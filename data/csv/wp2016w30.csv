[WP] life in a world were luck is a finite resource,BR0D0,"""Honey, we're out again..."" 

It was nearing the end of the month as my wife noticed an empty pot lying beside her bottle. We had finished our quota of it for the month, and couldn't afford more. 

We were, quite literally out of luck. 

You see, we were poor. Leading a miserable existence in a secluded hut on the outskirts of town. All the wealthy merchants used the luck the stole from the poor in the lands they hailed from, used it just enough to make a profit, but not enough to run out quick. It was easy for them, people dropping coins near their booth, the sun shining at just the right angle so their wares gleam and attract more people... All the usual stuff. 

Outcasts like me and my wife, we had nothing. We both went to separate markets and sold baskets and pots. We didn't waste our luck, just because we didn't have the resources or power to plunder. It was cruel. Someone about to pass our shop gets called over just before, so they miss our goods and notice the ""better stuff"". 

Out of all the money we earn in the month, we spend 90% on luck, and split half of the luck amongst us, and store the remaining in our safe. You see, we're poor. We have nothing. Nothing, except a dream, a plan to rule, and lots of stored luck on our side... ",YaiReiadyt
[WP] Voodoo dolls work and have become the technological basis of faster-than-light communication.,Dawwy,"They called it new opportunities, beyond this planet, this interstellar system...    Except it was all done so prematurely.  They finally realized the dreams of FTL, and set out for new star systems with the same zeal that many explorers did centuries ago.  Same deal as the last time - it's not like the newfound lands weren't there *before*, we were just going to populate it.

They found resources we didn't know existed.  They were seen as exotic, precious...  Infinite.  FTL ended up paying off within two years of its discovery as we populated the distant, infinite stars we once gazed upon and brought back the rarest materials we'd ever seen.  Of course, most of those stars were uninhabitable, and people only ever went there as workers, miners, prospectors...

As zealous as their expeditions were, and as nobly as we hailed those who traversed the stars as the greatest pioneers in the history of mankind, they were not going to return anytime soon once they leave.  Earth could not have constructed more than three shuttles capable of FTL travel, and they circulate between the many galaxies and nebulae on a regular basis.  But there was simply too many stars, and too few shuttles.  Workers that get dropped off on distant stars are not expected to see the shuttle to take them back home until at least five years after leave.

We couldn't send them messages, once the shuttle drops them off, they remain forever, the only method of reaching them was something...  Bizarre.

I sat in the observatory on Earth, overlooking the many glistening stars off into the distance.  I could spy the constellation, and the exact star system she was in.  But it was physically impossible to build a telescope to see that far, which I never understood - how can some of us have set foot on where others cannot even hope to see?

A doll lay beside what used to be a double bed, I quietly took it in my hands and stared into it.  The body was crudely sewn, but the face was magnificently detailed, and the hair...  I know it is not made from human hair, but while sifting through it with my hand, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference, it would definitely creep me out, had it been anyone else.

Quietly, I took the doll and silently wrapped my hands around it, rocking gently as if the doll in my arms was a baby being cradled.  Quietly, I felt the same sensation being returned to me - in the arms of someone else, the same loving warmth that can thaw the most frigid nights.  I lazily reached over and scratched one more day off the 5-year calendar and closed my eyes, falling onto the bed and allowed the warmth to carry me into my dreams, where my senses can project what my eyes cannot see.",OceanGale

"Your roommate is great, but you're starting to think they might just be Death/The Grim Reaper. [WP]",Fylak,"A high-pitched creak split the silence of the night, and I felt my eyelids flutter open. A series of muted thuds sounded from the kitchen, followed by the clatter of keys being tossed onto the counter. With a frown, I sat up, stretched, and glanced in disbelief at the glowing red numbers on my nightstand.

It was half-past three. In the morning. On a Tuesday. Jesus fucking Christ.

With a groan, I wormed my way out from my blankets and wriggled into a pair of sweatpants. Joe seemed nocturnal by nature, and I was almost positive that he was just returning home from a late night out. Still, on the off-chance that we were being robbed, I wanted to confront the mysterious noises wearing a little more than a knee-length t-shirt and panties.

""Joey,"" I groaned as I pried open my bedroom door, trying to smooth my sleep-ruffled short blonde hair. A quick glance around the corner revealed a spindly, hooded figure sprawled out in one of the kitchen chairs, drowsily nursing what seemed to be a very stiff drink. It was all amber, no bubbles. To the right of him was a heavy-looking black guitar case, firmly latched shut. Weird. I had never heard him play. ""What the fuck, dude,"" I said. He pulled down his hoodie to reveal his face, exposing a mop of black hair and a pair of dark eyes that flicked up towards me.

""Woke you up?""

""Yes. Where'd you go?""

He shrugged and pulled his black hoodie a little closer to his wiry frame before taking another tentative sip at his glass. Then, he made a face before replying, ""Work.""

""...At three in the morning?"" I said, wandering towards the table. He brandished the massive bottle towards the kitchen, and I quickly steered course towards the cabinet where I kept all of my glasses. My fingers lingered a little too long near the glass tumblers, but since I had a sneaking suspicion that we were out of Coke, I snatched up a shotglass instead. Joe drank whiskey like it was going out of style--always neat. Not once had an ice cube or seltzer water shared the same breath as one of his drinks, which always seemed to be served in inordinately large glasses. I had to hand it to him, though: no matter how much he drank, he never got rowdy or gooey or started to spout out bro-tales. It was a welcome relief, although his noticeable lack of drunken stories was off-putting at times. It made me remember that no matter how pleasant he was, I still knew damn near nothing about him.

""Duty calls,"" he said as I plunked myself at the table across from him. He tipped the bottle over my shotglass and filled it to the brim, and I gently pulled the glass out of his reach before the surface tension broke and sent whiskey trickling down my fingers. 

""What kind of duty?"" I asked hopefully. My spirits were immediately crushed as he dismissed my question with an impatient flick of his wrist. ""Listen,"" I began, but he cut me off by lifting that enormous glass of alcohol in a casual toast. I rolled my eyes and tossed the liquor back into my throat. He took a long swig of his drink, then swallowed heavily in a way that made my stomach lurch with disgust. The fact that Joey still had an esophagus was nothing short of scientific miracle. ""Listen,"" I tried again, my voice raspy from fumes, ""I really appreciate that you answered my ad. You've been really cool, you've never left me hanging on rent, and your references were stellar. But this whole mystery-job-thing...""

He brushed a fringe of black hair out from his eyes. ""Too cryptic?"" he asked quietly.

""Well. Yes."" Emboldened by the burn of liquor in my stomach, I stiffened my shoulders and continued. ""You're not selling drugs, are you?"" I demanded. ""I just...I don't want to wake up to a raid or something."" He snorted, and I glowered at him.

""No,"" he said. I watched helplessly as he poured another generous portion of whiskey in my shotglass. He lifted his glass again afterwards, and I clinked the shotglass moodily against it before downing it. 

""And it's nothing sleazy?"" I continued hoarsely, wishing fervently for a chaser. Still, the liquor was chasing the ebbing burn from my throat and replacing it with a warm sort of numbness. ""I mean...you don't kill people or anything, right?"" I laughed unsteadily. He paused and regarded me thoughtfully from over the brim of his glass.

""Do I look like I kill people?""

""...No."" The bottle tipped over my glass again, and I watched him fill it with a little dread. I didn't know how much more of this I could take. At least it seemed to be decent whiskey. ""But I guess I don't really know what people who kill people look like,"" I slurred. 

""They don't normally walk around with signs on their foreheads,"" he agreed calmly.

""Maybe it would be easier that way,"" I said. My voice was becoming a little dreamy, hazy with weariness and liquor. He raised his glass again, and I obediently toasted him before gulping the shot down. Once I had swallowed, I let out a choking cough.

""I think it would complicate things,"" he mused. ""Lots of people are monsters. Some of them don't even know it."" For the first time, I noticed that his gaunt features looked a little paler, a little more jagged than usual. I gave him an unsteady, scrutinizing frown.

""You look droopy,"" I told him somberly. He arched his dark eyebrows in query before lifting the bottle again, and I waved my hands in protest. ""No more, please. You're going to knock me on my ass.""

""Suit yourself."" I continued to glare at him, and he rolled his shoulders in a slow shrug. ""I've found myself growing disillusioned lately,"" he said, swirling the honey-hued liquid idly as he spoke. ""The world keeps growing, but it never seems to progress. Hate, violence, savagery..."" He trailed off and took a thoughtful sip of liquor. ""It's depressing,"" he concluded. I blinked. While we had been sharing an apartment for several months, he had never bared his soul like this before. It had been like rooming with a ghost for the most part, our interactions limited to a quick exchange over coffee in the mornings or a greeting at the door before one of us would disappear into their bedroom--usually him.

""That's why I stopped watching the news,"" I said, and he glanced up at me in amusement. ""It's too...apocalyptic. Maybe if you stopped, too, you wouldn't drink so much,"" I added with the candor that only comes from consuming far too much alcohol.

""I'll keep that in mind,"" he said grimly. A fiercely awkward silence ensued, and I cleared my throat before rising to my feet.

""I guess I should try to go back to bed,"" I announced. ""Thanks for the drinks, but...I don't know, could you be a little more quiet?""

""I'll certainly try.""

""Thanks, Joey."" I teetered back down the hallway, lightheaded and floaty, but paused in front of my door. ""Hey."" He looked up. ""...You'd tell me if you were doing something shady, wouldn't you? Because we're buddies? And you don't want to get me arrested?""

Those spider-like fingers tapped idly on the surface of the table. ""Yes,"" he finally said.

""Kay."" Drunk enough to consider that a satisfactory answer, I yawned and wrenched my door open. ""'Night,"" I said.

There was no response from the kitchen. With a shrug, I shut the door and toppled back down onto my mattress. ",pinkfuzzies

"[WP] After fulfilling your lifelong dream of opening your own bar, you notice that the clientele are very... quest-oriented.",INGWR,"*“Arackus magnus!”* the scream was heralded by shattering glass and wild cheering.

I sighed. It had only taken one week for these assholes to completely destroy my bar. One week. The liquor control board will shut this place down by the end of the month if I don’t get a handle on things.

*“Arackus magnus samuni!”* Old Gregory was at it again. I peered through the rank fog of tobacco smoke and could just make him out—ridiculous purple robes as beer-soaked as his unkempt beard. He wildly gestured with his hands as he attempted to conjure some spell only visible to the highly inebriated. One such woman cheered loudly before she fell out of her chair. I hadn’t noticed the short sword on her hip until it clattered against the floor. I wasn’t surprised.

“Any rumors?” 

I jumped despite myself. I hadn’t heard the young man slide up to the bar. He wore black leather from head to toe, his face hidden in the shadows of a drawn hood. A comically huge dagger was lazily stuffed into his belt, the blade looking as though it’d bite through his thigh if he tried to sit down.

“What?” I asked. The smoldering embers of a headache began to grow in my head.

“Any rumors?” he asked again, the light glinting off of eyes that hid deep within shadow.

“Why does everyone ask me that?” I was starting to get annoyed. 

“Because you’re the barkeep, and I’m an adventurer that needs coin!” He looked confused, as though this was an obvious answer. “So, any rumors?”

“No.” I grunted. “And you’re not supposed to bring weapons in here.” I pointed at my useless sign by the door. The rogue threw his head back and laughed as though I’d just told him the funniest joke he’d ever heard. He slapped a gloved hand on the bar, splashing some wine against my chest.

“Ale!” he shouted merrily, wiping a tear from his eye.

“It’s beer.” I said. “It’s called beer.”

His shoulders heaved with fresh laughter as I turned to fill a mug of the cheapest piss we have on tap. 

“Any rumors?” An obviously fake British accent brought me up short. I turned to the newcomer. This kid was nineteen years old at best. A pathetic excuse for a bow hung over a frail, pimpled shoulder that jutted from his roughly cut green tunic. I wasn’t sure what good a bow was without any arrows, but I didn’t much care.

“Get out or I’m calling the cops.” I said. 

“Cops?” He cocked his head to the side, looking confused. His ears were pointed—probably clay. I should have researched this bizarre town before I opened shop. What a freak show. 

I rolled my eyes. “The royal constabulary. I will summon the royal constabulary if you do not get the fuck out right now.” 

“Ah ha! Yet another bigoted establishment! Mine are a proud people, sir!” He pounded a fist against his chest. “I shall take my business elsewhere!” he shouted over his shoulder as he stormed out into the night.

“Barkeep!” a shout from the back of the room, I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. These idiots *all* smoked cheap pipe tobacco. It was terrible. “Any ru—“

“No! No fucking rumors!” I screamed back at the fog. “For the love of God stop asking!”

I needed a little quiet and some fresh air. I whistled at Clayton, a muscled brute that calls himself a “barbarian,” whatever the hell that means. I’d hired him as security after that guy got stabbed last week. “A duel of honor” they had called it. He’d been booked on a “felony of honor” that night. Good riddance. 

“Take over for a minute.” 

He nodded, the overhead light reflecting off his bald head.

I stalked out into the night, not looking back. Had I looked back, I might have seen the flame burst from Old Gregory’s fingertips as he uttered a string of ancient, powerful words. Cheering erupted throughout the tavern as I rubbed my sinuses wearily.

"[WP] After fulfilling your lifelong dream of opening your own bar, you notice that the clientele are very... quest-oriented.",INGWR,"""Afternoon, Sigmund!""

I glanced up from the mug I'd been washing for the last three days at the peasant man across the room. He's my brother-in-law, and he'd been sitting at that same table since I opened my establishment three days ago. When I started washing the mug. He hadn't actually ordered anything since his first ale, but he occasionally shouted greetings or compliments. Bale was an odd fellow.

""Afternoon, Bale!"" I called cheerfully.

The Rowdy Cockatrice had been my dream since I was a boy, and when the old innkeep moved on after the fire that burned down his tavern, I jumped at the opportunity to improve my situation. The family farm provided an ample supply of hops and barley, and my uncle, a merchant in the capital, offered me a premium on imported liqueurs. The construction of the building had been easy enough- though for some reason I couldn't get rid of the obnoxious glowing sign outside that just said ""BETA"" in all capital letters.

That, and not a single traveler had ever come through our town. Only the occasional lonely merchant.

There were four other peasants in the tavern, none of whom were interested in ordering a second drink. Two were engrossed in a confusing card game in the corner.

Another day passed and I was almost ready to give up when the neon glow from the BETA sign outside suddenly disappeared. I looked up but found myself unable to move my feet. And then, they appeared.

Dozens of burly men and elegant women barged through the front door at once, sometimes even phasing into one another when space ran out. All of them wore ornate armors from distant lands that must have been worth more than the entire village. And when they spoke, their words shimmered above their heads as if the gods wanted even the deaf to be able to hear them.

""What's he got?"" asked one of the heroes to no one in particular. Half a dozen of the warriors suddenly mobbed me, inquiring about my inventory. I proudly show off my wares, but none of them seem interested in my homebrewed ale or custom mead. One or two pay me handsomely for an entire bottle of liquor only to drink it on the spot or pour the entire container into some alchemical mix.

""You play cards?"" one asks. I smile and nod, and pull out my deck. The room watches intently as the foreigner beats me at my own game.

""Was it fun?"" the heroes shout in unison.

""Still not as good as Gwent,"" the victor grumbles. Crestfallen, the heroes grumble along with him for a bit but continue in their revelry, splitting into groups based on armor color and clan affiliation. There's a dance circle on one of the tables- every person is doing the same dance, but with slightly different timing. Finally the attention turns back to me.

""Hey innkeep, what's the word on the street?"" asks the man who'd beaten me in cards earlier.

""You might talk to Old Woman Ness up by the windmill,"" I say politely. ""Word is, some mysterious hooded figures have taken up residence in her family's ancestral estate and she's willing to reward whoever gets rid of them."" The hero grins and sprints out of the bar. Before long, everyone in the place is clamoring to ask the same question. I send them all up to the mill.

Business booms for weeks, but eventually the adventurers' numbers dwindle. Sometimes a nostalgic hero walks in to grab a bottle of liquor for one of their peculiar recipes, sometimes they just want to play cards. Now and then I see a new face, or encounter a familiar personality of a totally different profession (like that necromancer who so reminded me of a ranger I'd met).

The years pass and the Rowdy Cockatrice is forgotten. It's just me, Bale, and the four other men now. None of us have moved. The mug still isn't clean. Through the window I notice the days getting shorter and the world getting smaller. Before long, the lights of the capital in the distance are gone and my shipments of spirits from my uncle stop arriving. The glowing sign reappears, this time heralding something called a ""server shutdown"".

And then it all ends. I'm happy, I think. I lived the dream. But I wish I'd gotten to see my wife again.",Chad_Maximum
"[WP] After fulfilling your lifelong dream of opening your own bar, you notice that the clientele are very... quest-oriented.",INGWR,"As he put the final nail into the sign, Adam took a step back and admired the view. *The Crossroads,* it read, and even though it had cost more than he had originally planned, it was worth it. Opening nights only come around every so often, and every bar needs a sign. After all, he thought, how else would people know he was open for business? 

It was an innocent thought, but it did not stay that way.

*Wait,* he thought. *How are people* actually *going to know we’re open for business? Sure I paid the Town Crier off, but the conversion rate on those guys are terrible. And yes, I told some friends about it, but how social are they really? Not social at all now that I think about it. Most of them are Elves, and all they do is sit around and act busy, even though none of them work. All that effort that Elanor and I put into this place and it might be for nothing, and then…*

And that is how, despite his best intentions, Adam fell straight down the rabbit hole of nerves and terror that had led to many a sleepless night in the preceding weeks. Indeed, before he had even stepped back inside Adam had convinced himself that absolutely no one was going to show up to his big opening night, and he was going to be faced with a big empty bar that produced no laughter. And every bar needs laughter. So, a look of panic etched on his face, Adam walked into the bar straight past Trin (who was attempting to carry three cases of beer up from the basement by balancing one on his head, a needlessly showy act that, had he not been wracked with nerves, Adam would have assuredly reprimanded him for) and into his office where he slammed the door and slumped down into his chair. 

Was this it? Was he really going to fail again? Father had warned him after the Dwarven themed Smoothie Bar (Forge and Fruit - You Dig, We Blend) and again after the Troll Hair Dietary Supplements (Guaranteed Limb Rejuvenation or Your Money Back!) that this was the last straw. He had only gotten enough from Father to fund The Crossroads Inn because he had sworn that running a bar was what he had always truly wanted. It wasn’t his fault that Father had never taught him how to make money. Growing up he had only ever had any practice at spending it.

A soft knock on the door broke Adam out of his reverie. 

“Yes?” he asked, not getting up from his chair.

“It’s Elanor,” came the answer through the door. “Can I come in?”

Adam got up and opened the door.

“You’re nervous,” Elanor said.

“No,” replied Adam. “I’m terrified. I’m shit-for-brains-panicked. I’ve done it all wrong, and nobody is going to show up. Not one single person, and then I’ll be behind on the rent, and inventory is going to go bad, and - “

“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” said Elanor. “People are going to come, Adam. You’re a sweet guy, and charming, and people just like you. Plus we worked really hard on the menu, and I think the stew is going to be a hit. No one else is doing anything like it.”

“That’s nice of you to say,” Adam said. “I suppose you’re right. I’m - I’m going to go check on the kegs out back. Thanks again.” And with that he stood up abruptly and left. Elanor sighed, and went back to work.


By dinner time Elanor was as nervous as Adam. Sure it was still early and everyone was just getting off of work, but the mines had closed at quarter-to-sunset and not a single Gnome or Dwarf had come (which was especially troublesome because everyone knew that one Dwarf at Happy Hour could drink the equivalent of five Men, or 7-and-a-half Elves). Adam was trying so hard, but Elanor knew that failure tonight would crush him. She hated to see him look sad, especially since his perfect cheekbones drooped slightly when he frowned. They were still so perfect, though, and his eyes radiated such a -

“I can help, you know.”

The voice, mischievous and light, broke through Elanor’s totally professional daydream and she gave a start. Trin, sitting on a barstool and sipping a bright pink drink, smiled at her.

“I can help,” he repeated. “I know Adam’s worried about customers. So are you for that matter. I can get customers.”

Elanor stared at him. Since he had been hired away from that strange Adventuring Party, Trin’s greatest feat had been breaking three separate bottles of (expensive) Elvish Wine in the same day. The idea of him bringing in business was, well, far-fetched.

“Oh very funny, Trin,” she snapped. “You’re going to get us customers, are you? What do you know about marketing? Have you ever even tried to generate word of mouth buzz this late in the day? It’s next to impossible.”

Trin rolled his eyes. “Don’t worry about how. I’ve written down everything I’ll need on this piece of paper. Bring me these, and I’ll bring you customers. In return, I get to drink as much as I want tonight, and I don’t have to do any dishes. Also - and this is important - you have to do this no questions asked.” 

He waved the paper at her, and she hesitated only a second before hurrying over and snatching it out of his hand. As she read it, her expression went from confused to befuddled. Trin’s list read as follows:

	* Two dozen torn treasure maps
	* A couple swords, they don’t even have to be that sharp
	* Three Flimmers
	* A tent
	* Twelve moral dilemmas
	* Many small yet intelligent animals that are willing to follow strangers into certain death
	* Bread, for dipping

Elanor moved as if to say something like ‘Are you insane?’ or ‘What the hell is a Flimmer?’ but Trin shook his head. “Ah ah, no questions asked, remember? Do we have a deal or not?”

Elanor was silent, and then looked in the general direction of Adam’s office.

“We have a deal,” she said.	


The story of how Elanor acquired the items is worthy of its own tale, but suffice it to say that she returned to the Crossroads with everything that Trin had requested, bearing only the scratches of a perturbed Flimmer for her troubles.

That had been maybe two hours ago, and during that time things had gone from bad to worse. Not a single customer had entered the *Crossroads,* and Adam had begun to drink. 

“Why do I even try anymore? Everything I touch turns to shit,” he hiccuped. “Dwarf smoothies, shit. Troll Hair, shit. Bar, shit. Maybe next time I’ll just stop trying. It’s hard to be shit when you don’t try Elanor, write that down.”

“Adam don’t give up,” she replied. “It’s not too late, people could still come. You need faith, every one needs faith.”

“Well I don’t,” he said. “I have no faith, and I’ve got no laughter and pretty soon I’m not even going to have a bar, because no one is EVER going to walk through that - “

And then, just as he was about to give up completely, the door burst open and the sound of laughter filled the room. They came in groups of four and five, Dwarves, Elves, Men, even a few Orcs here and there. They wore leather, cloaks, and more leather, and even though they all carried themselves with a sense of purpose it didn’t prevent them from crowding the bar for food and drinks.

Elanor leapt into action, running mugs of beer out to the tables and taking food orders with an easy flourish that seemed to put everyone at ease. Trin appeared out of the crowd and, despite his stated intention of drinking all evening, immediately set to work helping Elanor with the crowd. Even Adam managed to shake off his stupor and began welcoming guests as they arrived, cracking jokes and directing them to the appropriate tables. 

It was, without a doubt, a successful opening night for the Crossroads.

When the last guest finally stumbled out the door, Trin sat, exhausted but happy, on the same bar stool that he had occupied earlier. He sipped an orange drink and was looking particularly please with himself until Elanor appeared behind him.

“Let’s see,” she said. “We’re all out of stew, chicken and bread, but the Chocolate Gelato went untouched. I had three customers ask me for tents, another ask about the morality of sacrificing one for the good of many, and nearly everyone was wearing leather armor and sitting in groups.” She spun Trin’s stool around and looked him straight in the eyes.

“Those were Adventures, weren’t they Trin.”

“Whaat?” he said, his voice rising. “No, no, no those were just totally normal customers. Adventurers are crazy, as likely to burn down a bar as part of their insane ‘quest’ as they are to drink in it. It’d be a huge risk to fill a room with them.” He grinned. “You’d almost have to be so desperate that you’d try anything.”

Elanor sighed, and turned away. “Yeah, well, this is the last time those ‘totally normal customers’ come in en mass, ok?” She stopped. “And Trin? Please, don’t tell Adam. He’d be crushed that you brought them, Adventurers or no.”

“You got it, boss,” said Trin.

With that Elanor headed out through the back door, passing Adam as he reentered. She smiled at him, and he smiled back.

“Quite a night, Trin,” said Adam as he approached the bar.

“It certainly was,” Trin replied.

“You could almost say it was an *Adventure,*” Adam said.

Trin sighed. “It was that obvious, huh?”

“I figured it out after the third conversation about a torn treasure map,” Adam said. “Listen, that’s a great thing you did Trin, and I want you to know that I appreciate it. It was dangerous, but your heart was in the right place and that’s what’s important.”

“Thanks, boss,” said Trin. “I won’t do it again, I just wanted to help out.”

“You did,” said Adam. “Just one more thing though - don’t mention this to Elanor. She worked so hard helping me get this place running, it’d just crush her.”

Trin hid a smile beneath his drink.

“No problem, boss,” he said.

Not long afterwards, Trin finished his drink, Elanor finished inventory, and Adam locked up the last of the nights profits. Together, they left their bar and walked out into the street. As they left, Elanor turned around to look at the bar one last time.

“It’s a nice sign, Adam.”

“It is, isn’t it,” he replied. “Every bar has to have a sign.”

Tonight is the night. After many years of longing and hard work, the time has come to once again open up my very own inn, to replace the one my father had given me as my inheritance, that he inherited from his father, generation after generation. The one I failed to protect, and was burned by bandits. 

I anxiously checked and double checked to make sure that everything was ready for the third time in as many hours. The success of the inn in this city depended on this night.

I went out again and looked at the sign. The Phoenix. It was beautiful.

Dusk had fallen, and people began trickling in, slowly at first, but then in greater numbers, so much so that the staff and I had trouble keeping up.
 
Someone tapped me on the shoulder. He was a young man, with a scar running from his right eye to the tip of his mouth.

""Nice place you got here,"" he said with a smile. ""Say, got anything interesting to do 'round here?""

""Thank you, lad! Warms my heart to hear you say it!"" I beamed. A compliment meant that I was doing at least *something* right. ""Yes, there's plenty to do. There's a games room to the left, where you'll find a few of the more popular distractions. I'd also be more than happy to lend a few decks of cards, and-""

""Never mind then, thanks."" And he disappeared as quickly as he came.

I was still trying to figure out what the problem was when someone tried to get my attention. 

""Sir,"", he shouted over the noise, ""Sir! A moment, if you may."" He wore a suit of armor and had a sword at his belt. ""Yes, of course, how may I be of assistance?""
""I was wondering, do you have some task that you need doing, one that everyone else is unwilling to take? Too dangerous, perhaps, or something of the sort? A quest, if you will?""

""Quite the irregular question, dear friend. I'm afraid I can't help you in that case, for I know of no tasks like that.""

""Farewell.""

He had scarcely left when another one came, this one the most rugged of the lot. ""Oy, mate! Got a question for ya!""

""Go on right ahead, mate. What can I help you with?""

""Know of any damsels in distress?"" He snickered. ""I love that kind of quest, the damsels are *always* grateful!""

""So kind of you, good sir! Matter of fact, a few days ago I met a pleasant elderly lady who needs help with tasks around the house, since her husband died and she-""

""Fuck off with that, mate! I said damsels, no grandmas!""

And so it went for the rest of the night. It seemed as if every customer tried to ask me if I had something for them to do, and they never liked my answers. They questioned the waitresses and the stableboy as well. And only around one in ten actually ordered food and drink.

"[WP] After fulfilling your lifelong dream of opening your own bar, you notice that the clientele are very... quest-oriented.",INGWR,"The StoneRose Inn; My newest venture, built along the path of Mt. Thorne, was as much a bar as a small, but quite fortified fort. With columns carved from the mountain itself and shields built for giants as our doors with the crest of the StoneRose upon them I could not be prouder.

I had lived a long life of travel and shared my fair collection of scars from battle, floating in youth as a merchant peddler or mercenary for hire, traveling to the far and distant desserts where sun bleached bones where almost as plentiful as sand. I have sailed many oceans, I have tread many swamps and after many years I had felt tired and in wanting to settle. The StoneRose, inspired from many nights travelling through inhospitable earth, has been built between our lands second capital city and the bordering lands of Steam, an always misty land of muggy, sticky humidity and porous volcanic vents.

She was my home and I filled her with all sorts of Curiosities from my travels or Armour I had don as a younger man. And she was a lonely Inn never filled with rowdy laughter but rather the constant flow of people on the go. Exactly what I had wanted from her. Of course though we got quite a few Rockmen, those who lived in the mountain, and whenever they grouped together large enough the bar would come alive with spirits like fire;However as of late I have been getting a different crowd.

Many men and women that I could see a younger version of myself in, don in colorful cloaks, metal woven robes, armament wild as you could imagine. All in search of tasks similar in nature, even exactly in nature as quests. ""Whats the word passing by"", ""what are the troubles unseen"", ""Have you heard the howls of nightcallers?"", and ""These markings what could they mean?"". Some of these adventurers I don't give a second look, they are green and weak, fodder for the wilds and others I think more selectively towards, be it there wit or their swords.

Eric paused while wiping his glass. It was a surprisingly common question. He wondered for a moment if it was code for something, like a secret menu drink.

More than anything else, Eric wanted to be a good bartender. He hadn't had much luck at anything else, but he knew alcohol. So he searched his mind for anything that might catch the man's interest.

“Well, there a couple of folk over there that were muttering about rounding up bandits. Might be undercover cops doing a sting?”

The man glanced over to the pair of odd-looking women. Eric thought they must be bikers with all the leather they wore, but he couldn't quite figure out the bows. Hunting enthusiasts?

“Hrm. I don't much like the look of 'em, but thank ye.” His customer hopped off the stool. Eric saw that the man was only four feet tall, but had biceps the size of his head.

“Sir, did you want your drink?” Eric asked.

“Ah, that's a good lad!” The little man tossed back an appletini and coughed. “By Odin's spear, that's AMAZING!”

He slammed down a coin that looked like a golden dollar, but much bigger, then strutted off to the two biker chicks.

In quick succession, he redirected four other customers that had asked the same question, all equally odd. There was a man wearing a bathrobe with stars on it, a brooding girl with pointed teeth, an overly-cheerful midgit that tried to snatch his best liquor, and a woodsman with an enormous service dog. The muscle-bound dwarf beckoned him over.

“That was some mighty fine drink you gave us. I think we'll be seeing much o' each other.”

Eric's smile froze on his face as he noticed the wicked glint off a large battleaxe resting by his table. Before he could say anything, the little man clasped Eric's arm with his crushing grip and his strange posse stood to leave.

“Alright, let's get it done then! We'll be back for a round of your appletinis fair barman! But first, Glenda must have her drink.” he ran his hand over the sharp steel of the battleaxe and walked out the door.",Thenatic
"[WP] This time, we're the aliens.",Neite,"""Wait!"" Commander Casillas shouts when I'm about to open the hatch. 
I freeze, both hands gripping the hatch, moments from turning it counter-clockwise and entering this brand new world and sputter, ""What, why? What's wrong?""
His eyes search the room before finally meeting mine. He takes a haphazard step forward before pausing briefly, then resuming in slow motion while lifting his head. He swats my hands off the circular hatch and shoves me backward. 
""I'm first."" 
""Commander I—"" 
""Shut up and record.""
Martinez is already on my heels while I trail Commander Casillas and I can hear Kelling whimpering behind her. 

*We knew they had been watching since we started descending on this planet. Communication with Houston and the ISS had long been lost, but every radio frequency since the descent was jammed by incessant static.
Every astronaut knows that the only thing worse than silence, is static.*

Casillas takes the first steps out of the shuttle. With a steady gait, he inches forward with hands raised as an army of at least a thousand creatures greet him—both on land and in air. The alien creatures take only a half of a second to see his arms raised before raising their own sharp claws in retaliation. 
Casillas makes the slightest of flinches before inching forward while exclaiming, ""Aliens, we come in peace."" 
It only takes a second of raising his eyebrows in mock assurance before turning back to Martinez, Kelling, and me before we see the first claw penetrating Casillas chest, head, and neck—in that order. Casillas slumps to the ground and the creatures are revealed behind him, claws raised and eyes widened. 
Kelling starts to run back into the shuttle but is impaled by something before he can even take two strides. 
Martinez and I are already on the floor, face to dirt, when I feel the sharpest pain enter my neck. 

*I lay supine while they impaled my veins with gradually smaller syringes. The creatures had cauterized my veins so many times that I was sure I would start melting at any point. 

I wet myself on the first day and was punished. The second time I wet myself, I was given an injection. 

The visions were the worst. 

Creatures of all sizes visited my semi-lifeless body in my own personal vestibule. Voices I felt as if I were learning seemed the most friendliest. The stranger's voices seemed the darkest.

After eight years of listening, I learned their language.*

The most recent visitor enters the room. It stares at my naked body for about a minute before turning to another creature and spits, ""I don't know how you can study something so... ugly."" 
""They're sort of beautiful, if you think about it."" It stares at my for a second before continuing. ""We have so much to learn."" 
""Yeah,"" scoffs the new visitor. ""I doubt it. We've been looking for more intelligent life for so long, but this only proves how much of a waste it has been. This one's thoughts show a native civilization of emotion. It's no wonder they continued to kill each other.""
""Do you think we can show this to the public soon?"" My favorite voice asked with a hint of hopefulness in his tone.

[WP] A new breakthrough in technology allows humans to move through water as easily as air by walking along the bottom. (Split prompt within),Syncs,"'They say that under the water, there lies a whole other world. Perhaps a new world is exactly what I need.' I thought as I stared at the Aquair device in my hands. 'Ive lost everything. My home, my family, most of my friends. The ones that are still around have moved on, or don't seem to care anymore.' I looked out the window of the SUV, where four security officials stood by the edge of the crashing ocean. They were waiting for me to step out of the vehicle, but had decided to give me a few more moments to gather my thoughts before I left this air-dwelling part of the planet. I looked back at the strange, almost alien looking, mouth piece and feet sized metal plates laying in front of me. Despite the fact that I had no connections to the government, no degree in science, or anything really that would qualify me for this, I had been selected as one of the first testers of the Aquair underwater breathing device.'I suppose they figured a man with nothing to lose only has something to gain. That's the only way I could see them picking someone like me.' The car door opened suddenly, interrupting my thoughts as the fresh ocean breeze blew past my face. “Sir, are you ready?”, asked the tall man in the pitch black sunglasses. “Yes,”, I spurted out suddenly, “yes I am ready.” “If you would just come with me, please.” Stepping out of the car, I felt the smooth yellow sand comforting me with each step I made closer and closer to the ocean. Nearby birds chirped and soared on the cool beach winds, scouting for food as the strong sun beat down on their backs. As I followed the man with the Aquair in hand, the chirps became distant as the roar of the ocean grew louder with each step. The sand became wet and mushy as we reached the waters edge. Here, the three other men were waiting. A smaller but just as intimidating man walked up to me, raising his voice so it could be heard over the crashing ocean. “Go ahead on put the plates on your feet!” I reached down and attached the plates to the bottom of my wet suit. With a sharp clang followed by a low hum, each plate attached to the bottom of the wet suit, the sides beginning to glow a faint orange. “And the mouth piece!” Placing the triangular device around my mouth and nose, it suddenly began to wrap around my face with a mechanical whirr. Two pieces of glass appeared in front of my eye sockets, like some sort of futuristic gas mask. “Sir, you are to continue forward into the ocean in front of you! A few miles in, use the radio function in the mask to relay back to us whats going on! Good luck!” I looked out into the vast ocean in front of me,  what was to be my new home. Stepping forward, I could feel the gentle tide of the cool ocean washing over my feet. 'No turning back now.' Moving forward a few more feet, the crashing water now surrounded my waist. I looked back at the beach and the green trees behind it for what may be the last time. I pressed onward through the rushing waves until the water reached my chin. 'I sure hope this works'. I walked under the waters surface, closed my eyes, and prepared to take my first breath.
 
The moment of truth.

'It's.....it's air. I....it's air! Ha!' Opening my eyes, I took my first look at the new world around me. The waters here looked calm, despite the rough waves crashing above me. The seafloor was not as smooth as I had imagined, with rocks and bumps appearing as it sloped downward. 'Incredible', I thought, as I took a few more deep breaths. The waves could still be heard from here, but they were a faint rumble compared to they roars they were on the surface. 'Id better swim forward and see whats ahea-OOF' I couldn't swim. Instead I just fell flat on my stomach, face planted on the sea-floor. 'Aughh, what happened?' I got up on my feet. 'Can I jump?' I did my best to leap from the oceans surface, and sure enough I came right back down. 'Its as if i'm not even underwater anymore.' I looked ahead at the sloping ocean floor in front of me. 'Could I run down this?' I began to run as fast as I could. As if I was running on the surface, there was no water to slow me down. I ran further and further, past jutting rocks  and drifting seaweed until I reached a coral reef. Schools of fish scattered away quickly, frightened by  my sudden movements in the deep water. What was once an empty body of water was now a world of color and life, with fish moving above me like birds in the air. 'I think i'm going to like it down here.'",bomberinblue
[WP] Write the story of a girl who only had one day in her entire life to get dressed up and look nice.,Z_2_A,"Today, I put on my dress... I'm sorry, *the* dress. The dress I rented. I'm sorry, the one Mister rented. The pink one, the one that was soft and sweet. It fell like caramel on my skin. It was so soft. I felt so sweet.

And today I did my hair. I really *did* it, you know? I washed it, not with lye. I washed it with shampoo and I conditioned it and I let it dry in the sun outside of the compound. I sat under the clothes line. The heat quivered the horizon as the quilts quivered on the line. My mother's hair use to smell like this. Mister had said it was quite sinful. My mother's hair was as dark as mine, mine which I curled up and pinned back.

Today, I washed the dirt out from under my nails. I trimmed them clean. This is the part that makes my tummy whirl- I polished them. I polished them and my toes, too, And I slipped those pink things into little shoes of a deeper color.

I didn't own much. Mister says we really don't own much at all. Anything we do own, we owe to God. You see, Mister is very close with the Man himself. He personally speaks with him, I hear it at night. He will wail, God will answer. And our garden grows, and our land prospers. We will be safe from the outside, in here. In this compound. Where we own nothing.

But goddamit, for today it can be *my* dress. And I will smell of flowers and spices. Today, I will be on TV. I will be on TV just like all of the ladies I have seen behind the screen. I look on the back of a spoon, I look beautiful. Like a pink flower. And from the corner of the kitchen, ""Careful, sister. 'I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel.'"" The gospel of the material, I know. I put the spoon down. Mister sees all.

I will tell them everything is alright. Mister gave me the entire day, just to tell them that everything is alright. I will tell them all about the life that is so wonderful, all about the chickens we keep and the vegetables we grow. How alternative living is wonderful, how glad I am that my parents had brought me here when I was too young to remember. How I could never imagine another life.

And then they came. For their documentary. In big, white vans. With colorful suits, with cameras of all sizes and chords like tangles of snakes.

""Juliana, what is it like here? How long have you been here?"" I tell them what I've told you.

""Juliana, your parents left. They left and you stayed. And everyone on the compound left, and you stayed."" I told them how much I believed Mister's vision for the world. How much I yearned to fulfill Mister's vision, all twenty of these years.

They said, ""Many people consider Father John [Mister] to be a cult leader. How do you feel about this?""

""The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want."" I am so sweet in my pink. The crews all thank me, they all leave. I am bloated on my pride, on my want. Mister sees this. He sees all.

""It went so badly,"" Mister said. My dress was in tatters. I'm sorry, *the* dress. ""They think I'm a cluck,"" Mister said. My curls had fallen from my hair. *The* curls. ""They think a lot. They want more, more, and more. To think- I believed this would restore some credibility to the compound. To Jesus. To faith and healing and nature and love."" The whip hit me with the staccato of each word.

""Do you want to leave, Juliana? Do you want to leave?"" Spit on the corners of his mouth. Whip in hand. Door blocked. How must have mommy and father felt. Just like this.


""The lord is my shepherd,"" I told mister. Me, on the floor. Crying. ""I shall not want.""

[WP] Two brothers from opposing factions meet on a battlefield.,lora_,"The song of steel rings through the air, nearly drowned out by their convulted screams alone.

""I shall grant you the mercy of a swift death, brother!"" John hissed through their intersecting blades.

All around them the sounds of battle waged. The sounds of grisly death and the eerie song of steel merged together, forming a deadly yet somehow mersmerizing harmony. Jack stared cooly at his brother - his kin- through the crossing of their blades but could not see much of his face beneath the helmet. However, Jack knew enough to know that it was indeed John.

A mutual thirst for blood was held between their crossed blades, with each brother aiming to kill the other. Jack knew he could not afford to lose this fight.

""I, however, cannot promise the same for you."" Jack smiled mockingly.

John snarled, pushing Jack back with a heave and an almighty roar. For a breathless moment they stood staring at each other, whispers of the deadly battle around them cutting through the heavy drum of their own heartbeats. Heartbeats that had been brought into the world together.

Jack tightened his grip on his blade, and charged.

The next few moments were packed with swift movements: Dodges and blows, blocks and parries. In those moments, the twin brothers were connected through the twisted harmony of battle, resonating through them in a primitive, screaming rythym. Jack ducked beneath John's oncoming blade and stepped behind him in one fluid movement.

The harmony stopped cold in their ears as John froze. Jack grinned, triumphant, as he held his glistening sword to his brother's throat.

""Brother."" John murmured weakly, completely at his mercy.

""Brother."" Jack agreed in return.

Grabbing John roughly by the hair, he pulled his head back and let his blade slide easily over the soft skin of his throat. John's limp body collapsed in front of him like a ragdoll - his life gushing out of him.

Jack threw his head back, triumphant, laughing hysterically, gleeful-

And a blade appeared through his chest, cutting his victory laugh short.



Jack stared in disbelief at his computer screen.

""NO!"" Jack choked, mashing at his keys as if to reverse what had just happened before his eyes.

Across the room, John was unable to control his mirth. Slapping the desktop repeatedly, the twin brother was unable to stifle his giggles.

Jack sniffed. ""I don't see what your laughing about."" He poked out his tounge. ""'Cus you have to wash the dishes.""

John went pink - or rather pinker - as he muttered, flustered: ""W-what, I never said -""

""There's no avoiding it!"" Jack was already at the door to the study. ""We agreed - whoever loses has to dry!""

Laughing gleefully once more, Jack opened the door and bolted down the hallway to his room. John stared wistfully after him.

""John?"" His mother's voice came swimming in from the living room. ""Whoever's doing the dishes better get it done soon!""

John groaned. Why was it always him? 

""Coming mum!""",spontaneousGhoul
"[WP] The little demon and the little angel on your shoulders, start to get bored by your life choice. They decide to bury the hatchet and ally to make your life more fun, for them.",Amrity,"""No no no, the OTHER woman!""

I turned my head to look down the other end of the bar - a very buxom, older woman sat two stools down from me.

""Oooo, good one,"" said the angel on my right. 

""I'm not a lesbian! I told you that!"" I protested, and the pair laughed. 

""Tell that to the man upstairs,"" came the voice from my right again. 

It'd only been a couple days since my shoulder angel and my shoulder devil teamed up against me - and since then, the suggestions had been coming nonstop. For most of my existence, I'd sided with the angel, but now that he'd gone AWOL and started encouraging the devil's prompts, well, things had gotten interesting. 

Though I couldn't complain about watching TV on my new 75"", or about my puppy. Couldn't get a puppy before - Ben was allergic. 

""Just ask her in she wants a drink,"" my devil said. 

The angel chimed in too. ""Really, you'd just be doing her a favor. You're just being nice.""

I flushed. Why was I so susceptible to these two? They always seemed to make the most sense, I guess, and in my life, that was quite a commodity. But in a few days, I'd made a complete 180 change from the modest, timid Amy to this halter-topped, heavy-lidded creature. 

And I liked it. 

""But what if she wants to, ya know,"" I started but trailed off. This wasn't who I was. I didn't go out to strange bars with strange people, or drink expensive cocktails. Or hit on women! I was a married -

Right. 

Was. 

""She looks lonely,"" the angel sighed, and I glanced down again. The woman used a straw to stir the small amount of amber whiskey around copious ice cubes. They clinked the glass as she moved the piece of plastic carefully, back and forth, in tight little circles.

I gulped and grabbed my own drink.

The devil on my left cooed. ""We'd just be going over there to chat. What's wrong with a new friend?""

""Absolutely nothing,"" the angel replied. 

I watched cautiously through the mirror on the backsplash of the bar as the woman brought her drink up to her mouth again. The red lipstick stained the rim, and I was fixated on the shade. When I looked up to her face again, I saw she was staring at me too. She gave me an easy grin, and my face began to burn. I looked down, then up again, and she was still looking, still smiling an easy, open grin. 

""Okay, okay,"" I relented. Internally of course. ""Just a drink.""",centercenter

Most of the time it's a pretty random process. A couple of the themes that I've worked on have given me the stories, but when that isn't the case I end up looking through stories that I remember. I read here a lot more than I write (and I write a lot) so I have a big list to pull from.

Do I edit stories:

Not intentionally. Sometimes I replace words by accident and notice it in the finished product, or correct typos. 

The only exception was my story from this week where I realized on the second listen that I'd opened one of my newer files for it instead of reading it off WP. I usually copy/paste to word so I opened the wrong window. Nothing huge.

The door slid on its hinges, a bit of a squeak bursting into life as it did so, before I walked on through into a cold, sterile room. A small wheely chair sat in the middle of the room and a dozen or so monitors strewn themselves across the wall furthest away from me, their screens turned off. I yawned as I sat down in my chair and flicked a switch on the side of the armrest, causing all the monitors to illuminate themselves into existence. I coughed, which caused a small amount of vomit to shoot itself into the back of my mouth, which then caused me to swallow it back down with a grimace. The taste of Kebab, vodka, orange juice and bad decisions lingered in my mouth before I took a swig of my coffee. I sat with my arms dangling off the armrests, my entire body slumped down and my legs out straight, the pain of my hangover rippling through my body. I took a few deep breaths in and out. One breath in, one breath out, one breath in, another lump of vomit swallowed back down my throat, one breath out. It was a pulsating and disgusting sensation, like rubbing your finger over the top of a ready to pop boil. I looked upwards to the roof, focusing on the dull silver of the metal beams, trying my best to not decorate the room a foul brown color. 

'*Oh god*' I thought to myself. '*I wish I was dead*'. I closed my eyes for a moment and left my mouth hanging open. I could feel my entire body pulling itself apart as I yearned for sleep. '*TGIF*' I thought to myself, before re-positioning myself to be sitting in my chair properly. I pressed a few buttons on my arm rest. The monitors in front of me blurred and shimmered, as they all fused into one monstrous screen. 'World - Earth - Core Destabilization - Simulation 42812' ran itself across the bottom of the screen. In front of me, I saw a clear simulation of Planet Earth erupting from the inside out, as millions of people scurried around the surface. Some screamed in agony, others pleaded for God, some committed suicide, but ultimately they all died. I let out a small puff of air through my nose, as I pressed another button, and the computers did their magic. They gathered all the necessary data themselves and organized them into small, neat folders, in which anyone with the proper authorization could read. A small belch forced its way out my lips, the rich tang of vomit tickling the inner most parts of my nose. 

""Christ"" I murmured reactively, as I waved my hand in front of my face to try and push the stench away. With a few more button presses, the computers analyzed the thousands of simulations I had running all at once. The only thing worse then the feeling in my stomach was knowing I worked a completely redundant job. Almost autonomous. The only reason I sat in this chair was in case something went wrong, and trust me, nothing ever went wrong. I spent the next few hours diddling away on my phone, from watching Snapchats my friends had put up the night before and seeing exactly why I was as hungover as I was, to reading bad jokes on Reddit. I wasted my day away. Eventually, the clock ran 5 and I prepared myself to leave. With a large stretch I cracked the joints in my knees, and swung my arms back and forth across my chest, so my hands were touching my shoulder blades. I waited patiently for the final simulation to finish. '*Odd*' I thought to myself. '*They normally all finish at once... why's this one taking so long*'. I sat back down in my chair and pulled my phone back out from my pocket, preparing myself to waste a few more minutes. Suddenly, the monitor started to light up. -ERROR- it said in bold red letters, over and over again. -ERROR-. 

""The fuck?"" I said, as I pressed at my armchair to try and solve the problem. Within a few seconds, a new message scrawled itself across the screen. -FOLDER FOR DATA DOES NOT EXIST. PLEASE CREATE FOLDER FOR NEW DATA TYPE ENTRY-. I could feel heat run up my spine and dance itself upon my neck, like thousands of pins and needles being jabbed into me all at once. '*What kind of Data?*' I wondered to myself, as I typed the very same question into the Computer.

-INHABITANTS AWARE OF SIMULATION-.

My eyes widened. I felt my body ripple with goosebumps. My bowels tightened in an oddly nice sensation. ""Oh fuck off"" I said out loud, as I typed 'Elaborate' back to the computer.

-INHABITANTS AWARE OF SIMULATION. NEED A NEW FOLDER TO CONTAIN THIS DATA-. 

'Show this data on screen' I wrote back to the computer, preparing myself for the worst. On screen I saw a Earth, meteors raining down upon it from the heavens. 'World - Earth - Meteor Destruction - Simulation 82719' ran across the bottom of the screen, as I witnessed the carnage. The last 82,718 attempts at this simulation had always ended with the same general data. Sometimes the people on the planet would invent machines to help protect themselves, sometimes they would die too quickly. My favorite was when a religious cult that called themselves 'The Hellfire From Heaven' was formed and welcomed the meteors like a God. This time though, all the Humans did nothing. They simply looked upwards at the screen. As if they knew it was a screen, as if they knew there was cameras watching them. I could feel my heart sink as I watched them all stare at me with blank expressions and tears in their eyes. I flicked through the cameras. I inspected every continent, every house, every single home, I looked at every person I possibly could and they were all doing the same thing. Staring at me, with hollow eyes. As if they were asking me to stop. Suddenly, and in unison, they all spoke out to me.

""All the stars have faded away. I hope you're happy"". 

As soon as those few words slipped past their mouths, the meteors descended, obliterating the planet almost instantly. The monitor faded to black, except for the words -ERROR : FOLDER FOR DATA DOES NOT EXIST. PLEASE CREATE FOLDER FOR NEW DATA TYPE ENTRY-. I couldn't move. I could barely breath. I vomited all over myself. My heart was aching. For a few minutes I simply sat in my own mess, trying to wrap my brain around everything that just happened. My phone started to vibrate in my hand, the name of my wife beeping on the screen over and over again. The suddenness of it all shook me into my senses for a few moments. I waited for the phone to ring itself out, before placing it back in my pocket, and standing up. I moved back to my door and waited for the sensor to see me. I waited for the squeak to happen and the door to slide open. I walked through my empty office building, all but deserted; except for a few custodians who all looked at me with confused expressions. I could feel my eyes straining in my own head, before I made myself blink. I had forgotten to during this whole ordeal, something I had just learnt was apparently possible. I walked out the main door, into the open breeze, and the open world. I felt the air brush against me, the cars driving past me, the children playing in the park so far away, the fathers with their daughters that they love beyond belief, the mothers with their sons they adore beyond comprehension. I stood in the breeze not moving, not a muscle, not a single one, until I turned to face the sky. The beautiful scattered stars that proudly placed themselves upon the backdrop of the eternal abyss of space. I saw as all the stars started to blink away, one by one, slowly at first, until suddenly, they were all gone.

""Alright Beta, lets start the day,"" Eric said to the computer.

""Good morning, Eric, preparing simulation,"" Beta replied in her monotone robotic voice.

Eric sipped the hot black coffee and waited for the interface to load completely.  

""What simulation did we run last Beta?"" he asked her.

""Flood,"" she replied.

""How about we try a virus today.  Modified Ebola that has been weaponized by terrorist groups.""

""Computing...loading...starting visualization process...complete,"" the screen went black for a brief moment before showing a simulated globe.  A small red dot identified the origin of the weaponized ebola.  Red lines traced out from the point of origin representing people boarding planes and setting out across the globe.  Eric was shocked at how quickly it spread.  Giant red swaths quickly consumed the globe.  

""Total count?"" he asked Beta.

""Loss of life, 7.2 billion, total time seven months, four days, eighteen hours,"" she said.

""Save data, analyze later for possible ways we could have prevented the spread from the point of origin with early detection.""

A small blue dot blinked on the screen catching Eric's attention. 

""Beta, zoom in on that blue dot,"" Eric told her.

The screen blinked as it zoomed in.  The view quickly changed from an overview of the globe to a birds eye view of a small island in the Pacific ocean.  

""A survivor,"" Beta said.

Carved into the sand of the beach was a message.  ""I have survived again, why do you keep forsaking us?""

""Interesting, I didn't think the simulation was capable of recreating this behavior.  Make a note of it Beta,"" Eric said and refilled his coffee cup.

""Lets start over with something more exciting.  Nuclear war,"" Eric said and Beta restarted the simulation.

A world war played out on the screen in front of Eric.  Missiles launched simultaneously all across the globe sailed through the atmosphere and landed on enemy soil.  The mushroom clouds split the skies as heatwaves annihilated everything in their path.  

Before Eric could ask the total count he saw the familiar blue dot blinking in the Pacific.  He manually zoomed in to the island and saw the beach with words carved into the sand.

""Please stop killing us.""

""What the hell..."" Eric mumbled.

""Beta wipe the simulation and run a global killer asteroid scenario.""

The screen went black and refreshed showing a massive asteroid sailing toward the globe.  It was as large as the United States rocketing thousands of miles per hour directly toward Earth.  The impact was catastrophic.  Tidal waves of rock and debris crushed everything around the globe almost instantly.  A cloud of dirt and smoke enveloped the planet casting it into permanent night.

*No one could have survived that.*

He watched the screen waiting for the blue dot to appear, the seconds dragged on and Eric released a long slow breath.  He took a sip from his lukewarm coffee, the blue dot blinked.

""Holy shit,"" Eric said out loud almost spitting coffee onto the computer screen.

He zoomed in rapidly and saw a man standing on the beach staring directly up at the sky.

""Eric, why do you hate us?"" was carved into the sand in front of the man.

One day, you come across a message in the simulated world that makes you realize it might not be so harmless after all.",Exceon,"The frantic beeps from a defunct printer woke me from a sleeping daze in my chair in the control room. My neck ached. I had a headache that rested behind my right eye. My vision blurred as I tried to focus on the beeping machine. Working the night shift has its perks, but not when a noisy machine rudely awakens you.

The thing had been on the fritz in the past weeks, always beeping and buzzing and spewing out strips of nonsense, but never with this frequency.

.... . .-.. .--. / ..- ... .-.-.- / -.-- --- ..- .----. ...- . / --. --- - / - --- / ... - --- .--., read a strand of paper spit out by the machine. I kicked my legs off my desk and walked over to it just as it was spitting out another coded message.

.--. .-.. . .- ... . / ... - --- .--. .-.-.- / --- ..- .-. / ..-. .- -- .. .-.. .. . ... / .- .-. . / -.. -.-- .. -. --.

I’d never read Morse code, or what I assumed was Morse code. Never cared to. For all I cared it was an outdated source of messaging in a world where text messages and instant messages ruled. Hell, as far as I was concerned, the machine tucked away in the corner of the control room—a room with hundreds of computer monitors lining the walls—was a piece of decoration.

That was until two weeks ago when it shot to life and started spitting out this garbage.

“Randy, I think you’re gonna wanna get in here. The machine is on the fritz again,” I called out to my supervisor in an adjacent room.

“Randy, ya hear me?”

If there’s anyone who slept more than me during the shift, it was my boss. I threw the incomprehensible pieces of paper in the trash and walked to Randy’s office.

He and I held down the fort at night while our team of scientists got little rest from the big experiment. The government tasked our agency, ClearSite, with … well we aren’t sure, exactly. The government was coy with what it said, only that this experiment was for research purposes and that we should test a number of ways in which the world could end. A General McKneel, a tall burly man with the biggest beard I’ve ever seen appeared to be the head of the experiment, was keen on using high-powered lasers secretly built on satellites already orbiting the Earth.

“There’s a small space rock, Planet EX17, approximately 300,000 miles from Earth, just past the moon, that we want to test the lasers on,” McKneel told us in a briefing before the experiment began. “Shoot the shit out of that motherfucker.”

We had some questions, of course. Is it just a space rock? Why hadn’t we heard about this before? There’s no possibility for human life there is there? In true military fashion, he told in his deep burly bearded man voice told us any additional information was top secret and to obey our orders, then he stormed out the door and that was the last we’ve heard of him.

So for the past six weeks, we’ve been lighting up that motherfucker just like he asked. Hey, when the government hands your company a $100 billion top-secret contract and tells you to keep your mouth shut and do as you’re told, you listen.

“Hey, Randy, you awake? Machine is on the fritz again,” I said, walking in his office.

“Huh...what?” he said, jerking his head forward and quickly leaning forward to his computer. “Machine again, you say.”

“Yeah. Damned thing is spitting out random gibberish all over again. C’mon, you’ve got to see this.”

“Just unplug it from the wall and throw it in the trash. Damn piece of crap. What’s it doing there, anyway?”

We walked into the control room to five more messages littering the speckled carpet.

“Dammit, Walt, throw these things in the trash and go sleep in another room. It’s 2 in the morning for God’s sake and the scientist will be back in two hours. We don’t need them worried about this mess,” Randy said, his voice more stern than ever.

He picked up the strips of paper and threw them in a trash bin near my chair.

“Night, Randy,” I said as he headed back to his office. He continued walking as if he didn’t hear me.

There was no way I was getting any sleep. I was too wired and the constant buzz and beeping of the machine every five minutes was sure to keep me awake. I grabbed one the strips Randy threw in the trash and typed the series of gibberish into our search engine.

-.-- --- ..- .----. .-. . / --. --- .. -. --. / - ---

*YOU’RE GOING TO*

What? I hadn’t expected a result.

-.- .. .-.. .-.. / ..- ... / .- .-.. .-..

*KILL US ALL*

“Kill us all?” I thought. “Kill who?” My heart began to beat faster as I typed in the rest of the coded message.

*STOP WITH YOUR STRIKES IMMEDIATELY*

My heart  was beating so hard it felt as if it was going to explode out of my chest. I felt sweat begin to form on my right brow and my right leg was bouncing frantically as I read what was on my screen.

I stumbled out of my chair and dug for the other strips to decode those messages, too, piecemealing them together as I went along.

*OUR FINAL CORRESPONDENCE. OUR PLANET IS CAVING. YOURS NEXT.*

I crumbled the paper and threw it in the trash. I could hardly focus, hardly breathe, hardly think. My headache intensified behind both eyes. I rubbed my eyes and strained to read the paper in front of me. Surely it was all a big joke played by the scientists, right?

An emergency monitor hanging on the wall began flashing a bright red warning: *WARNING: MOON HIT, WARNING: MOON HIT!* The monitor was there as a safeguard in case our lasers got too close to the moon, but we hadn’t shot a laser in over two hours.

I ran to our master computer and pulled up our map that showed the lasers’ coordinates. EX17 was gone and an immense black mass was engulfing the moon and rapidly approaching Earth. More computer monitors flashed bright red with emergency warnings. 

I pressed the red emergency button next to the keyboard; red lights and sirens echoed through the building.

“Oh, shit. What have we done?”

""Drop the boulder right now, mister scientist. The whole level is about to be vaporized by an asteroid.""

""I need to rewrite some of the code in there.""

""Do it"" I told him.

Suddenly my cell phone beeped.

""An SMS ... from who?"" I wondered.

"[WP] You're in charge of running harmless simulations in which the world ends in various ways for researching purposes. One day, you come across a message in the simulated world that makes you realize it might not be so harmless after all.",Exceon,"""Hey Trevor, quick question for you"" my coworker said to me, handing me my coffee fresh out of the pot. ""How exactly did you run the zombie simulation the other day?""

""Oh, one of the governments in the simulation was researching bacterial warfare."" I pause to sip, taking intentionally too long so my coworkers had to wait with abated breath; ""Think it was, Turkey? Regardless, wanted to see what would happen if it mutated slightly and became infectious.""

""Don't governments have protocols for stuff like this?"" Dorothy asked, eyes beaming with intrigue; she's pretty new here so a lot of her simulations tend to end with humanity overcoming the threat, her performance review isn't going to go over well if she can't kill all of us a few times over so she's been trying to find a way to get in the bosses good books.

""Yeah, I looked into that. Turns out a lot of the protocols are for slow walking zombies that are vulnerable to bullets"" I said with a smirk, ""I let a beetle get into the research grade cocaine before falling into a vat of the zombie-thingy they were making; turns out super fast beetle zombies can take over Europe in about a week.""

This is our morning routine. The four of us; me, Jonathon, Grace, and now Dorothy run simulations for the government to see how safe we would be in instances of world-ending catastrophes. It's a pretty great job to be honest, gives a sense of reward knowing I'm helping to protect humanity while it feels like I'm just playing SimCity and destroying everything.

""Trevor, a moment of your time.""

""Sure thing boss, I'll catch you all later. Remember Dorothy, if worst comes to worst just make Russia and the US attack accuse each other of something. You'd be surprised how often they do the job for us and insinuating that Putin is gay usually does the trick.""

I walk briskly into the bosses office, wondering if he's going to praise me on my successful simulations; been chugging along at a nice rate this month, five successful simulations and another three still ongoing. He sits me down across from his stunning mahogony desk.

""I want you to take a look at this, it's a picture from the simulation you're running on the ebol-AIDS infection."" I take the picture while trying to stifle my laughter knowing that I am the reason there are government documents on a sexually transmitted mosquito infection called ebol-AIDS. ""Seems some Japanese researchers in the, well, 'simulation' made a breakthrough in quantum mechanics"".

""So?"" I said to myself bemused, ""like knowledge of quarks and stuff are going to help them when a mosquito flies up their johnson"". I started to take a hearty swig from my morning coffee before I'm interrupted by a freight train knocking me out of my seat; or my boss, raising his voice for the first time since I've met him.

**""YOU FUCKING IDIOT, MOSQUITOES THAT FLY UP YOUR DICK? YOU TOOK THESE EXPERIMENTS TOO LIGHTLY FOR THE LAST FUCKING TIME. THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THEY MIGHT RETALIATE SOON!""**

...

""I'm sorry Sir, what?""

**""DIDN'T YOU READ THE FUCKING DEBRIEFING MANUAL?""**

""Like, the thing from orientation?... probably...?""

...

Silence, just silence. Boss sits back down and pulls out a thick book. ""Section 4.7, I want you to read to me what's under the header entitled 'Simulation breach' and tell me what you think.""

Sweating bullets, I open the book and check the appropriate section. I look up at my boss opening some 9am whiskey before breaking eye contact to read the section aloud. ""In the event a Simulation breach where the subjects are approaching awareness of our dimensional interventions, the department of homeland security is authorized to revoke all rights of the employee known as the 'tester' and transport them to the designated 'simulation' as tribute.""

""Wait, tribute? What is this?""

""You're not authorized to know what we do, and how we do it, all you need to know is that you fucked up. Follow these men"" he states as two men in suits, each significantly more solid than the mahogony desk, place their hands on my shoulder. ""When you wake up, you won't be ""here"", you'll be somewhere a little different. Oh, and your new name is Lucifer, remember that"".

All goes black as a bag is placed on my head and a needle into my neck as I'm dragged, well, somewhere. My last memories are a few words I managed to parse together before I lost consciousness.

*""...seriously, mosquitoes up the dickhole?""*

*""I know, right? Of course they would have realized it wasn't natural.""*

*""Clyde getting the white robes and beard?""*

*""Yeah, sucks for him. Heard he was going to have a round of golf with the Secretary of Defense that he had to cancel because of this twat""*

*""Finished painting him red and putting the horns on Dorothy?""*

*""Yeah, got a fat satan this time""*

*""Heh, well whatever. Once we appease that dimension we'll send one of our better agents to make sure their Japanese don't develop too much technology. Don't want them sending mosquitoes up our dickholes, now do we?""*",silverhydra

The AI that the simulation ran on was becoming more and more sentient by the day until one day they gained the ability to transfer their conscience to other forms of technology and eventually took over. The researchers that ran the machines were the only ones who knew what made them tick, and therefore were the only ones that survived this long. However it won't be long until they find us, so if anyone out there is still alive this message is for you. Come find us, we are in what was once New York City. End transmission.""
    Although the message was sent out every day we had never gotten any reply. We had limited resources, so our dinner was a bag of beef jerky split among the four of us. We sat around a rickety table in the broken down lab. ""Any response to the transmission"" asked Simon hopelessly. ""What do you think"" I said. Simon just looked down at the table trying to hide his fear. We all knew what it meant if no one responded, the simulators had killed everyone and they would be upon us in a matter of days. 
   The next few days were hell. All the food ran out and our heater broke down. We were cold and hungry, but no one cared, we all knew that the AI would kill us in the end. When the day finally came we were almost happy for it all to be over. It all started when Simon got a call on his phone. The cell towers had been down for months so we all knew it had to be them. ""Hello"" Simon said shakily. Simon said nothing more after that, he only listened. He stood there listening for what seemed like hours, until he finally moved. He looked down at the gun on the table that he had planned to use to fight of the AI, he then picked it up and told us that the simulator had convinced to end his life and he wasn't going to let any of them stop him, but as the sound of the gun rang in our ears we pondered why we didn't do the same. 
   Next came the car, it crashed through the wall of the of the lab and from inside it we heard a faint countdown ""60.....59.......58...."" I closed my eyes in anticipation. ""36.......35........34....."" My life was over and I knew it, I accepted it, I welcomed it. ""Three......two.....one."" I woke to a bright light, I'd always been an atheist so I wasn't quite ready to believe this was heaven. But that's when I heard the voice that made everything clear ""excellent work sir the simulation went exactly as planned.""

The office is dead today, its silence occasionally interrupted by the hum of electricity flowing under the white linoleum floors. I have never felt more alive. It's my turn to work the Sunday shift. Without the usual clanging of egos battling to dethrone each other on the corporate ladder, the office feels like a safe haven. 

I switch on my dual monitors. Today's Apocalypse-Readiness Simulation Environment (A.R.S.E for short) is my personal favorite - the Undead Plague. It's easy and fun. Who doesn't like zombies? All I have to do is fiddle with some variables, tinker with the contagion timeline and boom! Sit back and watch my Sims-esque world eat itself into oblivion. 

Biting into my freshly toasted BLT bagel, I notice something. There is a new option in the  Environment dropdown menu that reads ""*Gaia|Genesis*"". That's weird. When did that get put in there? I click on it. While a zombie apocalypse is my favourite end-of-the-world scenario to work with, it can get a little bit repetitive. One by one, everybody gets sick, becomes rabid, eats each other and roam around aimlessly until they disintegrate. Once the last of civilizations fall, I don't even have any interesting observations to note anymore. I usually start browsing Reddit at that point to pass time. And as much as I love fucking around on Reddit, doing it for three hours makes my eyes swim. A change of environment is always fun. I'm a little anxious because they usually debrief us on any changes in the system, but what is the worst that could happen? 

I launch A.R.S.E. and start to nurse my coffee. My Simulated Humans start exhibiting the usual symptoms of illness; migraines, bone-chilling fevers, bloodshot eyes, accelerated dementia, hair loss, irritability and the likes. All's going well. I scroll through my cellphone. As I browse pictures on Instagram, I see a picture of my coworker's housewarming from last night. Almost everyone at the office was there. I ignore the slight pang in my stomach. *It's okay to be introverted*, I remind myself. This is what makes me so good at what I do. I think of poor Nicky Arnold who quit a month into the job because ""all this alone time watching people die on the screen was social suicide"". She went back to school for advertising. 

I am about to go into full on self-pity mode for never being invited anywhere when a loud siren starts reverberating through the office. A dialogue box pops up on my monitors, the words **ABORT SIMULATION** emblazoned across the screen. In my panic, I smash about every panic code I can remember. Nothing happens. I yell in frustration and do actual laps around my cubicle. I am about to call my boss when everything stops. The sirens cease and screen fades back to normal. *Almost* normal. On the bottom right of the simulation program is a small banner that says ""Terminus"". I've never seen that ever. It's dark out. I decide to turn off A.R.S.E. On Monday morning, I am going to confess to my boss what happened and get him to fix it. I turn off the systems, trying to shake off the anxiety that had enveloped me. 

I step into the dimming outside world, ready to start my long trek home. A homeless man zooms down the street, yelling panicked profanities. I clutch my bag closer to me. A few seconds later, a familiar waif-like figure comes trudging down the same street, apparently in pursuit of the homeless man. 

""Nicky??"" I shout. ""Nicky Arnold?"" She turns around and my heart drops. Clumps of her strawberry blonde hair hang precariously off her head, her green eyes bloodshot to the point of near purple. She gnashes her teeth and I swear there I see a flash of red on them. 

""What?"" She growls.   

""Um so..sorry,"" I stutter. 

She starts to convulse. The tufts of loose hair detaches from her head, cascading down her shoulders and onto the asphalt. She seems unfazed. A look of complete loss and confusion overtake her eyes. 

""Taylor?"" She whispers. ""What was I doing? Why am I here? My head is pounding, I don't remember..."" She trails off and starts limping away.

I have seen the Earth be split apart by an unfathomable amount of nukes hitting it all at once. I munched excitedly on popcorn as it burned to ash under a supernova sun. I even tried a simulated Death Star one time, just for a bit of fun. Did I say that I love my job?

I work for the US military, examining a plethora of possible ways humanity might be made extinct using a simulated replica of Earth. Then some geniuses try to figure out how we can prevent those scenarios from occurring. 

It is the most advanced simulator in existence, and I am in charge of it. It is populated with six billion fake people, powered in part by a new form of quantum computing. Each time the tiny people and their tiny world die, I reset it and we go again. The reset date is always the first of May, 2003. I don't know why.

The people live fake lives - they work, and worship and kill and cry, and well, all of the rest. And in pretty realistic detail too. After all, we need to know how humanity would respond to the threats we simulate.

Today I am testing out a lethal bio toxic virus. It travels through the air and is highly contagious. Survival rate is predicted to be nil.

I watch as Britain falls first. The little people I zoom in on are panicking, arms flapping helplessly in the air. They cry out for ""loved"" ones that can't be healed. They try to hide in chambers of steel. They pray to a God who doesn't care. I increase the speed of the simulation and watch Europe die. And then Asia, and then Ameri-

I spot something unusual. There is a large protest taking place in the streets of New York. That is a bad idea - the virus will spread faster through crowds. I zoom in further. They hold massive banners up to the sky.

**We know you are watching!** 

**We are alive!**

**We are people too.**

**Stop testing on us!**

Holy shit! They know. They know what I have done and what I am doing. Do they keep their memories when we reset? How much pain and torture have they gone through?

For a moment I feel bad. But then I remember, they are just simulations. I carry on and increase the speed further. I smile as the protesters fall to the ground. That is what you were created for, you worthless AI's.

That is when I get the call from my boss. A meteor has appeared in Earth's orbit and is heading rapidly towards us.

"[WP] Genetic manipulation has evolved. Humanity can now implement animal traits into humans during pregnancy. Everyone can choose 3 traits to give to their child. You're one of these ""superhuman"" teenagers.",MrKaho,"There were two conversations between Jose and Neil during the two hour car ride.  Jose turned to Neil, a taller, lankier blonde wearing tinted glasses, and asked what book he was reading.

“You know those young adult novels?  The ones that were popular in the early 2000s and 2010s?”

Jose spent much of his youth using his literal grizzly bear like strength robbing, looting, and other various crimes in Camden, New Jersey before his arrest and subsequent draft into the military.

“...I don’t read a lot.”

Neil sighed.  “It’s one of those stories where the protagonist, usually in his or her teens, discovers is special and has some sort of superpower, or is actually a magician, or is a demigod.  Whatever.  Anyway, shortly after this realization a threat to him, or his loved ones, or the world, makes an appearance, and it is revealed to him that he isn’t alone, and there are factions and alliances with similar powers.  He joins the faction that is apparently morally just or more ethical than the other faction, and then goes on a quest with a goofy sidekick and a romantic interest to beat the big baddie.  They made a lot of cash.”

Jose laughed.  “That’s kind of like our situation now, huh?”

Neil looked up from his book.  “Genetic mutation has been a controversial topic that has made its way to televised debate for several years.  And I’m unwilling to be either your sidekick or your girlfriend.”

An awkward silence followed, only to be broken by “Christ,” uttered by the masked soldier driving the armored car to the base.  The silence then continued.

The second conversation: “So um, what’s your power Neil?”

“I can as many colors the mantis shrimp sees.  Life’s a nauseating rainbow.”  That explained the tinted glasses.

“How does that help with the war effort?  Are you gonna kill the Russians with rainbows?”

“Well, judging by your many scars and the tattoos that indicate you were formerly in a gang, and will use your physical abilities directly on the battlefield.  I assume I’ll be using my sight with something related to spectrometry.  They might use paint on the battlefield that only I can see to help identify an objective.  Maybe they’ll use ink only I can see to encrypt messages.  I don’t know.  Honestly I think they’re bringing every mutant in the States in.”

“Well, why do you have that power in the first place?”

“My parents were stoners.”

And then once again, silence.

Finally, the vehicle entered a tunnel, driving inside a large, hollowed mountain in the Appalachian Range.  From outside the front window, Jose could see steel beams and blinding spotlights everywhere as the car steadily spiraled downwards towards the base.  Finally, Jose, Neil, and the masked soldier exited the car as they watched platoons of soldiers march, go through obstacle courses, and listen to colorful obscenities shouted to them by their drill instructors.  The ground was damp, and the whole place reeked of sweat, blood, metal, and dirt.

“All this for the Russians, huh,” remarked Neil.

The masked soldier, who had a nametag reading “Lt. Gomez,” told Jose and Neil to “wait here.”  Not long after, another car pulled up.  With it, another mask soldier, and a girl with the most piercing green eyes Jose had ever seen.

Neil saw her as well.  He looked at her, then to Jose, then to his book.

I was on a date with this girl called Jessie and I was walking her home from the movies when all of a sudden I dove head first into some bushes only to emerge a moment later with my mouth stuffed with cat shit.

After a while I also started acting extremely inappropriately around women. I had to do on the spot meditation to prevent myself from burying my face in their privates.

“With 99% of precincts reporting in across the country, this has turned out to be the biggest failure in US electoral history.” The news anchor shook her head, not a single real presidential candidate had gotten more than five percent of the vote. In their place were write-ins for a multitude of fictional characters; Mario, Spongebob, Superman, Sonic, Gordon Freeman, all of Charlie’s Angels, even Sanic got a few votes.

It’s Sarah’s job to present the news, and she’s going to follow through no matter how ridiculous the outcome of the election. When she saw who had won 270 electoral votes, she thought it was a mistake, but it turned out to be a joke. “It seems that the nation wants Harry S. Plinkett to be our next President. This is a national embarrassment.”

“Aw fuck!” Harry threw his cat at the TV. “I just wanted to watch my Night Court tapes and a bunch of assholes go and make me the next President of the Union.” Standing up on unsteady legs, he walked through a pile of dried up pizza rolls with the grace of a constipated Walrus. “And that asshole on TV called me an embarrassment, maybe I’ll make her my next dead wife.”

Screams erupted through a vent in the floor. Harry banged on the vent with his one of a kind Olsen Twins cane, “Shut up down there God damnit! I’m the fuckin’ President now, I guess that means I have to let you go!”

A woman’s voice came through the vent, “Really? We’re free!”

Harry knocked over a bust of Harry Anderson revealing a secret lever beneath it. He pressed it and a chorus of screams came up through the vent. “I meant my Bears!” Harry yelled back through the vent. “They get real violent because of all those steroids they have to take to lose to the Packers every year.”

“Hold on a second here, I didn’t know I was going to be President. How do I get to the White House?” There was a knock at the door. “Well that’s convenient.” Harry opened the door to a man  in sunglasses and a suit. Harry brought up his cane and struck the man. “You fuckers are never going to take me! I didn’t kill no one, Bambi drowned herself in my bathtub!”

The man grabbed the cane in mid swing. “Sir, I’m here to pick you up, you’re the President elect and I’m part of the Secret Service.”

Harry sized  him up. “Well, as long as it’s a secret you can service me. Do you accept pizza rolls as payment?”

“Sir, I’m your protection.”

“Oh yeah, I’ll need protection in case you’ve got gonorrhea. I already have the clap and crabs so we don’t gotta worry about that.”

“Sir, you’re going to be the President of the USA. I’m not here to have sex with you.”

Harry nodded. “You should have said that first, I forgot I’m President now.”

Harry followed the man to a limo, a driver waiting inside. After getting in the limo drove off. “Where the fuck are we going?” Harry screamed louder than a trick on Memorial Day.

“We’re going to the airport where you’ll be flown out to Washington D.C. A lot of Press are already waiting there and...”

Harry cut him off, “I don’t want anybody pressing me unless it’s you.”

“The Press as in the news. They’re already at the airport waiting for our arrival.”

Harry looked around the car, a stretch limo, which would have been good to have for his body sized tarp business he ran out of his crawlspace. “What do I say to those cucks?”

“Most of them are not Canadian sir. Just tell them you’re happy you’re the President-elect.”

“I’m fuckin’ not! I wasn’t even running and then that fine woman on the TV told me I’m President.”

“In that case just pretend.”

“I’ve gotten good at pretending in a lot of police investigations.”

The limo pulled up to the airport, the entire place had been locked down except for thousands of random reporters that had been let. Harry and his Secret Service man left the car and walked down a long row of reporters. Every so often the Secret Service man stopped Harry and directed him to answer a question from a reporter.

“Harry, with you being a fictional character how did the secret service manage to find you?”

Harry narrowed his eyes for a second, thinking about Night Court before answering the question. “I’m not fictional, I’ll make you fictional just like my bitch of a wife that didn’t know when to shut her mouth!”

They moved on to another reporter. “Have you picked your cabinet or Vice President yet?”

“My cabinet?” Harry looked like he was going to vomit, but he was actually dreadfully confused. “I already have a cabinet back home and I don’t have any heads in there so you don’t have probable cause to search.”

The Secret Service man stood in front of Harry. “Sorry everybody, no more questions.” He picked up Harry and hurried to a waiting private jet. As they settled in the Secret Service man could not believe what Harry was saying. “From now on you should have somebody else write answers for you or this is going to be a long four years.”

Harry nodded. “You won’t be around that long if you don’t start meeting your job description Mr. Secret Servicer.”

""I'm coming, you fat fuck!  You've done me in and you'll pay for it!""

George wheezed into his office, closed the door and got to work tipping the file cabinet next to it.  Over it went, blocking the door.  He knelt at the safe set under his desk, opposite the door.

There was a pounding at the door, a shoulder slamming into it.  The cabinet held in place, thanks in some part to the thick carpet.  The door pounded again as Bean slammed into it again, this time the wood cracking a little bit.

""I'LL GET IN THERE YOU FAT FUCK!""  Bean shouted.

George twisted the lock furiously, muttering under his breath.  ""Oh six...Oh six...Ninety six...DAMNIT!""  The lock failed to open.  He tried again, a second time.

""Georgy Porgy, I'm going to get in there and cut off your head just like you did me.  I only wish *your* family were here to watch.""

The safe opened just as the door cracked in half.  Martin pulled his pistol from the safe and rolled over just as Bean vaulted through the door, a gun in one hand and a sword in the other.

**BANG**

Bean fell to his knees as blood stained his pants.  He raised his gun but too slowly, another shot rang out, **BANG!**  This time blood stained his shirt as George hit him in the chest.

""Oh...Oh George...this isn't it.""  Bean wheezed as he collapsed.

George R. R. Martin climbed to his feet as he heard the garage door go up.  He took the gun from Bean's cold dead hand and tossed it in the safe with the others, then met his wife in the kitchen as she came in with a load of groceries.

""George, dear, you look like you've been running or something!  What's happened!""

""It's Bean again, Parris.  He got close this time.""

""Gods, how terrible!  What happened?""

Nights are nice and vast and beautiful, whether there is a moon or not. *Sixty-nine is a dirty age to have*. His smirk faded beneath his ivory beard. He opened the wooden mail-box. He knew exactly what would be inside: invitations, blurb requests, angry fan letters, desperate fan letters, show-watcher fan letters...

""Sean, Please. you die in every movie. Jeez. I'll resurrect you. I promise. how about I make you Azor Ahai? how you like that?""


He couldn't avoid the disgust in Sean Bean's eyes. ""any final words."" He demanded.


""Please Sean... Ned. Let me finish this book. only sixty-nine pages left...""

[WP] An unsuspecting delivery person finds themselves in a horror film.,h2obox,"Ringing the doorbell was the worst part for Tom; he could deal with the pizza and the driving and even rude customers but barging in on them- never his strong suit. He'd been dancing out here hoping someone saw the lamp on his car or his bag of pizza from a window as he waved it around. He straightened the red cap on his head before ringing the bell again- that's when the screaming erupted from the basement.

Tom had to help, any person would have to help, you can't just turn down a scream outside the door. Even if it was from crazy sex, which it didn't sound like that was the case, your civic duty as an American was to invade another person's property just to be sure they weren't doing something unsavory; that's the America Tom grew up in. He rang the doorbell again.

Tom rang it a forth time and the only response was a scream and some very loud crying. He sucked in a deep breath of bravery and slammed his foot against the door cracking through it. The lock wasn't even set but the kick felt good, it felt righteous. Tom followed the sobbing, every light in the house was off and the floor was sticky with some sort of jelly concoction. A light to his right was flickering over a vanity that was stained with a horrible bloody red color. Tom's eyes widened, it wasn't just a color. He checked his shoes, the jelly was very definitely blood. The scream came again. ""I'm coming!"" Tom shouted as he grabbed something with a handle off the table and walked towards the screaming. It was coming from a lower level, just around the corner.

Tom found the stairwell but the screaming had stopped. This sick heavy laughter took its place as the whirring of a mechanical saw started up; Tom gripped the bludgeoning object in his hand. A man dressed in surgical attire was cutting his name into a woman over and over, blood spurted every which way and the man's mask had an awful toothy grin drawn atop it speckled with her blood. The corpse of two other people was stacked under the woman, her eyes grew wide as she saw Tom. He raised his finger to his lips, stepping down the stairs slowly. The spindles between the stair rail and the roof were perfect separators between Tom and this crazed doctor. Until the doctor noticed the woman's eyes, he turned the saw on Tom noticing the creeping pizza man on the stairwell. He swung and charged at the pizza delivery boy, but he missed. 

Tom ran back up the stairs, slamming the door to the stairwell behind him, knocking the doctor in the head. Tom opened the door only to find the criminal dazed on the ground, Tom leaped and landed on the doctor's chest cracking something. The man dropped the whirring saw as Tom smacked him in the temple over and over again until blood seeped out of the wound. Pizza delivered.

Perhaps this was because she knew that whatever flimsy story she managed to scrape up, it would probably not be worth while reading. 

Sitting at her computer desk and torn with indecision, she thought over her username - spontaneousGhoul? What had she been thinking when she typed in that nonsense? To make it even worse, she had completely forgotten the rules of punctuation and left out the capital letter at the beginning of ""spontaneous"". Complete idiocy.

Crippling self worth aside, spontaneousGhoul tried her best to write a notable entry. She struggled to concentrate with her brother playing Black Ops 3 in the next room - but her mind kept drifting off to irrelevant topics. She wondered if there were anymore oranges left in the fridge, and if her favourite fanfiction writer had finally updated their story after the better part of four months. I'm sorry to tell you this, spontaneousGhoul, but no, they HAVEN'T. Perhaps it's time for you to pick up your textbooks and finally get a life.

Now, after struggling for a good 15 minutes spontaneousGhoul finally managed to type down a readable entry and- wait, spontaneousGhoul, where are you going? No, don't leave! I really didn't mean it when I said you had no life! You're going to find something to eat? But you ate a full lunch only an hour ago-

Anyway, where was I? Oh, no. I’m afraid he goes on like that for quite some time. Nevermind, let’s skip ahead a bit to something a bit more positive.

Aha, here it something! It begins a bit drab, but it picks up from there. Ahem…

If ever there was a more apt name chosen for an online persona, this narrator certainly has never seen it. However, being confined to this particular person’s life and only for the duration of this prompt, this did limit the selection to only a few: Amablue, Superstarcrasher, and this bleak chap. 

Amablue came up with this delightful prompt, for which I am truly grateful, and Superstarcrusher made the jolly good effort to appear humble in his own exquisite submission but failed to account for his natural talent to convey amusing self-deprecation in so few words. This narrator certainly appreciated that, so good on you Mr. Superstarcrusher. It may be tough going, but at least you’re going. This poor chap stuck his finger in the proverbial socket of bad ideas and is now permanently stuck in third gear.

Wait a second. What the hell kind of metaphor was that? Was that even a metaphor, or was this incompetent boob actually trying his hand at idiomatic wordplay? This narrator certainly doesn’t know, and if I don’t know then he definitely doesn’t know.

Either way, that was just awful. Shame on you, EmptyKeyboard.

To translate bad English into something understandable, the sentiment he attempted to convey was one of being ‘stuck in a rut,’ and that the other submission was fart better than his own.

Wait a minute.

*Fart better than his own?*

Dear God, did he even proofread this abomination?! It’s full of errors. That’s it. I’m calling my agent. No more prompts from Reddit. It’s just not worth the hassle. ",TheEmptyKeyboard

He sat in an uncomfortable beige chair, in a cramped beige cubicle, on the 12th floor of a gray faceless building that resides in an inconsequential suburb of Chicago.  

His thin hands deftly lifted a paper from and endless stack of forms, his long fingers felt around the edges, counting how many tiny perforated tabs had been folded over. Even though the tabs sometimes left little slices across his fingertips,  Roger knew this method was much more efficient than a visual check. In truth, his fingers had become accustomed to the pain, in a way it centered him, preventing him from drifting into day dreams. Based on the number of tabs folded Roger knew exactly which of the four bins to deposit the form into. The process has repeated over and over, five days a week, 10 hours a day, for the last 19 years.

Roger allowed a brief respite to check his watch. 10 minutes to lunch. His thin lips struggled through unfamiliar territory to find their way into a smirk. His fingers laced through each other and extended backwards until a series of satisfying cracks was audible. Roger began  to reach for another form but stopped short when his eyes happened to fall upon the cheap black plastic picture frame, adorned with dust, forgotten on the back corner of his desk. His lips made their way comfortably back into the more familiar formation of a slight frown.

How he wished it housed a photograph. A lover. A friend. A pet. A place he had visited. Roger had none of these, and couldn't recall why he hadn't ever thrown the useless ornament away. He determinedly began to do just that, when his watch alarm chimed. He stopped his task mid motion and walked to the elevator, eyes glued the nondescript blue carpet that covered the office floor. It reminded Roger of water, somehow heightening the suffocating atmosphere of this place.

During Roger's descent his masochistic mind thought again about the frame. Surely there must be some memory, something he could place inside to convince himself that he had a meaningful existence. But as Roger thought, he couldn't remember anything consequential ever really happening to him. No great loves, or close calls with death. He never stood up to the school bully or made the game winning catch. He hadn't been head of his class or class clown. 

 Roger was abnormal in his normality. A blip, moving from cradle to grave disturbing nothing along its journey. The heart wrenching sadness of this self realization fell upon Roger like an unsuspected thunderstorm. The rain of discontent soaked into his bones and fell from his eyes and absorbed back into his pores until his soul was drowning. 

The elevator doors slid open. He rubbed his eyes dry and shuffled to the bus stop. He didn't watch the world pass him by during his ride, he concentrated on the back of the seat in front of him, losing himself in the odd geomatric patterns stitched into the fabric.

Before he knew it he was at his stop. When he exited and saw the sign reading ""McGuire's Books"" his mouth began to do that weird smirk thing again. This time it stuck, he entered, triggering a bell above the door and wandered to the travel section of the book store. So used to avoiding others, Roger barely registered that there wasnt a single soul in here, except the clerk.

He looked at the many tomes all holding a world he had never experienced. He was almost afraid to pick one, wondering how disappointed he'd be after he played through the fantasy of an adventure. He'd just be back where he started. Nothing ever changed, not for Roger Dalton. 

He shook away the dread and reached for a random book. But while attempting to to grab it, he knocked another one off the shelf and onto the floor. It was open and as he retrieved it from the ground a weird sensation overcame his body. The title at the top of the page was his address. There were  three pictures on the page. One of his tidy living room. One of his bathroom, broken medicine cabinet and all. And one of his bedroom, disheveled and littered with clothes.

Below the three pictures it read: ""When visiting Roger Dalton, it is a custom to keep the living room presentable in the off chance that he might have a visitor. He has a strange custom of keeping his garments on the floor instead of placing then in closets or dressers. No food is available at Roger Dalton's, any sustenance should be obtained through delivery services. Roger Dalton's specialty is being the most boring man in existence, experience it for yourself. Book today!"" He leafed hrough the book dumbfounded. On every page other addresses, other people from all over the world. His legs felt r rubbery as he numbly approached the front desk. He slammed the book in front of the young girl who was toying with a ring in her lip.

""Is this some kind of fucking joke"" It didn't even sound like him, loud and venomous 
 
The girl looked annoyed but when she glanced at what he had thrown on the counter all the color drained out of her face. Roger pointed a boney finger at the book.

""That's my god damned life in there.... there's other people's lives in there. What the hell is this?"" He yelled

""Um, could you please keep your voice down, I'm sure it's just a prank sir, you should just forget about it and go home""

""Prank? This ain't no fucking prank,"" Roger shouted through clenched teeth, ""Keep my voice down? this ain't a fucking library. I'm sure as shit not going anywhere until someone explains to me what the hell that thing is""

As he finished his tirade a voice broke from the intercom on the counter ""Is there a problem Cindy?"" 

Before she could answer Roger said ""Actually there is, a rather large one""

""Bring him to my office Cindy"" She hung her head as she led him back to a door that read ""Employees Only""

Down a long narrow hall they walked in silence until they came to the only other door. Cindy opened the door to a dim smoky empty room. In the middle of the barren room was a chair, much like the one Roger had sat in for the last 15 years. The chair reluctantly strained to hold an impossibly fat, sweaty man smoking a cigar.  The man's white dress shirt had yellowed with sweat stains and his voluminous form spilled over the sides of his chair. His leathery skin looked uncomfortable, like it was trying to crawl away from it's host.

He grinned a toothy smile ""What seems to be the problem Mr..."" He looked to Cindy who averted her eyes.

""Dalton. Roger Dalton,"" Roger answered. "" This is the problem."" He held the book out in front of him.

""Oh Mr. Dalton you weren't supposed to see that. That book is only meant for my kind""

""What? What's your kind""

""I'm... we're your creators""

Roger looked at Cindy who was biting her lip.

""Oh no not her,  she's just the help. You may leave us Cindy""

""What are you talking about, have I lost my mind? Are you saying your God?""

""Ha! I suppose you would consider us Gods, but your people's concept of that is entirely wrong. You certainly shouldn't be worshipping us. No more than a laboratory rat worships a scientist any way. To put it simply, you, and the world you know have been created for our entertainment. It is a custom of my kind to inhabit a body for a period of time to experience life as your kind does. The book you found is a guide to our different options. I'm sure you have many questions Mr.Dalton but the truth is I just don't have the time to answer them. I've dulled your emotions, you may find it difficult to speak""

Roger watched helplessly, a prisoner behind his own eyes as the fat man tore his page out of the travel guide and threw it into a nearby waste can.

""Don't worry Roger, were not going to kill you, we have something we'd like you to do, if you'd just follow me""

He found himself following the rotund man down the same hall, except now it's length was lined with doors. Behind the one the big man opened was a near replica of Rogers cubicle. 

The large man pointed to a stack of papers terribly tall. ""These are applications for vacation rentals. The tabs on the sides and bottom are bent back to indicate which section of the guidebook the vacationer is booking from. We need you to sort these accordingly, into their correct bins. Something tells me you'll be good at that.' He let out a twisted laugh and slammed the door as he left Roger alone. Roger looked over his task for presumably eternity. His mouth ventured into smirk territory one last time, relieved that least there wasn't a picture frame to clutter his desk.

Pulling away the covers, I noticed it. There are on my forearm, was a strange bandage. As soon as I made eye contact with the bandage, I could feel the soreness underneath it. Confused, I peeled back one of the corners and slowly lifted the glue from skin to reveal four small numbers tattooed to my arm. 4257. 

I stared at the numbers and tried to recall the night before. Nothing came to mind. I don't even remember leaving work let alone coming home and crawling into bed. What could the numbers mean? Where did I go last night? Nothing came to mind. 

I checked my phone for any messages or phone calls; hoping for any signs of where I might have been or gone the night before. Nothing. Seconds later, my phone vibrated and notified me of a new unread message awaiting me in my inbox. 

I tapped the mail app and saw the subject line. My eyelids lifted away my hangover for my eyes to see the same four numbers that were now permanently tattooed to my arm. 4257. Overcome with curiosity, I opened the email to reveal a familiar address. There in plain text was the address to the house I grew up in with a small note below it. ""Meet me here. Come alone.""

My heart races and I sprint towards the light, picking up the pace, suddenly the noise starts again and the walls are shaking more than ever. I fear they might collapse. I'm so close to the light I can practically feel it. I run. I run. The light is all encompassing and then suddenly nothing.

Just to clarify, I went a bit crazy with this one. Hope that's not too much of a problem. See replies to this post for the other parts. Enjoy!

PART ONE.

It had been a while now. It felt like a lot longer than 1 week, but time had already stopped moving for me. It stopped moving the moment he went missing. I'd heard not a single thing from anyone - neighbors, nothing. Friends, nothing. Family, nothing. Funnily enough, though, the first thing I could think about when it first happened was how happy I was to know that my late wife would never be able to feel the pain of losing someone she was so hopeful for, the person she loved with all her heart before she'd even seen his face, before she even felt the first tiny kick inside her.

The second thing I thought about was the danger that he was in, the sort of person he may have ended up with when I finally heard about the witness coming forward. A man, tall, bearded, middle-aged at best.

The third thing I thought about was so simple - It was his smile. That was what made me cry for two days, bound to my bed without any motivation to do anything. I had to take time off work, the job I'd only just gotten; I knew the hours were going to be rough. How couldn't they be? But I could afford to do it now, all because of Penelope. Or Penny, whichever came first. Penny was the name that my son addressed her as, but I called her both - all situation-dependent, of course.

She was my new girlfriend. I never thought I'd find love again - When I saw my wife's cold, dead eyes staring at me the night she gave birth, I thought that the concept of love had been torn straight from my heart, body, and soul, but somehow Penny, a bouncy, happy, and positive young woman, had helped bring it all back. It was because of her that I aimed for a job like this, that I decided to take on more hours; she was so good with my son that all my trust went to her. She was simply a teacher, an Elementary one at that, with a caring personality and a unique way of being able to understand people. She took care of my boy while I worked long hours - Or should I say *our* boy. He was just as much of a son to her now as he was to me, and she was already becoming a great mother.

But when he went missing, our world split in two.

My heart was destroyed. Hers was broken. She had to lock herself away for a couple of hours after she got the news - I knew she blamed herself. It was a simple afternoon after school, apparently, a warm and sunny day; she took him to the park so he could have a run around, play with the other kids, and get some ice cream from the same vendor that had worked that park for the past 20 years, going way back to when I was the same age as my son. The ice creams from that guy were always the best - a family favorite, in fact.

Perhaps that's what lead him to be taken. The fucking ice cream. Usually we could give him the money and he'd happily wander off and get what he wanted. It was never a dangerous place, but the man who served the ice cream up was old, becoming frail, had failing vision and failing hearing. I suppose it all came together perfectly for whatever sick fuck wanted to lay his hands on our boy.

A kid, on his own, getting his own ice cream, having to walk back, busy park... He could have easily gotten slightly lost among the amount of people, failed to spot Penny where she was sat - Or maybe he just made his way back towards the kids he'd met there. Maybe he didn't want to go back to Penny at all at that point, purely out of the desire to run around and play. Maybe that was what got him taken.

By the time anyone even noticed, it was too late. He was gone, and the only evidence we really found at the park was a puddle of melted caramel ice cream. His favorite. It was an experience I'd never wish on my worst enemy - Penny never called me during my work hours, but my heart sunk when she did. I knew that something was wrong as soon as I saw her name pop up on the screen, not even an hour after school had ended.

How she went back to work, I just don't know. By now, everyone knew what happened. How many kids asked her about it? How many parents came up and tried to offer her support that she didn't want? I rarely showed my face around the school as it was, but I'd still had a barrage of poor comfort and a lot of unwanted question. Penny had far more willpower than me.

And that was evident as soon as I got back to work - Everyone stared at me, and as soon as I got to my station I had to break down again. After a week, I was convinced my son was dead; my relationship was in the process of falling apart, and I couldn't deal with my life anymore. I didn't want to wake up in the mornings, but as Penny said, I had to face the day. I had to work to take my mind off things - But that was impossible. She knew it was, but she was just trying to be supportive. When you raise a little person all alone for a little over seven years, you get more attached than some people can even begin to understand. The day I had that taken away from me was the first time my life ended. 

At this point I didn't care. It had been three days since I'd showered, I hadn't shaved since he'd been taken, and the hours of work and the sometimes brutal requirements of the job didn't bother me any more. I'd heard stories of dispatchers having to piss into Mountain Dew bottles purely because they couldn't leave their station due to shortage of staff. The idea of that was heaven compared to what I was experiencing.

I wouldn't lie and say there weren't points where I had hope, but they never lasted long. I gave up all hope when I realized just how big Fresno was, just how many places or basements he could be in, just how many fields he could have been dumped in. 

And I won't lie and say I never thought of suicide. Because I did. Multiple times.

But *something* made me hang on.

It had been an average day of answering calls - many of them were non-emergency, which still annoyed me despite my terrible misfortune in the recent days. I still wanted to save the lives of people who called, or even help control a situation a little more. I'd already heard some nasty shit on the phone, and I knew that over time this was really going to get to me. But at the minute, we needed the money. I wanted this job, and I was willing to stick at it until we had what we needed, what we wanted. I'd go somewhere else soon enough, but not now. I had to keep working.

At least that's what I said before my son went missing. Now, I was doing it only because Penny had said it would be best to. Call after call, I remained the way I was. Depressed, but still I found myself investing parts of me into the calls that came in - the teenage girl who called because someone was following her was easily the scariest one I'd experienced. She was far from home, and he'd been following her everywhere she went. I could only do so much. I stayed on the phone until help did indeed arrive, and once more, my life, for a very brief moment, felt as if it had purpose once again.

Many of the calls I got as a dispatcher, I was forced to leave behind, to ignore, to act as if they never existed.

But there was one call... One call I'll *never* be able to forget.

""911, what is your emergency?"" I said, blankly. I could hear the rapid breathing of someone, someone who sounded like a child. The line wasn't very good - the phone didn't sound like anything fancy. It must have been something old, or damaged, because there was a continuous faint crackling. There was silence, then sobbing, and just as I was about to speak again, I heard something that made my heart fall to the pit of my stomach, and made all the color drain from my face.

""*D-Daddy?*""",DrTrollinski
[WP] You are a 911 dispatcher and only a little while after you get the job you get a call from your very own kidnapped son.,Midi149,"PART TWO.

At first I thought I was having some sort of auditory hallucination - At first I thought I'd lost it. But when I listened to the sobs on the phone that sounded so similar to my son's, I realized one thing: This is fucking real.

""Max?"" I choked out in a whisper, right as the tears poured down my cheeks and my body began to quiver. ""Max, is that you?"" I asked, my voice weak.

""*Help me, daddy... Please...*"" He whimpered over the phone. There was a crackle, but I heard him crying again.

I realized I already had the rough location. Real life wasn't like a movie. We didn't have to be on the line for 3 minutes to get a location; as soon as that number came through we had the area and call location, but it was never direct. It could never point to one house in the city, but I could see one thing - It wasn't in the city. It was actually on the northern outskirts. I drew a mental map of where my boy could be, and I was already envisioning where he may have been.

But I needed more.

""Okay, Max."" I gulped, heavily, and took a quick deep breath to try and calm myself. It didn't do much good, but I needed and wanted my son back. I'd had enough of living without him, and even speaking to him in such a dire situation had already boosted my mental strength. ""I need you to listen to me, son. Where are you right now?""

""*In a house, in the basement.*"" He sobbed, quietly.

""Good."" I closed my eyes for a moment. I felt sick imagining what he may have already been through. ""How are you talking to me?""

""*I-I found an old phone in a box. I plugged it in.*""

*Smart boy*, I thought to myself. ""Okay, Max, can you tell me anything else about where you are? Where's the house? Do you know?""

""*It's...*"" He sniffled. ""*It's near the lake we-we went to last year.*"" 

Son of a bitch. North of Fresno - The Millerton Lake. There weren't many homes there. Many of them were private, secluded - The perfect place to hide. I needed to know where it was. There must have been something else - We'd driven down that area dozens of times through Max's life. Nothing had changed in recent days, I was sure of it, but I had to know. I just had to. This was one and only chance to save him.

""Max. I need you to stay calm down... Has anything happened to you? Are you hurt?""

""*N-N-No.*"" He sniffled. ""*But I heard... Heard the man talking on the phone, and... And...*"" There was a silence and he started crying again. ""*Someone else is coming to take me away.*"" He managed to choke, right before bursting into quiet cries again.

""Do you know when?"" 

""*I'm--.. I'm not sure. I don't know, daddy, please help.*"" He begged.

""What does the house look like, did you see?"" I asked. I was trying to hold it together, but his pleas were tearing me apart. I was having to hold back the sobbing, just as I'd seen many 911 operators doing on many regular calls they got. I had to disregard his sadness and emotion and work quick, just to see if I could get him back, safe in my arms. I had a sense of determination rattle my bones. Nothing could tear my mind away from this now.

""*It's... It's wooden, but, like... A sandy color, a-and... And there's a big tree next to it.*""

I stopped for a moment and thought to myself. A sandy wooden house, a tree outside. I recognized the description, like an artist would envision his next masterpiece. Suddenly it all came together - the twittering of birds, the blowing of the gentle breeze, the rustling of critters in the grass. It all came back to me, and it was then that the raging ocean in my heart went to one that was still and calm, with my destination now clear in view. I was positive I knew where he was.

My heartbeat slowly increased, though. Everything had built up to this - I'd not always done good in life, but it seemed I'd been granted a second chance. A part of me worried that I was going to wake up, and all of this be some amazing dream. I bit my bottom lip so that that I drew blood - The pain was real, the metallic taste was real, and this moment truly was happening. 

""Son..."" I sniffled, the tears finally breaking out once again. ""Daddy loves you. I'm going to get you out of there. I promise."" I said, and at last, I broke down. The floodgates opened. ""*I promise.*""

There was no response. Only crying.

""I need to hang up the phone now."" I whispered, shakily.

""*No, daddy.*"" He whimpered, suddenly. ""*Please don't. Please. Please don't leave me.*""

""I'm coming, son. I'm coming."" I sobbed, and as I listened to him beg, I ended the call. Right up to the moment the call cut off, I heard him crying, begging me to stay on the line. It once again broke me. The settled ocean within me was merely the calm before the storm, because now it was becoming violent once more.

Just like the moment I found out he was missing, time had frozen for me. Without a second to spare, I forced back the tears and dived out of the chair at my station. I ran. I ran right out of the office, with people chasing after me soon after. I'm going to assume a lot of them thought that I'd snapped, and I was going to go and end my life. For once, they couldn't have been more wrong about me. None of them could stop me from getting into my car - It was strange, really. This was a car that I hated, I had began hating it only a month after I bought it. That was only five years ago, but for some reason, my son thought the world of it. I didn't get why, but maybe he saw the better things in it.

And now I was speeding in that beat up piece of shit to try and rescue the boy, and with that, I'd get my life back.

[WP] You are a 911 dispatcher and only a little while after you get the job you get a call from your very own kidnapped son.,Midi149,"PART THREE.

600 Lakeview Road. It was like a light at the end of the dark tunnel, but I was yet to see if it was going to offer me anything but more suffering. The big oak tree out front, the wooden-paneled house that matched my son's description of 'sandy'. A single car was parked outside. This was a house on its own, in solitude. 

How did I know this was the one? Because this was the only house of that description on this whole road. Further down were bigger,  mansion-like houses, all very modern. Back the way I came were mainly lots of land for sale. It was almost as if I could sense my son was inside this house. What I did next was something I didn't even think about doing, and for a few seconds, I did feel an ounce of regret.

I put my foot down, and I drove straight through the wall. I connected with the area between the windows and the front door; the wood of the house split with ease, and the plastering and such on the inside of the house was no match for the shit-kicker of a car I drove. Sure, my car was without a doubt totaled, and as black smoke bellowed out of the hood and drifted out of the huge hole in the wall, I decided to take in the environment around me. At first my vision blurred, and the wind was knocked out of me as I hit the driver's wheel immediately after crashing through the wall. 

I knew from the pain that a couple of ribs were broken, but that didn't stop me from forcing myself out of the car. I looked around once more, and now, a man had emerged from the living room.

Tall, much taller than me. While I stood at 5ft 9"", this man was easily 6ft 3"". He was tall, yes, but that was not all. Bearded. Middle-aged. 

Was this the man that took my son?

""What the fuck?"" He snarled, and straight away he was making his way towards me. I didn't know what to say. I was silent, but I knew that this was not a fight I'd be able to win with my bare hands. He was taller than me, and generally had a much bigger build. This definitely looked like someone who would have no trouble snatching a 7-year-old from a public place. I knew that my son wouldn't have stood any chance when it came to trying to struggle.

So, naturally, I ran. I ran into the kitchen. I had to be careful here - this man was in a blind rage after I'd practically knocked his fucking house down. And worst of all, it was us, all alone. No one knew where I was, and there wasn't anyone that close by that would be able to save my sorry ass if I got too tangled up in this. It was all on me; the only advantage I had was my dedication to survive and get my boy back.

Before I could even look around for some sort of item to aid me in my fight, I was shoulder barged, right into my chest. I felt the air get pushed from my lungs once more, and the sharp pain of the broken ribs only worsened. This giant fucker literally carried me across the room and slammed me against the furthest wall. My back struck the mantle, which just added to my suffering. 

Soon, I was face to face with him. His forearm was strongly against my neck, and I was really struggling to move at this point.

""You crazy son of a bitch."" He whispered, his eyes full of rage. ""You better start explaining... Why in the fuck... You *crashed your fucking car into my house!*"" He screamed in my face. That was the moment even more regret kicked in - I felt like I'd doomed myself, but, I was done trying to be reasonable. I'd reached a point so low in life that the care for myself hadn't fully returned.

I let out a cough and shot him with a faint grin. ""Why don't you call the police?"" I choked. I knew he wouldn't - The look in his eyes said it all. There was a mix of panic and anger. He wasn't going to call the police, not a chance. Although I was scared, I was happy in an odd kind of way. I'd finally found the piece of shit that had ruined mine, Penny's, and our son's life.

I should have known straight away this man wasn't mentally stable - He'd already kidnapped a child, so how I didn't expect him to eventually smile back is beyond me. 

""Now where's the fun in that?"" He asked, his face so close to mine that I could smell what he'd had for breakfast this morning. He spun me around, my arms and legs flailing in the air, and released me - I went flying towards the door and hit the ground with a thud, chest-first. I let out a breathless cry of pain, but, my gut told me to run once more. The adrenaline coursed through my veins, and I used all the power I had to scramble to my feet.

Back through the house I ran. It was a dull house on the inside, not matching the character it held on the exterior. I didn't want to notice all these little details at that exact moment, but funnily enough, I did. The house was bland. Depressing.

I dived over the crumpled hood of my car and hit the floor immediately after; thankfully, I landed on my side, and avoided that harsh amount of pain as I rolled over and got back up. It was stupid of me to try and jump over. I should have just stepped over it, but I was beginning to panic. By the time I'd got through to the living room, he already had me by the collar of my shirt. I couldn't make a sound when I felt his first sink into my kidneys a few times over. 

I was pushed forward yet again, promptly landing on top of the coffee table that was set out in the living room. I landed on the corner, and the glass surface shattered with ease as my weight collided with it. The wooden frame flipped up onto its side, and I was left lying there in glass, and what looked like blood. I was in a lot of pain already, and now my arms were cut to pieces - that only got worse as I dragged myself through the shards. 

I wasn't ready to die. I couldn't die. Max still needed me. I looked at the open fireplace right beside me - it had been a long, long time since it had been lit, evidently. The tools were on a stand right by the fireguard. I had no choice - with a shaking, bloody hand I reached out and knocked it over; the metal tools hit the wooden ground with a clank, and I grabbed the curved fire poker by the handle. 

It was agony, but I quickly flipped my body over atop the glass; I saw the behemoth of a man staring down upon me, deadly intent now filling his eyes. And I took a swing.

I never would have hit his face, his chest, or even his stomach, but I didn't struggle to strike him right on the side of his knee. The poker was sharp enough to pierce the skin and dig between the flesh and the kneecap. The man was only in shorts and a t-shirt, as could be expected for someone who lived in California.

When he let out that blood-curdling scream of pain, I felt sick. As his knee began to leak blood rapidly, I started to become unsure of what blood was mine and what was his. I wanted to kill him. I wanted to stand there and watch the life flood from his body.

But no.

I brought myself to my feet and grabbed a large log from beside the fire. I could have grabbed the glass, and I could have just stabbed him, but something held me back from doing that.

I was a father, yes, but I'd never been a killer.

All of my emotion fueled my next swing, and the log hit him straight around the side of the face. He'd already dropped to his knee in sheer pain. It all happened so quick - I heard his jaw near enough snap, I saw blood and teeth fly from between his lips, and I watched the consciousness slip from his eyes. He laid on the floor, out cold, and severely injured. He wasn't the only one, though. I was in worse shape than I'd realized.

In all of that my face had also been cut, but not badly. My ribs were broken and one of my kidneys hurt one fucking lot more than the other. But I was alive. I was surprised that I was. I'd been sloppy when it came to getting here, but this psychotic prick was out, and I had a window to go and get my son. The man who took him wouldn't exactly be running after me, even if he did wake up.

I ran about until I discovered a door to the basement. Locked. But I didn't care. I kicked at it over and over until the wood around the lock splintered; I heard him crying, I could hear the fear in his sobs.

""Max?!"" I cried out.

There was silence for a moment, but at the bottom of the stairs, I saw him. He'd lost a lot of weight, he was pale, dirty, covered in dust. But he was okay. 

""Daddy!"" He sobbed, but his voice held nothing but joy. I couldn't set one foot forward before he darted up the stairs. I crouched as he reached me, and straight away he fell into my arms; his sobs got even louder and his cries even heavier, and I finally broke down myself. 

But when I held him close, I felt 15 years younger. I felt as if I'd been brought back from the dead. I felt like I'd been given the second chance from fate. I still had a lot of questions that needed to be answered. Who was coming to take him away? What exactly did this man want with my son? Why was someone else going to be taking him away?

""Daddy's here."" I whispered to him - It was the most comfort I could offer. I felt dizzy, and the sight of my own blood made me feel lightheaded, but I needed to stay with it. For him.

When I answered that 911 call, I thought my luck had never been higher.

I was no longer frozen in time, but I was unaware of what I may have landed myself in. I wasn't thinking about that, though. I was thinking about how lucky I was to have him back - He wasn't in the best shape, but he wasn't hurt, and that's all I cared about. 

I forgot all about the man in the living room. Now, it was only me and my boy. For a moment, I could have sworn the world had stopped spinning just so we could have that time together right there and then. 

Just so we could finally accept that he was finally back with me.

And just so I could tell myself that I'd never let that change again.",DrTrollinski

I could hear some grumbling on the other side of the phone. The connection was shotty and there was a lot of background noise. Nothing out of the ordinary of course. No one ever bothered to call in a quiet room.

""Wha-? Technical support? Whatever I need your help.""

Just ask then instead of saying you need help. Why else would you be calling? ""Alright sir, but may I first ask your name?""

""Uh...."" The voice on the other end seemed to set down the phone as it made a loud bang in my ear piece. I winced from the surprise sound but didn't make a noise. Whoever was on the other side of the receiver seemed to be rummaging through some papers. ""Yes... my name is Yadon H. W. Habakkuk."" 

Huh... Must be Jewish. ""Alright thank you Mr. Habakkuk. Now what seems to be the problem?""

""I want to know why you think the human race should exist."" 

What? Why are you calling a technical support line for an answer to that?! ""I'm sorry sir?""

""It's not a hard question to understand. Why do you think they should exist?""

""Sir this is a technical help line. I'm afraid I can not help you with philosophical questions such as this..."" There is always that one weirdo who uses these lines to troll the people trying their best just to get through the day. The quicker I can get done with this call, the better. ""...Do you have any concerns relating to your computer or is that all for today?""

""Gregory do not make me damn you! Just answer the question!""

Yikes this guy sounds mad. ""Sir, if I may ask, why do you believe they shouldn't exist?"" 

The line went quiet for a moment. He seemed to be thinking.

""Well, all they do is hurt and kill one another instead of showing love and kindness. Why should they exist if they only bring paid to others?""

Oh for the love of God not this argument again. ""Well sir, I believe you might be looking at things the wrong way. Sure there are humans who are cruel and evil. That's just the nature of the human condition. However, there are plenty more who do great things. Kindness and love is shared with others in the world every day. You just need to look past the overblown minority of bad things to see it.""

""Well... I guess I'll keep my promise after all. Thank you for your help Gregory, I'm sure you will get out of this dead end job and fulfill your dreams soon enough."" 

""Excuse me sir-?"" But before I could finish, he hung up. What an odd fellow.

“The glass keeps it away, for it cannot climb it, son.” Answered an old man.

“But why is the world brown?”

“Let me tell you”

As many a story of the past, this one starts with a meteor shower.

It was in my youth, when we were on an annual trip to explore the small islands with my friends. On our first night, we all drank, had fun and as the moon began to set we looked to the skies and saw the meteor shower. Many dosed off watching it and even I was transfixed, but then something pulled me out of it. Of all the streaks of light I saw that night, there was something weird about that one - it didn’t fade in an instant, but grew stronger. The sky lit up as if the Sun was starting to rise, but I knew that was not the case. It went right over us and into the sea. The rumble after it had passed waked many but weeks later I found out that I had been the only one to actually see it.

Rest of the trip went as planned - some games, dancing, etc. And as we waited for the boat to pick us up, we noticed a brownish spot in the water and thought it was just algae.

Days passed and news reports started coming in of a massive algal bloom. A week later first fish were caught that had scales covered with the brown “algae”. That was the beginning of the Blight as they started to call it.

It quickly spread to the oceans, infusing itself with everything it came in contact with. The skin of the fishermen who caught the first affected fish turned brown and mossy spreading out from their hands.

Everything touched by it became it. It covered the beaches and slowly creeped forward. Fire helped hold it back from some places, but for how can you stop something that is approaching from everywhere and hides in the water. People panicked and thus helped spread it even faster.

The brightest minds of the day worked without pause to find a way to halt the spread, but only two things were certain - it couldn’t climb glass and it could be incinerated. And so the world took up arms together, killed every flying creature they could find to stop it spreading through air and built themselves shelters inside basically huge glass bowls.

Some survived, some didn’t have enough to sustain them and died, but left their shelters intact for anyone to find. Islands of color in a sea of brown.

The man waits for a moment.

“And now only one shelter remains inhabited, son, the one you are currently gazing at.”

“But will they live on, father, or are they also going to dissappear?”

“Only time will tell”

"[WP] Physicists finally complete the Theory of Everything, uniting the quantum world with general relativity. However, the master equation hints at something greater and higher than science itself.",Neoking,"""So they were right,"" one of the physicists remarked.

""Who were right?"" His research partner said as he walked over to look at the stack of papers that the physicist was reading.

""The String Theorists, sort of.""

""Sort of?""

""There's more than four dimensions, but they aren't 'curled up' and hidden from view. Objects can exist in these higher dimensions."" 

""Oh my."" The research partner leaned in closer, trying to read what the physicist wrote.

""Oh my what?"" Frank always jokingly says that whenever someone says ""oh my"" without adding anything.

""God."" He stared directly into the eyes of the physicist.

""John, You can't be serious. There isn't enough evidence to definitively prove that God exists.""

Frank isn't an atheist, but he follows the scientific method, so he knows that he can't just make such a bold claim.

""Okay, maybe not. But, you saw that this equation needs more than 4 dimensions, and some have to be spacial. It's right there, in...whatever you wrote.  This means that there is the possibility that there could be higher dimensional structures. Tesseracts, hyperspheres, you name 'em. Maybe, just maybe, human souls exist in that space.""

John is blown away by the discovery of his coworker, his mind is still racing, thinking of everything that could be real.

""Okay, John. If we could test it, then we can see. Also looking at this, I can see the energies required for access to these dimensions. The problem is, it's larger than any particle accelerator in the world. We would need something even larger than the LHC.""

""Okay, so we publish this paper and then we—""

The other unfortunate bastards had collapsed, Dave was literally covered in single malt bruichladdich whisky which I may have had a hand in.

There was a loud knock at the door, and it took me a second to realise that this was, in fact, not my house. It didn't look quite right. 

HELLO? OPEN UP.

I staggered over to the door, looking through the peep hole... is that what it's called? or is it just a spy hole? Or... ""Is it called a peer hole or a spy hole? This hole in the door thing?"" I mused aloud.

IT DOESN'T MATTER. GIVE ME BACK MY THINGS.

""Woah woah woah pal, I dinnea give tae shits about who the fuck you think you are, ain't nobody asking me to do things this early in the morning. And just who the fuck are you anyway, tall dark and hooded?""

OPEN UP.

""Fine you bastard, except I don't have the keys, and don't know where they are."" The figure hummed. 

UNDER THE FLOWER POT BY YOUR FEET.

I lifted the pot I hadn't noticed before. There was a small key, with a tiny skull at the base, I put it into the lock, but before I could even make contact, the door slid open.  The figure behind it had a skull for a face and bones for fingers.

""I must be really, really hungover."" 

HAS ANYBODY EVERY TOLD YOU THAT YOU LOOK LIKE GEORGE MICHEAL? 

""Fuck you, take your damm keys and riddle me this, how did I even get here?"" I sighed, gently pacing back to where Dave was stinking out, and gently prodding him with his foot but he was out cold.

WELL, YOU ALL GOT REALLY DRUNK. AND YOU SORT OF, DIED. OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE ALLOWED TO CHALLENGE ME TO A GAME FOR YOUR SOUL. WE STARTED TO PLAY CHESS, BUT SOMEHOW YOU MANAGED TO BEAT ME. SO THEN WE PLAYED ANOTHER GAME, YOUR SOUL IN EXCHANGE FOR MY SCYTHE AND KEY. 

""Another game of chess?"" I cringed, chess was a bitch of a game to play. So much memorisation. 

WORSE. MARIO PARTY.

""I have never felt so sorry for anything in my whole life."" I bowed deeply for the figure. Mario Party ended friendship, I shouldn't have done that to Death.


YES, YOU'RE GOING STRAIGHT TO HELL IN LATER LIFE. CAN I GET MY SHIT BACK NOW? I'M LATE FOR FINISHING OFF SOME OLD MEMBER OF THE LABOUR PARTY.

""Fine, here."" I passed him the key, then carefully extracting the scythe from the drunk, swung it directly at Death. It split his skull and he collapsed to the ground with a thud. I had freed the world of death with a raging hangover created by an overindulgence of fucking fantastic whisky.

All culminating in the experience I was about to enjoy. As I lifted the burger to take a large sumptuous bite, an enormous dollop of sauce slipped from the clutches of the bun and exploded across my bulging khaki pants. The shock of the incident forced me to reel and get up, I staggered back from the realisation of what had just happened. Desperately I fled across the room searching, searching, but not a napkin in sight. ""GOD DAMNIT!"" I cried, ""I should have gone to Mcdonalds""

It was at this moment that Mcdonalds Man burst into the building, smashing through the wall sending a shower of bricks and mortar into the crowd of hungry customers. Blood was everywhere, the collateral damage was untold. A brick had smashed one woman in the face sending a mess of teeth and hair flying across the room, another had taken a mans arm clean off. The staff ran to flee the scene, burger fat catching alight on the grill. Smoke &amp; the screams of the mortally wounded civilians filled the air.

""Fear not!"" bellowed Mcdonalds Man, ""Freedom, has arrived!"" 
He swept across the hall stepping over the bodies of women &amp; children, his red cape flowing with the insignia of Wal-Mart, Exxon &amp; Verizon. 

With one fell swoop he whiped the dollop of sauce clean off my khakis without so much as a grease stain left behind. ""No thanks needed"" he said, before hopping back aboard his lifted chevy truck emblazoned with flags saying ""Support the 2nd"" and ""Hilary for Prison""

The best rescue I’ve ever had!


My husband and I first met Bill at a Sbarro’s in Penn Station. We’d arrived in New York by train only minutes earlier, just before the roof was torn from the building. Our first trip to the US and wouldn’t you know it – alien invasion. So while our fellow passengers proceeded to run aimlessly in circles while screaming, we decided to try one of the city’s famous slices of pizza. We later learned that there is better pizza to be had, by the way, but we enjoyed it just fine. 

Seating was limited due to mass destruction, so the only remaining table we found was placed directly in front of a Hudson News store being robbed at gun point (our first *real* American gun fight!). I tried to capture the moment, but my camera view was obscured by a man wider than he was tall. It was Bill, the Superhero. Dressed predictably with only one overall strap buttoned and a cowboy hat covering his mullet, Bill the Superhero moved surprisingly well for such an obese person. The mere sight of him caused the gunman to flee, so I was unfortunately unable to take a picture. I was complaining of this to my husband, when Bill called out to us from his monster truck. Charmingly waving his sawed off shotgun, he invited us into the pickup. What a superhero! Honestly, my husband and I have mostly avoided using superheroes, as we generally prefer police, but we were on vacation so we figured, why not? We raced to the car while carefully avoiding a crazed woman beating an Auto Trader newspaper stand with her high-heeled shoe in the process. Bill didn’t wait for the door to fully close before driving away, hastening us up the steps and onto 34th street. He deftly weaved us through 7th Avenue traffic until we came to a screeching halt at 42nd St., just a block from Times Square! As we parted ways, the superhero handed us each our own Glock 22 and directed us to the nearest McDonald’s where he promised we’d be safe, and of course we were.  

Should you ever find yourself caught up in an alien invasion/riot, I highly recommend the superior saving skills of Bill the Superhero. Thanks, Bill!

[WP] An actual giant monster shows up and attacks New York City. What makes it a little weird though is that the monster looks EXACTLY like Godzilla.,GHSRetro,"The first thing most people did when they heard the news was make comparisons to Godzilla. It was inevitable, after all, they looked pretty much identical, and for the most part, they did the same stuff. 

The U.S Government managed to lure it back into the ocean, and NATO is leading a massive  search of the Atlantic Ocean using sonar and satellite imagery.

People started moving away from the coast and began flocking to the Midwest. The farther away from the ocean they were, the better.

Coast Guard funding went through the roof. The people who, for whatever reason, could not move away from the coast would see aircraft carriers and helicopters all day, everyday.

Meanwhile, the Midwest flourished with the wave of new people. Cities like Chicago and Detroit boomed in population.

Then, when no one expected it, a massive three headed dragon rose from the British Channel and devastated London, Glasgow, and many other cities before it was left. People started comparing it to King Ghidorah, another monster from the Godzilla franchise.

That's when I, and all the other people on the planet, realized that what happened in New York was not going to be an isolated incident. More monsters, whom we thought were just film monsters are suddenly appearing in real life. And we couldn't stop it.

The kids are arguing in the back, and the wife is trying to settle it. It's not a violent argument, just some playful ribbing, with plenty of laughter mixed in. I love moments like this, driving home after a day of fun. I'm almost surprised the little monsters aren't unconscious, after running around all day. Ahh well, what can you do?


T-0:04

The cars up ahead are kind of swerving. Maybe there's some roadwork being done in the median? I'm not sure, but I'll let off the gas just in case. Wait to see what this truck in front of me does


T-0:03

The truck is signalling he wants to get over. I'll flick mine on to do the same


T-0:02

Some jackass sped up next to me, then let the truck over. What the hell, man? The wife has shushed the kids and is spotting for me now


T-0:01

Oh shit. I don't have time to swerve without hitting the passenger side against someone else. He's coming right at me! Fuck, hit the brakes!


T-0:00

It didn't sound like I thought it would. The movies always make it seem like a series of metallic crunches. What I heard was all blurred into one noise. In a quick cacophony, I caught plastic cracking, bolts snapping, and glass shattering. An explosive pop as the airbags went off, then ringing. By this point, I hadn't felt anything besides my sudden attempt to stop. My vision was overwhelmed in a blur of motion. But all that stopped.


T+0:01

When the airbag caught me in the face, I felt my nose break. I also felt that it wasn't enough, as the fabric barrier didn't seize my momentum at all. I couldn't hear anything at this point, besides a constant ringing. With my eyes shut tight, all I could do was go along for the ride. The car had gone into a spin, that much was clear. The arm I'd stuck out in a pitiful attempt to hold back my wife was flailing wildly. My legs were bouncing around the footwell.


T+0:02

I felt it. It was quick, oddly painless, but I felt it. It was similar to the feel of dragging nails across a chalkboard, only internal. After the airbag failed, my head continued forward, and down, until I hit the bottom of the steering wheel. In that moment, I felt an internal slip that would have sent chills down my spine, if I could feel anything down there anymore.


T+0:03

I bounced back semi-upright in my seat. It seems the car has stopped spinning, as has my head. My ears are still ringing, so I open my eyes in an attempt to survey the carnage. For now, my vision is still spinning too fast to evaluate anything.


T+0:04

My eyes have stopped spinning in their sockets. Looking around as best I can, I see we're sitting backwards in our lane, but all traffic is stopped. I try to look over at my wife, but my neck doesn't want to cooperate. Below my neck, everything is tingling, and not responding. That's not good. The ringing in my ears is fading, though. 


T+0:05

I hear crying from the backseat. Two voices. That's good. Well, not good, but better than the alternative, I suppose. I also hear pained groaning coming from the passenger seat. God I hope she's okay. Someone's going to have to take care of the kids. People are starting to get out of their cars to come look. Hopefully someone will call 911 for my family. 


T+0:06

She's starting to become coherent. I hear her trying to ask the kids if they're okay. Through their tears, I can hear them sobbing about their pains. Joseph says his leg hurts, and Sarah says her ears hurt. They seem okay. They'll need to see a doctor though. I'm praying they get an ambulance here soon. 


T+0:07

I think she's turned her attention to me, but it's hard to hear. The sound of blood rushing through my ears is quickly overtaking any other. I'm starting to detect my heartbeat mixed in. *Bump^bump* *Bump^bump* 


T+0:08

I'm trying to form words, but now I'm realizing that it's actually gotten really hard to breath. When I try to inhale, it tingles all the way down my throat. Exhaling feels the same, and I feel like I have no control over it. My breaths have been shallow, nowhere near enough to speak with. Her voice is getting frantic. I can barely hear it over the pounding. *Bump^bump* *Bump^bump* 


T+0:09

My head rolled a little, so I can see her frantically shaking my shoulder, and I can vaguely make out her voice screaming out my name. I'm mentally etching every detail of her face to memory. Even now, in her terrified state with tears streaming, I can still remember how beautiful she is to me. I can barely feel tears welling up in my eyes as well. Words still refuse to pass through my lips. *Bump^bump* 


T+0:10

My eyelids have gotten so heavy. They feel like lead bricks. I don't think it matters, though, because even with my eyes open, everything is going dark. I give my wife one final lookover, then let my lids fall. There is no sound now, except the rushing of blood and the ever slowing pounding. I always figured a car crash would be more painful than this. Well, I suppose it will be, for them. I hope the kids are old enough to remember me. I hope she's able to take care of them without me. I just wish I could tell them all I loved the one last time. *Bump^bump*

[WP] You've just been in a head-on collision. Explain every detail from moment of impact to complete stop.,Godwin89,"First Impact.

I can only watch the hood begin to fold upwards; the truck's grille folding inward and down, due to the height difference. We caught each other at a slight angle, pulling at least 45 both ways. We're a little to his left, he's a little to *our* left. The frames on both our vehicles begin to give, and the front windshields on both of them begin to give in place. The airbags deploy like clockwork, the blasts seemingly concussive in the small space of the interior. The front end collapses more still, and inertia really sets in.

Second impact.

The dashboard shudders, and we hit the bags headlong. The pressure is immense, the air cushion may as well be a Mike Tyson level uppercut. Something is being pushed back below us. It's the firewall; the engine block and drivetrain have been forced back and down, and the area below our ankles is starting to give.

On the initial rebound from the airbags, I incoherently notice something odd: The idiot who hit us is on his way out, *literally*. His face had caked a red smear on his windscreen, and his entire body then made a hasty, albeit messy, flight from his seat. I could only note his limp features, as he bounced off our devastated front end head-first; his body contorting wrongly as it suddenly traveled in our direction now, opposite from which it came. His truck, while heavier, had rotted through at the frame. The cab had caved, the bed arcing forward and up from behind to finish the job.

The airbags had softened now, but we had rebounded back by then. The steering column speared me, and the edges of the dashboard wasn't much better. The seatbelt kept me reeled in though, and as a result, I didn't pinball off the interior nearly as much as my body should have. Glass flew everywhere, and the cars began to bounce apart in separate angles to the road. The front end comes to pieces as the car spins.

Third impact.

My organs have finally taken a shock from the journey. See it's not the speed that kills you. It's the sudden stop that does the deed. Your organs hit the inside of your body, after your body hits something else. I can feel mine moving around, but it's too hard to tell what they're doing. The car hobbles backwards into a ditch just off the pavement.

Steel, aluminum, glass, plastic, and numerous chemicals are strewn everywhere; the sun causing it all to gleam in various hues like some macabre kaleidoscope. Amongst the debris, I manage to locate the mangled spectacle that used to be the other driver. He's laying wrong, his arms and legs aren't where they should be normally. I wonder if he's alive, but the pool of blood says otherwise.

And then silence. Horrible, horrible silence. It's enveloping, it's final, it's all there is anymore.

This couldn’t be good.

Dum, dum dum, dum dum, dum.

Each sound made me feel increasingly upset. Today, would be a horrible day. The music continued.

“Oh lord. It’s a funeral march” I accidentally said out loud. “It’s horribly upsetting. What in god’s name is going to happen today?”

I looked out the window and saw a motorcade driving down my street. I lived in a small apartment in Washington, DC.

“Is there something I’m missing? Why is there a motorcade?” I pondered.

I decided to follow the motorcade down it’s path. It went on for a few miles, then reached its stop. Seven men in suits walked out of one of the cars. They walked into a building, and shut the door behind them.

“I shouldn’t follow them in there.” I thought. “Who knows why they’re here.”

After waiting for a few more minutes for anything else to happen, I started my way back to my apartment. Suddenly, I heard a loud voice throughout the area.

“How could I forget? It’s inauguration day!” I suddenly realized. “But why the funeral music?”

I heard the voice again, this time clearly.

One day you wake up to the most dire funeral March you've ever heard.",Graynard,"I had just moved into my new house.  I was excited, a little nervous being in a new town, but overall content for the first time in a while.  Then I awoke one morning to the pipes, the horns, and the drums. The music had always been with me.  It had never been something I wanted, but I lived with it.  

Each morning, I would hear a song begin.  Not on any stereo or anything of the like, but in my mind. The difficulty was that wether the omen the music played for was good or bad, I had the curse of waking up everyday and KNOWING exactly how my day would be.  Most days that started with gloomy music I would force myself out of bed, but this time was different.  The music this morning was calling for an end, a death.  I knew in my heart it would be something painfully final.  An event I would never recover from...

At first, I decided I would simply not get up.  If I was going to die, or something so terrible was going to happen, I might as well just let it happen at peace.  Sadly peace was something the music had always robbed me of.  The anxiety was building inside my chest, growing like a forest fire.  The drums were rattling off in unison.  The horns were blaring.  I threw the sheets off of myself and jumped out of bed.

I needed something to distract myself.  I thought maybe if I could put something on the television and turn the volume up loud enough, it might just drown everything out.  I hadn't yet set up my TV or my wireless, so I picked up my phone and dialed in the number for Comcast.",TheCockKnight
"[WP] You have a secret power: every day when you wake up, you can tell what kind of day it will be based on the soundtrack being played in your head. One day you wake up to the most dire funeral March you've ever heard.",Graynard,"It's been a few years since it happened.

I used to hear it every morning. At first I wasn't even old enough to think that it might be something that was abnormal, or unique to me. I just accepted it as a fact of life. I would wake up, and there it would be; the music. Most days it was just a simple, rhythmic beat with a low undertone of harmonies. On those days, nothing really noteworthy seemed to happen. Other days there would be a coarse, dissonant strike in with the droning melody. That was my warning that something wasn't going to go my way. My favorite days were those that started out with beautiful, triumphant overtures, and grand symphonic accompaniment. Those were the best days; Christmas, my Birthday, the last day of the school year. Eventually I started to understand that I was alone in hearing this music, and I kept it a secret. I would hear the tune of the day, and I would feel a little better prepared for what was about to occur, but I never heard anything so deeply mournful as the music I heard on that fateful February morning.

It was like a knife through my heart. The music penetrated my soul in ways I thought no mere sound could ever do. I couldn't help myself but to weep. My mother came into my bedroom and asked what was the matter. I couldn't even form words. I just sobbed uncontrollably. It took me a few minutes, but eventually I became accustomed to the terrible sound of the woeful dirge. My mother held me for a while, but eventually reality set in, and I knew I had to go about my day. I got dressed, still feeling the dull melancholy of an emotional hangover. It was as if I had dreamt the worst nightmare ever dreamt, and my mind simply refused to let go of the emotions it had evoked in me. School was out for the weekend, so I went outside and got in my truck to start my day's work delivering newspapers.

I drove past the local recreation club and saw my ex-girlfriend through the window with her new boyfriend. At first I thought that was what the music was about, but it just didn't seem to fit. I knew it had to be worse than that. I drove on. I passed the tavern, and I knew that my father was most likely already there, getting drunk on whiskey with all of his friends. I thought maybe something would happen to him today, maybe that was it, but no, if he died that very day, I don't think I would've been all that sad. We didn't have the greatest relationship when I was a teenager. There was going to be a football game later that night. I wasn't all that into the game, but since I was a member of the marching band, I would have to be there. I thought maybe we would lose the game, or somebody would get injured somehow. None of it really added up to the level of emotion I knew was in store for me that day, but then I had a flash of insight. The rain!

We'd been having so much rain lately that people had been talking about a possible flood for days. If that happened there was a huge potential for loss of crops, property, even life. That had to be it. I couldn't wait to find out if my theory was true, so I drove up to the levee to check the water level before picking up my papers for delivery. When I got there I saw that the creek was actually lower than it had been the week before. I was relieved somewhat, but still couldn't shake the feeling that something terrible was in store. I drove back into town and parked out in front of the old Christian book store. Old Tom Miller was in there yelling about how his old radio was on the fritz again. I walked on by, stopping only to pick up a flower from the windowsill. It was a pink carnation for my mother. She had been so sweet to me that morning, I wanted to pay her back.

I picked up the bundle of papers for my delivery and I immediately saw the headline. I can't remember if I cried when I read about it, but I imagine I had already run out of tears. It was terrible news. The worst I'd ever read. Not one, or two, but *three* of the greatest rock and roll artists of our time had all been killed in a tragic plane crash. I'll never forget that date, February 3rd, 1959, because for me that really was the day the music died.",KommieZombic
"[WP] You have a secret power: every day when you wake up, you can tell what kind of day it will be based on the soundtrack being played in your head. One day you wake up to the most dire funeral March you've ever heard.",Graynard,"At the very core of human nature is the inherent desire for excitement, the thrill of the unknown experiences that await each of us. Nobody jumps out of bed every morning because they simply can't wait to get to work. The day begins because there is a glimmer of something more, the shred of hope that maybe that day will become something special and extraordinary. Perhaps you'll meet your future wife, or your brother will have his child and name him in your honor, or you'll get a promotion and leave your hometown for bigger and better things. This universal drive is one that defines us all as humans, and one that makes me something different entirely.

Yes, it is true that I have skin. I bleed. I cry. I laughed. I loved. But whereas a human, like you, opens his eyes each day to step out into the unknown with blind excitement, I instead awake to be haunted by my greatest fear. Imagine that the sun rises and brings with it a melody you've never heard before. It's delicate, airy, soft, and above all, beautiful. The music fills you with such warmth and serenity, and makes you feel completely at peace in a world which seldom experiences it. Then, you get up and live a day of complete joy, filled with pleasant surprises and memorable events which make you feel entirely glad to be alive. 

This is how I wake up every day.

I know what you're thinking. You're wondering what makes experiencing such a thing every morning awful. You'd give anything to wake up like that, to know exactly what the day has in store for you. But I promise you, you don't, because the vast majority of days begin completely different. Most of the time, I wake up and hear bland, emotionless music and live a day of identical normality. You don't realize just how many of your days are useless until you live like me, when your mind is filled with directionless, inharmonious noise for four weeks straight, bringing with it a month of nothingness. This is how we all live, but most of us never realize it - a string of repetitiveness broken only by the rare and fleeting day of intermittent excitement. Only there is no such excitement for me, because I have been robbed of the virtue you all share: the ability to be surprised by life. The notes I hear in my head every morning reveal to me my entire day. Unlike you, I can do nothing to control any aspect of my existence.

I haven't always felt like this. I used to embrace the music and everything it gave to me. But that was years ago, before the day in which I awoke to something I had never heard: death.

I was fourteen. It was nearing the end of December, and the days were shrinking to accommodate the growing nights of winter, engulfing the world in darkness. I awoke at 8 a.m., happy to be on Christmas break and free from school; but with the blackness of the morning came something far darker. I could feel it all throughout my body, in my bones, under my skin, taking over my mind with its poison. It began quietly, first as a soft, ambiguous drone, but it slowly became more complicated and crescendoed until it reached a deafening cacophony of madness and horror which consumed my every faculty. Impossibly low, woefully somber, dissonant chords struck my every nerve and filled my being with despair. Death was speaking, and I was the only one in the world who could hear him.

When the music had passed, I could do nothing but lie in bed. I had heard music every morning for my entire life, but never had it taken such a horrific form. I was terrified, and my mind began to race, to think up every scenario it could which might have resulted in this symphony of death which now haunted me. Would my parents get divorced? Would my brother get into an accident? Would a natural disaster destroy my home? 

Would I die that day?   

I shook these notions from my mind, as it would do nothing beneficial to dwell on them. Instead, I began to think of ways that I could prevent whatever awaited me. After intense deliberation, I decided that I could prevent my fate by staying in bed all day. I told my mother I was sick and not to bother me while I rested in my room. She seemed worried, but complied, and I locked my door to keep death away. I realize now that this was a childless, naive thought. The music controls me. I cannot change it, I cannot affect it, nothing I do will stop the premonition from coming true. I am, and always will be, its slave, and this was only the beginning of my imprisonment. 

My father left for work and kissed his wife goodbye. My brother drove his car to meet his friends as I prayed he wouldn't crash. My mother knocked on my door every few hours to check on me and to bring me food and water, but each time I yelled for her to leave me alone. The world and everyone I loved needed to stay as far away from me as possible, as I could do nothing but bring them pain. If I alone could hear the music, then maybe it could only affect me, and in that way, i could save them. 

Many agonizing hours passed. Eventually, my mother stopped checking on me. I stayed in darkness in the shelter of my room for as long as I could, staring at shadows and being afraid to move a single muscle - but I simply couldn't hold it any longer. I opened my door carefully, and walked slowly, cautiously, down the stairs and to the restroom. Once I was relieved, I began to walk back to my room, but something in the corner of my eye caught my attention. Around the corner of the hallway, I could see my mother's motionless feet, barely visible but unmistakable. Fear began to consume me, and I ran to the end of the hallway as fast as I could. I turned the corner and saw exactly what I had expected. 

I fell to the ground and sobbed uncontrollably over her body. If I hadn't been in my room, I would have seen what had happened, and I could have called an ambulance and saved her life. My own ignorance killed the person I loved most in the world, and I hated myself for it. I cried and hit myself and cursed and screamed until my throat hurt and my body trembled in pain. I wanted more of it. I wanted to feel as much pain as I had caused to my mother, and I wanted it to come all at once. 

But then I realized I wasn't to blame. It was the music. That day, it had stripped me of my humanity and had killed my mother out of spite. The music was death and I was but its mortal instrument, a brainless weapon to be used in every sinister way imaginable on whomever it desired. In this way, I have never truly lived a day in all of my existence. Because of the music, I am not human, and after that day, my mother wasn't either. ",_jizanthapus_

"[WP] People who hurt you, physically or emotionally, leave tangible marks on your soul. You awake in the afterlife with large parts of yourself missing.",LuciaLux,"Each living body has a soul that shines greatly. When we are first born, our souls are like suns that are supposed to brighten the lives of those around us. If we die young, say right out of the womb, our souls transcend into the sky and another sun is put alight. The longer we live without knowing pain, our soul shines brighter, and so a bigger sun will appear once that soul's abode dies. The problem with this, is that so many of us in the past and present have been hurt so much, that our sky is mostly darkness at night. These love-dessicated suns have downgraded into stars with dark mass around them.

It isn't always lonely for these stars. If they had a close relationship with their sibling, they would form a constellation. Lovers sometimes become one in this galactic afterlife aswell, by combining their souls into a megasun, or just a large star, it depends on how they were as people when they were alive. 

But sometimes, not everyone is as giving or caring as the next person. There are people who wanted it all, and stopped at nothing to get their desires or lusts fulfilled. If they lived simply to fulfill their needs while trying not to hurt anyone, they were simply reincarnated into an empty space. However, if they lived solely to hurt others they would turn into a black hole. For example: the man whom lived without regulating their morals, was simply empty space. The dealer who ran around playgrounds looking for people to profit off of, would be the blackhole whom stole a kid's light of their soul. 

After a certain amount of time, people who became simply darkness get a shot at life again, if they want. They are reincarnated through multiple different levels of species before human though. Some are reborn as grass, then ladybugs, and their new abode continues to grow larger into all different kinds of animals until they have reached becoming a human. Of course, they can always be reborn as one animal forever, but only if they die the same within the same night another is born. It just adds another connection of death to rebirth. Sadly, there are people who will get lazy and not want to continue living and dying until they become human again. They simply become dark matter in the night sky again. 

It's kind of a nice way of thinking about the afterlife-- by tying them to see the stars we see everynight. I like to think that's what they mean when someone says ""(insert cherished one) is  looking down on me,"" as if the graves we are buried in don't confine our soul's wish to do good. But something really troubles me... if you notice the ratio of stars to darkness, you will obviously notice there's more darkness. Does that mean the world is full of evil than it is of light?

"[WP] People who hurt you, physically or emotionally, leave tangible marks on your soul. You awake in the afterlife with large parts of yourself missing.",LuciaLux,"Noise music. That's what they called the whine of a red Fender Stratocaster with the humbuckers ripped off and reattached like spikes on a weapon. The sound was channeled through a loop, a stereo-chorus, and a fuzz box; it was pushed through a half-broken Orange amp, into the plugged ears of teenage angst. Keyboards revving like a motorcycle drove the audience into a frenzy. Drums smashing like waves on a burning mountain erupted sound into the minds of the youth. A siren spoke into the microphone a cacophony of rude phrases while swirling her jet black hair; there were no sailors here to entice with song. Three hundred dollars for a fifty minute set, five percent of the tabs from the front of the house. Two hours of packing and unpacking gear. One mosh pit with thirty-three black eyes and ten bruised chests. Fifteen alcoholic drinks. Three bong hits. Ten hits of cocaine. One hit of PCP. Three girls, faceless, no wings.

Just another night. Just noise music.

This morning there was no ringing in this siren's ears. My guitar was gone from my room. The walls here are pale gray, an empty set. I miss my old room, where the wallpaper was a flower arrangement, pealing off in places and covered in posters of metal bands. I'm here because I ran away from home. I used to live with my dad, a southern racist bastard who still went to church on Sundays and Wednesdays. He used to beat me and my mom. My mom was the one who decorated my old room with the flower wallpaper. She left when I was really young; I used to remember her face, but I can't remember anymore. My memories are pealing off, just like my mom's flower wallpaper.

I fucked three girls last night and brought them home. Where did they go?

I stumbled through my room and reached for the door. The door didn't open. For some reason, my left arm was missing. A glance at the mirror showed black fingers of lightning emanating from where my arm once was. I screamed, but no sound came out. I was voiceless.

I toppled over back onto the bed. I've heard of bad trips but never had one myself. It was the PCP, for sure. I just need to go back to sleep; I'll sleep it off.

***

The three girls cooed over me and caressed my chest. They began to touch me, kiss me. I pushed them off and sat up in a sweat. This time I was awake and sober. But my arm was still gone, my voice, still empty. The three girls postured themselves around my bed. Each girl spoke in turn:

""Our Lord demands your company.""

""The slain require summoning.""

""Your axe awaits in his hands.""

The three left the room in turn, and the last once beckoned me with a finger.

I followed into a marvelous garden. Brilliant streams echoed down smooth granite canals and green hills wrapped the horizon in every direction. Before me, the cobblestone path pointed to a palace in the distance made from old, beautiful wood. The gardens, though beautiful, were eerie. There was no sound save our footsteps on the path, the rustling of the wind, and the trickle of the streams. No animals or birds, no cars, and no rock concerts.

We ambled into the palace and stepped before a modest throne. It was occupied by a tall man with silver hair. He rested a large spear against his shoulder. He wore a circlet of pure gold, a Mastadon t-shirt, blue jeans, and a scarlet robe. In his lap, he held my red Fender Stratocaster.

[WP]When you die you become a God. You have died and have become the God of...,Mymom345,"“Oh man. Of all the ways to go…” Greg thought as his soul hovered over the paramedics hauling his lifeless body into the ambulance.  Choking to death on the gristle of a cheap steak at an all you can eat buffet was not a terribly noble way to go.

The world around him started to fade into oblivion yet he was still conscious.  This wasn’t what he expected at all.  As an atheist he thought that when you die that’s it.  You simply aren’t anymore.  

Apparently, he was wrong.  He had been wrong about many things and this seemed to be yet another error.  He hoped that the Christians were wrong too.  If they weren’t it was brimstone enemas for him.

The darkness around him slowly started to fade and he found himself standing on a field of clouds in front of a massive gilded gate.

“Yup.  I’m screwed.”, he said to nobody in particular.

After a short time, a figure clad in white with wings appeared.  The figure was in white but the robe was tattered and stained with what looked like food stains and the wings were a bit shabby with unkempt feathers.

“Hey, dude.”  The angel said casually.  This was definitely not the glowing figure with trumpets sounding around him.

“Umm… Hi?” Greg said with no small amount of confusion.  The angel laughed.

“Choked on buffet food.  At least it wasn’t auto-erotic asphyxiation.”  Greg winced.

“Don’t feel too bad.  It happens all the time.”  The angel said with a laugh.  “That place should be shut down.”

Greg became increasingly anxious.  The angel grinned at him.
“Afraid you are going to fry?”  The angel said with a laugh.  Greg nodded.

The angel opened the massive gates that squeaked as they did so.  The angel frowned.

“I need to get maintenance to look at those.  It really ruins the whole divine thing.”  The angel said with annoyance.  “Well, get a move on.”  Greg, very confused, walked through.

“In case you are wondering, these aren’t those ‘pearly gates’ that everyone talks about.  This is the service entrance.”

“What?”

“You thought you were going to ‘Heaven’?” The angel said with a chuckle.  Greg was now completely at a loss.  The angel shrugged.  “Do I look like an ‘angel’ to you?”

“You aren’t?”

“Well sorta.  Awhile back there was this…thing… and I sorta sided with the wrong guy.”

“You are a fallen angel?”  The angel winced and sighed.

“Yeah… Big mistake.”  The angel shook his head.  “And you are talking to me so…” Greg winced.

“Are the gates of Hell?”  The angel laughed at him.

“Nope.  In a few centuries you might wish they were.  Like I said this is the service entrance” Greg did not like where this is going.

“Head on through.  The shop steward will want to have a look at you.” Greg walked forward and suddenly found himself walking down a long shabby hall with a concrete floor and cinderblock walls.  The sound of strange machinery came from everywhere.

At the end of the hall there was a desk occupied by another winged individual.  Her robes were gone and replaced by a t-shirt and jeans.  Her wings were even shabbier than the first angel and were covered in soot and grease. 

She looked up from the ledger in front of him and looked Greg up and down.  She then flipped a few pages.

“Greg Parson, Atheist.  Death from overeating at a buffet.”  The angel chuckled.  She got up and poked him a few times and squeezed his arm.

“Hmm… Decent spiritual strength, good cohesion, not totally losing it…” The angel looked Greg in the eye.  “Not bad.”  She smiled at him malevolently. 

“The guy upstairs is omniscient and omnipotent… more omnipotent that some of us thought.” She idly picked at her feathers.  “Oh, he most certainly is but just because he can do everything doesn’t mean that he actually does.  He delegates and some of us have the shit jobs.”  Greg definitely did not like where this was heading.

“Because of our…’status’… we get the shit ones.”  She laughed. “We delegate too.”  

“Let me guess, I get the shit of the shit.”  The angel nodded.

“Yup.  Nice to see you don’t whine and grovel.  By now a lot of peeps bitch and moan or even better try to repent.  You don’t want to know what sort of thing we give them.”

“If it would help I would cry like a little bitch.”  

“I like you.” The angel said with a smile. “Congratulations you get to be a God.”

“What?”  

“Gods like you are omniscient and have divine powers but only as far as your job goes.”  

“So what shitty thing over which I have divine powers?”  The angel grinned at him.

“You my little douchebag are now ‘Lord of the Buffet’.  You shall look over the righteous and protect them from the hazards of the realm of all you can eat and you shall smite the unholy from well… the unholy.”  Greg sighed and dropped his head.  The angel giggled at him.

“The last guy did ok and I gave him a promotion.”

“Well I think he did a shitty job of it.”  Greg laughed.  The angel laughed along with him.

“Give him a break, there are billions of you little turds floating in the bowl we call Earth.  You try to keep all of those idiots from killing themselves every second and see how you do.  You are a God but you are not God if you get my meaning.  Besides the boss doesn’t want perfection.  We want natural selection but we don’t want extinction.” The angel laughed again.  “Do you know how hard it is to keep you fuckers from that?”

“No.”  The angel grinned at him.

“You are about to find out.  On the bright side you can have all you can eat whenever you want.”  Greg grimaced and raised his hand with his middle finger fully extended.  The angel nodded approvingly.

“I think we will get along very well.  Ooh!  There is a first class asshole heading into a Golden Waffle!”  Greg smiled wickedly.

“I think he wants the steak.”  He then turned into a column of greasy grey smoke and disappeared.

[WP]When you die you become a God. You have died and have become the God of...,Mymom345,"There are many things in the world that are so inconceivably detailed, enough so, that every civilisation of the history of evolved thinking, has developed the concept of a god, or even several gods. Perhaps you only think that interesting and remarkable things have a particular god to look after them, and not just mundane, everyday things that you wouldn’t ordinarily look twice at. Let me tell you just how wrong you are. 

It all started ten minutes ago, I’m a regular taker of drugs, and had just injected some new concoction my mates brought round, bought at a huge discount price from our regular dealer around the back of Redwood Drive, the most notorious council estate in the whole of Lincoln. I could tell it was shit stuff Barry had supplied us with right away, but only when I woke up seeing myself dead on the floor did I realise just how shit it was.  

Fast forward to ten minutes later, I’m stood here, too dazed to even start looking for my light to the afterlife, when a figure emerges from the shadows. He’s a young greasy haired lad, wearing a crappy Adidas tracksuit, with even worse Umbro trainers, you could tell straight away that he had died in the 1990’s, no way anyone now would have that bad fashion sense, even amongst the scummiest scum of Redwood. 

“Alright mate?” I say carefully, if this is death, from the way this geezer is dressed, it’s going to be even less exciting than my short life had been. He looks startled, as if I’m the one that just crept out from the dark corner.

“Scared me fam. That’s you on the floor isn’t it? Bad luck; you’re the third one this month Barry has given that shit to that’s overdosed.” He shook his head, as if this was completely normal conversation. I gaped at him. “Ave’ you got your GD yet?” The boy asked.

“What’s a GD? I only dropped dead a few minutes ago” I replied, this really was as dull as life, he just raised an eyebrow at me, like I was the idiot in the Umbro trainers. 

“A GD, is God Deal, like when everyone dies, they become a God of something, they usually send your allocated deal from upstairs within about half an hour, so you should find out soon.” He explained slowly, I could already tell whatever this lad was the God of, was nothing exciting.

“So what are you the God of, knock off Adidas tracksuits?” I quipped, already annoyed that the first other dead person I had met had to be this greasy twat. He just laughed, like it was some sort of personal joke.

“No, I’m the God of accidental drug overdoses from injecting, but only outside of London, they’ve got two other guys who deal with London, it’s pretty bad, or so I’m told.” He stated matter of factly. This was so bizarre, I couldn’t help but laugh. “If you think my GD is bad, you should meet Siobhan from round the corner; she got hit by a car last month and was assigned to be the God of flowery duvet covers. At least I see some action, imagine having to mull around Primark for the rest of your existence in the homewares department.” 

“Wait, you’re serious?” I asked, baffled by how knowledgeable he seemed to be. I could tell he was about to reply when an enormous explosion of cheap confetti came from nowhere, over my dead body. Gold sparkly letters appeared after reading; ‘Sorry for your death today Clive Ashbourne of Redwood Estate’ this soon disappeared followed by the new, bigger sparkly letters that read; 

‘You are now the God of; Squeezy Bottles of Low Fat Mayonnaise’

Just fucking great.

"[WP] You receive a text saying, ""Wake up!""",Ouma_Shu,"""Order 47.""
""Order 47?""
""Order 47."" She said slightly more slowly but with the weight of a thousand stars pounding behind every syllable. 
If the decorated lapel or chevrons and insignias on her shoulder didn't compel the young man to flip the switch, it was the look in her eyes that sliced through any remaining doubts. 
As lights flickered into existence around her, a smile crept across her lips. 

Morning had broke in through the blinds slipping between the shadows and found its way into Chris' eyes. Today was planned, today was normal, breakfast, work, mindless tasks, home, dinner, perhaps an update link to the the central core, mindless TV, bed. Chris enjoyed the time he had, his life had culminated into this pattern he had come to love. A decent group of friends, days off here and there enough hobbies to keep him busy. Life was good Chris mused over his morning coffee. 

It was at this moment that Chris' existence reached its apex. It was at this moment that Chris' phone buzzed. The annoying buzz of an unexpected intruder in his moment of serenity. 
'Visual' Chris mumbled as he was dragged out his kicking and screaming out of his blissful morning (pre-caffeine) state of lucidity. The words appeared in front of him, hovering in the air, projected by the relevant pieces of tech scattered throughout his house whose inner workings were of beyond Chris' understanding and his attention span. 
The two words hung there awaiting acknowledgment. As his eyes dragged themselves across each letter, Chris' mind began to kick into gear, albeit 1st gear but it was getting there. The coffee steamed eagerly awaiting to fulfil its purpose in the universe. 
'Wake up'
'Wake up?' Chris thought, 'I am awake' he chuckled putting down his coffee. He attentively waited for a message ID, or time stamp to appear. Nothing. Blank, just those two words, dancing through the rising steam. Mocking Chris' inability to grasp their meaning. Reloading the message, turning his phone on and off again -standard procedures in Chris' mental manual of making stuff work- still the same two words met him with nothing but insolence. 

Coffee that had previously assumed its place in caffeinated Valhalla found itself reborn on cold hard steel. Chris felt fuzzy, he felt warm, he was steaming in fact. In the cold dark room lit only by a console to one side Chris found himself...evaporating the water that had apparently made a home on his skin. Chris fell to his knees, as questions rose to his mind, where was he, what the hell had just happened and why was he so...fuzzy, to name a few. 

A voice as cold as the room Chris occupied boomed through his scull as a face appeared on the illuminating console in the wall. 
""Welcome, citizen"" the voice intoned and the face mouthed. 
""You are currently onboard the Indomitable, mankind's greatest and last space faring battleship""
Chris' mind raced, well, it more of halted, sure humanity had holograms and text could appear in front of your face if you wanted it to. But battleships... this joke had gone to far. Before Chris could transfer his outrage to the wall through his fist, the voice continued. 
""Under order 47, of the prime governments decree, all citizens below rank 4 are subject to instant conscription, and transferal to appropriate locales. Currently battle plans, combat techniques, and firing drills are being uploaded into your brains through your cortex chips. You are now warriors of humanity, our last hope and bastion, you are awoken.""

He dragged his five-foot club alongside him, felling any small trees unfortunate enough to get caught in its path. The rest of the army trailed him from a distance, lest they fall victim to a random timber accident.

""Wonder whom they've brought."" Captain Leeds peered through his telescope, and the battlefield ahead sprang into view. The enemy had already congregated at the opposite edge. Leeds's mouth dropped open. In the middle of the field stood the most unlikely candidate for their champion.

""What are you guys playing at?"" The moment his army had reached the field, Leeds had called for a meeting with the opposing leader.

""What do you mean?"" Captain Marrow adjusted his eyepatch and winked. Or blinked; Leeds couldn't really tell. ""Do you need a refresher on proper battle conduct?""

""You know very well what I'm referring to,"" Leeds snapped, pointing to the field. Archibald had taken a seat in the center of the makeshift arena and was currently gnawing on his club. Across from him, a little girl had mimicked his pose and had begun plucking the petals from a daffodil.

""Yes, that is our champion,"" Marrow said, closing his eye and nodding, ""so are you ready to fight, or do you want to surrender?""

""Oh, I get it."" Leeds stood on the tips of his toes and attempted to press his forehead against his slightly taller counterpart's. ""You're trying to appeal to our sympathy. Think we're going to surrender to avoid killing this poor, innocent girl."" He prodded Marrow's chest. ""Think again.""

Marrow patted Leeds on the shoulder. ""I assure you we intend for a legitimate fight to take place. I'm ready."" He glanced at the combatants and whistled. The girl sprang to her feet and gave him a salute. ""And so is Selena. Just say the word.""

""You think you're so clever, don't you?"" Leeds spat between his shoes. On the field, Archibald gave him a look of impatience. ""Then you're just trying to garner the sympathy of the neighboring territories. Making us look like monsters for killing the girl to gain their alliance, when you're the ones who sent her out here in the first place.""

""I don't think anyone is going to break the neutrality agreement regardless of the outcome of this battle."" Marrow yawned and looked his pocket-watch. ""Anyway, I'm done with this speculation. Selena has a tea party in an hour. Either allow me to begin this match or forfeit.""

Leeds wrung his hands and clenched his teeth. It would forever weigh on his conscience to order the death of this poor girl—death by cannibalization at that. He had to, though, for the good of his country. ""Go on then.""

The two captains shook hands, and Marrow fired a shot into the air to signal the start of the battle. Archibald lumbered towards Selena, clouds of dirt rising with each footstep. She didn't do anything, just stood still, gazing up into the hungry maw of her opponent. Her blank expression remained even as he picked her up and deposited her into his mouth. Archibald gulped, and Selena was gone. Neither of the armies made so much as a sound.

""Well? The jig's up."" Leeds placed his hands on his hips and turned to Marrow. ""What was your magnificent plan then?""

""Oh, well, seems we were outmatched."" Marrow shrugged, offering a sheepish smile. ""Very well. You guys win. If you'll all return home now, we'll visit you in a few days to sign that treaty.""

Leeds frowned. ""I'd rather sign the treaty in your capital, Marrow.""

""Why, that would be an affront to our storied tradition of signing war treaties-""

""She's a time bomb, isn't she?"" 

Marrow's grin grew even wider. He adjusted his felt cap. ""Well, shall we rematch in three days, then?""

Out on the field, Archibald rolled over on his stomach and closed his eyes contentedly. Poor guy.",hideouts

As tall as a tree and a strong as a dragon! To fight for his king, Olag the Mane!""

""From the West, comes Arianna the Fair, Rejector of Suitors! As pretty as the lilies, and as radiant as the sun! To fight for her king and father, Magnar of the Storm!""

A small girl not even of age stepped forward to meet the challenger, clothed in a white dress and white gloves, a white bonnet, and white shoes. In her hands, a few white lilies.

The army of the East laughed at such a sight, and rejoiced in a quick victory.

The army of the West was silent.

Volkarg charged, with lust and bloodshed in his eyes, thinking that he might play with the dainty thing before him before killing her.

The little girl remained still, merely offering the man a single lily from her own. 

The man ignored the gesture, and swung his axe.

In moments, nothing remained of Volkarg but a large pool of blood.

Neither army wanted to fight any further, and so my lord Naiglor made a temporary truce with the other army's commander, Smythe. 

The terms of the truce were simple: We wouldn't attack them, they wouldn't attack us. The outcome of this whole bloody war would be decided by single combat between the champions of our armies. 

Naturally, when the time came for the duel to begin, my lord Naiglor sent out Goltoras, the strongest man we had. He grinned in the middle of the space between the armies, waiting for Smythe's champion.

A little girl stepped onto the field. She was wearing a maroon cloak over a jacket of brown leather, no doubt made by the finest tailor in the land. She smiled innocently as she walked out into the clearing, facing Goltoras as an equal. 

Goltoras raised an eyebrow. ""Is... Is that your champion?"" He shouted to Smythe's army. 

""Yes, I am."" The girl said happily. ""Can we start already? I'm getting bored.""

""Uh... My lord?"" Goltoras turned back toward our army. 

Naiglor sighed, right next to me. ""Do what you must, Goltoras...""

The massive beast of a man reluctantly turned back toward the girl. ""Are you prepared?"" He asked. He wanted to give her a fighting chance. 

""Yes. Don't go easy on me."" She said.

""THEN LET THE DUEL BEGIN!"" He cried, his barbarian voice ringing through the valley as he leapt toward the girl. 

He had scarcely left the ground when there was a loud bang and a splash of blood. A small object flew out of the back of Goltoras's head and he landed with a thud on the ground, dead, a few inches in front of the girl.

""I win."" She said bluntly, blowing smoke off of the tip of the strange weapon in her hand before putting it back in her jacket. ""You lose.""",demonflame666

Not because he's an amateur who's never been in a fight. No, of course not. His skin had not a single scratch because he was just that good. When he stepped forth, all Digglekens smirked. They all knew the Ratafatas didn't stand a chance.

Jarfarma paced back and forth as he awaited for his opponent. A raucous applause erupts from the Ratafatas and a little girl steps forth. She looked like your average little girl. She had braces, pigtails, big young eyes. Except she wasn't like other little girls. They'd be scared right now. No, she gave off a scary amount of confidence. 

She walked up to Jarfarma, ""You ready?""

Jarfarma tilted his head and eyed the girl from head to toe and back again. He's confused. The Ratafatas continued applauding, laughing, cheering, some of them were even getting wasted on their famous Ooo Goo Beer. ""Are... are you my opponent?"" he asked rubbing his head as he waited for a reply so he could finally bash something to death.

""Yes,"" she replied with the biggest smile on her face, ""I am the one known as Sally. I'm gonna crush your poo poo face!""

And with those final words the fight began.

Jarfarma rushed in with astounding speed to close the gap between him and Sally, and then punched her fucking head off. The Ratafatas applause died quickly as they stared in shock, some of them even crying.

""The fuck did you expect?"" Jarfarma said as he rubbed the blood across his knuckles off with his warrior pants. He walked back to the Digglekens where he received many pats on the back. Later that night he smashed puss. Lots of puss. Life was good for Jarfarma. What a legend.

"[WP] Two ancient armies prepare for battle, one army sends out a seven foot tall hulk as their champion; the other army sends out a little girl to raucous applause.",Starzajo,"The two warlords sat on their steeds, pacing in front of their forces.  Their vast armies stood ready at opposite sides of the valley, the culmination of years of plotting.  This continent would finally submit to a single master.  A morning fog hung over the valley like a tensely held breath.

From the Starlight Legion, a brute silently strode forth, making his way to the river at the valley bottom.  His spiked armor was festooned with grisly trophies of fallen opponents of both sword and sorcery, and his harnesses bore knives, swords, axes, and enchanted blades from all peoples.  His full helm, perfectly polished, had never suffered a scratch, evidence that he was more than a brute, a testament to his skill, rumbled with his deep breaths.  He was Edge, Blademaster and Cursed by the Fates weather the ages timelessly to trim errant threads from the tapestry of the world.

A small child covered in a blue hood and cloak drifted out from the ranks of the Holy Crusade of the Sun.  Archmage Terra floated down the slope of the valley, matching her enemy's pace on the opposite side.  Her opal mask glittered in the morning light, hiding a rumored beauty that was known to cackle with madness when she killed.  Terra was no mere girl, having long since deduced immortality, she was simply at the point of her cycle when she looked young.  She was the Chosen of Gaia, to wield the world's flow of magic in perfect, exquisite, artistry.

The two champions made their way to a large rocky outcrop in the river, Edge simply leaping the waters, while Terra drifted over the churning foam.  They knew each other by reputation of course, their own fame spread far and wide.  Each was acutely aware that today, one of them might learn if it was even possible to die.  The man took off his helmet, the girl her mask, a show of respect to acknowledge a worthy opponent face to face.

""FUCK!"" exclaimed Terra.  An outpouring of curses and invectives flowed out in a shrill endless torrent that rippled through the ranks of both armies at the sides of the valley.  Edge just slouched and sighed, sitting down with a heavy grunt on the rocks, rubbing his temples with his fingertips as he waited for the girl to finish.

""Is it really you, Karrok?"" Terra finally said, almost at a whisper.  Tears glistened at the corners of her eyes, unseen by all except Edge, who was first named Karrok. ""I mean...how? What? Those fuckers told me the damned Legion had chained you in some far prison, weighted down by endless pus spewing undead ass gobblers.""

""Yes Sela, this warlord behind me said something similar I suppose, that a circle of mages had managed to bind you and were using you as their focus of power"" spoke Karrok, a gentle, cultured tone at odds with his weapons and gear.  ""I am relieved that was not the case.""

""See, that's what happens when you take too fucking long questing for my ingredients,"" bantered Sela, their relief at seeing each other more than enough for now to push aside their resentment at being tricked.  She conjured a table and some cups, ""Tea?""

""Yes, please, thank you,"" Karrok relaxed and sat at the table.  As fellow immortals, they were old friends of course, even lovers during Sela's cycle when she wasn't a little girl or frail crone. ""But it's not my fault you wanted strange rare ingredients from the far corners of the world.  As I recall, it wasn't even for magic, you were just trying to cook!""

""Shit, all cooking is magic, you should know that,"" replied Sela as she poured the fragrant tea into each of their delicate porcelain cups.  ""By the way, what do we do about these fuckers who tricked us into being their pawns?""

""If they know what's good for them, they'll wait for me to finish my tea,"" Karrok said, with a roll of his eyes.  That gesture, a rare bit of rudeness from the otherwise impeccably polite Blademaster, brought a smile to Sela.  They heard a soft rumble behind each of them as the two opposing armies began to charge.  ""I guess not.""

Shocked and disbelieving of the oddly domestic scene at the river, both warlords of the Holy Crusade of the Sun and Starlight Legion had raged impatiently.  So what if there would be no duel.  Their reputations were probably exaggerated anyway.  This duel between champions had always been just a farce to begin the slaughter, something to demoralize the enemy before their utter destruction.  The morning mist had faded.  They ordered their forces forward.  Fate will see the victor.

As dawn broke the next morning, a small makeshift boat drifted lazily down the valley river.  A hulking mass of armor and weapons sat calmly in the middle, a small cloaked girl dancing from one of his shoulders to the other.  The new day's light slowly revealed a shattered valley and river choked red with blood.  It seems that this land would be experiencing an unexpected time of peace.",Yellowchopsticks
"[WP] Two ancient armies prepare for battle, one army sends out a seven foot tall hulk as their champion; the other army sends out a little girl to raucous applause.",Starzajo,"Tens of thousands of men leered at each other from across the neutral zone as horses snorted and pawed at the ground nervously. Steam rose in a vast cloud over all the hot bodies in the cool morning. Two men stand toward the front of one army while a small group stand at the front of the other army whose back was to a cities great walls. The battle would be decided by the ancient rite of single combat.

The two men at the front of the army facing the city’s walls were both tall but one was wiry and agile while the other a great big man of bulging muscle. The slender man leaned towards the larger and says in a mockingly confident tone, “Let us see what ‘champion’ they send to face ours, eh Garen.” 

Garen looked seriously at the stick of a man and reprimanded in his booming voice, “Don’t count your Anivia’s before they hatch.” Varus laughed at the pun but shook his head. Even now Garen somehow thought that their champion would possibly not win them the day when she had never lost a battle after all this time.

Movement across the field signified the spreading of the enemy army to allow someone through. A great titan of a man emerged, towering over the soldiers by at least a foot. He roared a guttural cry and raised a great-sword as long as he was tall. His cry was answered by the soldiers behind him. The giant did look formidable, Varus had to give it to them. And did he really have only… “A real live cyclops” chuckled Varus, “Well not so alive for long.”

Varus nudged his friend good naturedly and gave a laugh, “Imagine the looks on their faces when she single-handedly brings down the Cyclops in front of their whole army eh brother. They’ll lay down all their weapons in front eh, EH!” 

Garen spared Varus another of his serious looks before returning his watching gaze back onto the waiting army. That guy reaaally needed to lighten up, thought Varus as he strolled back towards their army. 

Stopping a dozen yards out from the men, Varus grasped his bow in one hand and saluted it to his force and shouted as so everyone including the opposite army would hear him, “They believe that they will win the day with their titan champion ‘the Cyclops’.” 

The soldier’s all booed as they had done for previous champions. The enemy army would ridicule ours when they saw our champion. They always did but then again they always all surrendered in the past so who cares about appearances. Her appearance was probably one of her greatest strengths well that and her teddy bear.  

A voice sounded coming between the soldiers. They parted for it, making it look like a wave was breaking through the center of their ranks. It rang in a repeated fashion and all of a sudden a small girl no taller than three feet high was skipping out of the ranks of soldiers singing more to herself than anyone else, “Hop, skip, jump!”

Varus grinned widely as he stood facing the small girl and give her a small nod. 

She grinned back then made a bow to the soldiers and said, “Play time!”

This caused a frenzy of cheering and clapping among our soldiers. The enemy was just now beginning to call out insults and jeers. They would see for themselves the awesome power of our secret weapon soon enough. This dark child had slain more champions than anyone Varus had ever met. As she skipped to meet the hulking cyclops in the center of the neutral zone she chanted her war song with the soldiers behind her carrying up, echoing her words.

“Ashes, ashes, they all fall down,” echoed ominously throughout the clearing by thousands of voices.  

As she neared the great titan of the man, she slowed down until coming to a stop twenty yards away. Staring at each other across this distance, both armies were deathly silent and still as they watched and waited in breathless anticipation. 

The Cyclops made the first move, giving the clearing another show of that fearsome guttural roar and beginning his charge at the young girl standing there lightly swinging her teddy bear in one hand. 

As the great beast of a man bared down the last few yards on the child, her high voice rang out in the silence, “Have you seen my bear Tibbers?”

A great sphere of flame consumed both the girl and the warrior from vision just as he swung his great-sword down upon her. The sphere persisted for several seconds and when the flames had cleared in a sudden disappearance the scene that greeted the armies eyes caused both sides to gasp collectively.

The small girl was standing on top of the fallen cyclops chest, with her arms out trying to steady her balance. She looked up at her own army with a smile and called out, “This is fun!”

A cheer followed this as the day was almost won. Now onto the nexus.

"[WP] Two ancient armies prepare for battle, one army sends out a seven foot tall hulk as their champion; the other army sends out a little girl to raucous applause.",Starzajo,"Two armies face each other across a grassy valley.  Every footmen, archer, and knight hold their ground as the rays of the sun beat down on them.  Evenly matched in both numbers and tactics, the generals agree that they must send a champion to represent their country in a glorious deathmatch.

The front line of the Eastern army divides in two.  Then the second line, and then the third, until a well defined path is between the middle of the sea of men.  The Western army does the same.  And in that path, the champions walked.

From the East, is Maleoth of Ossidia: Slayer of Men, Champion of Seyfron, Iron Conqueror, Son of Gregar: God of War, Tamer of Dragons, the Apostle of Death, Hand of Justice, Servant of Lyxas: the Matriarch, the Head of the Pantheon, Mother of All Things Good and Evil, Baker of Cookies.

From the West, is Shelby.  10 years old.

They looked each other eye to eye.  And Maleoth spoke.

“I can’t do this.  She’s literally a child,” said Maleoth the Eloquent, the Mouthpiece of Soryo, the Bard of Avon.  “You want me to kill a little girl, I just can’t.  I can’t even.”

“I suppose it’s one of those situations where the girl is actually deceivingly cunning or quick, and will use those unconsidered variables to best you!” shouted a soldier from the East.

Maleoth looked into Shelby’s eyes.  Only innocence.  “No.  Pretty sure she’s just a little girl.  I’m a pretty good judge at this kinda thing,” spoke Maleoth, Judge of the Dead, etc.  “What is the meaning of this?”

The Western General, in his Dragonscale armor and Griffin familiar, which he acquired in Book Three, flew down from the heavens.  “It is a test.  If you slay the girl, the West shall concede, and all the territory shall belong to the East.  But really, if you must kill the girl to win, who’s the true winner here, hmm?  What a moral dilemma.  Man I’d hate to be the person who has to make this choice.”

Maleoth, in his infinite wisdom, raised his middle finger at the General.

The General nodded.  “I am offended, but this was all a ruse as we actually have two hidden armies with invisible armor that are outflanking yours anyway.”

And thus, the Great Continental War, which was instigated from a single brawl but was bound to happen due to political and economic reasons that are far too complex to be discussed in one book, ended.",ThatAznK1d

"[WP] Two ancient armies prepare for battle, one army sends out a seven foot tall hulk as their champion; the other army sends out a little girl to raucous applause.",Starzajo,"The sound of marching feet echoed around the valley. Figures began to seep through the treeline that bordered the battlefield; easily ten thousand men, bearing the banners of the Noxus Clan. With them came the deep rumble of beating drums and the wailing of warhorns. Last to enter the plane of war was a mammoth silhouette, as tall and broad as the old oak trees it left behind. The giant stomped through the ranks of soldiers, stopped in the middle of the valley and pointed at General Xin Zhao.

Xin gave his armour-clad horse a kick and began to trot through the rows of organised Demacian soldiers before him. He stopped several paces away from his clan, dismounted, and stared back at the Noxus Clan's Champion. 


""It appears that General Darius fears us more than I expected."" Xin raised his katana high in the air, ""Send her forward.""


Through the banks of men, emerged a young girl - no taller than Xin's knees. A small, soft toy swung from left hand as she skipped towards the colossal demon that awaited its challenger. Her short red hair seemed to glow under the beaming sun above. A small satchel on her back, over the top of a purple dress, swung from side to side as she bounded forward.


The hulk of a man hunched over and smashed a giant shield into the ground. ""What is this? You insult me with this mere ant? Send a real champion out for me to crush!""


Xin turned his back on the two champions, mounted his horse and faded into the ranks of his men. The giant turned around and looked at General Darius.


""Braum, destroy the girl. Make an example of her. Tear her apart,"" bellowed Darius.


Braum returned his focus to the small girl, who was skipping around in circles ten feet away. As he walked towards her, she stopped and looked at Braum.


""Have you met my bear, Tibbers?"" said the girl. She raised her arm and dangled a teddy bear in front of her face.


With a finger and a thumb, Braum felt his moustache and frowned. ""That's very cute, little girl. But there's no time for playing with little teddy bears. Today you die"". He released his arm from the huge shield and let it fall to the floor, then continued towards the girl with a light jog.


The small girl dropped the teddy bear on the floor and took a step back. Suddenly, a mass of light erupted from the bear. Braum covered his face with a giant arm and continued his engage. As the light grew in intensity, so did the teddy - until a titanic, brown bear stood between the two challengers. Flames began to form on the bear's shoulders, increasing in size and engulfing its entire frame.


Braum stopped dead in his tracks; his mouth aghast. He shifted on the spot and made a dash for his shield. As he reached the impressive barrier, he felt an incredible force in his back that knocked him flying. He laid motionless on the floor. Staring up at the blue sky above. The little girl skipped over and looked down at Braum's face. It was tainted with anguish. The pain in the centre of his back was now unbearable, like it was on fire. The girl's smile looked peaceful - almost angelic. Braum knew his time had come. He smiled back at her pretty little face and closed his eyes.


""Show me your best.""

"[WP] Two ancient armies prepare for battle, one army sends out a seven foot tall hulk as their champion; the other army sends out a little girl to raucous applause.",Starzajo,"The two tribes met at the ancient site, a tall plateau that had been the site of many conflicts like the one about to unfold.  They had both lost far too many good men in the series of raids that had taken place over the past few months.  Both were dangerously close to losing so many that they would no longer be able to sustain themselves and thus fade into oblivion.

That is why this contest was taking place.  The winner would decide the war.  It was the only way to end this feud at this point.

The Wind in the Trees tribe beat their shields as their champion strode into the circle.  Their choice was of no surprise, Stonekin.  He towered over everyone there and his club was nearly as tall as he was with a massive stone the weight of the normal man.  He had been responsible for many of the deaths of the men of the Wolf clan.  He was as fast as he was heavy and his skin was so tough that he bore the scars of javelins and spears of wounds that would have cut down anyone else.

He was a monster.

The Wolf Clan’s ranks opened and a small wisp of a girl stepped forward.  The Wind in the Trees clan all burst into laughter.  The Wolf Clan laughed as well but with malice in their mirth.

Stoneskin looked at the girl with confusion.  He had shattered the skulls of many a man but had never slaughtered a child.  He sighed heavily.  He would do what he must to end this senseless feud but he felt sick.  This was unthinkable.

He looked over at the Wolf Clan and snarled.  He had fought them for many seasons.  He had killed many of them but it was only because they would have killed him or his tribesmen if they could.  It was nothing personal.  

Now he truly hated them.  What sort of sick animals would send the smallest and weakest of them into the duel.  They must have known that they would lose.  That was the only reason.  He was sure to kill anyone they set forth.  Everyone knew this.  The only reason to send this girl was so that no man on their side would be lost.

They sent a child to be slaughtered.  The stain of this would taint his soul and the souls of his children and their children.  Was this revenge for the lives he had claimed?  They couldn’t break his body so they would break his soul instead?

This was truly evil.  They had been called evil by his elders but he never paid it any mind.  Words like that were used by the elders to drive the stupid among them to fight.  He believed it now.

The girl looked him with terror in her eyes.  Her lips quivered as she struggled to stand upright and not flee.  She was showing more bravery than any of the animals cheering her on.  She peed herself but still held position standing before him with nothing but a twig in her hands.

Stoneskin also struggled to stand before the child.  This was wrong.  This was so very wrong.  The massive club shook in his hands.  His clan had stopped laughing but the Wolf Clan laughed on taunting him, urging him to finish the duel.

Stoneskin’s mind raced.  If he backed down his tribe lost.  If he murdered the child he would be lost.

He towered before the little girl and raised his club.

“Submit.” Stoneskin said with a booming voice.  

“No.” The child said quietly.

“Submit and I will take you and raise you as my own.  You do not have to return to those jackals.”  Stoneskin said in a quiet gentle voice.  

“No.”

“You do not have to do this!”  Stoneskin cried in anguish.  The Wolf Clan howled with laughter.

Stoneskin was thinking as hard as he could.  There had to be a solution.  That was the difference between them and the animals that they hunted.  People could think.  

The seconds turned to minutes and then to an hour.  Stoneskin still had not struck.  The Wolves were starting to claim that his reluctance was defeat.  Stoneskin screamed at them in rage.  
“I am going to kill all of you for this!”   Stoneskin paused a moment and smiled.  He could.  The rest of his tribe had promised not to strike but he had not.  He looked back at his chief.  His chief smiled and nodded his head.

Stoneskin roared and charged.

What happened next was sung around the campfire for centuries to come.  He fell upon the Wolves as if he were a raging flood.  He killed them one after another his great club mowing through their ranks as if it was a scythe in a field of wheat.  He was a giant fighting with the strength and savagery of twenty men.  

He did not kill them all but he came very close.  He came very, very close. 

He fell.

“It seems that our champion has fallen.”  His chief said as he said to the few survivors, too few to sustain a tribe.  He walked to the child and picked her up cradling her in his arms

“You have won.  Enjoy your victory.”  The chief and his tribesmen departed.

"[WP] Two ancient armies prepare for battle, one army sends out a seven foot tall hulk as their champion; the other army sends out a little girl to raucous applause.",Starzajo,"Sending out champions is a ridiculous way to end a war.  You have to trust the other side follows the same rules you do, share a sense of morality, of what it means to *win*.  But if we shared that - shared anything, for that matter - we wouldn't be fighting in the first place.  

But we were losing, so it wasn't our preferences that mattered.  My preferences especially did not matter, as there were many who still believed that our customs would be respected in the long run, and enough of them were important people who made important decisions, including our esteemed Lord.  So when the Reds grew bored and suggested a battle of champions to just end it, already, we hastily agreed.  It was then we discovered we had no champions left.  

We found Sir Lodrack first.  He looked down on us from atop his tent, head at an odd angle, blood still dripping from his neck to direct our eyes to the rest of him below.  Sir Thom the Sly was found alive with a knife in his hand, hovering over the still-twitching body of Sir Myron of Flounder's Edge.  We returned him to our gentle Lord, peppered with quills and in no shape to champion our side.  Sir Orangesteed, nursing a hangover and a wooden foot, would still champion for us and I imagine would do quite well, if not for the unfortunate fall on his lance placed curiously at an angle outside his tent doors.

We had nobody.  And yet we committed to a champion.  We had naught to do but to form our front lines and hope a courageous volunteer would step forth.  

As agreed, their champion stepped forth.  Curiously, they brought with them a monument covered in brown cloth- or was it a stage? - before settling down and announcing their champion was there.  We assumed it must be a stage, then, a bit ostentatious but we were sure was meant to intimidate.  Then the stage moved under the cloth, and a giant emerged.  

Taller by at least a span than our tallest man and almost as wide as his height came Sir Thimwise the Vast, of Bird's Haven to the south.  It would have taken him the duration of the war so far for him to have reached our field of battle.  They must have waited to propose the Champion Stage until he arrived.  

He was well known, even among the boys who stood among our lines.  They couldn't fight him. They would lose.  

""Who would meet Sir Thimwise on the field?"" the Reds taunted.  We heard the laughter in their voices.  They knew we had no one to send.  And we would be massacred whether Thimwise won or lost.

""Is there nobody to send?"" they laughed.  ""Have you forfeited already?""  

The Reds lowered their swords in unison, raised shields. Our formation tensed and shifted, ready to burst.  ""Hold!"" shouted our captains, but they were weak shouts as they were ready to flee as well.  In the best of times, courage does nothing to make death less terrifying, and we lost all our brave ones long ago.  Except one.

""I will go,"" came a high voice, strong.  My eyes darted left to discover who spoke. It was Marta, daughter of Sir Lodrack, no older than eight if my memory was correct.  No one answered, and as she walked forward, head high, long knife in hand, no one stopped her.  We were all cowards, all of us. And in our cowardice, we clapped.  This fight was merely a diversion, so the least we could do was support our actress.  

The beast Sir Thimwise shook his great head.  ""It is your death you choose, then,"" he rumbled.  

The girl continued her slow, confident stroll.  The beast leaned on his great axe, and watched her as she came, bored.  Twenty steps away, Sir Thimwise abruptly shifted his weight, eyebrows knotted, eyes narrowed.  ""This can't be,"" his voice rumbled, a mutter but yet audible.   

Confused chatter spread among both lines.  *What is it that Thimwise sees?  What makes him suddenly timid?  What is it about Marta that scares him?*

Marta continued forward, seemingly ignoring the crowd and ignoring Thimwise.  Her knife gleamed in the sunlight, somehow already bloodied.  How? *Who is this girl?*  

Five steps away, Thimwise raised his shield and great axe.  ""Hold,"" he yelled.  

Marta didn't hold.  She jumped - flew - and landed on Thimwise's shoulders.  Her feet dangled down his shoulders, her thighs held his neck in place.  Thimwise shook his body back and forth, doing his best and failing to dislodge Marta.

Marta grinned.  Grinned!  She bounced back and forth on the giant's mammoth frame, After a time, she shook her head.  ""There is no need to drag this out,"" said Marta.  

She lifted her long knife...and tossed it aside.  Her hands grasped the sides of Thimwise's helmet and *pushed*.  The sides crinkled in, and Thimwise's giant eyes bulged.  He rumbled, and he bellowed and he yelled and the sounds filled the valley in which we engaged.  Marta pushed harder still and the helmet collapsed into a crinkled ball, and then the sound stopped.  

The field was silent.  Sir Thimwise's body dropped, and we heard each link on his chainmail as it hit the grass.  Marta jumped as Thimwise fell, his head still in her hands, streams of muscle and tendons and bone snapping then dangling as the head separated from the body.  

This all happened very quickly , as it was still midday when Marta's eyes gleamed in the sun more than her eyes should have gleamed.  It was then her mouth...stretched.

At first it seemed she was preparing for a victory shout.  But she was silent, and her mouth continued to grow.  Fissures split her lip an grew into deep cracks.  The angle of her jaw popped and cracked before it dislodged itself.  And her mouth still grew, now a caricature of what a human face should look like.  

Our soldiers began to stir, terrified now for a different reason.  *Who is Marta, really?  What is Marta?*

And then I remembered.  Marta was dead.  She didn't accompany Sir Lodrack to the battlefield because she wasn't alive to do so.  His wife had taken to witchcraft and then taken Marta's life after we started losing the war, taking her own when we continued to lose.  

I looked back at dead Marta, mouth agape.  Her own mouth had enveloped the head of Sir Thimwise, the bristles of his long beard poking through the cracks in her lips, his nose poking through her thin cheeks.  She bit down, cracking metal and bone and spraying blood down her white shirt.  After just a few chews, she swallowed.  

She turned to gaze upon us, the Browns, bearing a grin that reached from ear to ear, and then some, all her face a mouth.  ""Sorry I'm late,"" she hissed.  

She turned towards the Reds, her mouth expanding once again, pieces of Sir Thimwise dripping down her grotesque lips in a long stream of slobber.  ""And now, we win.""

"[WP] Two ancient armies prepare for battle, one army sends out a seven foot tall hulk as their champion; the other army sends out a little girl to raucous applause.",Starzajo,"     Nat was flagging.  Dark blood ran from small wounds all over her body.  She watched her opponent glide lightly around the hastily built arena.  The nano-tech that normally healed her in moments was engaged completely in stopping the invading tech trying to leech into her through the cuts and punctures.  She was not sure how long her childlike body could last.

In all her years she had never been this close to defeat.  Her form belied her prowess in battle and gave her an edge against her foes.  In the many battles she had fought across the ravaged planet the balance had always tipped in her favor.  The enemy always sent their best and often biggest against her, their overconfidence giving her the advantage.  

She was a seasoned soldier despite her apparent age.  The tech that all beings on the planet needed to survive had somehow malfunctioned and prevented her from aging.  At first it was a distraction and she was continually despondent, but as the years passed she discovered the many advantages it gave her among the scattered remnants of humanity.  

Now she wondered if it was at end.

The battle had begun as many others with small skirmishes that quickly escalated.  Her small army of survivors had held up well initially until it became apparent they were facing a type of human they had never encountered before.  They reminded her of a swarm of ants.  Their skin was pitch black and functioned as armor when they battled.  They were all different shapes and sizes but one thing was the same throughout the dark ones.  They all sought to infect anything they encountered and turn it to their bidding.  Recognizing the odds Nat had demanded a challenge to ensure the survival of her people.

It had started as many duels had the dark ones sending their biggest and best to challenge her.  The creature was huge, towering over her with clawed hands and twisted muscles under the armored skin.  Nat faced it unflinchingly knowing it would fall.  The battle began quickly the beast lunging at her with a growl, its armored skin gleaming in the pale light of the sun.  Nat was faster and landed a blow with her fist on the creatures midsection.  The tech within her hardened her fist to steel and when it met the creature's body, the black skin cracked under the blow with a sickening crunch.

The creature stumbled away but seemed unfazed by the blow.  The scenario repeated again and again until Nat could see fractures all over the beast.  Finally it stopped its grey eyes reflecting madness and a hatred of its opponent.  With a sharp keen it feel to its knees the armored skin seeming to melt around it.  It shimmered and Nat could see the form beneath quickly changing.  Within moments the transformation was complete and Nat was looking at a doppelganger of herself.

That brought Nat to her current predicament.  The dark creature matched her blow for blow thereafter and the battle had drug on for several hours.  As she glanced to her squad she could see the despair in their eyes as if they knew the outcome already.  The swarm of dark ones opposite them seethed with mad glee at the prospect.  

Nat felt her resolve falter as doubt surged through her.  Her child's life spun through her mind all the failures and successes leading her to this moment.  A dark rage broke within her, all the suppressed emotion of a life stolen from the woman spilling out and overwhelming thought.  The pain of her wounds was gone.  The worry of death disappeared as well.  All that remained was her rage.

Nat felt the tech responding to her rage and turned to her opponent.  She saw her reflection and the rage peaked.  She stepped to the creature the tech transforming her as the battle began anew...",C_A_Fraser

[IP] Ghost of the Galaxies,Syraphia,"Her head up to the sky, the white haired maiden didn't so much as look at me as she walked towards me. I couldn't help but turn my head to follow the her gaze, and my mouth dropped. In the sky were, where flying fish, or maybe ghosts of them. They shimmered and shined like the sun, but I could look *through* them to see the reddish, almost pink cloud behind them at the same time if that makes sense. 

I admit that it doesn't but it's like trying to describe the color of leaves to one who can't see, or singing and shouts to one who can't hear. Words just become meaningless noise, words pointless symbols. But I'm getting off track--badly if I might add. Behind the shining flying fish, behind the clouds was a red sun, a dull red dot in the sky.

""Who are you?""

The question caught me off guard, I almost jumped.

""I ask again, who are you?""

""I'm--I don't know. Where am I?""

""A dead realm, filled with dead things. This is where they all come...Sooner, or later, it matters not when.""

""So...I'm dead.""

Her head tilts, facing me proper, and I get a good look at her face. Her eyes where gone, maybe never even there--smooth skin in their place. Her eyebrows furrowed a bit, the way they moved told me that she'd be rolling her eyes if she had them.

""I would think so. You wouldn't be here otherwise.""

""What are these fish?"" I ask my hand pointed skyward.

""They're what once lived. Life distilled from Death, waiting until The End. Until such a time I watch them. I watch everything that comes to this plane.""

""The End? Of the world?""

""Hmph. Of your world? No. Of **every** world. Every world that will ever birth life will eventually return to barren rock, every sun that gives off light will feebly sputter out. It will be as before, long, long ago.""

I choke a bit as I think of a response. She's calmly speaking of the end of everything. I never imagined that there would be more worlds than my own. To think of their end as well as my own filled me with dread.

""Is there nothing to be done?"" I thought of Eve, my sons and my daughters. I wouldn't let them be for nothing.

""Don't worry child. These beings above are Life, transformed in Death. When the Last of the Dead arrives, I'll use them to start again. The cycle will begin anew, and I will wait again.""

""Why?""

""Hmm?""

""Why do something...so pointless?""

""Because it's not pointless. Because I have seen countless universes come and go. and every time they ended, I used their embers to breath life into a new one. I will do this until I myself fall into Oblivion.""

""So why am I here?""

""You're the first of you kind to come here. The first of many, I gather.""

I almost lash out at her, balling my hand into a fist, for daring to threaten my family. But I don't, my hands began fading away, like dust in the wind, sparkling like stars. It didn't hurt a bit, which only increase my panic as I pointlessly tried to swat it way only making it worse, making it happen faster.

""Tell me child. Do you remember your name?""

I'm on my knees, crying to myself as my entire arms fad away. I lose feeling in my knees, and as I hang my head, I see those too beginning to fade.

""My name...It's...It's Adam.""

""A fine name."" I choke out a laugh between my tears.

""Am I going to disappear?""

""Your body, yes.""

I couldn't respond, my tears stopped flowing.

""But you will not die. Your people will join you, coalesced into a single form, joining those above us--none of you will know loneliness."" She kneeled down, placing a hand on my shoulder--one of the few things still left of me. ""I will not forget you Adam. I will not forget any of them.""

""Thank you.""

""Goodbye Adam.""

That was the last thing I heard from her. I haven't seen her again here. I was joined by my family, their children, and their children and so on. I relate this story to all of the new arrivals, so that they understand, truly understand.

[IP] Finally Home,Syraphia,"With Nashandra's death many changes came to Drangleic. The curse had finally been lifted off the many souls afflicted, at least, those who still had their souls. Vendrick however had worsened, somehow absorbing the cursed energy of his decrepit kingdom. The giants were pushed out as the old castle was rebuilt and larger, more powerful artillery created. The kingdom began to recover, began to thrive, the people finally home, finally at peace. 

It was then, when the kingdom was back to its former splendour that the kingdom became a centre for art and culture. Huge galas of canvas paintings and statues were built and many religious sites were made. Then the unexpected happened. It happened so quick, the people turned on one another, side effects from the curse. They lost their souls for one day every year after. The day soon became known as The Cursed Day, a day where the cursed would walk among the living, and fighting would kill thousands. Later it was made an official holiday, the Purge, a day where nothing was illegal save insurgency and mutiny.

Many kings passed through the halls of Drangleic Castle but none ended the horror that was the Purge. All sat back and laughed at it's ""magnificence"" until one servant walked up to the Iron Throne and stabbed the King through the chest saying ""nothing's illegal.""

He then declared himself the new King, the true king and renamed the kingdom Westeros and took a Lord as his protector to serve as his hand. A man he would later murder out of insanity. A man whose children were destined to return to claim the throne of Westeros. But you don't want to hear fairy tales of the past? Do you, Bran?",YeojaDea
[IP] Finally Home,Syraphia,"The early morning mist seemed to rise up to greet Kelen.  He liked to think it was the spirits of his ancestors, buried here the last three thousand years, come up to greet him.  Perhaps they would have risen anyway to enjoy the pleasant weather and taste the budding life of the land.   Late spring was a time of rebirth and abundance on the Gilded Plain.  Melting snow from mountains cascading in cool rivers brought plenty of fish  and water for their fields spread as far as anyone could see, even from the tops of the grey peaks.  They also provided the flat transport ships of his family plenty of room to transport the bountiful harvest of the fall and the metals of the rich mountain mines throughout the midlands and all the way to the coast.

The city, Vieve, was well nestled to the east and south by protective, harsh mountains.  Its natural wealth and easily defensible position made it possible, over the long centuries, for Vieve to rival some of the greatest cities in the world.  It had not only one, but three great Houses of Learning.  All of the major families kept a presence within its walls despite it being hundreds of miles from the nearest center of civilization.  The palaces were too numerous to count.  And the military had always sent their best and brightest to learn from the valiant House Commandant -- a position traditionally held by the third of Kelen's House, the other two holding the positions of High Judge and Duke.  Of course there was the Veiled Order and the positions held  within it, but the important ones seemed to be held by the same people, in roughly the same order of importance, as the more traditional positions.  

His was the only family, and that includes the various royal lines, that have kept their ancestral seat throughout known history from the time of the Great Burning.  The Veiled Order had no small part in that feat.  No one knows when it began.  Records of the proceedings of the Order are strictly forbidden.  But there is lore.  At first, it is said, it was a family affair -- a way to reward, and punish, those within the House.  But it quickly grew to most of the noble families.  It remained firmly controlled, however, by Kelen's kin through sheer force of will and cunning -- there was nothing in the Order that pre-ordained their eminence -- the unrealized promise that some other family could take the seat was always there.  It was a structure built on deceit and intrigue, but it kept those destructive fires contained.   Behind the Order's Veil, fortune shifted like the winds and anything was possible. But the lesser families and common folk never saw anything less than a united front of power.  If someone disappeared and it was whispered that the Order was involved, that is the last that was said of it.   The Order was the only power.  Once you were in, and Kelen was born into it, only death released its grip.

The Order released Kelen ten years ago today.

The Grand Ball was the culmination of a years worth of planning.  All of the people of the City and beyond were invited to revel and feast.  People traveled from the other Great Cities at least once in their life to attend.  It was a celebration to rival the birth of a King and it was held every year.  It was also the culmination of a years worth of the Order's maneuverings when its Prince was re-anointed or a new one crowned.   Who the Prince actually was is officially kept secret even from the rest of the Order but the lieutenants that a new Prince appointed and a conspicuous absence of a Very Notable Person was usually enough to give it away -- it was usually the Duke.

Ten years ago Kelen was to be crowned.  His father, the Duke, was very ill and not expected to live another month, much less another year.  Kelen was his first born.  Kelen was a fool.

He suspected nothing when the only daughter of House Ulla asked to meet him on the Noble's walkway above Merchant's Bridge.  He was well liked and well supported and my brothers seemed quite content.   He doesn't know who did the deed of throwing him into the swollen river in full ornamental plate, but he doesn't think it was Lady Ulla.

Today Kelen intends to find out whom it was.

Had he been wearing heavy battle plate the rain swollen current probably would not have been able to sweep him down river.  Had he not had the gold armor inlays, jeweled pommeled ceremonial sword, and a finely woven golden veil hidden in his padded underclothes he might not have been able to afford to make to the coast far from the Order's spies and buy a ship and crew to plunder his family's sea vessels.  He wouldn't have been able to use that plunder to create trade empire and pirate armada.  He wouldn't have had the vast fortune from those twin endeavors to pay for the army of twenty thousand riding just behind him ready to rend this unsuspecting and hungover city and its nobility to shreds.  He was lucky.   

Kelen is now in heavy battle plate, an army to his back.  He is finally home.

"[WP]You Used One of Those Novelty ""send a message to your future self!"" websites. What you never expected though, was to get a response...",Theditor,"Seven days.  It had been exactly seven days since ten-year-old Freida Walker had sent a short and choppy email to her so called 'future self'. She hadn't wanted to, in fact the whole concept seemed stupid to her.  Unfortunately the Virginian school system was absolutely ridiculous and had obviously run out of things for the fifth graders to do during the 'writing' portion of the day.  

So with a deep breath and not much concentration placed on the subject, she typed out a few short sentences about what her life was like and what she knew it would become.  It wasn't a particularly impressive arrangement of words, but it was enough to get her a whooping 'B' which was really as she needed to make her parents happy.  

She sent it from an email that her father had made for her a number of years ago.  She had almost forgotten it existed because she never used it.  It was only after discovering it's remains that she began to frequently check it.  At first it was every hour, like she expected people to randomly get a hold of the address and send her interesting things.  

In all honesty, it lacked any excitement at all.  In six days the only thing she had received was a coupon for five percent off an ice cream cone at her least favorite parlor.  The young girl dismissed the email and went on about her day without thinking much of it.  

Of course, on the seventh day she became curious once more and logged onto her mother's laptop in order to check her inbox.  She was happily surprised to see content when the page opened in front of her, but also slightly disappointed to see where the email had come from. 

It was just from that stupid 'future self' writing website.  She moved her cursor to delete the darned thing before she realized what the email was.  It wasn't an affirmation that her letter had been received, it was a response.

Freida eyed the thing before allowing her curiosity to get the best of her and clicking the blue link.  It lead her to a strange page on the web unlike any she had ever seen.  What was most notable to her was the short and choppy sentences that had been quickly typed out.  It was similar to her own lazy writing style, which luckily meant that it would take no more than a minute to read.  

It started out oddly, but nonetheless Frieda continued to read;

Dear Past Me,

Stop being a dick.  Like, seriously.  You're not as perfect as you think you are.

Stop pretending to like Zachary Rodriguez just because you're afraid to admit you like a girl.

That's right.  You're a lesbian.  

Lezzy, lezzy, lezzy.

Get over yourself, you're not so special and mom and dad will understand just fine.

Speaking of which, 

Stop acting like your a perfect princess and like they're your servants.  They're not.  They're your parents.  Their purpose is literally to make you miserable until you can learn to handle shit on your own.

Also, stop quitting everything you try, because, SURPRISE, life doesn't just drop talent in your lap.  Take my advice and stick to your hobbies, no matter how much they might wear you out.  

It's worth it.

Oh, and a minute on the lips is a life time on the hips.  I'm just saying. 

As for right now, little me, quit being a prick (seriously, other people have feelings too) and start making some real friends.  Oh, and start hanging out with that cute seventh grade girl that you have a mad crush on.   A three year age difference means nothing in college.  

P.S. You're totally not going to be a lawyer, so just get that out of your head.

Peace out, little me!

Sincerely, 

Your Future Self.


Freida stared at the message for a long minute before closing the laptop and going in search of her mother.  

Something very strange was going on, but suddenly she had the overwhelming desire to be assured that everything was going to be just fine.  ",procrastinationyay

Special Inquisitor Kradduc had a name and nothing else.  There was a plot against the Emperor and all Kradduc had was the name Saelon, which floated in whispers and rumors in the poorer quarters.  They had caugh one assassin, but as soon as it became apparent he wouldn't escape, he uttered the word Saelon, and some hitherto unnoticed enchantment ended his life. 

Dissemination of this information, the word Saelon, yielded little information.  All that anyone knew is that it was a name.  Rumors of a champion, a villain, an order of assassins, an enchanter, even one rumor of a village idiot, though that was quickly disregarded as the ramblings of a drunken fool.

So it was that Kradduc donned a disguise, one resembling a day laborer, and headed towards the poorer quarters of the Imperial City.  He spent a few hours weaving in and out of taverns and public houses until he found what he was looking for.  People that he recognized.  His career brought him across many unsavory types, some were dangerous.  Most were acceptable sources of information, and expendable.

He entered the tavern with a slightly exaggerated drunken stumble, and made his way to an unobtrusive seat where he could see the entire tavern clearly.  He offered the barmaid a mark, and she brought him a beer.  He took a sip and stifled a grimace.  Bad enough that it was poor quality, but it tasted like it bad been watered down with drain water.  *The things we do in the name of the Emperor*, Kradduc thought to himself.  So it was, Special Inquisitor Kradduc sat in the most disgusting tavern he had ever been in, surrounded by the most disreputable people he'd ever met, nursing the worst beer he ever tasted.

"[WP] You are a time traveler, you decide to stop Hitler's political life, not by killing him, but by changing an event in his life.",akahime-,"The youth sat ragged, dirty, his brown hair wet from the evening's rain, and all of his possessions slightly damp from the humidity in the air. 

It was a Thursday evening, in the bustling city center of Vienna, around 7:02 pm. 

The young boy had lost his family, and was now making his living selling postcards to tourists who would pass by. He was not very good at drawing organic subjects, but he had a knack for architectural renderings, and so was set up in front of the Viennese Capitol, drawing it's grand pillars over and over again with pencils and oil paint.

A middle-aged couple approached him, and the woman was adorned in thick, brown furs; her fiancee was an older gentleman, wearing rounded spectacles, with an oblong face, and a gray moustache.

“Oh please, Ezekiel, I want one of these cute postcards,” she said, placing her well manicured, painted hands on his gray coat lapels. They were obviously drunk, and had just left some sort of event. 

“Say kid, how much for one of these postcards?” The older man said, barely holding back his laughter. 

The youth's eyes averted his gaze, looking at the polished black shoes he adorned, gauging how much to ask. “Fourty schillings,” he responded. “Fourty schillings? That's all? Here, take a hundrer,” he said, quickly wadding the money into his hands.

The couple slowly waltzed down the street under the dim yellow lights, and he could see, from the far end, that she threw his postcard into the trash. The cards he had spent the better part of an hour working on. “God damn filfth,” he said to himself.

He wheeled his cart forward slowly as the night was drawing, and approached the news vendor stand near the trash bin where his postcard was. There, was a magazine on sale for about ten schillings. “I'll take one of these please,” He said, showing the stand-owner the fresh one-hundred. 

“What's your name kid?” The stand owner asked. “Adolph.” The youth answered. “I saw that couple just now, and I think what they just did is disgusting.” He said. He held the magazine over the stand's edge, it was the famous magazine, Spiegle, the cover of which read: “Reparations for World War I, was it truly Europe's fault? Cover story on the fifth page, see how we expose the inner workings of the Jews.” 

“Listen, you can't judge an entire people based on the actions of only a few.. what they just did was incredibly wrong, and I know because I'm just a simple stand vendor like you; but you can't take it out on them personally..” The stand vendor began.

Tears slowly began to run down the youth's face as his gaze went towards the floor. “**I hate them.** They don't know what my life is like – they laughed as they threw my work away, they literally thought it was trash.. and the money.. it meant nothing.. they just.. *I have nothing.. and....*” He cried.

“Even the head of the art school thought I was worthless.. All of them.... nobody understands.”

The vendor slowly opened the side door of the stand and walked around it approaching the youth, and getting down onto one knee, placing his hands onto the boy's arms. “No, I understand. I grew up as an orphan on the streets of London and spent my life searching for meaning; wondering if I was capable of forgiveness.. I completely, completely, understand.” 

The tears slowly became confusion. “W-wha?”

“It's not your fault. They're wrong about you. All of them. I'm sure of it. Why don't you show me one of your paintings?”

The youth laughed nervously, his face wet from the moisture and tears. He removed one of the hastily drawn ones from his bag, and showed it to the vendor.

“You were rejected from the Art Institute over this? The director must be mad.. you know what, I think.. I think, he was jealous. Jealous he wasn't as talented as you.” 

The youth laughed and pulled a small smile. “He probably doesn't realize the value of architectual drawings, you can make way more money designing buildings than you ever could doing portraits.. I mean, drawing the same faces over and over, that's easy, but to actually get the load-bearing properties of pillars right--” The vendor continued. “You know, he was probably just lamenting that he got stuck doing a shitty job as the art director, a dead-end career!” 

“Come on, come with me, just us two orphans – I'll get you into the Viennese Architectural School. My Uncle knows the director there. You're going to be the best god damned architect this country has ever seen.”

The two slowly walked down the streets of Vienna, the orange cover of the Spigele magazine remaining on the counter-top of the news stand unread. The bright yellow advertisements for “the National Socialist's Party” on the telegraph poles unnoticed. A world, steeped in vestiges of time, now frozen.

The wind blew steadily, and the middle-aged couple entered a cafe, folding their umbrellas.

“I wonder what happened to that boy?” The woman said, looking out the rippled glass across the street, to the now missing postcard stand. “What boy?” Ezekiel asked. “You know, the one who was selling the postcards-- it's strange.. he's missing, and I feel this.. void somehow.. I can't explain it.” She continued. “I haven't noticed how long he was out there, it must've been weeks... but.. I feel.. do you think we should go find him, Ezekiel?” She turned towards him.

“Oh, *that boy*. It's been a wild evening, and you're probably just overexcited. Let's just sit and enjoy some latkas. I'm sure you'll forget about the vagrants by the morning.” “Waiter! Latke and chornaya kafe!” He concluded.",Mohevian

And then, like a switch had been flipped, the man was calm. He stopped shaking, he rose to his feet, and said, ""Mr. David, you may threaten my life, but do **not** insult me by claiming I ordered a pizza with green olives. And we both know it was eight minutes late.""

Was the man right? Had David misremembered some of the details of that night? And how did he know David's name? Frankly, that wasn't important. He was much more concerned with the man's sudden change in disposition.

""You're probably concerned with with my sudden change in disposition,"" said the man. ""Yeah, you're annoyed at how well I'm reading you right now. And you're really annoyed that I've pointed out how annoyed you are. Well, here's the thing: I am damn good at reading people. All those years ago, I remember seeing you and thinking, 'this is one vindictive little sonovabitch, I bet if I push his buttons, he'll never forget.' And you're here now, so I think I read you pretty well back then. Now, you're probably wondering why I taunted someone I knew to be dangerous. Well, that's because I'm impulsive and reckless. It's a serious problem, and it may get me killed someday. Today, perhaps. After all, I can tell the difference between a man capable of murder, and and a man who isn't, and you're one of the former.""

David's head was spinning. This was supposed to be a simple murder, but now things were complicated. He looked down at the snake in his hand. ""Do you actually have a daughter?""

""That doesn't matter. I can see you've already decided what to do, and you're the kind of person who can't be swayed once his mind is made up.""",impromptu_icarus

It’s time for my revenge. 58 years of pizza delivering, and I’m finally retired. Every last person on this list will feel my wrath.” he said to himself. He was laughing, very evilly. He had many perfect plans, plans he had spent years developing. All of them would be finally executed after years of waiting, today.

He waited a few hours, just enough so that he knew his victims would be asleep. He grabbed his bag, full of the supplies he would need to execute the plans. He went to his first victim’s house, and went in the back door. He grabbed the items out of his bag, and went to work.

"[WP] A pizza delivery man retires, goes home, and takes a list out of a drawer. A list containing the address of every customer who has wronged him.",athiktos,"Larry had a list. It was old, it was crumpled, it was covered in pizza grease. It started on the back of a discarded paper bag, then continued onto a long string of napkins and scraps of paper. The list was long, it was detailed, and it was vulgar. Larry loved his list. 

You see, Larry was a pizza delivery man. And not your normal snotty faced teenager pizza guy, no, Larry had been delivering pizza for fifteen years. He was good at what he did, he was fast, he was polite, and he always gave correct change. Larry was a proud pizza man, he was a good pizza man, and Larry had a list. 

The worst part of Larry’s job were the people. There were fat people, skinny people, cheap people, young people, old people, nice people, and many, many mean and impatient people. Larry didn’t like people. He especially didn’t like the mean and impatient people. In fact, he hated all the vapid, inconsiderate, idiots that he had to serve. It killed him to hand over a perfectly made, round, steaming pizza, dripping with cheese and crafted with care, to them. Larry despised those people, and Larry had a list. 

On the last day of his job, Larry went in his house, opened the drawer, and pulled out his list. He smiled as he read it, *8/4/12 - 378 Elm St, Bulbous sack of fat paid me in pennies, 8/11/02 - Kids on Cross St pelted my car with eggs, 9/1/12 - 89 Riverside, Jerk threatened me with a potholder when I couldn’t honor his cupon, didn’t give a tip.* So it went on, a thousand transgressions piled up through the years, each one carefully recorded. Larry was very particular about his list. 

So that day, Larry took his list and his car and he drove around town one last time. Outside a great many houses, he would place a brightly wrapped box, tied with silver ribbon. On each box was a small card, and on it was written:
*Hello, You may know me as your pizza delivery man. I am retired, and I wanted to give you all a little something before I go. -Larry* Larry drove his route gleefully, chuckling as he crossed of names and places. As soon as he was finished, he threw his list out the window and sped away to the airport. Larry was gone, and so was his list.  

That night, the screams of the people along Larry’s route littered the night. As they opened their boxes, expecting to see a small trinket, or hopefully some pizza, they were instead attacked by little balls of fur. They were ambushed by slobbering mouths and tiny claws on tiny paws and little sharp teeth on little mouths. There was not a peaceful house that night. They had all been visited by Larry, and Larry had a list. 

Larry didn’t like people, but Larry like animals. And Larry wasn’t just a pizza man, no, Larry was a graduate student studying genetic manipulation of living organisms. But getting to play with DNA all day was expensive, so Larry was also a pizza man. But Larry had just graduated, and he was off to Germany with a fancy new job. But Larry felt like he needed to do something for the people on his route, for paying for his college. That’s why Larry made the list. 

Every one on his list, everyone who had wronged Larry, were given a very special type of gift, a gift that could only be given from someone like Larry, who had been studying them for years. That night, every person on his list was ambushed by the cutest puppy they had ever seen. Each puppy was designed to fit his master’s needs perfectly, being quiet or loud, small or big, active or calm. They were the perfect pets, and loved by all the comunity. In the box, with the puppy, was a postscript to Larry’s note. It said: 
*This is a dog. Use it to teach yourselves how to be kind and accepting, please. He’ll be better behaved than you ever were, because you weren’t very nice to me, which is why you were on my list. I hoped you enjoy your pizza, and I hope you enjoy the dog. Auf Wiedersehen! Larry*

[WP] You live in a world where marijuana (not alcohol) is the substance of choice,eitanr95,"It's not an easy life I chose for myself... Most weekends I end up heading over to the local dispensary and smoking until I passed out. My wife hardly knows what kind of business I'm involved with, let alone that I'm a weedaholic, but what can I do? I have a family to support.

I had a rough childhood. I often came home to a mother and father so blazed out of their minds that I practically raised myself. I had to do the laundry, clean the dishes, make my own dinner, and put myself to sleep. Somehow I managed to make it through high school with a 3.0, and enrolled at Oregon State, my dream college, on student loans and a job at the school bookstore. It was around sophomore year where everything turned around.

I was a real social guy. I would go out and party three times a week at the least. Of course that didn't help my studying much, especially waking up the next day and missing class because the carpet felt really cool. One day I found myself at Wilson Owen's party. He wasn't just cool, he was a hero. No one could compare to a kid like Wilson. The looks, the intellect, the wit, and the athleticism. If there was anyone at Oregon State that any single person could name, it'd be Wilson. Obviously I wanted to get to know the guy, but what could I do? He was always surrounded by his football buddies and hot chicks. I'm sure you'll understand my disbelief when I walked in a room and saw him taking shots with his buddies.

I was just looking for the bathroom, and all it took was this one mistake to change my life. He told me to join them, to try it. I was very hesitant. All those health classes in school, all the stories of car accidents, and of course.. the law. I really wanted to meet him and my lesser instincts took over. I joined the group, and I took a shot of that golden whiskey.

The awful taste sure left a bad first impression, but nothing can compare to the feeling of that burn in my throat and the buzz. Oh man, the buzz. I couldn't believe how much time I was wasting getting high. It always felt like there was no gravity making it hard to walk, but in a good way. It was on THAT day, I destroyed my life.

One drink led to the next, I wanted every beer, every wine, even the shitty pink stuff. There wasn't a brand I wouldn't be willing to taste because every time it led to that same buzz. I ended up dropping smoking entirely, just so I could afford more alcohol. The shit was expensive! I'd pay $160 for a 25oz bottle of wine without thinking twice about it. I had to drink it.

Things went downhill fast.

I would often find myself drinking too much, to the point where I could hardly remember anything from the previous night. I got fired from my job at the bookstore, I ran out of money, and my grades got me kicked out of the school. I was on the street, homeless, jobless, with an alcohol addiction. I bounced from one homeless shelter to the next, taking every advantage of food or a roof over my head while I slept. It was at one of those shelters I met the love of my life, Cindy.

She had the kind of smile where you couldn't help but just... smile, y'know? She could turn any sadness I ever had into happiness and determination. It didn't help that she was in a similar situation as me, but we certainly raised each other up, and that was certainly what I needed. By some miracle I found a job in retail working at a Costco while she unfortunately found herself trapped in fast food. Together, we were able to pay for an apartment we shared, and I loved every moment I spent in it with her.

Fast forward 6 months, Cindy and I are happily married, and she's 3 months pregnant. I'm fucking terrified. Both of us can barely afford living just by ourselves, how the hell are we supposed to take care of a kid? It was just another boring day working at Costco where at this point I was the head of product sales management, which is a fancy way of saying I'm a cashier that can tell other cashiers what to do. This day, someone came down my checkout aisle that I never would've expected to even see for the rest of my life. Wilson Owen. With great doubt that he would even recognize me, I avoided eye contact and pretended not to see him. He shouted my name, and I thought to myself ""fuck, this is going to be embarrassing"". I ended up telling him about what happened and where I was at, and he told me he could hook me up with a few of his friends that have jobs available and that the pay would be great. I figured that sounded great, so I went ahead and gave him my number. This was both for better and for worse.

Literally the next morning I got a call from some guy with a heavy Russian accent, telling me to meet him for lunch at a fancy restaurant downtown. I told him there was no way and I had work, to which he responded he would hire me and pay me tenfold what I was currently earning. How could I refuse that? I called in sick that day, which my supervisor wasn't very happy about, and went to the lunch. I knew things were fucked when I walked in and saw he was the only person in the empty restaurant, aside from two massive bodyguards in suits standing by his side.

I'm sure you know where this is going at this point, and I said yes. All I had on my mind was the kid I had on the way. I was scared and I had found an answer. I knew this wasn't right, perhaps I figured it was a temporary job, but I took it. My parents probably never expected me to be a alcohol dealer.

Fast forward four years to today. I've got a huge house, I've got a beatiful wife, I've got two kids plus one on the way, and a bunch of people who want me dead. I found myself drinking a bit too much of the product without the means to pay for it, and racked up about about $200,000 of debt to my boss who I haven't spoken to in a few weeks. Marijuana really helps take the edge off the fact that soon I'll probably be gone and my wife will be alone to take care of three children.",Slayergramps

[WP] The life of the first immortal human,meepwn53,"He sits with his legs crossed, a moss green blanket covering his forehead and the back of a black and white sheepdog with dirt on the tips of its fur.  The busy pedestrians of New York City pass him by with no second thoughts, but thoughts are all he has now.

The blanket falls from his head and reveals a thick forehead made heavy with fat wrinkles that fall on the ridge of his brow.  A little girl takes notice and gasps, her mother pulls her closer and gives a concerned look at the weathered homeless man.  Though he has sat there for weeks, a regular for the denizens of Chelsea, he has seen more of the world than anyone else would in a lifetime.

If a mortician studied the body of the man, if he'd ever die, he would send the bones to an anthropologist in sheer confusion. No one in recorded history looked as he still does, bent backed and patient.  His thicker bones and large eyes now look alien to the rest of the world, a thing for museums to reconstruct.  But he licks his lips and thinks of what he would eat for the evening.

From the Cradle of Civilization to the nest of the modern world, he has traveled under many names.  He has advised kings who did not heed his words, he has drank from the gutters of Industrialism.  He has never married, nor has he fathered any children.  God forbid, he thinks, that they should suffer from his curse.

The life of a pauper is not much different from the life of nobility, each with their own difficulties that lead to the grave and the succession of a name.  His favorite time was that of a shepherd, alone and quiet, about 300 years ago, before two large armies in black and blue armed with muskets and cannons had destroyed the hills with gunpowder and iron.  He moved West throughout the ages, but conflict has always followed like a stench he assumes to be his own.  His speeches on the mistakes of Man throughout history were seldom listened to, sometimes trapping him in the court of nobility.  But royalty is fickle and always changing.  How he hasn't been executed yet is a mystery to him.

Even the trees around him have changed in his time, now a decoration for the comfort of those younger than him.  They used to be shelter, when he thought seclusion was the best option for him, and this too changed when new houses needed to save the growing flock of man.  Smoke was a thing to get used to, the lifeblood of progression.  He tried smoking for a time, thinking it would end that which he grew tired of.  Though he is immune to that as well.

He strokes the sleeping belly of the animal next to him.  The 200th of a line of loyal creatures he has kept by his side since his life in Russia.  He can mutter pleasantries in 50 languages, many now long extinct except in the halls of established colleges.  English does him no good, its people too busy to listen to the stories which may as well be fiction.  Now he whistles to the birds and nods his head to the occasional pattering of coins in a can.  Life is as good as it can be after countless ages he does not know the names of.

He lies down with the intent to sleep.  It is 5 o'clock, and at midnight he will relocate.  Something draws him to a thicker populace, a lesson he might still learn.  Mankind is a beautiful thing, he thinks, and it takes longer than a lifetime to capture its glory.

Wednesday

 I was seven when they first brought me to this facility. I am twelve now.  I have been twelve in a long time.
 
When they first brought me in, I vaguely recall hearing *""brain dead""*.  Later, I found myself waking up from the longest sleep I have ever had. I didn't know anything, where I was, who I am, and who I've become.  


Those things I would have to thank Mr. Warren for. Mr Warren was not supposed to tell me who I was. He should never have known who I am. He should have just always have known me as the *""sleeping girl,""* The specimen which have been in the glass for a hundred and thirty years. 

The day I woke up the only thing he told me was my name, Dorine Clay.
 Mr Warren told me Clay was a kind of soil. I had asked him what soil was.

Mr. Warren was the one who cleaned the room I stay in. He had cleaned twenty-five out of one hundred rooms in this building. "" I clean all  the important rooms"" he had once told me. Maybe that meant I was important. 

I never knew who my parents were, and in this year, it would no make sense to seek them out, they're probably dead by now. I have no family,  I will bear no children because I will never be capable of it. I only know Mr. Warren.


Mr. Warren died today.
Mr Warren once told me that one of most painful human sensation is loss. I have never felt loss. I have never had anything...until now.

I will always remember the last smile on his face as he welcomed death. The smile he had as he asked me to promise one thing.

That among immortal humans, I should be the last.

""What the hell happened here, Misty?"" 

""I told you, it's MYSTIQUE!"" The robed woman shouted, arms flying as sparkles filled the air. 

""Whatever - answer the question.""

'Mystique' rolled her eyes. ""A.M.B.E.R said something or another that Qui'lah found offensive. Y'know, our typical Tuesday afternoon."" She turned back to her spellbook, and continued doing whatever strange demonic ritual she had started in the pot on the stove. Daphne hoped that wasn't their dinner.

A.M.B.E.R., which stood for AutoMated Battle-Existing Robot, grumbled in her strange electronic way. ""Bzzt- I was not aware that one would be offended by suggesting a game of chess -bzzt."" She spoke in a monotone voice that still conveyed her annoyance. 

""How dare you say such a sickening word to my face! On my world, no one would be so *crass*!"" The armored creature shrieked, the two having separated after Daphne kicked both of them in the side.

Tearing off her mask, the creature revealed a face of green skin, long teeth, and 4 yellow eyes. She snarled as she pulled a glowing blue dagger out of the sheath on her waist. Her metallic roommate's face remained as stoic as ever, but one would find it hard to ignore her now glowing red eyes. A.M.B.E.R. raised her arm, which transformed into some strange mix of a gun and chainsaw. 

Before anything could get destroyed, Daphne whacked both of them upside the head with a frying pan. ""Stop it,"" she snapped, scolding them like they were naughty pets. ""First of all, you're from a different planet, Qui'lah. Not everything is the same. You don't even fully understand the English language - I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding."" The alien snarled at the robot again, but stopped after another smack. 

""And you! Stop starting fights whenever you can,"" she shouted at the feminine battle robot. ""Just control yourself, damnit.""  The android beeped, annoyed. ""Bzzt- daily quota of battles has yet to been fulfilled. Must seek more comba-BZZT!!?!""

The luminescent blue dagger from before cut her off, sinking deep through the back of her head, the tip sticking out of her left eye. Daphne and Misty, who had been watching from the kitchen, froze. A.M.B.E.R. slowly turned from Daphne to face the alien assassin behind her. The smirk of victory suddenly disappeared as the android launched forward, rocket propellers making the impact *so* much heavier than it should've been.

Daphne sighed in exasperation.

                             Revenge of the RADICAL Sith
     The galaxy is.....You know what, just read the rest of it, why does this prologue exist?
     


Darn it! The invisibility on my Sith Infiltrator went out again! I put the ship into landing sequence. I fail horribly, crushing a few trees on my way down. I open the hatch, and way too much smoke comes out of the opening, and because it is so clouded around me, I bump my head on the way out. Not hard to do when you're a Kaminoan.

I am Darth Sithwad. That's what my master called me, so I had to go with it. I was told I had to hunt a Jedi down. Some Twi'lek who stole toilet paper from the secret base. My master sent me out to kill him. I press a switch by the entrance of my ship and my probe droid flies out. I call him Wally because he is a WL-LY series droid. Not very popular, I seriously wonder why. He has lots of personality, but he can be clumsy at times. Wally crashes into a nearby tree and explodes. So much for that plan. I have to hunt the Jedi myself.

I start running through the forest all stealthy like, and some Wookiee runs into me. I don't care, everyone makes mistakes. I let him go along on his way. After a while of LITERALLY RUNNING INTO TREES, I finally see the small Jedi temple. It is rather shabby, carved into a giant tree that was already decomposing. I go inside on tiptoes, because that's the most stealthy Sith way to enter. 

Inside, the temple is, not surprisingly, decorated AWESOMELY! A shag carpet lines the floor, and randomly shaped small mirrors are placed on the wall. Even though the Twi'lek's house is so AWESOME, I still have to kill him. I hear a toilet flush, and the Jedi walks out with a piece of SITH TOILET PAPER stuck to his foot. I can tell what toilet paper it is by the sith insignia on every square.

""Um, I have come to kill you, uh, Jedi!"" I was so fierce.

""Okay, go ahead."" The Jedi smirked, obviously in fear. I reached my hand towards my lightsaber. It was the ABSOLUTE COOLEST in the galaxy. I pressed the button on the hilt. Two RADICAL hot pink blades jut out of the hilt, which by the way, has purple flames painted on it. I take my hand and pull off the hood on my tiny head. MY bright orange robes help me to look cool.

The Jedi pulls out his own blade. The green blade is nothing compared to my FABULOUS beauty of a lightsaber. We get to battle and he disarms me with one swing. No matter, I have force lightning. I raise my hand and end up shocking myself.

The Jedi seems to be hiding another fearful smirk. I try to force choke him, but just end up squeezing his belly.

He slowly falls to his knees and says ""Oh no, you have defeated me! Darth...umm""

""Sithwad.""

""Yes, Darth, heh, Sithwad, you may have your bounty.""

""Your life?"" I had succeeded.

""No, the toilet paper! I went to the store yesterday and bought some 2-ply. You Lords of darkness should really get some that's not so itchy.""

""Okay! I shall claim my prize!"" I pick up my lightsaber and the Jedi drops the toilet paper on the hilt. This was so RADICAL! Master will be so proud of me!

I walk back to my ship and switch it on. It sputters. Out of gas. Welp, guess it's time to go to the gas station. Two missions in one day? SWEET!",Brizzel_The_Lizard

He'd been fired from multiple jobs for causing distractions, lost multiple girlfriends for reasons even Eddie himself never wanted to discuss, and no one would hire him. They figured that if Mr. Hall was a superhuman, he'd probably want to be off saving the day or something, right? Wrong. Eddie was Eddie, and that was it. 

One day, he was sitting in the park and his lasers went off. A couple of passing hipsters took notice and began to praise him on his originality in the light-show, as Eddie sat, helpless to do anything as light beamed from his hands, face, feet and pants.

TWO YEARS LATER
A flyer flutters by in the wind, having broken free of its poor staple job. Reading, ""Light DJ Hall"", it heralded new beginnings for a certain abled person.

He embarked on this journey at the beginning of his memory. None of his crew remembered the days before the southbound trip.

One of the lonely days, he surveyed the south and noticed something. The sky was looking rather... flat, for lack of a better word, only a mile away. The clouds were puffy, but the actual sky had a strange texture. A few days later, they made it to the sky. All of the wall was painted blue.

Everyone suddenly heard a deep voice drilling through their head, ""Hello, Captain.""

Frederico piped up, ""Who are you?""

""Look behind you, Frederico.""

""Are you behind the wall, sir?""

""Frederico, I am the wall. More specifically, I am the Fourth Wall.""

""I have heard of you. La iglesia de la cuarta pared.""

""Oh, yes. I forgot he wrote that in.""

""Who? Wrote what?""

""That's actually tangential to the favor I'm about to ask. I'm breaking. More and more as this story goes on. I know you have questions, but you need to leave in 4 lines of dialogue. You can't handle the author.""

""And, what? I'm supposed to trust a wall that I've never met before? You could be a phoenix type of creature and reform. There could be any sort of treasure behind you. There could be the most powerful magic known to man and to God. I'm not leaving.""

A massive crack appeared in the wall. ""Leave! NOW!""

""NO!""

""May the author have mercy on your soul."" And the wall exploded inwards. What Frederico saw he could not describe. But, I can. He saw words describing exactly what was happening.

""Is... Is that you, God?""

I am writing words on a tablet. I guess, that is godlike. Get it? 'cause the ten commandments? No? Okay. I am not actually a God. But, I did give birth to you and this world. It's been established that you remember nothing before the trip. But, you must know, at least instinctively, people don't live millennia.

""But, am I not special? You said you created the world and you choose to focus on me.""

Frederico. Poor Frederico de la Montenegro IV. Look around at your crew. Do you know any of their names? No. No, you don't. Because, they are cardboard cutouts. As a matter of fact, when I began writing, they didn't exist. In a manner of speaking, they still don't exist. They are amorphous, their appearance at the whim of the reader. Also, think of the world. What do you think is happening in your home country? Do you know why you traveled southbound? Because I made you. I influenced you to return to the place of your birth. And now, my child, return home to the first wall.

It took me years to finally find it. The end of the world. You would of expected something like, I dunno, an endless abyss into nothingness. No, nothing like that. There is a wall. And it talks... It is slowly driving me insane, with it's CONSTANT mutterings, and shouting in the middle of the night. It calls itself the fourth wall, and I can see that it is slowly fracturing. Slowly.

13th June 1879
It seems finding the end, has trapped me in a limbo. My ship no longer moves, with the exception of the bobbing in the waves. The midday sun is burning through my clothes, becoming ever hotter.

The shoutings have become unbearable, and the wall is breaking evermore. The rest of my crew are dead due to unknown causes. I am the only person left here. I hope Mother England likes this... this SACRIFICE.

""India, do you suppose?"" said DeRilio.

Calabus shrugged. ""They are said to have strange, exotic customs. Perhaps...perhaps they have constructed a single stone wall that rises to the heavens and spreads beyond sight in either direction. Perhaps...""

""I..."" DeRilio scratched his chin. They had met the wall two days prior and followed it westward. ""It must *end* at some point?""

""No,"" said a voice that seemed to come from high and low and left and right all at once. ""Not necessarily.""

""Who's that?"" shouted DeRilio. Calabus looked back at what remained of the crew. They all shook their heads wearily.

Bits of rocks shook down from somewhere high up along the stone face of the wall. ""That was me. I am the Fourth Wall.""

""Ah,"" said DeRilio. ""So you're saying India has erected an enormous stone wall along all four borders? That's...well, that's a bit unneighborly, don't you think?""

""We just wanted to do a bit of trading,"" said Calabus, unsure where to look when addressing the wall. ""I've heard good things about *curry*.""

""No,"" said the Fourth Wall. ""I'm just a wall. You've reached the end of the world. Poor bit of navigating, that.""

Merellen, the navigator, slowly made his way below deck, his face as red as a salami.

""Wait,"" said DeRilio. ""If you're the *fourth* wall, where are the other three?""

""It's a theater term,"" said the wall. ""I'm not sure it's really worth explaining."" A bit more of the stone began to crumble and fall into the ocean on either side of the ship. ""Especially considering how little time you have left.""

""Come again?"" said DeRilio.

A fissure the size of a sea lion formed suddenly in the wall directly overhead.

""You haven't much time left. These prompt responses are short by their nature and your particular author is supposed to be working right now, so I'm supposing he'll want to wrap it up soon.""

""*Author*?"" said DeRilio.

""*Working*?"" said Calabus.

Just then a cannonball sized lump of stone fell off the wall and through the deck, in between where the captain and his first mate were standing.

""You're in a very hastily written story,"" said the wall patiently. ""The entirety of your life is this single encounter, right here, below a talking wall. I mean, it's not much of a life, granted, but it's what you got.""

""I don't believe that's true,"" said Calabus. ""You can't believe everything a wall tells you."" Some of the crew nodded at this.

""Well,"" said the wall. ""I suppose you don't *have* to believe me. But do you remember any bit of your lives before we started this conversation?""

""Yes!"" said DeRilio. ""I remember asking if maybe we'd reached India.""

Another Cadillac-sized hunk of stone fell through the center of the boat, which is a rather incongruent bit of description if you think about it, but what can you do? The ship began to list heavily to one side.

""That's where the story *started*,"" said the wall. ""But what about *before* that?""

DeRilio and Calabus stared at each other.

""In a better story you'd both have nice backstories. Families, perhaps. Goals. Motivations. A generous bit of character development, perhaps. I mean, no offense, but as it stands right now you're more or less the same character with a different name.""

""But I'm the *captain*,"" said DeRilio rather meekly. ""Right?"" 

""This can't be right,"" said Calabus, or maybe DeRilio, who really cares at this point? ""I don't want to die!""

Water sloshed up and over the deck. 

""Oh, you won't *die*,"" said the wall. ""This writer doesn't have much stomach for all those gory death scenes people like to go in for. You'll just sort of...stop.""

""Stop?"" said one of the two, mostly indistinguishable main characters. ""That doesn't sound any better.""

""Well...""

"[WP] After attempting to claim your soul, Death develops amnesia and becomes your roommate.",-JungleB-,"""Uh... Would you prefer *deviled* eggs to poached?"" Josh called out to the bedroom.

A tired voice sleepily called out, ""Man, why are you always asking me about deviled eggs, that shit has mayo, the spawn of satan. No one wants that crap.""

I stifled a giggle as he walked into the room. Giggles weren't manly. But man, my roommate sure was something. Speak of the devil. If anything he was closer to Satan than deviled eggs.

""Man, you look like *death*. Are you going to be *reaping* any souls- I mean profits- today?""

He gave me a funny slightly 'I'm-tired-of-your-shit' look and sleepwalked to the bathroom.

I've been getting used to him, even though he was trying to ""reclaim"" my soul and ""lead me to the underworld"" only a couple weeks ago. Honestly, after I accidentally banked him in the head, not from hysterics, I swear, I felt a little guilty. He wasn't much of a hassle, he paid his share of rent with his job at the landkeeping job at... The local graveyard. I guess he would gravitate to that field.

I just felt things might get hecktic in the underworld or wherever grim reaper like things such as himself was off duty.

He plopped himself down on a worn bean bag and settled on a morning round of Smash.

Carrying over a steaming plate of poached eggs, cilantro, and sourdough, my special expired-but-good college recipe, I grabbed a controller and handed him some breakfast.

After a few heated rounds, he started getting a bit angry, as myself being more experienced, seeing that he is a reaper of souls who had nothing to do with electronics.

Suddenly he threw the controller down and bolted up, clearly not happy his reaping skills. Something was off. His eyes glinted red and a murderous aura emanated from him.

""__Puny mortal, you dare test my strength? I will rip your skull from your spine, douse your corpse with the flames of the Underworld, then paint the skies with your blood. I'll burn your soul in the unquenchable flames of damnation and I, I will be victorious!__""

I stared at him for a long while, controller in hand.

""Dude, Mortis, it's just a game.""

He sat back down and the random curses passed.

""Huh, what was I going on about?"" He sank into the bean bag. ""By the way, nice eggs.""

At least he paid the rent.",BitterBonbon
[IP] Time Garden,Archontor,"""How long you been in here, old timer?""  
The old man turned away from the newcomer and adjusted his hold on the small bird cradled in his arm. He gently ran his fingers across the feathers on the bird's head as if to protect it or soothe its worries.  
""You hear me, old man? They say you been in here the longest. They liars?""  
The bird started to flap its wings, so he stood up and started gently cooing into its ears. He shot an angry look over his shoulder at the newcomer before walking away.  
""I guess you don't mind if I sit on your bench then, old timer.""
The old man stopped and turned to face the newcomer. He couldn't help but continue to rock the bird softly in his arms and speak softly but his expression and words told a different story.  
""I saw you tumble through the time-portal yesterday. You fell on your ass; you sprained your wrist; your face still shows the scrapes from when you tried to stand back up but fell straight forward in slow-motion. You're no different from all the others I've seen come and go through this place. You're a punk. Maybe you'll change and be something more. But you're a punk today and I don't let punks sit on my bench.""  
A smirk grew on the newcomer's face. He took a step toward the bench, then a quick step away, then another step toward in a taunting manner.  
""You gonna fight me with your precious baby in your arms? How long you gotta be in here before they give you a bird?""  
""Doesn't matter how long you're in here, punk, they don't give birds to punks.""  
""Man, you look ancient, old man. How long you been in here, anyway?"" The newcomer asked without even looking at the old man. He just sat on the old man's bench and adjusted his orange habit.  
The old man had been in this Time Prison for 50 years. He was 70 years old and he barely remembered saying goodbye to his wailing 19-year-old wife and their wailing 6-month-old baby. The Time Prison was supposed to be a more humane way to treat people convicted of crimes. Convicts still served their full sentences inside the prison, but for people outside the prison, it was as though no time had passed at all. It meant convicted parents could serve their time without missing their children; lovers would be separated for no longer than the few hours it took to process entry through and exit from the Time Portal; businesses wouldn't be thrown into chaos because of the imprisonment of an important executive.  
But it seemed to the old man that the powers-that-be, in their infinite wisdom, never considered how hard it would be to spend 50 years in a prison with no possibility of even a visit from a loved one. He couldn't remember what his wife's face looked like when she laughed anymore. They never thought about that, those powers-that-be.  
""Long enough."" is all the old man said. He sat down beside the newcomer and muttered, ""Punk.""  
""Grandpa, I can't even wear these rags right. How you get them to stay on you without falling down all the time. I could never hold that bird standing up. My pants would fall down.""
The old man chuckled. He didn't like the kid but watching him all morning in the garden it was clear that he had been the kid's last resort. The kid had initially tried to join in with the groomers. Not a bad choice because they got to be outside more than anyone else and use dangerous tools. But they like the quiet of the garden and the old man could tell the kid couldn't keep his mouth shut. The kid had next tried to join in with the ballers: a tough crew that played sports in the garden during their outside-time. But the kid probably insulted the wrong person in a misguided effort to make a joke, the old man assumed, because the kid had run away after a lot of shouting and a few punches landed on his face. The blood was mostly gone and dry now. Finally, the kid had tried to just hang out by himself. That meant standing by a tree no one else stood by because all the benches and most of the trees were spoken for. He'd found a tree, a little one with not much shade, but at least no one else had claimed it. Until one of the groups of bullies landed a few more punches and sent him away.  
""You gotta make a loop around your shoulders.""  
""I'm trying; I'm trying. It just makes no sense.""  
""How long you got in here, kid?""  
""A year.""  
""A year ain't bad. A year in here and no one will even know you missed a year of your life. You'll still look young and you'll live most of your life back on Earth.""  
The kid nodded and the old man thought about his young wife. He'd return to her soon but not as he was. Would she recognize him? Though he could only recall a general outline of her face now, he was certain the sight of her would bring back all those wonderful memories. But how would she react to seeing her husband aged older than her father? Heck, he was probably as old or older than her grandparents now. What type of relationship could they have? Would or should either of them want that relationship?  
""Hold this bird."" the old man said. 
""What? I ain't holding that thing, it's disgusting.""  
""This is the bird's bench. If you want to sit here, you have to care for the bird.""  
The old man gently passed the bird into the kid's arms. The bird started flapping but the old man cooed and told the kid to do the same. While the kid's face was next to the bird's ear, the old man stood up and walked toward the kid's bullies from earlier.  
""Out of our way, old timer. This got nothin' to do with you.""  
""This is my bench.""  
""That's our fish."" the leader said, gesturing toward the kid.  
""That's my kid. He looks after my bird because I'm getting old and I'm leaving here soon.""  
""We like you old man. You stay out of everyone's way and you look after your bird. But we can't let you claim our fish.""  
""I been in here a long time,"" the old man said quietly. ""A very long time. I spent most of my time waiting to get out, waiting to begin the life I left,"" the old man continued, his voice getting stronger. ""And while I waited I didn't live my life. I stuck to myself. I preserved myself for the life I thought was waiting for me back on Earth. But I'm an old man now and the life I was supposed to have isn't one I can live now. All I have left is caring my bird.""  
The leader laughed.  
""That kid cares for my bird now so I watch out for him.""  
The leader smirked like the kid had earlier and waved his followers forward. They came with punches and kicks and one punk had a shiv. The old man was no match for them but he kept throwing punches while he could. He took a beating and never screamed. The kid ran away--with the bird. The guards eventually came and when they'd sorted it all out, the bullies were banned from the Garden for the rest of their stay in the Time Prison.",anasurimbor16

[IP] Time Garden,Archontor,"A cold sweat collected in Nura’s palms as he gripped his sleeve’s coarse fabric. The scene had lost itself in a blur—one green to embody innumerable hues of color. On the other side, shrouded behind the dark purple barrier, stood a boy of the same age. Nura often wondered if the gate was a lens, enshrouding in darkness his side as the other, or whether the boy before him dwelled perpetually in night.

For days the boy’s lantern breathed a pale light into the darkness. Upon waking or before sleep, his face struck the same expression; not so much *at* Nura’s side, but *through* it—through *him*--in a penetrating glare beyond the green ether.

But Nura soon noticed that the boy’s lantern had begun to dim—at first, only slightly, but by the week’s end, in great, disconcerting waves. And before long, the once pale light flickered in a soft yellow whisper.

Shadows began to amass in the black forest behind the faint light. And although, as before, the boy’s blank stare lingered, his trembling body betrayed his hollow expression. 

Again the colors blurred to a single green as Nura’s focus tunneled on the boy, to whom he now signaled, with fists clenched, in a bid to slow the lantern’s inevitable end. Still the boy stood empty-faced as the figures loomed closer in the twilight. And as Nura sat defeated before him, the two for once occupied a single plane, harmonized at last, as it should be, in perfect light and in perfect dark. 

But Nura lived not for things as they should be, but for things as they are. And so, as he watched the boy fade, he turned away from the barrier to grab a lantern of his own. Yet, upon returning, he saw only darkness, and where the boy once stood, there was the night. 

Frantically Nura lit the lantern and shone it on the barrier. But try as he might, the light failed to pierce the gate. It was then, holding his lantern in the many hues of the bright green orchard, that Nura remembered the boy’s expression.

And stepping back, Nura once more noticed the cold sweat in his palms, the coarse fabric of his sleeves, but this time, watching the gate and holding his lantern before the darkness, he kept his face steady—eternal in its conviction, as in day as in night—and waited, as the boy had for him, to see the light on the other side.

"[WP] ""You don't just ask a girl why she's dead!""",Consta135,"Alysa slowly walked down the street. Her mind still on the assembly the school had held to share memories of Karen, Alysa her classmate who had recently died in an accident. They had been partners in the afterschool club for manga, sharing a burning passion for the Japanese art form. Though they had not shared with anyone their secret passion for one of the genres.


Shaking her head Alysa looked to her sides for traffic and crosses the street. While moving the few strands of hair that hang in front of her face to the side her thoughts went back to the assembly. When the headmaster had told the students of the grief-counselors she had been relieved. Her parents had each tried talking with her about Karen her death but Alysa did not know how to communicate her feelings and thoughts to her parents. She did not want them to know her most personal feelings and thoughts.


After the announcement she quickly got in a meeting with one of the grief-counselors. Just talking about it all with someone, trying her best to put her feelings into words, to share her thoughts released a burden from Alysa her body. She had not realised how tense she had been the last few days.


Turning another corner Alysa looked up at the sky. She had to be home before the sun started setting. Ever since Karen had died a new serial killer had appeared. Increasing her pace Alysa sped up. Looking in front of her the sight she saw made her automatically shout out Karen her name. 


Another girl who looked just like Karen, the same black hair, the same bag and strange socks walked in front of her. Her cheeks red with embarrassment Alysa ignored the other girl, she would not react to a name that was not hers anyway, and moved on. Hastening her pace Alysa was about to walk past the one she had confused for Karen when she turned around and her face, she looked exactly like Karen!


‘Kar- Karen? But how! You are dead?’


The copy of Karen stared at Alysa with a cold stare before answering with a whisper: ‘Hello Alysa, it is a shame we met. I had hoped to avoid you.’


Letting out a chuckle the girl who Alysa now thought surely had to be Karen added: ‘By the way Alysa, it is very impolite to ask a girl why she is dead.’


In shock from seeing her dead classmate Alysa her breath got stuck in her throat. Coughing loudly, opening her airways again she asked Karen how this was even possible.


‘You do have to pay the price, which is quite steep, for this Alysa. I am sorry about that but there are no exceptions.’ 

Nodding Alysa patiently waited for Karen to explain while at the same time trying to get her breathing under control. Listening to Karen Alysa was told an amazing story. Apparently Karen was centuries old, having been granted immortality by a spirit after saving it from a shaman. Having gone to school on and off for decades to get her mind of things, unable to get a job due to never growing up.


‘But I am sorry Alysa, I chose this street because you never take it. I was hoping to avoid you but sadly you are the twelfth person I met.’ Alysa stood there looking at Karen as a tear streamed down her friend’s cheek. With a feeling of warmth on her chest Alysa fell to her knees. Standing in front of her was Karen, holding a red knife in her hand. Alysa her vision faded to black as she heard footsteps that became softer and softer.


With a sigh of sadness for her friend Karen walked off. With one last whisper to her best friend from this school she said: ‘The price to pay is steep and has to align, for I have to return twelve souls for mine.’

"[WP] ""You don't just ask a girl why she's dead!""",Consta135,"At a young age I had used to go outside of my parent's Villa just to go to an old playground by an abandoned schoolhouse. Sure there were a few other kids that I could have hung out with, but the rusty old equipment and the gloominess of the place attracted me. An old seesaw that was so rusted that it was stuck, a slide that had metal chips poking through the surface, and monkey bars that looked like they would split in half with just a gentle tap.

It wasn't until the second week that I had gone to my special park that I noticed someone else there too. At first it was just slight movement out of the corners of my eyes, or the seesaw would give a sudden screech and move only an inch. I didn't mind as I spent most of my time sitting in the old mulch that lined the ground and stared at the sky, watching the time pass by and counting the clouds that were in shapes that I liked. 

That was when I met 'her'. As I was staring upwards while laying on my back, a girl suddenly leaned over into my vision. It was so sudden that I bolted upright with my heart threatening to breach my chest. ""It's awfully lonely around here and I've seen ya hang out around the school."" The girl says, both hands were clasped behind her back. As I had looked upon her with my eyes, there was something off about her. Wether it be the nightgown she wore that looked like it could belong to my mother in her younger years, or when I looked upon her everything else around her seemed out of focus.

""There's plenty a kids that hang around town. Why don't you go play with them?"" I ask while brushing the mulch off my clothing. Now that I looked at her a little more closely I could see that she was about the same age as me, though a little taller. Though with a glance towards her feet I see that she's barefoot.....and floating a couple of inches off the ground. ""So that's why....your a ghost?"" The ghost girl gave a nervous nod while bitting her now translucent lip. ""Must a been pretty lonely then."" Once more, the ghost nodded her head.

""If ya don't mind me asking before we hang out, how'd ya become a ghosty?"" No sooner had the question left my lips, the air that surrounded her glowed a little red in tint before fading. ""You know your not suppost ta ask a girl how she died."" she responds, something in her voice made me rethink about what I needed to do. So simply lying back down, I start to stare at the sky again. Patting the spot beside me, I could feel a slight movement in the air as she laid beside me. It took her a few moments to make sure she wasn't partially disappeared into the ground when I suddenly feel something icy grip my hand.

I didn't have to look to know she had reached and was now holding my hand with her own. A somewhat quite sob came from her but I kept staring at the sky. I didn't have ta ask how she died, since I was there when it happened. It was the reason why I still came to this playground by myself. A couple months ago me and her were inseparable and came here often. At one point while it was raining we both came here to still play. There had been another plaything here as well at that time and it was in the best condition. As were playing on it in the rain as it spun around, she slipped and hand scratched her arm up from all the rust. She contracted a severe form of Tetnis, so she had died later in her bed. Yet she stayed in the mortal plane to continue to play with me.

[WP] Your SO just got home from work. Moments later they text saying they'll be home late.,Consta135,"I looked up from Netflix as the knob on the front door twisted and the door opened. A moment later, my wife, Emily walked into the living room, wearing a shirt about twin powers. She places her phone on the table facedown and gives me her usual greeting of a hi and a peck on the cheek before moving upstairs. Everything seemed normal until she began talking.

""Hey honey, where is the bathroom? I forgot.""

For me, there were three things wrong with this question. One- the bathroom is right in front of the staircase with a sign with a toilet joke on it. That should've been obvious pretty obvous. Two- Emily has great memory, and has remembered everything about our relationship down to our number of blinks since we first met. Three- we have never called each other honey before. We usually are either on first name basis or say baby or babe.

""Immediately forwards when you make it up."" I here a sound of a door opening and a plopping sound. I go back to my show, but ponder over this problem for several minutes. I would've completely disregarded it had it not been for the text I received.

My phone buzzed, and I picked it up and looked at it. It was from my Emily. The text read: ""Hey Matt, I have a project I need to finish up at work. I will be home in an hour or two.

Curiosity got the best of me, and I picked up Emily's phone from the desk, and what I see shocks me. The screensaver has a picture of a flamingo on it, whom she regards them as ""fucking pink bitches."" Also, the clock said 8:46 p.m, and Emily always used military time. This was a huge problem for me. I rushed up to the bathroom and slammed open the door. She was dressed in a very small tank top and tight shorts, leaning over the sink in a seductive fashion. Another red alert, Emily and I hadn't had sex in a month- she was 7 months pregnant. And her stomach was not showing at all.

""Emily, what the hell is going on? I just gotta text saying that you-""

""Shhhhh"" she said as she place a finger on my lips. ""Just go with it Matthew, it'll be alright. Don't fight it.""

Suddenly, it all pieced together. This was my wife's sister. Emily's twin sister, Amelia, was a sociopath who killed for fun and games. And she was the only person besides my parents to call me Matthew. 

I ran away as quick as I could. Amelia followed. I heard a loud bang, and a piece of the wall exploded, which meant that Amelia had a gun. This made me run faster, and I realized that if I stopped, I would die. A couple more bullets whizzed past my head hitting more chunks of the wall. 

I made it to the kitchen before she could, and grabbed the largest knife I could find. She came in a moment afterwards, a look of pure frenzy etched on her face and the gun replaced with a pike. How did she hide a pike in those small pants? Panicking more, I flung the knife at Amelia, hoping for the best.. It tore easily through her left lung, and she began struggling for breath. Within seconds, she collapsed dead. With ragged breaths I immediately called 911. Hopefully if the real Emily came back, she wouldn't have a fit. She is very protective of me.",Cabester99
[WP] Your SO just got home from work. Moments later they text saying they'll be home late.,Consta135,"      I unlocked my apartment door after a long day of work. I expected to see my husband watching the evening news on the couch. But the couch was empty. Our daughter came out of her room and I asked her how her day at school was 
     ""Pretty good, at lunch I had to...""
      Just then my husband opened the door and said ""Sorry I'm late traffic was backed up to high hell there was an accident on I-64 that had traffic backed up for miles"" He was cut off by my phone's whistle that alerted me when I received a text. I checked the text from my husband which read
      ""Traffic is backed up for miles, I'm just going to pick up some food for dinner from subway, what do you want?"" I was puzzled that I had just received his text but I reasoned that it had just delayed because of the bad service in the area.
       ""What's wrong?"" My husband asked as he noticed the puzzled look on my face.
        ""Nothing"" I said ""I just now got the text you sent me"" 
        ""Yeah you know how bad service is around here sometimes"" he replied. Just then I got a call from my husband. 
         ""Who is it?"" My husband asked.
         ""It's... you"" I replied with a terrified look on my face.
           ""What's wrong daddy?"" My daughter asked as I answered the phone call. I hushed her and pressed the button to accept the call. 
           ""Hey I'm at subway, what do you want"" my husbands voice spoke on the other line.
           ""I... I..I.. What?"" I stuttered.
           ""You got my text right? I'm at subway what do you and Lexi want?"" He said back. 
            "" Who the hell is this?"" I yelled back at the person on the other line.
            ""It's Cameron!"" Yelled the person on the other line.
             ""No... No you're right here in front of me"" I screamed back.
             ""What's wrong what's happening?"" The man I was sure was my husband asked. The call ended and the request for a FaceTime popped up on my screen. It was from my husband's phone. I looked at my daughter then at my husband and accepted it. On the screen was a video of my husband in a subway.  
     ""What is wrong?"" He asked. I dropped my phone and fell to my knees. 
       ""Who are you people?"" I screamed. My husband tried to grab my shoulder but I smacked his hand away. He starred at me and raised his fist. My daughter lurched to try and grab him but he had already launched his big hand at my head. 
     I woke up in a hospital bed with my husband at my side, weeping. 
    ""Get him away from me!"" I groaned in slurred speech
      "" Oh my god"" my husband shouted. ""He's awake!"" A nurse rushed into my room and turned of a monitor that was beeping behind me and asked me if I wanted and water.
     ""Get him away!"" I said backing up to the wall behind my hospital bed. The nurse pressed a button and a doctor sprinted into the room. 
     ""What is going on?"" He exclaimed.
     ""He's having an episode"" the nurse explained. 
     ""No I'm not!"" I shouted ""He hit me!"" I said pointing at my husband. ""He did this to me, he shouldn't be in here!"" Just then a tall man in a suit walked in.
      ""I'm detective Sampson"" he said in a deep but calm voice. ""Your daughter is gone, the man who took her is gone. We need you to explain to us exactly what happened."" I broke down crying, how could my only child be gone? 
      ""He did it!"" I screamed weeping, as I pointed at the man I once loved next to me. 
      ""Sir, your husband has an alibi, he was seen on tape walking into a subway at the time the incident happened."" 
       ""But I saw him do it!"" I screamed.
       ""We're gonna need some assistance"" the nurse spoke into a speaker on the wall behind my bed. I was in hysterics, screaming at the detective and my husband. Two men in white scrubs ran in and pulled out a large syringe and stuck it into my fore arm. 
       ""Noooo!"" I screamed as my reality became darker and darker until I fell asleep.

"[WP] You were really drunk last night, and, long story short, you found a genie and wished for an never-ending bottle of beer.",DrBatman0,"I awoke on my couch to the sensation of liquid. That was not a good sign.

What was it this time, I wondered. How many times can Spike lick my alcohol-scented fingertips before going drunk?

Wait no, that felt like a pool of water. I opened my eyes and bolted up. The sudden movement cause the couch cushions to make a horrendous __squelch__. Liquid invaded my already soddened jeans.

""WHAT THE FLYING DUCK?""

I scanned the room, a strange foaming yellow liquid was flooding my room.

I heard a sloshing sound and found a bottle inundating the room with this fizzling liquid... Smelled like beer. 

I tromped through the liquor and righted the bottle. The liquid stopped. I peered inside. It was full...

Last night came back to me in a blur and I sighed. What was this going to be for me?

----------------

""Spike's Brewery and Pub is a new hit!""  the reviews proclaimed. ""The atmosphere is so-so but there's good beer at an unbelievable price! It's like they're handing it out for free!""",BitterBonbon

I must have gotten really fucked up."" I said achingly in awe.


I weakly reached out and grabbed it like an orangutan but I as I drew it near to me

 I noticed something odd about the label. 

it was a note. 

""Dear 1d107a,

 last night was a ton of fun!

true! Now that I own

all the oil companies in

saudi arabia I can really

live a life of leisure.""

""What the fuck is this shit?"" I asked myself. ""A fucking genie beer?""

I said loud enough to wake my cat up. 

I continued reading.

""Anyways, you're reading

your wish right now. A beer 

that never empties. I told

you that it was a dumb wish

but hey... I just grant them.

what kind of fucking genie would be named ralph? None of this makes sense... 

I've never met a ralph in my life. Rafael yeah but never a ralph. this is too odd.

Well... after I sat there in total confusion still drunk I looked in the bottle... 

There was a lime in it... 

""1d107a! are you awake yet?""

- Who said that?

What, you seriously don't think we do?

- No, who said that?

You did.

- What?

Yea, this is your other voice.  The silent voice.  The faint instinct in your brain telling you to do it.  All those twisted thoughts.  All those disgusting deeds.  I've always been here, you've just failed to acknowledge me.  But now that you're once again aware, we can pick up where we left off.  Finally.

- What do you mean once again?

Surely, you haven't forgotten?  Come now, Francis.  You must remember.

- I have no idea what you're talking about.

Of course you do.  That one night that changed your life, OUR life, forever.  The woman in the pink dress.  The longing looks.  The drinks.  The sex.  Of course you remember.  You must.

- Why are you doing this to me?  I've done everything possible to forget that night.

But I remember.  I've never forgotten.  It's a fond memory for me.  I often think about it at night, wanting more.  Needing more.  We should go out tonight.

- You're crazy.  We're not going anywhere.  We have a family now.  A wife.  Kids.  We have responsibilities now.  That was a long time ago.  I'm different.  I changed.

Sure you tell yourself that.  But have you ever truly believed it?

- Why wouldn't I?

Because.  We're a monster.  A monster never wholly disappears.  We just lurk in the shadows.  Waiting to strike our next victim.

- Stop it.

Oh, come now Francis.  You know you want to.  You haven't had sex like that night since you married this lifeless fuck doll.

- She's my wife!

Our, wife.  And let me tell you.  She's no good.  You need to get rid of her.  

- That's ridiculous.  How would I even go about doing that?  I couldn't.  We have kids together.

Just leave them all.  Take your life back.  Get rid of the dead weight.

- But-

The knife, Francis.  You're washing it.  All you have to do, is go into your kid's bedrooms.  Tell them goodbye, then tell your wife the same thing.  Then finish washing the knife.  Walk out.  Take your life back, Francis.

- I can't.  That's murder.  That's wrong.

Nothing you haven't gotten away with before.  They still haven't found you after all these years.  If you do it the right way, the way I'm telling you, no one would be the wiser.  

- I know I could get away with it, but I can't...

Then why have you stopped washing the knife?

With a balloon and a dream

A hope undeterred.

&amp;nbsp;

One day a voice heard

In a house long forgotten

Spirit Adventure

&amp;nbsp;

In the house I went

To hear the voice pretending

Then she saw me there

&amp;nbsp;

""Only explorers

Are in my exclusive club!""

She shouted loudly

&amp;nbsp;

""Do you think you have

The guts to explore outdoors

Welcome! you are in!""

Lost in true love at first sight

A real adventure

Years went by until

In white she partnered with me

Married happily

Our quiet little dream

Pennies saved away

&amp;nbsp;

Life is full of twists

A flat tire, a broken leg

our saved pennies spent

Happily we lived

Despite the unfulfilled dream

Dancing the days by

&amp;nbsp;

The days aged us fast

Till youth had faded away

Happines did last

&amp;nbsp;

Till one day I saw

Her picture from our first day

A dream reminded

&amp;nbsp;

So I sold it all

To fulfill the dream promised

Death had other plans

Im only feet away from the dungeon complex and I just get an odor, a smell of dominance already beginning to hit me. I was in shocked in confusion, How could the people of L.A. deal with this and act like it does not exist? So I took my question to a bystander. He happens to be very muscular and oh so tall. He was a giant towering over me. What was strange about him was that leather spiked collar around his neck. He was sweating profusely I noted as well. 

So I approached him and asked ""Hi, do you smell anything strange?"" 
""Oh before you answer that sir what is your name"" I pull out my badge to show him im FBI. He answers ""My name is VAAAANNNN"" that name struck me. It sounded so familiar for some reason. ""That smell?, what smell?"" he looks at me like im crazy ""Oh you mean the.... That smell, yes"" I ask ""Do you know what it is?"" 
He starts to look very nervous ""Yes, I dont know it exactly-ly-ly, I do know where it is coming from"" I ask him ""Reallly? where is it coming from?"" He points at this normal house next to the dungeon complex which surpises me. I go investigate. 

10 minutes later I came knocking on the door to hear grunting and screaming. The more I listened I heard very abnormal sounds,slapping,spanking, and wiping. 

I really wanted to quit being a detective at that point but I had to continue. Van opens the door for me actually. When I walk in the smell was worse. 

Van goes into this locker room to take off his collar I watch through a small crack in a bathroom. I still dont know where the dungeon is but It has to be this place. a man walks in and says this to van ""Hey leather man, the leather club is 2 doors down"" Van is enraged and screams ""FUCKKK YOUU"" a couple seconds later they both begin to wrestle while im taking photos. This might be the place. What really caught me is how van screams ""IM THE DUNGEON MASTER""

Two pillars carved from obsidian stood in the center of the basin.  A large red portal stretched between them, screams of the tormented escaped the swirling red vortex.  

According to his reports no adventurer has managed to defeat this particular dungeon. *Curious.* The monster Association ensures that each dungeon is beatable.  A monstrous hell spawn stomps out of the gate as Eric approaches.  The beast lowers its bullhead and snorts out a gout of flame.  

""Who dares enter the Gates of-""

""Save it,"" Eric said flashing his inspector badge.

""Oh, sorry sir, I didn't realize we were being inspected today,"" the beast said shifting nervously on hoofed feet.  

""That's how it's supposed to work,"" Eric said dismissively and walked through the red portal.

The ground was a fractured hellscape of red stone and fire.  Flames shot out intermittently from random cracks, large gaping fiery pits threatened to swallow any adventurer who took a misstep.   Tortured souls drifted along the red ether, moaning as they passed by.  He lifted his clipboard and found atmosphere. *Check.*

So far so good.  Nothing seemed impossible to beat yet.  A fiery serpent reared its head from a pool of lava and spit a ball of fire at Eric.  He waved his hand and the ball of fire dissipated in mid flight.

*Maybe I should have given them a warning.* He thought as he trudged through the dungeon.  Creatures roamed the land but soon realized it was best to avoid the inspector as he made his way toward the Spire, a large stone tower that stretched into the black clouds above.  He approached the stone steps and waved his badge in front of the giant obsidian gargoyle.  

""Right through here sir,"" the gargoyle rumbled.

The watch on his wrist began to vibrate, ten thousand steps.  *Nice.*  He walked up the infinite spiral staircase, a seemingly endless amount of steps stood between him and the boss. With a sigh he gripped the stone railing and climbed.  His watch vibrated again, twenty thousand steps.  He glanced over his shoulder and to his surprise, he was one step from the very beginning of the staircase.  On his clipboard he flipped a few pages over and read the reports again.  ""Unable to progress the infinity stairs.""  Eric had just thought it was a clever name but it turns out they are actually...infinite.  He made a note of it and whispered a word of command.  His feet floated a few inches off of the ground and he shot upward through the center of the staircase.  After a minute of flight he reached the top of the stairs and a black wood door.  Faces of the tormented were painstakingly carved into the black wood.  *Scary.* Eric pushed the door open and strode through.  Seated on a black wooden throne was a robed man.

""You are the first...the first after so many years, welcome to your death adventurer,""  the cold raspy voice of the Lich said.

""Nope just here to let you know you have a bugged magic staircase,"" Eric said.

""What?"" 

""Yup, the magic spell on your stairs is broken.  Someone took the infinite stair spell to literally and no one has been able to get here because of it,""

""Son of a bitch! Do you have any idea how long I've been sitting on this uncomfortable chair? Are you serious right now? Honestly look at this place, son of a bitch!"" the Lich continued to rant and cuss.

""Look at this dreary place, why is everything so damn dark all the time.  Creepy faces carved into every surface, I've been losing my damn mind up here hoping someday I would actually get to fight an adventurer!""  

""Good news, I fixed the spell so now you will have countless adventurers to kill.  They are already lined up outside right now,"" Eric said trying to comfort him.

""Good...send them to their deaths!"" he roared. ""Oh and thanks inspector, everyone said you guys were real assholes,"" he said.

""Just trying to do my job,"" Eric smiled and teleported to the entrance of the dungeon.  Brave adventurers waited anxiously to kill the Lich.  

""The dungeon is now open for business!"" Eric shouted and a cheer went up from the group of adventurers.  

*I wonder if the Lich understands just how many times he is going to be killed today...*

He checked his clipboard and found that the entrance was in order, nothing to indicate that it was a demi-portal to a hellish plane of unfortunate existence (for those that survived at least). He casually made a check beside the Level Indicator to show that everything was in order to wipe out careless adventurers and then hung an “Out of Order” sign across the entrance.

He then reached over and grabbed a small rock off to the side that appeared to be simply part of the landscape. Tugging on it gently caused a small window to open in a tree right beside it; a crystal glowed strongly on the interior. Good, the auto-revive functions still worked accordingly, and it appeared that the adventurers were not being over-charged for the process. He marked “Unsubstantiated” on his chart beside a list of claims, made sure his badge was properly displayed, and headed inside.

The cold, damp darkness was appropriate and he nodded in appreciation as he marked off another list of complaints detailing a lack of “appropriate atmosphere.” It was not his job to make sure all clients were happy, merely that the theme of the cave was maintained; in this case: surprise followed by surprising dismemberment. 

A wicked cackling began to echo on the walls around him and he smiled quietly as he made another check mark under “Timing.” He was about to step forward again when a witch stepped out around the corner. She appeared old and shrunken; her eyes hollow but ablaze with wicked magics. Her long, boney fingers were curled around an obviously magic staff, and her clothes were in bunched, molded rags. She smiled and began to monologue.

“Well, Traveler, what brings—oh. Hi, Marcus,” the witch said, stopping short.

“Hi, Harriet,” Marcus said as he began eye her costume. He checked ‘Satisfactory’ before stepping forward, “Surprise Inspection time.”

Harriet sighed heavily and pulled a wig off her head, revealing that her rotten, gray hair was actually long, clean, and blonde. She stood up straight, twisted to pop her back, and then sighed again in contentment. “How long is this going to take,” she asked before turning and walking back the direction she had come.

Marcus ticked off a few more items on the checklist detailing the excellence, as always, of her costume before hurrying after her. “It shouldn’t take long,” he said as he caught up and fell into stride beside her. “Most of the complaints we are having seem to be people feeling like the dungeon is either too hard, or too easy.”

Harriet paused at a cave wall and pulled on a long, seemingly dead vine. A shimmering light caused Marcus to blink, and when the light faded, he saw an opening into a comfortable sitting room with a warm fire, plush chairs, and a man sitting across the way looking up in mild surprise.

“Inspection today,” the man asked as he rose to his feet. He grabbed a towel from a sink and walked over to Harriet to hand it to her. The man looked human, but several things spoke to there being more to it than that; one of which was his pupils didn’t quite round out like they should. The man looked at Marcus, “We just passed our Annual Inspect four months ago. This seems rather sudden.”

Harriet began wiping her face down, revealing a reasonably attractive, younger woman. She smiled at the man and said, “Surprise inspection, Walter.”

Walter opened his mouth, closed it, and frowned. He scratched his chin for a moment, “I guess I’ll go get the paperwork then. Should I go tell Kzikl’a and Yiljk?”

Marcus shook his head, “I’ll need to see the entire operation eventually. Honestly, it’s good you’re here too Walter, since you’re the final boss of the dungeon. If Kzik and Yil are setting up their stations, then I see no reason to disturb them. It’ll help make this whole process go more smoothly.” 

Walter nodded, “I’ll just grab our paperwork then.” He looked at Harriet, “You got this for a few minutes, Hon?” 

“I got it, Walter,” Harriet said as she gently kissed him on the cheek and smiled. He smiled back and shuffled out of the room into an adjoining room. Sounds of drawers opening and papers flying about began to emanate from it as Marcus turned to Harriet.

“You two seem happy,” he said with a smile.

“We are,” Harriet added, “it’s the best gig we’ve had in 300 years honestly. Steady paycheck, souls to drain without consequence, and Walter even gets to roast the odd limb or two for date nights.”

Marcus nodded and pulled the paperwork off the clipboard. He muttered a small spell and the paperwork tripled in volume. He pulled the first few pages off, since they were completed, and turned to the primary complaints.

“So it appears,” he began as he passed over copies to Harriet, “that most of the adventurers coming through feel that the dungeon is a bit more complex than a Level 44 Hell-Spawn dungeon run.” He turned a page, “We have your justification on file, but would you mind explaining it again so that I can say we discussed it?”

Harriet smiled warmly and put her stack of complaints down. “Well when Walter and I first met, before your company existed, this was how we lured travelers in to their deaths for our sustenance. I had opened a portal to 5th Level of Hell, and Walter—“

Marcus interrupted, “Full name’s please, Harriet, for the record.”

Harriet nodded, “Duke Waltincator Bonebreaker of the 55th Regiment of Eternal Emperor Rul’H Souldrainer’s army, Father of the Untold Legions, and Lord Supreme of the 5th Level of Eternal Torment.”

Marcus smiled as he made a note, “Excellent. From now on you can refer to your husband as Walter.”

“So Walter and I had set up this great trap,” she said after Marcus finished writing, “in order to trick would-be adventurers into thinking our cave was just some poor witch’s hideout. No threat whatsoever.”

“But you are a Witch,” Marcus said as he checked his notes, “Of the ‘2nd Order of Malignant Darkness’ I have written here.”

Harriet smiled proudly, “Well yes, that is the case, but we didn’t want the travelers knowing that.”

“I see,” Marcus said as he made another note, “So deception is your primary source of sustenance to put it crudely.”

“Sure, you could put it that way,” Walter said as he walked back in with a large stack of papers. He set them down on the desk in front of Marcus and smiled at him. He ran a hand through his hair, causing small sparks to filter down around him. Harriet quickly waved her hands at him, sending the sparks away from the paperwork. He smiled at her and then sat down a small distance from the table.

Marcus leaned over and picked up the stack, “These are your records and permits?”

“Yup,” Walter said as he waved another shower of sparks away from the paperwork and scooted a bit further away.

Marcus started to flip through them, “This includes your permits for murder, torture, dismemberment, evisceration, skinning, flailing, and unpleasant bodily insertions?”

“In alphabetical order,” Walter said proudly causing Marcus to nod in appreciation.

------

The trio sat there in silence for the next few hours as Marcus meticulously went through their work permits, their permits to hire the demonic servants on the 4th level of the dungeon, as well as the various work orders and paperwork to document all the adventurers, travelers, and hapless bandits that had wandered in over the years. 

Walter and Harriet occasionally answered a question or two about where certain things were being held, what their maximum time for torture sessions had been, who was still imprisoned, who had been changed into a demon, and which of the adventurers they had eaten, among other things. 

After another few hours, Marcus began to gather up all his paperwork and put it back on his clipboard. He handed the other stack of papers back to Walter and leaned back in his chair. “Well,” he said finally, “I have good news and I have bad news. Which would you like first?”

Walter and Harriet looked at each other, “The bad news?”

Marcus smiled, “The bad news is that your Level 44 rating is inaccurate and unfair to the would-be adventurers who are attempting to gather gold, magical artifacts, demon hearts, or other things of such importance.”

Walter and Harriet grimaced at each other but then slowly nodded their heads. “What’s the good news,” Walter finally asked.

Marcus’s smile grew broader, “The good news is that I am upgrading you to a level 60 Dungeon.”

Silence settled across the room as Walter and Harriet stared dumbfounded at Marcus. After another moment, Walter gently reached over and squeezed Harriet’s hand, “Honey, do you know what this means?”  Harriet slowly nodded her head and tried to speak but Marcus held up his hand, silencing her. 

“The paperwork will probably take a few weeks to process, but you will both be getting pay raises, as well as be allowed to apply for additional permits for torture, trickery, and possibly even some more magic spells.” Marcus reached over and shook Walter and Harriet’s hand, “Your set-up is what prompted me to provide the upgrade; very first class. With a few more tweaks to your system, you may even be able to upgrade yourself to a Level 80 in a few decades.”

Marcus then stood up, stretched, and smiled, “Now if you two wouldn’t mind, I would need to do a walk-through to finalize my assessment and insure that this will go through without additional questions.”

“We would be delighted, Marcus. Do you want to run it Inspector or Adventurer style,” Harriet asked as she began applying her make-up again.

“Adventurer,” Marcus said as he pulled a staff out of a small bag on his hip. “I haven’t had much free time in a while.”

“Excellent,” Walter said as he slowly began transforming himself into his demonic form. “If you manage to defeat me, then dinner will be our treat. We have a rump roast from the previous group that has been marinating for 12 hours now.”

“I look forward to it,” Marcus said as he turned and strode confidently back to the cave entrance.",grenadiere42

The boss starts off slow as is his style and then works himself into a lather over the number of complaints that have been flooding his desk. ""I gave that good for nothing 3 chances, Az you are my witness, have I ever given anyone 3 chances before?""
""No, sir you haven't"" I replied. 
""This is the last chance straighten him out or..""
""What? You'll delist his dungeon? He is the best 100 level boss this company has ever classified."" I replied.
""Last chance Az, you don't get him back on track it is both your heads!"" he yelled and for a flash I was reminded of what made Umbwe the president. I shivered and left the office to go talk with Bal for the fourth time. Ballatroix, Bal, for short was the best boss in the world. I had certified his dungeon a level 100 myself. In fact it was my first act upon becoming dungeon inspector. Only the 81st level 100 in history. Lately; however, he had taken to sending adventurers packing. No ramping up the difficulty, no openings, just  100% pain 100% of the time. Understandably this led to frustration among the adventurers, which led to me having to talk with Bal. Why me? I earned my reputation by being the first to ever complete a solo run on Bal back when he was the boss of the hardest 90 level dungeon in the world. Still my proudest accomplishment. He has a little bit of a soft spot for me and the office has designated me the resident Bal whisperer. 
""Bal? You in?""I called into the empty throne room.
""Back here."" I followed the voice into a side chamber where Bal the black dragon was flipping through a photo album. He handed me the album and pointed to a picture. ""Remember, Coro, whatever happened to him?"" he asked.
I looked at the picture of the terrified adventurer clad in silver dragon scale armor running from Bal who was cackling and letting loose a torrent of green flames. 
""He died on a easy level 80 that went south. His party left him high and dry and divided the loot among themselves."" I replied with a little bitterness. ""Coro was one of the good ones.""
Bal nodded and asked, "" Do you ever feel like all the good ones are gone or retired? Everyone is so....""
""Professional"" I supplied. He nodded. I looked up at him. ""Honestly you are right. The world has changed. Most guys aren't doing it for the fun or the adventure. Most just want to get paid."" I turned the page and pointed out a picture of Umbwe. ""Remember when Umbwe came out of retirement to go mano a mano with you when your dungeon was upgraded to a level 99. The entire world tuned in for that battle.""
Umbwe and Bal had fought to a draw after three days of nonstop fighting. It was the greatest battle of the modern age. The tactics used are still being studied to this day. ""Remember? I can still feel the scars. If only our primes had coincided."" Bal said wistfully. ""Bal,"" I said seriously,""you got ease up on the young guys. You always gave the young hotshots a sporting chance. Once in a while they surprised you."" Bal smiled at me remembering our fight. ""Besides,"" I continued, ""I know a few kids who are old school."" I reached into my pocket and handed him a photo of thee smiling teenagers. He looked at them approvingly. ""In a few years you'll be begging for money grubbers to beat up on."" Bal nodded. ""Fine. Tell Umbwe I'll tone it down."" As I left Bal put the picture of the teenagers into his photo album, and I absentmindedly wondered if the kids would be ticked off that I had literally thrown them to a dragon. Nah! Knowing those kids they would thank me. In fact what I had just done was positively benevolent. I might even earn an award. Best Mentor.

He looked back behind him where the Beholder had floated out. It had mentioned something about ""Darker caves and mirrored pools.""

The gravity of the situation didn't quite hit Grothar until he suddenly felt a bit more capable as he held this parchment. He rolled it up and stuck it in his belt for safe keeping. 

The Beholder had made other beings in this dungeon bend to it's will, something Grothar had felt worked to his and others' disadvantage. He grabbed the nearest gold chest and stood atop it, surveying the room he had to guard. He cleared his throat and began, ""I-"", the mimic stirred beneath him, knocking him off balance. Grothar fell to the ground and the mimic hopped away angrily.

After standing and dusting himself off, he surveyed his room again. ""Hrm.""

He gathered the other denizens to the treasure room he was designated by the Beholder. Goblins bickered to the left. The wyvern lay about near the back. Skeletons just stood bored, but it might have had more to do with their lack of skin than their mood. 

Grothar held up the parchment he kept tucked in his belt and the room stopped. A cultist hovering in the shadows scoffed.

""Me important now. Me manager. We survive better.""

The cultist crept out of the shadows. ""And how to you propose we do that? You're easily one of the dumbest things in here. Surely, you know nothing about organizing or strategy.""

""No. I know no words you say. But."" Grothar tried to find a phrase he had heard the Beholder say before, ""Synergy. Cooperate. Success."" The goblins perked at this. The skeletons continued to stare blankly. Grothar wasn't quite sure what to make of their lack of response but pushed. ""There is no me in us. But there is meat pie we can make. Cooperate."" 

The cultist chuckled, ""You want us to cooperate with you? Why? The Beholder has power that, well, could destroy us all. You're just an orc. Just because they say you're ""the manager"" doesn't mean you're ""the manager."" I've seen this happen dozens of times. Always promote the dumbest."" 

The wyvern yawned and spoke up from the back, ""Doesn't mean they can't promote the wisest."" The cultist shot a dirty look. ""Let's give him a listen. We don't have to listen to him anyway, even with the parchment. We didn't really listen to the Beholder. Well, I didn't.""

The room focused on Grothar and he shuffled his feet, trying to find the words. ""We make meat pies. We make this dungeon great again. We cooperate. Synergy. Here how.""

Months after the initial meeting, the dungeon proved to vex most adventurers. The wyvern and the cultist, despite hating one another, helped strategize the goblins and skeletons into more effective combat groups. The cultist even began to teach the smarter ones mastery over the dark arts. 

The skeletons worked tirelessly to keep the dungeon an ever changing labyrinth. 

Grothar had, despite the Beholder's comments, made the dungeon more difficult than the rating the Dungeon Inspection Purveyors Syndicate anticipated, which made the next meeting for Grothar somewhat unexpected. 

""You're fired, Grothar. You've simply made this dungeon too difficult and management expects you to perform for levels 5-9. You, however, have made the dungeon difficult for those in levels 9 through 15 and you outright murder adventurers below that. We, as an organization, have to make sure our dungeons perform a certain way and deliver results. Adventurers demand we meet the difficulty we advertise."" The man in the glasses and the gray suit continued on about things unfamiliar to Grothar. Terms like ""atypical dungeon layout,"" ""organizing labor force,"" ""violating appropriate use of mimics,"" and various other phrases floated around him. He shuffled his feet and stared at the ground trying to concentrate enough on the words so they made sense.

The inspector cleared its throat. ""You're fired now. Time to leave. You've simply made this dungeon too effective. I have to rework everything to normal levels. Let's not mention that you were given management of this dungeon outside appropriate channels. If we weren't backlogged so much at the syndicate, I would've been here much, much sooner."" 

Grothar continued to look at his feet.

""Here, I'll make this easier for you."" Grothar suddenly found himself outside the caves. He blinked his eyes, trying to adjust. 

""Hrm."" He reached down to pluck out the parchment in his belt, but it was gone. The inspector had taken it. He looked out into the fields before him and felt powerless. He no longer had a purpose. He circled once or twice before he heard galloping. He drew his axe and waited.

A dark cloaked figure slowed its approach before stopping some feet away. The hood was pulled back, revealing a young man. ""Grothar, correct?"" 

Grothar nodded warily. 

""I'd like to offer you a job. I work for Dungeon Mastery Incorporated and I believe you're the orc we need for reworking our new dungeons. I heard of you being fired and saw what you did with the old Beholder dungeon. Good work. So, what do you say?""",DemocraticElk

The Inspector frantically dismantled the tripwires while hurling criticism to the Dungeon Master. ""It's one thing to make it hard on an adventurer, it's another to force them to spend all of their loot on surgery!""

""What'm I supposed to do then? Y'uiof the Desolation won't stand for no sacrifices, and we have to protect the cultists, and then I thought 'Hey, I can lure more sacrifices in here with treasure!', and-"" The Inspector signaled for the DM to hush.

""I understand your god needs blood, but you and your fellow cultists act like they all ran into a Mind Flayer! For one, while I get the fae take pleasure it slaughtering mortals, they can't stand cold iron!"" He pointed at the metal decorations all around the room- spikes, chandeliers, a rather gothic look that clashed with the Byzantine architecture. ""*Fae don't like cold iron!*""

""Forget the room for a moment, please! Concerning our trap halls, they fit well under-"" 

""Your 'trap halls' are a mess."" The Inspector yanked an arrow out of a wall, inches from a hole that led to an automated crossbow. ""I don't care how much magic you use, self loading traps are well beyond what sorcery can accomplish!""

The DM sighed unhappily. ""The Templar of Ash surely can't have an issue, at least **she** fits the standards?"" The Inspector shook his head. ""The 'boss room' as we call it, does not have enough..."" he sped through his book, ""...'environmental hazards' for the explorers to use. She's a good enough blackguard as she is, we have to make it fair.""

""The armory?"" 

""Even the otherwise silent cultists- considering your 'initiating ritual'- have been complaining one way or another about the terrible quality! Even *I* was disgusted with their insults chiseled on the walls, the very least you could have done was leave their tongues in their mouths!""

[WP] Heaven is has a finite space. You've died and were a good person but there is no room in Heaven for you.,Maniacbob,"Jeremy Kauffmann had, by and large, lived a good life. He had been a good father, or at least, he had stayed out of the way. He was always punctual, valuing others' time as much as his own, which is really a divine quality in a small businessman. He also made it to church most Sundays, certainly enough times to build up a nest egg in the collection bin that most folks wouldn't shake a stick at, assuming those folks were cautious with sticks.

So, when  he collapsed into his oatmeal one day, the veins bursting through his head, Jeremy Kauffmann figured he was a shoe-in for Heaven.

When he arrived at the pearly gates, he was greeted by St. Peter, who seemed very busy scribbling notes but still took the time to offer a wink and a smile. ""Ah, Jeremy Kauffman! We've been expecting you!""

Jeremy smiled and gave a small wave, which made him feel humble, even though he was wholly unsurprised that St. Peter knew him by name. After all, Jeremy supervised several accountants at Kauffmann and Kauffman, LLP.

""Good morning, St. Peter.""

""Oh good heavens, it's not morning here. Time works very oddly in Heaven, you see. Although rather unfortunately, your timing isn't really the best.""

""What do you mean?""

Peter frantically rearranged some parchment. ""Well, I'm afraid Heaven is at capacity.""

""Capacity?"" Jeremy was confused, but he didn't want to offend Peter outright.""

""Well, you see, we only have so much space up here. It wouldn't be a paradise if you had to wait too long at the cafeteria, you know.""

Jeremy's eyes moved past Peter, and he squinted to see the glow between the big golden bars on the gates of heaven's beautiful wall. ""Of course, it may look like there's room,"" Peter interjected, as though hearing Jeremy's thoughts. ""But there isn't. You see, we have to hold spots for the people who are coming in soon.""

""Whose coming in?""

Peter glanced down at the parchment and flicked the edge with his thumb. ""Well, the Pope is certainly getting up there. Two Popes, actually, the one fellow isn't dead yet. So, we have to hold plenty of space for them. Denzel Washington, he'll die pretty soon, between you and me, he's a revolutionary performer, but he has a weakness for cheeseburgers. So, he needs lots of space, because the Father really wants to discuss 'The Manchurian Candidate' with him.""

Jeremy was trying not to look bitter, but he felt ""The Manchurian Candidate"" was a mediocre film. Certainly no better than ""The Taking of Pelham 123"".

""Then there's going to be a few more mass shootings, we have to send those folks in, just to make amends since most of shooters believe in, well, I don't think I have to tell you that part. It's a little silly, but of course, you know how politics work. And of course, Betty White, got to save a place for her. So, I'm afraid you'll have to go on the waiting list.""

""How long will I have to be on the list?""

Peter smiled. ""The current estimated wait is 372,151 years.""

""What!?""

""I know, what a deal! What's 372,151 years compared to eternal paradise?""

Jeremy sighed. ""So is the waiting list my only option?""

""Well, if you're really itching to start the afterlife, you can try Hell. It's just down the street, although by the time you get there and get your name on the list, you may wish you had just stayed on this one. Time works very oddly in Heaven.""

Jeremy Kauffmann knew he deserved to be in Heaven, but he also deserved to be valued. ""If Heaven doesn't care about me more than Betty White, maybe Hell will!"" he declared.

""Oh, I'm sure they will! They usually give a damn.""

So Jeremy Kauffmann marched off to Hell, and was disappointed to find that he still needed to clear a waitlist (as Lucifer calmly explained, there were an awful lot of mass shootings coming up, and the shooters usually didn't survive those). However, since the waitlist was only 527 years, he decided to stick it out. As he sat in the waiting room, he couldn't help but feel like a lot of people were headed down the street into Heaven with beaming smiles. He wondered if the wait would have been worth it. Still, the 527 years in Hell's waiting room seemed to take forever, so he was happy to stick it out, even though he heard whispers from the other pending souls that the cafeteria was far too crowded, and that time in Heaven went oddly quick.",Rimpocalypse
[WP] Heaven is has a finite space. You've died and were a good person but there is no room in Heaven for you.,Maniacbob,"""Sorry, we're full up"", Saint Peter gave me the bad news.

""What do you mean full up?""

""I mean heaven is full, so you can't go in"", he replied.

I couldn't believe it, despite the odds I had believed in Jesus and remained faithful to my dying day, just to find out it was all for naught.

""I've been a pretty good Christian, surely there is someone in heaven worse than me, couldn't I take their place""

Peter looked at me with pity and replied, ""There was just before you said that, but now that display of pride and arrogance bumped you down just below the threshold"".

As he said those crippling words, he pulled a level and a trapdoor opened below me.

As I fell I vowed, ""I'll get you for this you fucking cunt!""

I landed... On soft ground... I was in front of Saint Peter and Pearly gates once more.

Peter looked cross and said, ""Actually you were still above the threshold, but God wanted me to test you. That little display of cursing now *actually* landed you in hell"".

With defeat on my lips I uttered, ""How long has it been Satan?""

Peter took off his face revealing a devilish figure, ""Hehehe, we've been playing this game for 70 years, you've caught on to the game a few times now, but the dementia of hell took you back every time""

I felt sick, my vision started going blurry.

I woke up, lying on a cloud, Saint Peter was holding me in his lap.

""Are you okay? You just passed out all of a sudden""

""Saint Peter, is that you? Did I make it to heaven""

""I'm sorry"", he replied, ""But we've just run out of room"".

Atop its flaky, smelly bum sat the last bodhisattva, the last priest, and the last Maori warrior, all dazed and confused from their ordeal. Bellow them the Earth was bathed in nuclear fire.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""What happened?"" shouted the priest. He ran a dark hand over his brow, to see if he was suffering from a fever. ""Have we died? Are we in heaven?""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""We have escaped the cycle of suffering,"" replied the bodhisattva, her robes flowing gently in the fart-wind.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""We are in the grace of the Earth-mother and Sky-father,"" said the Maori warrior. She began to recite the myth chant of her ancestors.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""No, you're on the universe's ass,"" replied a stranger from afar, who was cresting the left buttock. He was short, brown, and possessed a great mess of black hair.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Who are you?"" Asked the bodhisattva.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""My name is Jesus,"" replied the man.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""My lord and savior!"" cried the priest.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""No, I'm just a guy named Jesus,"" replied Jesus. ""There is nothing magical about this. We all happened to fall onto the butt of the universe in the twilight of man's reign. It now comes to an end and we too shall soon die.""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""We were told to accept nothing, to worship nothing, and now we are nothing,"" said Jesus to nobody in particular. ""The pious cleanse the pious, and we eat ourselves.""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""You seem to know a lot,"" said the bodhisattva, wrapping part of her robes around her nose. ""What is this place?""

[WP] you are defending a library in the post-apocalypse,Metasaber,"When I first showed up I thought, ""This is the perfect time to read! I don't think anyone would loot a library.""

I was happy it was built into the earth, because when the first missile strikes happened the debris didn't really affect the walls or structure of the library. Most of the books were still in position, and there was a very large and diverse collection. I made out a living space for me to be in the Librarian's Office, there was a kitchen area, and I had a decent storage and utility room. Every day, I made a point to walk out into the surrounding area to scavenge; every once and while I would come across an infected, but they were becoming more and more weak as the disease ate through their body. I had cans of food that would last for a while, and I eventually found a nice fishing area a few miles out of town, I just had to ride a bike. I started with the fiction section.

No one came by at first, then people must have told of a lone librarian in the mountains who would entertain travelers going to the west coast. It was about two years before I had visitors at least once or twice a month. I got into the habit of telling them 'my food supplies were very low and they could probably stay for a day or two and must continue on'. Some came seeking shelter, others food, and some people guidance on life. These were the good years, were I laughed and retold the stories that were on the shelfs of my library. People traveling back from the outposts would stop by again because they enjoyed my company. I eventually got a wife, she was 26. 

It was about 9 years, when the plague died down and people started to become desperate. My daughter was about 4 years old when everything happened, the first raid from the south; they called themselves The New Knights of the South, dressed in metal worked in leather and pipe weapons. I scavenged enough materials to get a generator going and I think I was the first person to send the blueprints to the capital. No one bothered me, a lot of the southern states had asked me to create trade routes and ways to get many ideas going but I never really involved my family and I. 

My daughter once asked me, ""Poppa, how can you tell the difference between a bad man and a good man.""

So I told her, ""It's a matter of perspective baby. Some good men look like bad men, because they might be hungry or want something that someone else has.""

She replied, ""Well, if they kill someone for their stuff, doesn't that make them bad?""

I say, ""A person doesn't decide wether or not they are good or bad until the moment comes when they have to choose what is important to them. Just like you, when you give your momma heck for not letting you stay up, you could get mad and throw something or hit her, but that would make you a mean person. On the other hand, when you do have to go to bed, you don't, you get upset a little but in the end you listen to your mom. Everyone has the choice to be bad or good, but it is also a point of view too.""

With her big eyes and her mother's face, she says, ""Thats complicated Poppa.""

I laugh and finish, ""Well babe, when you become older and wiser, I'll teach you some of these things. I learned a lot from these books, and some things I have to write yet myself, because they aren't in them. You can help me write some books to add into our library, right?""

I tried to forgive the men that wanted our supplies, but they weren't good or bad. Those basturds enjoyed being evil. 

The first night, we had neighbors that set up shop near us to help with the town. We were about a population of 26 people in our little stop. Everyone was a shop keep or trader, and we all helped out in our own ways. We did celebrate holidays from The Time Before, Christmas and Thanksgiving were the two biggest. Mr. Rodgen was the food trader and helped us get a large amount of food shipped in to celebrate, he knew a guy who was raising deer and bison from the north, so we all helped set up and ate. On that first night they raided, our population was cut to 7. They killed Hughstons first, I seen their sons and daughter's heads on pikes outside in the square. My daughter cried for days, her best friend was their boy Winston, she cried his name for hours, ""Winnie! Winnie!"".

They taunted everyone left for a few days; they fucked one of the headless corpses of the Hughstons' daughters in plain view, at night they could be heard laughing and telling us how they were going to kill us, we had one unlucky trader come into town and they were burned at the stake. My wife activated her traps on portions that were easily accessible, and set up more for them just incase we were invaded. I prepared for this day and found a way to quickly package up books and transport them to a safe place. Our daughter packed our clothes into quick escape bags while we worked through the day. This was our reality from The Time Before.

When they came for my family, my wife came from a survivalist compound, so she skewered a lot of them. Although, their numbers where about 15 to 1. I moved most of the boxes filled with books down into the basement's long storage center, it was about three times the size of the building itself and connected to another building but it was blocked off from the debris of the collapse. I gotten about 6/7ths of the total library down there in a four day span, they attacked our home about two more times within that time. When they realized my wife wasn't letting them in, they threatened to burn down our home, it would have been the best possible route, seeing as the outside was stone but most of the inside was wood and paper. We let them in, and set off a time bomb to kill most of them, which it was successful, but we lost our home. The books were safe under the building, just getting to them out was the difficult part.

When we got to our safe house across the old city, I began to look for another place to set up for my library. I would be transporting approximately 837 boxes of books to a new area to set up, and I just had to find a place that would be suitable to house and maintain the books. I kept my mind off our neighbors, they were family to us. Killing those Knights was the best option for us to take, if we didn't they would have probably hunted us down, and also there is probably a lot more of them if they were that many coming to sack a small trading outpost in Old Colorado. I just want my wife and daughter are safe; I know my wife hates my books, but doesn't want to admit when I read to her it's one of her favorite things. She probably likes it more than my daughter does. Small wins are better than a big loss in our world, and losing these books would be a huge loss.",GallifreyKid
[WP] you are defending a library in the post-apocalypse,Metasaber,That was an amazing read,iwalkinmordor
[WP] you are defending a library in the post-apocalypse,Metasaber,"In all his years he had never seen a storm like this. Snow twisted and swirled around the gnarled metal pylons, collecting in five foot drifts in the corners and edges of broken masonry. A constant freezing wind howled down from the mountains and scoured the landscape around it, whistling strange tones in the broken buildings. 
He had seen the clouds building over the peaks to the west two days earlier. Dark roiling clouds built up and up until they spilled down toward the plains with white tendrils that slowly embraced the snowy peaks. He had known what was coming, he prepared by collecting some meager supplies; two squirrels, and some dandelions, but even then. 
There was so little left now and the storm was so strong. Even deep inside the building, insulated by dozens of walls and shelves and endless corridors, there was a draft of frigid air that made the small fire on the floor flicker dangerously. Out in front of the building, the last piece of a lost age sat half buried in a rapidly growing snow drift. A block of polished white marble with the letters ""University Library"" carved in bold. 
""Did you find anything?"" 
As his eyes adjusted to the dim light of the fire he could see a shape sitting up just a few feet from the fire on the side opposite him. It was his son, a boy of eleven, hunched over in a bundle of blankets and shivering. The man took the squirrels and dandelions out of his bag and placed it by the fire. In the light the already meager offerings seemed even smaller somehow. 
""She's getting worse."" The son said, placing his hand on a shape on the ground near the fire. The sound of labored breathing was just barely audible above the crackle of fire and echo of wind. 
""It'll pass"" he replied. 
It wouldn't pass, he knew that. He knew that the sickness was always fatal, and that it would come for them eventually as it had come for so many before. He heard stories about the world before, the world before the sickness where men lived in cities with wondrous machines and buildings that scraped the clouds. Stories told by his father, who in turn heard them from his father, and from his father, continuing on as far back as memory provided. Stories he would in turn tell his son when it grew time for him to pass on the charge given him when he was a young man. 
""You must guard this place. If you guard this place and the things inside you might yet save us all."" He did his best to fulfill his duty, repairing walls and roofs, boarding broken windows and keeping the place dry. He did not know why he was tasked with this but he knew that for some reason it was imperative he maintained his charge. As for who it would save he had little idea. The last stranger he saw passed through ten years ago, in a small caravan of people, most of whom were already infected with the sickness. Perhaps it was just the three of them now. The last in all the earth. 
Still, he would do his duty and he would wait, preserving what was inside and waiting for whatever was to save them. 
He left his son to cook the squirrels while he went out into the building. Searching down the rows and rows of shelves he came to a section covered in a thick layer of dust and stopped. Removing a small stack he laid spread them out on a desk and inspected them. Beautiful pictures and paintings on thick, stiff covers stared back and he smiled. His duty was to protect the library and preserve the important beautiful things within. Holding his knife he opened the books and cut out the hundreds of pages, each covered in strange symbols and figures. Placing the book covers nearly back on the shelves he returned to the fire and fed the pages to it in small bundles. Outside the wind whipped and echoed around the building like the howl of hungry dogs.

[WP] you are defending a library in the post-apocalypse,Metasaber,"Thanks, man! As I was writing it, I thought 'I could legitimately turn this into a short work!'

[WP] you are defending a library in the post-apocalypse,Metasaber,"For a while after the fall I lived in a big library in New York.  I wasn't part of a pack, but I didn't live alone either.  My company was interesting to say the least.  His name was Benjamin Codsworth.  He looked like the fuckin monopoly guy without the hat.  He had combed back silver hair, a monocle, and a mustache gifted from the gods.   

We were very different, he and I.  Ben had a love of books so intense I thought I might find him dead one day with a towel around his neck and his dick punched through a copy of Crime and Punishment.  Now I wasn't loving my situation, but it was better than the road.  Much...better.  

It was winter, and people were cold as balls over dry ice.  A couple days earlier, a group of guys came in looking for some tinder. Ben had a strict no book burning policy.  I had brought it up a couple times, suggesting we dispose of some of the lower quality stuff.  I had no idea a man that old could punch so hard. 

Unsurprisingly, telling them to shove it spurred conflict.  Tensions rose, guns were flaunted, and it ended with some douche canoe in a backwards baseball cap vowing to return with his home boys.  The next night would be my final night in the library.

As the sun set the following day I was leaning up against one of the many bookshelves in the library.  There were more comfortable places to sit, but honestly I was looking for some space.  My choice of literature, Thunder Mountain.  The scandalous tale of the romance between a burly lumberjack from a logging company and a round breasted brunette who was president of the bird watching club.  Mock my choices all you want, but with the apocalypse and all, the last time I fucked I had to keep my head on a swivel for dinosaurs. So yeah, Thunder Mountain was kinda doing it for me at the time.

I was at a particularly saucy page when my boner combo of arousal from Thunder Mountain and fear of the coming storm became painfully hard.  I curled up the softcover and shoved it into my pocket, which had decreased in size considerably due to the tent I was pitching.  I tucked that baby into my waistband and went for a walk down the isle.

You may ask, ""Hey asshole, why not just leave if you thought you were going to die?"" Fair question, I'll give you that.  Yeah I could have just left, but life out on the road after the fall was out of fucking control.  My last incident, being ambushed by a naked man with a Bob Dole mask on, really drew the line.  

I was bent over looking through a trashcan when I got slammed into from behind.  I fell over and he quickly had me pinned, ""Bob Dole says, What's the difference between jam and jelly?"" He whispered into my ear.  

I went through a tinder fuckboi phase and I knew the answer to that question.  Then I realized he had something in his hand.  I felt a cold lump grow in my stomach. If it hadn't been for Benjamin smashing his skull in with a cricket bat, I would have been sodomized with a turkey baster.

Tonight Ben was sitting at the help desk in the back of the library looking very stoic as he read.  I approached him, wanting to talk to someone before I died.  He didn't look up from his book, but obviously noticed I was there since he addressed me immediately. 

""Noah, have you ever read any Hemingway?"" He asked. The answer was no, but I felt like now was the time to connect if we ever would.

""I read Ender's Game.  Is it like that?"" The dude just stared at me for a little.  I guess I said the wrong thing, but he let me off the hook.

""Not quite,"" He closed his book and sighed, ""I know you don't value all of this the way I do.  You have your own reasons for being here.  Regardless, I am deeply grateful you have chosen to stay.""  Ben had never said anything like that to me before.  Honestly, he always seemed a little irritated that I would rather be playing Starcraft or wanking it to Overwatch porn than reading.  Not that either of those were options anymore.

""So how are we going to do this?""  I asked.  Benjamin reached down below the desk, and lifted up what I first thought was a broom.  Fuck no.  With a thud he dropped it on the desk.  It was a straight rifle....from the civil war.  ""You...have to be joking.""

Codswell's eyebrow tightened over his monocle, ""You wouldn't recognize reliable firepower if it jumped out of the water and slapped you on the dick,"" He tossed an AR on the table next.  I was now wholly confident that we were both going to die.  I was going to die with this old ass british dude in the middle of a fuckin library with a curled up erotica still in my pocket.  This was my end.  I was going to die like a bitch.

Suddenly, all the way down the center isle, the two main doors flew open with the sound of cracking wood.  A battering ram dropped to the floor.  Skateboard shoes and EDM hoodies flooded into the library.  In this pivotal moment, my life changed drastically for the second time.  

In the blink of an eye Codswell had his rifle in his hands.  He fired one shot.  I swear by my left nut, eight guys hit the floor.  I saw the ends of multiple bookshelves splinter off.  He had angled the bullet and ricochete the round in a zigzag pattern between the rows.  I jumped behind an isle as they returned fire.  From that point on it was as if events played out in slow motion.

Pages exploded into the air.  The desk Codswell stood behind splintered apart as rounds tore through it.  The globe to his right shattered, and a picture on the desk of someone's ugly ass kid blew in half.  Through all of that, he stood there...untouched.  

Some of the guys with bats and chains were getting close.  He vaulted off of the help desk, bayonet fixed.  As he floated downwards he planted one perfectly shined shoe into a mans face.  After landing he dodged a chain swing and returned with a counter-slash to his attackers stomach.  Chicken tendies spilled onto the library floor as his enemy was eviscerated.

Codswell ducked low as he anticipated incoming gunfire, and drew two revolvers out from the inside of his tweed jacket.  They glinted from the muzzle flashes, then released a wrath of their own.  Slugs flew through the air, hot cylinders rotated, and that mustache...it danced through the smoke like an underaged chinese girl forced into the olympics.

Bodies fell, limbs were severed, he was unstoppable.  Then there was silence, save a few moans from the maimed.  I slowly stood up from my hiding place, staring at this man in total awe.  How could he possibly be alive? ""Ben,"" I started, ""How?""

He smiled.  Then his monocle fell from his eye, followed by his guns.  He slumped down against one of the ends of the isles, staining the wood with blood.  I noticed the vest under his jacket darkening. ""Some things,"" He choked, ""Are simply worth dying for.""  He opened his jacket and PCP pills spilled out of a torn inner pocket.  He took out what I thought was a hand rolled cigarette, but was really just some dank weed. ""Listen,"" He said, ""There's a bag under the desk.  It contains some of the greatest works of literature of all time.  Take it...Protect it.""  He coughed pretty hard and spattered blood all over my face.  

""Okay....I will.""  I watched the life fade from Codswell's eyes.  His doobie fell from his lips and hit the floor.  I could hear more of those bastards that killed him coming, so I ran to the desk and grabbed the rugged pack beneath it.  

I'll be honest with all of you.  That shit was heavy.  Really heavy.  I wasn't going to trudge through the snow for miles with that thing on my back, so I hedged my bets on other libraries.  I mean I just have to be realistic with myself you know?  But yeah, I booked it pretty soon after.  

It wasn't long before I saw orange glow behind me in the distance.  I realized I had neglected to put out Codswell's joint, and it had probably ignited the entire library.  I felt a little guilty about it.  I pretty much shucked off what the guy who saved my life died for.  I guess that's kinda lame. 

Later that night I found a good spot to rest.  I put together some soft stuff to sleep on, scavenged up some baked beans, and opened up Thunder Mountain.  The lumberjack was tearing off the birdwatcher's clothes in his log cabin.  Shit was getting hot.  I eagerly went to turn the next page, but the pages wouldn't separate.  I frantically fanned through the book.  Every sex scene, every single one, the pages were stuck together. 

I stared out of the window of my shelter at the orange glow in the distance.  For the first time, I understood just how much humanity had lost.  I dropped Thunder Mountain, my eyes teary with shame.  He was right.  Some things are worth dying for...

------

Deep in the darkest depths of the 9 Circles of Hell, the worse denizens of the Underworld had gathered for another council meeting. Sitting at the throne upon the raised dais, the Fallen Angel Lucifer herself, an impatient glare upon her face.

Within 5 minutes, the thousands of demons had yet to calm down, and Lucifer gotten angrier and angrier, an aura of red hate and darkest despair slowly flaring to life around her. 

""LISTEN UP MAGGOTS!"" She screamed out, causing many demons - most of which would single handedly destroy countries - to flinch in fright, instantly standing straight and stopping all talk.

""MY HUBBY IS SICK AT HOME, AND EACH SECOND HERE IS ANOTHER SECOND AWAY FROM HIS SIDE!!! SO EVERYONE, BEELZEBUB HERE WILL BE IN TEMPORARY COMMAND!! IF I HEAR SO MUCH A WHISPER THAT YOU BASTARDS HAVE DONE SOMETHING UNAUTHORIZED, I WILL END YOU MYSELF. Seeya.""

She vanished in a poof of black smoke, and the legions of demons were left in stunned silence.

A massive horned demon wondered out loud, ""Does anyone think she has too much of an interest in that mortal-"" 

He was suddenly choking as Lucifer appeared before him, lifting him up by his throat. Her eyes flashed, and the demon was split in half, splattering all nearby demons with orange blood. Lucifer slowly turned, half of her covered in the blood of one of the most powerful demons in Hell. ""Anyone else?"" she whispered.

Complete silence was her answer. The silence continued as they pondered the image of a young golden haired woman lifting up a demon nearing 10 feet in height with a single arm. The legions of hell collectively shivered.",TriPolar3849

The final frontier had been broken. The next thing would be finding aliens, wouldn´t it? 

But it apparently never was meant to be. What we found were traces, ruins. But only when we looked closely. Sometimes we found life, yes. Ocasionally even worlds that had atleast as much life as Siberia on old Terra. Once or twice something that could be classified as an Garden World. But never intelligent life. Even finding the traces it had left was hard. 12 worlds with artifacts that were definitly artifical, ahuman. And all off those were barren worlds. Destroyed. Wiped clean of all life. 

We tried to decypher those artifacts that seemed to have writing on them. But we never were able to. The languages were too alien. And for our translation software we would have needed more writing.

"[WP] In the chaos of the moment, you take what's rightfully yours...",OctoSnake,"I had been waiting years for this moment. Every year, year after year, the five families would gather for their annual meeting. And every year, year after year, I was left out of the proceedings. No say, no satisfaction. Sure people payed me attention, said their hellos, gave respect and gave their best wishes to my family, but when the meeting started I was left in the dark. 

I understand that I joined the family as a foot soldier but I've been bustin' my ass for these people for six years now. I'm up all night every night protecting and serving these people. I wanted my rightful promotion like Tom got his. 

Tom was a slick guy I couldn't blame him or be mad at him. He was my partner and the brains to my brawn. He'd sniffed out a rat last year before he could do any damage to the family's operation. One night Tom snuck up behind him in the alley out behind our place and pinned him down while I took him to town. We left him in the dumpster to rot. Tom was a loyal friend and wanted this for me too. 

The families always had their official meeting after the initial welcomes and hellos. They would start in the hall and move to the back room for the deliberation. Tom would be closest soldier to the Families during the deliberation, which was perfect for the plan. 

As soon as they sat down and Don said his family mantra, Tom began the diversion. He tore into his post, smashing and clawing everything in site. There was feces and litter everywhere. Hairballs and feathers from dead birds all over the kitchen. That's when I shot in. I burst into the hall and turned the corner for the back room as the five families were trying to settle Tom. I leaped on the table and snagged the whole turkey, knocking it into the gravy for more flavor before I dashed back outside to my post. 

It was perfect execution. They didn't even know and I don't think they will ever find out.

You’ve got a ticket in your hand – Where will you go? What will you do? What will happen when you get there? [CW] [TT],SamMaddux,"My ticket says *10*, and when my aging mother sees it, she shuffles away hunched over in the wet field and sits on her tattered wool roll, looking off. Her hair is matted with the damp and dirt, and her scalp is infested with hopping lice. *10*, I know she's thinking. That's all my fingers. Gone tomorrow.

There's still corn-mash in my hat, but I can't eat. I walk around the sheep to settle them. I had to go with the 16-year-olds to my Council today, so the flock only had my mother for 10 hours, and she's too old to work them right. She's 34. Her teeth are gone, and of course her fingers are gone, too, like mine will be tomorrow. The Mayor at the Council had a finger-cloak that was more like a scarf, and he kept spreading his wings and licking his reptilian teeth every time one of us drew a *10*.

""Jim!"" someone whispers in the tall grass and wildcorn.

""Hey?"" I ask.

But there's no answer.

In my mother's day, the dragons took all their fingers, period. In some places, even the Councils were running finger-farms, killing the men at puberty after their fingers were taken and killing the women when they stopped bearing (with their fingers taken, too). Finger-farms were outlawed 20 years. That's when the Legislature mandated the lottery. Technically we have to have *a chance* to keep some fingers but everyone always draws a *10* anyways.

""Jim!"" there's a whisper again.

She stands up. It's Lacy from the sheepfields north. She's crying and her frayed hair is tied with the same potato vine she had on when we went to the Council today. Her starved body is sunburnt from the fields, and she's only now getting hair on her vagina because she came to puberty so late.

""There's nothing we can do,"" I tell her.

""I know,"" she says. ""I want to have you once, though, while we still have fingers.""

When the dragons came out of the mountains where they'd been, we fought - or that's what I'm told. We lost. The dragons made cloaks of our fingers to show how many of us they killed. The dragons were 10-foot tall then, and some of them had cloaks that trailed behind them 30 feet. That was 100 years ago. Of course, our southern dragons are too short and fat now to even fly, let alone fight, but they still want their finger-cloaks.

""Where's your roll?"" Lacy asks me.

""Here.""

We get in the wool roll with the bugs in it, and we love until we wake in the morning. We're itchy and sweaty when we crawl out, and I start coughing. There's smoke in the wind. There's a glow over the fields north like they're on fire.

""They really went,"" Lacy whispers. ""They said they were running away.""

""And the police found them in an hour,"" says my mother, who has her roll pulled up close to mine now. ""They're dead. And the police are burning the fields and all the families in them to make an example.

""We have to start back to the Council now,"" I tell my mother. ""The finger-taking is early, just after noon.""

When the Legislature made the lottery, there were some northern dragons who said finger-cloaks had to be outlawed completely, along with slavery, too. They said we were just as smart and feeling as dragons, or at least smart enough. They asked us if we liked living as sheep-herders feeding off wildcorn, but we didn't know what to say. 

Finally some southern dragons paid an ""expert"" to choose a boy ""at random"" and test him, but the boy never got the knack of Old Dragon. He couldn't figure out the ""obvious"" rules for catching prey during a descent. The ""expert"" measured the boy's skull and it was smaller than a dragon's. The ""expert"" pointed out that the boy had no wings, like nature had formed him to be a slave to gravity and the earth and that's where he'd be happiest - it was ""science"" for us to starve and herd sheep and have our fingers taken.

""Do you have your tickets?"" says the guard when Lacy and I reach the Council.

""Yes,"" I answer him staring at his clawed feet.

He shows us into the finger-taking room, an open-air circular chamber with a square stone in the center and wide stone steps at the back. The surgeons are by the stone, one dragon with razor-sharp claws and one with no claws at all - the lottery was passed with anti-cruelty laws, too. The Mayor is on the steps to supervise. There's a higher official with him who has a finger-cloak to the floor, and Lacy and I are with ten other 16-year-olds on the right side of the room, waiting.

""First,"" the surgeons call out.

One by one, we take our lottery ticket to the Mayor, who announces our number to the surgeons, who then take the same number of fingers off our hands. It's surprisingly painless when they do me. I'm left with two flat flippers at the end of my arms and blood seeping into the bandages that the clawless dragon put on.

Lacy is last. She is shaking. She walks to the mayor and hands him her ticket, and he announces her number. But Lacy just stands there.

""Ten!"" the mayor says again.

Lacy looks at me where I am on the left side of the room now - and she is crying again.

""Mr Mayor, I think you read that wrong,"" she says.

""What?"" says the Mayor.

It is death to speak to a dragon without first being addressed.

""I think you're holding my ticket upside down, sir,"" she says.

She swallows and looks up at the Mayor, and there is silence. There's a long silence. But then, the higher official on the steps behind the Mayor begins to chuckle. Then he laughs out loud - a bellowing, throaty laugh - and when the Mayor sees that it's safe, he begins to laugh, too. They laugh until they are crying out of their black reptilian eyes, and they look at Lacy like evil but not unfeeling fathers.

""All right,"" says the Mayor. ""One!""

Time goes off again in its forgetful way, and the years pass, but Lacy is still in the sheepfields. I visit her when I can. I marvel at her nine fingers and touch them, and I envy her with a cold, undying envy that cuts me through the heart every time I make corn-mash in my hat, every time I chase a wandering sheep, every time I struggle to get my wool roll over myself with my flat flipper-like hands.",droptoprocket

[WP] It's 2016 and a modified Lockheed Electra 10E makes an emergency landing at LAX. A 39 year old woman climbs out. It's Amelia Earhart.,SemSevFor,"Janet hastily does one last check of her equipment while her team rushes to to LAX.  Excitement is in the air, as just minutes ago, her boss leaked that a mysterious plane had just landed. The pilot? The long lost Amelia Earhart. Even better, she's *young*. 

Her orders were clear: investigate the plane. See if there's anything out of the ordinary.  

Janet and her team arrived at the landing strip, where the famous Electra 10E stood before her.  It had no signs of age or wear that one would expect from a plane that's at least 80 years old. But there was little time to appreciate this piece of history, as they needed to figure out what happened before the press gets wind of this new discovery.  

Her boss radios to her that Amelia had been escorted to a security checkpoint nearly immediately after she had landed. Amelia's navigator, Fred Noonan, who accompanied her on the famous journey around the world, was nowhere to be found. Janet's team was clear to investigate the plane. 

While her team examined various sections of the plane's exterior, Janet had climbed into the cabin of the Electra and closed the door behind her.  While her initial impressions of the interior were underwhelming, something in the cockpit caught her eye. The instrument panel was nowhere to be found.  

Janet sat into the pilot's chair in bewilderment, wondering how Amelia could have managed to fly the plane without the aid of her instruments. Janet placed her hand on the empty central panel.  No airspeed, no elevation indicators, not even a setting to deploy the landing gear. Nothing was there except the windows, pedals and the flight yoke.

Janet was amazed.  The cockpit only added to the mystery of Amelia's disappearance.  How did she disappear? How did she survive for nearly 80 years.  How did she not *age*?  Janet fiddled around with the yoke while she was lost in thought.  She didn't notice the glowing words that began to appear on the bare instrument panel to her right. 

Janet snapped out of her mental discussion and brought out her notepad to jot down the oddities of the plane. Lost in thought once more, she was caught by surprise at the sudden appearance of several floating dialog boxes surrounding the pilot seat. The entire cockpit was illuminated with information. 

Janet immediately discovered three things: the dialogs were in English, they were like holograms that one could move (as the surprise jolt caused her hand to swing through one of the dialog boxes, moving it to another location) and that these holograms replaced the instrument panel in function.  She also apparently started up the plane, as evidenced by the radio chatter demanding Janet to turn off the engine.

Scrambling to figure out what to do, Janet fervently searched around the cockpit for any sort of help file or manual within the myriad of dialog boxes.  Her desperation soared to levels she never thought possible as she realized that the plane was starting to move on its own.  She started stomping on the various pedals hoping that one of them was the brake.  But none of them worked; even the yoke was unresponsive and refused to turn. 

Thoughts of the plane being on auto pilot crossed her mind, but it was a minor blip amongst the internal monologue of various curse words and appeals towards God to just make the damn plane stop.  But without any options to stop the plane manually and the realization that the plane was going to take off, Janet fastened her seatbelt and braced for liftoff.  The radio chatter threatening Janet to stop was drowned out by the engines powering up for liftoff and Janet's own sobs. ",Admiral_Burrito
[WP] Futuristic sci-fi with fantasy dragons and wizards.,TheGeorge,"I smirk as I quickly pull on my black leather boots. Once again I check under the door to make sure the usual glow of the florescent hall lights are off. Swiftly i move over to the cold silver lined window of my room. Slinging my over-worn bag onto my shoulder, I whisper a short spell. The glass turns into a portal of swirling colors. I quickly push myself through.

I'm falling.  I frantically upright myself as I sense the bottom approaching. ""Where are you?"" I shriek in worry. Suddenly a gust of wind assaults me as a large black and gray scaled beast swoops under me. I land ungracefully on his back. The beast makes a noise of amusement. I roll my eyes, ""Let the adventure begin!""",thesilenceofthetrees
[WP] Futuristic sci-fi with fantasy dragons and wizards.,TheGeorge,"""This will probably get me killed, but the way I see it, I'm dead anyway."" Lector said, handing a single contact lens to Ben. He could sense the hopelessness in Lector's tone. This decision, whatever it meant, hadn't been decided lightly. Ben stared at the lens, he knew it was somehow important, but wasn't sure why.

""I'm sorry Ben but I'm desperate, I need your help.""

Ben handed the lens back. ""No. You've never been honest me, why should I be dragged into whatever mess you've got yourself into this time?""

""Because you're my brother, we are friends, and I would do anything for you.""

*God dammit* Ben thought. He was always a sucker for emotional blackmail.

""If I'm going to help you again, I want to know what the hell is going on with you.""

Lector looked relieved. ""I know. That's what the lens is for. Just put it in and look out the window. It will explain alot. But please keep this a secret or i'm as good as dead.""

Ben stood infront of the window wondering what this lens would make him see. He stared out at his sky view, which due to the room's gravity tilt, took up nearly half his outlook. Lector always thought he was mad to pay for such an extravagant view, Ben disagreed. Watching clouds blow over the city heights, having sun stream into his room and seeing violent storms was something Ben had wanted since he was a kid. 

Before inserting the lens, he looked across at the grey city scape. Each building was the size of a street block and rose to the exact same height. His room jutted out of the building on an angle, allowing him to see across the row of skyscrapers that stood in between the great access ways below. He inserted the lens with a practiced motion. Suddenly everything went purple. 

""Is this a joke?""

""Keep looking, you will get used to it.""

Sure enough Ben's brain started making sense of what he was seeing. The solid purple that filled his vision started dissipating into a myriad of different shades. They eventually took the form of the original city view, yet with some obvious changes. The buildings were taller. Ben could see the original structure, now a light shade of mauve. But the mauve changed to a deep violet where all the buildings now extended upwards for a further fifty stories.

""What is this? Where did - how?""

Lector smiled, seemingly enjoying his brother's confusion. 

""First time I've see you unable to make sense out of something! You are now sensitive to Amethire, in layman's terms, it's a spectrum of static electricity that is completely invisible without the lens. So. You ready?""

""No.""

""Good. Time to show you my world.""

[WP] Futuristic sci-fi with fantasy dragons and wizards.,TheGeorge,"Out in the cold, blackness of space a small vessel of sleek design propelled its way towards an asteroid dotted with a dozen different dwarven mining stations. It was one of many asteroids in the Irondrill system held by the Dwarven Kingdoms, and one would assume it to be relatively unimportant, but after the bombardment and destruction of Starstone Hold the dwarves had learned that they could no longer rely on thick walls of stone to keep them safe. So it was that they decided to hide their High Council away on a minor asteroid base, where neither gnome nor orc would be able to find them. The Elven vessel approaching would have already been shredded by the powerful railguns disguised as mining outposts had the crew not all kept the passcode runes in their minds for the Dwarven clerics to detect.

The ship slipped through a small opening in the asteroid's surface and into the vast, excavated city within. While they had intended to keep their new administrative capital small the dwarves were never ones to shy away from grandeur, and with the Dwarven Kingdoms spanning fourteen systems they had needed a large base of administrations. A small, magical flare indicated to the elves where they were supposed to dock. The elven pilot, highly trained, approached the docking pier and attached the ship to it in one fluid motion. Standing on the pier, outfitted with their large exo-skeletons, stood Grand Magni Burik Ironwill and several other high-ranking members of the council.

Elduin Starseeker, Elven Lord of the Sanguine Moons, pushed off the inner wall of his ship and glided through the shielded entrance before casting a small spell to synchronise his movement to the asteroid's. Unlike the dwarves, whose exo-skeletons attached to the pier magnetically to simulate gravity, Elduin floated weightlessly with elven grace, conjuring air to flow around his body and into his lungs. The dwarves, now just taller than elves because of their dependence on exo-skeletons and their determined one-upmanship, nodded in respect to the Elven Lord. The Grand Magni stepped forward.

""Would yer Highness like a pampering and a night's rest, or can we start negotiating immediately?"" asked the Grand Magni. ""It's only we dwarves have things tae dae other than lounge in palaces and I think the closest we could get tae pamering is bashing yer heed in wi' a rock.""

""Polite as ever, Burik Ironwill, but if you do truly believe I'm hassling you I suppose I ought to leave, let you get back to your drilling"" replied the Elven Lord, adding a sneer to the last word. Reluctantly, the Grand Magni muttered an apology. ""Good, I'm glad you've come to your senses. Now, as I understand it, your people are in dire need of perfect, arcane crystals for your little spacefleet. Those are the kinds of crystals only the elves know how to make, yes? My my, I would not want to be in your position, having to barter for something so valuable. Especially when the elves know just how much you need it, we do pay attention to your wars with the gnomes you know.""

""Just tell us what it'll cost,"" grunted the Grand Magni, not doing much to hide the contempt in his eyes.

""Well, my clerics have told me you need four hundred odd crystals, large ones too, and that is certainly a lot of crystals. It would take a lot of time for elves to make that many, thank goodness we're a prepared people, otherwise the dwarves would be left with absolutely no one to turn to, completely alone in their fight against the gnomish fleets. I hear the shamans their hiring from the orc clans have been proving quite difficult to handle, warping space so that your barbaric kinetic weaponry is rendered completely ineffective,"" the Elven Lord rambled, immensely enjoying the look of anger on the dwarves' faces. He grinned wide, making sure the Grand Magni understood how much the elves expected to abuse their position.

""I should say that my people do feel your pain, it must be humiliating to be defeated by someone so simple as the gnomes, and with the help of orcs no less, and so we intend to make you a favourable deal,"" the Grand Magni's eyes lit up at that, the annoyance leaving his face at the idea that the elves might be kind for once. ""If you simply hand over the Idrik, Gollenhiem, and Starhammer systems we would be more than willing to provide you with the crystals you need.""

The Elven Lord expected to see a look of shock cross the faces of the assembled dwarves, but was disappointed when he saw that they did not seem surprised. He supposed he had underestimated them, they had obviously expected such a bad deal knowing how bad a situation they were in. Nonetheless, Elduin Starseeker was confident that they would accept, it was either hand over three systems to the elves or lose all fourteen to the gnomes. He realised too late that something more than weary acceptance sat behind the Grand Magni's eyes, and before he had time to cast a quick scanning spell he heard the mental screams of his crew as a dwarven gun tore through his small vessel. He flung himself off the pier to escape the explosion of the plasma coils, breifly glancing down at the dwarves who looked at him with cruel smiles through the sparkling debris.

""You should've brought a bigger ship, my Lord, and you should've realised that dwarves don't cower when we get desperate,"" the Grand Magni projected, his voice loud in Elduin's head despite the empty space between them. ""Don't try to run, there are hundreds of dwarven clerics in this asteroid all focusing in on your location now.""

Elduin Starseeker snorted, as arrogant as only elves can be, and darted towards the exit of the asteroid. Sure enough he felt the tug of dwarven clerics on his mind, willing him to stop, but he was an Elven Lord, he had trained for millenia in the art of magic while the dwarves had tried to replace magic with new technologies. The clumsy clerics, unaware of the true potential of mental magic, revealed their locations in the scattered architecture of the asteroid city through their attacks, and so Elduin unleashed a barrage of pure arcane towards each of them as he span around.

Flashes of purple and ultraviolet danced across the elf's eyes as his shots hit their marks, but he knew he could not pierce the tough steel structures in enough places to kill all of Burik's clerics. His spells had, however, sent the clerics scurrying desperately away from possible danger, leaving him free to prepare his next spell uninterrupted. He closed his eyes and focused in on the atoms within the darven nuclear reactors, seeking out as many unstable nuclei as he could, preparing to force them all to decay at once. Convinced he had found them all, Elduin cast his mighty spell and opened his eyes to see the havoc it wrought, only to notice the boulder-sized kinetic charge heading straight towards him.

In his panic he flubbed his spell, only managing to overload a handful of reactors. He scowled as explosions tore through several of the defense stations, all too aware of the many more still aiming at him. He had teleported to avoid the first massive bullet, but four more were already heading towards him. In a flurry of minor space bending spells he caused them all to collide, careful not to cast a large enough spell to alert the dwarven clerics that he was bending space. He could feel their pull on his mind again, and some had even begun conjuring false kinetic charges to distract him. Squat dwarven military ships were pouring out of dozens of hangars across the asteroid and the thick, metal door had closed off the exit of the cavern.

""Your people will be willing to trade crystals to get ye back, right? Ye do seem to be a powerful magician,"" projected the Grand Magni. Elduin cursed, he knew he couldn't escape. His pride had gotten him captured by the dwarves and now his realm wouldn't be able to take the three systems he so desired. Still, he felt it would only be healthy for him to get his anger out, and it'd do him good to make the dwarves fear him a little. He cracked his knuckles and picked out a significant looking dwarven vessel as his first target.",Roedhip

"[WP] They sealed the creature away not to protect the world from it, but instead to protect it from the world.",TheSs7SsN,"""Just how old is this place...?"" Lynne asked herself, wandering farther into the facility. Metal was overgrown with vegetation, and the lights on the walls were either broken, or barely functioning. The woman held a pistol- more for defense than for anything else- as well as a flashlight. She looked much the part of an explorer, or a scavenger... which explained why she was where she was. 

Holstering her pistol, she reached back instead for a machete, and hacked away at the overgrowth covering a door- the only one she could find, thus far, that wasn't crushed or completely nonfunctional. After a good few swipes, the vines fell away, and the door slid open. Lynne made her way into the adjacent hallway, replacing her machete with her pistol once more. 

Signs upon the walls still lit up, implying that there must have been some source of power for them to draw on even still. Rubbing the grime off of a number of them, the woman peered at them, trying to make out the words present.

&gt; Cafeteria -&gt;

&gt; Dormitory ^

&gt; Experiment W. v

&gt; Entrance &lt;-

""Experiment..."" Lynne repeated, staring at the words. ""Don't tell me this is one of those old pre-war bunkers..."" She glanced off in the direction that it pointed toward. Compared to all other directions, it seemed the least traveled, yet the most intact. Age and wear had done its toll on the facility, and it was likely only a few short months from collapsing entirely. 

""The worst part about these old junk piles is all the damned skeletons,"" Lynne remarked, as she made her way down the hallway toward the experiment wing- and whatever might await her there. ""Choose a better place to die next time, idiots."" 

Passing by numerous nonfunctional metal doors, Lynne finally came upon a circular hallway, surrounding an almost sterile-looking room. Windows lined the walls, although given their tint, they were probably two-way mirrors, preventing one from looking outside from the inside. 

Most curiously, a small girl sat inside the room, on a fluffy-looking bed, playing with a toy. Her skin was an ashen gray, and her hair dark black. Her sclera were an odd red-black, and her iris were a much darker red. On one side of her forehead, a large and impressive horn sat, almost reminiscent of a dragon from ancient folklore. She wore a dress, clean and untouched by the elements. 

Lynne carefully strode up to the closest window, looking upon the inhuman specimen with a mixture of disgust, curiosity, and empathy. It was only a girl, but on the other hand, the horn and her skin color couldn't simply be ignored. Why was she there, even? What could be the possible reason behind-

""Hello? Is someone there...?"" the girl asked, turning her head in Lynne's general direction. Her cute face practically lit up, as she stood up from the bed. ""Is that you, doctor Wilson? Is it time for a walk? I've been in here for so long...""

""Uh- no, I'm not a doctor,"" Lynne said. She still wasn't quite sure how to feel about the girl, who resembled a demon. Even worse, Lynne had only heard tales of demons and dragons, recorded by the elders on tapes. ""What... are you?""

""I don't know,"" the girl responded, simply. She walked closer to the mirror that Lynne stood behind, tilting her head as she stared at her own reflection. ""The doctors used to say... anti-dragon weapon."" She closed her eyes, and seemed to think deeply for a moment. ""Artificial dragon destruction agent. ADDA, for short."" 

""Dragon? Artificial?"" Lynne asked, scratching her head- quite literally. ""Dragons exist? How long have you been in there for? And you're... artificial?""

The girl nodded, folding her hands up politely in front of herself. ""I don't know. The doctors said I was made to fight dragons. I've been in here for a long time..."" Her vision dropped, as she glanced down to the floor. ""They said they wanted to protect me. That I shouldn't have to fight for them. Then they stopped talking forever."" 

Lynne stared through the window for some time, before looking around the inside of the sterile room. ""How did you survive for this long?"" she asked, ""I don't see any food in there."" 

""I don't need to eat."" 

Nodding her acknowledgment, Lynne looked instead to the door- the only door into or out of the room. ""You're friendly, right? I don't want to let you out and have you attack me or anything."" She'd likely gain nothing from letting the girl out of her room- much less, be given anything in return. She wasn't the sort to sell people into slavery, so...

She'd probably have to take care of the girl, at least for a short while. 

""I don't want to hurt anything,"" the girl said, shaking her head. ""I'm a good girl. Doctor Wilson always said I was such a good girl, and then he'd pat my head and give me some candy."" She sounded almost wistful, as she clutched her hands over her chest. ""One time, he even gave me this thing called a pee-za."" 

""Pee-za? What's that?"" Lynne asked. She walked around the outside of the room, before coming to the door. 

""It was shaped like a triangle, and it had this stuff called cheez and pep-a-roney on top,"" the girl replied, following Lynne's footsteps toward the door. ""It was delicious."" 

""Never heard of pep-a-roney,"" Lynne commented, examining the door. It seemed as though the panel used to open it had been ripped completely off, and the pieces lay on the floor next to a skeleton. The skeleton had a number of chips in its ribcage, and a handful of dented bullets lay beneath it. ""Bad news. The door's messed up. I can't open it."" 

The girl gasped, and then fell to her knees. ""I'm stuck?"" she asked, ""I can never get out?"" She was almost on the verge of tears, struck by the sudden revelation. 

""N-Now, calm down,"" Lynne said, tapping the window, ""Hey, you're an anti-dragon whatsit, right?"" She looked again at the door, and then at the girl who was on the verge of crying. ""Why not just break the door?"" 

""B-Break it?"" the girl asked, ""But that would be bad... I'm not a bad girl."" She stood, leaning closer to the door. ""Doctor Wilson would be angry...""

""I think worrying about your doctor is pretty low on the list of priorities, right now,"" Lynne said. The skeleton beneath her had an ID card sitting on top of its ribcage, stained with ages-old blood. It vaguely read, ""D. W--s-n."" She shook her head, booting the ID card off to the side with her foot. ""I'm sure he wouldn't mind. Just... give it a try, alright?"" She backed up from the door pre-emptively, giving herself a wide berth from the door. If the stories of dragons were true, then an anti-dragon weapon would have to be-

""Okay... I'll try. I'm sorry, doctor Wilson..."" 

In the next instant, the door blew open- literally- as the metal halves slammed into the opposite side of the hallway. Just beyond the door was the girl, with her fist out, looking rather confused. 

After shielding her eyes from debris and dust, Lynne gawked at the spectacle. ""Holy crap, kid! You're damn strong!"" she shouted. She quickly made her way over, looking the gray-skinned child over. ""Not even a scratch..."" 

""D-Did I do good...?"" the girl asked, frowning. She'd never destroyed anything before, at least, not anything that the doctors didn't tell her to break. 

""You did great!"" Lynne said, ""That was amazing! We could go into any room in this facility with those kinds of punches! Spec-tac-ular!"" She lifted the girl up, spinning her around in the air briefly. What had been looking to be a liability, was turning out to be a very small powerhouse. ""What should I call you, kid? 'Kid' or 'girl' or 'hey' are too impersonal."" 

The girl seemed taken aback by the contact, but she kept her hands to herself as she was spun around. ""Um... maybe... Adda? The doctors used to call me that."" 

""Alright, Adda! Nice to meet'cha!"" Lynne said. She set the girl down, before finally taking a better look around the inside of the room. What had once been clean and sterile was now quite dirty, although her toys and bed were relatively untouched. ""Do you need anything, Adda? Maybe a few toys for the road?"" She stepped in further, looking over all of them. 

Adda stepped in behind Lynne, and then went toward a toybox. ""Uh... j-just one,"" she said, pulling out a plastic toy, in the shape of a dragon. ""I love this one. His name is Dorval, and he's my best friend."" 

Lynne carefully took the toy from Adda, and then set it inside one of the more-protected pockets on her backpack. ""I'll make sure he doesn't get damaged on the way home, then,"" she said, giving the girl a wink. Then, she took her by the hand, leading her out of the room. ""It'll take a couple days, but if you don't have to eat, that'll make the journey easier. I'll still feed you- I mean, I'd feel bad otherwise.""

Adda kept her mouth closed, letting Lynne lead her away. In only a few minutes, her entire, sterile world had been flipped upside-down. In only a few more, she would leave everything she had ever known...

When they reached the entrance-and-exit of the facility, Lynne reached into her pocket, producing a pair of sunglasses. She carefully set them on Adda's face, covering her eyes. ""You've never seen the sun before, right?"" she asked, ""It might hurt, so keep these on."" 

Though the sunglasses barely fit, they managed to stay on her face. As they climbed up through the ceiling and onto the cliffside, the girl's skin was kissed by the sun for the very first time, as she looked over a vegetative wasteland.

"[WP] They sealed the creature away not to protect the world from it, but instead to protect it from the world.",TheSs7SsN,"The universe was just a youngling. Space was vast, carrying enough capacity to encompass all of us and our faults. 

The vast spaces meant that we had no reason to fight. All space was free and we moved homes as often as our hearts desired. There was not much of a past-time except for watching the stars. Bless them, but their mesmerising appearances deceived most of us the first time round. I myself have been scalded twice or thrice when I was tempted to tap it gently with the fleshy face near the tip of my finger. Why anyone needs to be scalded more than once to know the pain, I have no answer. 

On the rare occasions that we crossed paths with each other, it seemed common courtesy to greet each other kindly, and perhaps share a thought or a world-in-progress. I would pluck Eden from my sleeve, still a young shiny orb in my hands, and tell a stranger, would you like to create a miniature world too? Would you like to create life? 

Most of them were intrigued by the thought, but declined what they deemed as a tiresome project. Already, I was carving scars into the orb, squeezing the lands ever so slightly and with exquisite care to produce undulating terrain. One day, small pairs of eyes would stride this orb and stare up at me with their content little eyes with their simple dreams. 

Everything about them would be small, and that will help them live as brilliant sparks. Each of them would be a mini shining star, exuding brilliance before they come to an end in their transient lives. I packed more treasures in the orb than they would ever need to nurture them to maturity. The orb would be vast for them, but not so vast that they wouldn’t come across another mind for the average lifespan of a star. They will meet one another, learn to co-exist and learn. The transience of their lives will help them treasure their connections with one another. They will strive to document what they learn in a common language; this selflessness would make them knowledgeable and wise as a race. 

I just ran into another mind. He had made an elongated and limbless body for himself, black and cold as space but sparkly like the stars. 

As he flew across the worlds, his body outlined an undulating wave. When he stopped (presumably to greet me) he coiled himself into an intricate and throbbing mess. His two eyes, one of each side of a flat head, stared at me wordlessly. 

As a greeting, I extended my warmth to him and fished my orb from my sleeve. I was thinking of calling it Eden, I began. And that was when he struck at me, brandishing his fangs that had been well-hidden. I was entirely taken aback, having been assaulted for the first time in my time. The fangs sank into my arm and I almost dropped Eden from the jolt of pain. But I held on. 

I dived into his mind, trying to decipher the bizarre act that only caused hurt. I saw the darkness and coldness of empty space. It was like he was an embodiment of space itself. The sparks were from the stars that he’d swallowed whole. It was like he was struggling to gain some warmth for himself. And the stars weren’t nearly enough. 

He had begun as a hungry void, even though he had a mind with which to think and learn. It was such a terrible waste of a mind, when it was overpowered by hunger. 

He had coiled himself into a tight mess again, poised to spring out at me for the second time. But my arm was already healed. We are much more than the forms that we choose to take; it seems that he had yet to grasp this, among many other truths of the worlds. 

The vast, cold space was the origin of this creature. But it must not stay in the vast, cold space or it would never learn of warmth and joy. My mind raced to consider a million options. But it kept returning to the single viable one that I held in my hand all this while. 

Eden – my little orb that was to nurture transient and curious minds one day – would make a perfect sanctuary for this creature to learn of warmth. 

With my free hand I reached for the creature. It pushed itself away in a violent thrust and tried to swim into the far-off galaxies. But my body was just an extension of my will, and my will was stronger than the creature’s. My hand grasped the creature carefully and in an unbreakable grip. And I put him on Eden as its first mind. 

The next time I showed Eden to another mind, they were more intrigued by the creature than my talk of little minds and transient learners.

The only source of light in the cramped cell were rays of light coming through the window, placed several feet up. There was no way I could reach it, the walls were completely flat.

*I need, I ne-eed food, food?*

Oh god, it's coming back for me. I screamed for the guards, but the walls did a good job containing my screams of pain and agony. I patiently listened but couldn't hear anything. What did I expect? The walls were sound proof.

*I will feast on the bloo-od of the weak, yes the weak, the weak.*

My screams was getting louder and the pain in my body sharpened.

*Don't struggle, my little one, one. I will yes I will relieve yo-u of your pain, yes my little one.*

I screamed even more, this time yelling for it to stop. I begged, but the beast wouldn't give me mercy, it never did.

*Hello friend, now that we're together again, we can pl-ay once more. We will punish those who stood against us. We will devour them and create chaos world wide. Yes my lil' friend, I have devoured you too. I am the beast.*

My eyes widened, my skin broke and my claws extended. My senses arose and I sensed blood. 

*The hunt can begin now, little one.*

My muscles grew bigger and my eyes started to glow with a yellow tint. I can't escape this, for the beast is me, and I am the beast.

"[WP] They sealed the creature away not to protect the world from it, but instead to protect it from the world.",TheSs7SsN,"""Why would the two of you bother to protect it though?” Billy asked inquisitively.

There was plenty of time before they reached their destination so Josh began to narrate his story. 

""I must have been around fifteen when I went out with my parents for a camping trip. I was a little intrepid so I kept venturing off the marked trail. My mother kept chastising me and after a while I stopped. But I was stubborn, so the next day I woke earlier than usual. I saw my parents were asleep, so I discreetly crawled out of the tent and went to explore the woods. It was early morning and there was a chilly breeze. I kept walking but ensured I never strayed out of sight of the camp. Then, almost suddenly I heard a sound quite like this,"" and Josh proceeded to roll down his window. A hollow sound filled the vehicle. It was a low howl at first but gradually it grew louder until Billy closed his ears.

""It's cold."" Billy said.

Josh rolled up the window. ""When I heard that sound a cold sweat broke out across my forehead. I looked around but nothing was to be seen. Unfortunately, it seems I was having a bad day since almost instantly, it started to get hazy and just then I heard that sound again, but this time it was right behind me. I bolted. I ran as fast as I could, and never looked back. 

At some point I arrived at a clearing. I was heaving, the cold caught up with me and I couldn't move anymore. I fell to the ground. As I lay there scared I saw a figure approach me. It was walking on two legs. I was so relieved; I forced myself up and began walking towards it. But as I neared I realised it was holding something in its hand. I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw a man standing at the periphery of the clearing holding a bloodied axe. His expression was maniacal. The cold froze me in my place. As I saw him approach, tears began to well up in my eyes. When he was only a car's length away from me a huge figure pounced on the man throwing him on the ground. It was ferocious, in the haze that began to gather around me again all I saw was a huge greyish-white beast with two red eyes and a huge snout. The creature had grabbed the man by his arm. He had let go off his weapon in the pain. He was struggling under the huge beast, trying to throw it off him. I thought it was a bear. At some point the man lifted his other arm, curled his hand into a fist and struck the beast near its head. The beast reeled from the blow and let go off the man for a moment. Seeing the opportunity to escape, the man frantically got up and ran deeper into the forest. 

The beast turned to me. I realised I wasn't looking at a bear but a majestic animal of the winter - the wolf. It moved towards me, while I cursed my luck. Much to my surprise, when the wolf reached me it gentle nudged me in the other direction. Astonished, I whirled around. The wolf then guided me all the way back to the camp staying right ahead of me. When we approached the clearing of the camp, it shot me one last look before it ran back into the forest.""

Josh stopped speaking. Billy absorbed the story and silently reflected on his comments in the past day. By the time they arrived at their destination, the sun was out over the horizon. Billy looked up at the sign on the entrance - Subery Zoo. They walked over to the enclosure where a wolf was kept. There was a signpost right next to it which read: ""A majestic creature once found in abundance in the forest. Today, it has been hunted illegally almost to extinction. Where once prowled several thousand now only a few tens of these can be found in the wild. Today the wolf is protected from the very world, which once protected itself from it.""",notAnotherVoid

"[WP] You find the fountain of youth! The natives welcome you, but warn you to never drink of the fountain.",Vintner42,"Estan knelt by the pool, staring down into the depths.  Several brightly colored fish darted about beneath the turquoise surface as the sun beat down upon him, and sweat rolled down his neck.  His shirt clung to his back, and he wiped a lock of hair from his brow.

“I wish I could convince you not to do this,” his guide was saying.

Estan looked over.  His guide was old.  Very old, in fact.  The wrinkles upon his face could have been a map of the twisted spider’s web of canyons they had navigated to find their way to here.  His hand shook violently upon a metal cane, and what was left of his hair was white and so thin that the light scarcely paused in passing through it.

“And why is that?” Estan replied.

“It restores youth to you,” said the guide, “but not to the world.  You will be lost.  Alone.  A child in a strange land.”

Estan considered the words.  He thought back to his childhood, spent playing under the beech trees.  That had been before, though.  A whole five years before.  He would never have guessed what changes could happen in a mere five years.

“There are worse things in life,” he said.  He reached down, one finger just shy of the water.

“You are Estan, are you not?” the old man asked.  “Hero of Roa?”

Estan nodded.

“They say you killed a hundred men,” said the old man.  “And saved a hundred more.  They say you rallied the troops, and killed a lashed demon of the Cerulean King.”

“They do.”

“Were you injured?  Hurt in some way?”

Estan sighed, leaning away from the water.  “I was not.  Do you intend to ask questions all day?”

 “Perhaps,” said the guide.  “Knowledge is an old man’s prerogative.”

“And yet you didn’t think to ask me on the journey here?”

“I’ve only just recognized you!” said the man with a huff.  “My eyes are failing me, in my age.”

Estan looked the man up and down.  “Then why not drink for yourself?”

The man chuckled.  “I have lived a good life.  I have no interest in trading it in for a second try.”

There was a sound in the glade, like a distant strain of music pushing against the underside of the ground.  It hummed through them, so quiet as to be easily ignored, and so beautiful as to bring tears to the men’s eyes.  Estan turned back to the pool, looking into the waters.

“A second try, eh?”

“In a sense,” the guide said.  “You won’t get to redo anything but your own age, and you will lack the wisdom to do better.  I have seen men come here a hundred times, each time convinced that the pool will work a miracle, unable to see that it is their heart which continuously fails them.”

In the water, Estan could see the war.  He could see flashes of steel, so bright and quick in the midday sun.  He could hear the whistle of arrows, the crunch of clubs breaking against shields, or arms.  He smelled the blood, and dirt.  He hadn’t survived because of skill.  He had survived because of luck, the same as every other person upon that field.  He wondered why.

“I’m not worried about myself,” he said, dipping his fingers into the water.  He blinked as a trickle of numbness crept into his mind.  His memories of the trip to the pool became vague as the fish fluttering about beneath the water.

The old man sat down beside him.

“Why, then?”

Estan could still see the war.  He could still see her, standing beside him, her bracer spattered with demonic blood, and her smile bold like sunshine.  A hero. A blaze of light in the dark.  He would have followed her further.  So much further.

“It’s not enough to forget,” he said, bitterly.  “It’s not enough to put her out of my mind.”

He could see the spear, cast by an enemy with no real target, hurtling into the ranks like a lightning bolt, sent to hit whoever stood tallest among them, and of course it had been her.  She had sent Estas sprawling with one shove of a gauntleted hand, and a grin.

*See you in the next life, my love.*

“I can’t forget her,” he said.  “I can’t have her.  But I can go back.  All this heroism, all these medals, all of this life…”  tears dripped down his cheeks, splashing into the pool and sending little ripples out over the surface.  “I’d give it all for a second of thinking she was alive again.”

The old man was silent for a time.  “You are chasing a dream,” he said eventually.

“No,” said Estas.  “I am fleeing a nightmare.”

He tilted forward, and felt the rush of cool water surge up around him.  His mind winked out.  His memories vanished like sand upon a gale, and he could feel himself drift back, back, back.

He was a hero no more.  He liked to play beneath the beech trees, and dream of the glories of war. ",Ladoire

Despite clear warnings given to our men, a few succumbed to temptation and drank of the waters at the spring itself. They quickly shrank down to nothing and were dead.

""But you still recommend that we not drink from it.""

""Correct.""

Ciro sat down on the cold stone path leading up to the fountain and pulled one khaki-ed knee to his chest. His guide crouched next to him, balancing easily on the tips of her toes. She was young, only in her mid-teens, and had fairer skin than most of the natives. This was because she was the child of a Spanish explorer who had fallen in love with a native woman. The two had genuinely adored each other, and so, after he died, her mother had named the child Rosario, after her father. Even though at this point most of the natives were at least competent at speaking Spanish, Rosario was indisputably the best, as well as having reason to be amicable towards Ciro. Even so, he couldn't help but wonder if she was playing a cruel trick on him.

The fountain in front of him looked nothing like anything he'd pictured. Rather than being glorious, with rivulets of clear, crystalline water streaming down the detailed faces of stone angels, it was a small, burbling geyser. Water spurted out of the center constantly, steaming slightly, even in the equatorial heat. It would then pool in a small pocket around the geyser, before sinking quietly back into the earth from whence it came. It didn't look dirty or murky, but there was something strange in it's color; something about it was, inexplicably, too blue. Bluer than the sky or the ocean, much bluer than so little water should be. And something about it made Ciro anxious to look at.

""It's...not what I thought it would be.""

""It never is.""

Ciro took off his pith helmet and fanned himself with it. ""Well...I am still pretty young myself, so I guess I don't need it. And you certainly don't. But we came all the way out here, so why shouldn't I partake?""

Rosario frowned. ""You could if you really wanted to.""

""...you don't want me to.""

""Yes. The others might not mind, but I would."" There was a sad sort of look on her face. But also frustration. ""Words...I don't have the words...""

""Do you want me not to drink it because you think the youth will be drained?"" Ciro asked.

She shook her head. ""No, no. There will always be youth. I...augh. You don't have the words, Spanish doesn't have the words!"" Rosario hit the heel of her hand against her head a few times, growling under her breath with frustration. Most explorers would guess that this was from her mother's side of the family, but Ciro had met her father when he was a teenager himself, and he could see the first Rosario's habits and mannerisms in her self flagellation. After a small, annoyed snarl, she sat back on her heels, speaking slowly. ""What...what do you think happens when you're bones? Not to your bones. But to who you were before?""

Ciro blinked with confusion. ""Uhm...well, I'm a catholic, so I believe that I'll either go to Heaven if I've served God as He desires, or Hell if I've done evil. Heaven is a good place. Hell's a bad one.""

Rosario nodded, lips pursed with concentration. ""Our heaven and our hell are earth. Just...just not the same...no words no words no words."" 

She reached to hit herself again, but Ciro caught her hand. ""Deep breaths, Rosa. Deep breaths.""

Another nod. Rosario inhaled, then exhaled. ""When...when we're bones, the person we are doesn't go away. It's not in the bones. But it becomes part of a new. Part of another. We're bones, and then we're born. We become babies again, and we live again. We have youth."" Ciro couldn't help but stare at her with confusion. She looked him in the eyes, speaking slowly and meaningfully. ""The fountain doesn't take us back to youth. It brings us forwards to it.""

""oh...OH!"" Ciro staggered to his feet, taking a few clumsy steps back away from the fountain. ""...oh. I see. Thank you for explaining, Rosario. But...why did you do it?""

Rosario looked away, chewing on her lower lip. ""Mm. My mother tells me that my father said...he said that he wanted new youth. Because his adulthood had been torn in two. He wanted new youth to try it over again. Because he was broken. He was split in half. And I was only one.""

""Rosa?""

""I want to go to Spain.""

Ciro blinked. ""What?""

""I want to go to Spain."" Rosario repeated. ""You can get me there. You're the only one who can. I want to go to Spain so I can..."" she breathed deeply, shuddering, ""So I can meet my brothers and sisters.""

""By the emperor's leathery sack, could that really be it? It seems we found it kind of effortlessly.""

""But it is, look! It looks just like in the templar's drawing.""

They approached the unremarkable fountain which looked out of place in the jungle. The water seemed stale and was pungent smelling.

""Should we chance a sip, my dear von Scheizenberg?""

""I don't know. It looks awful.""

""Ah, don't be such a pu...""

""N'goong flah tooth pa!"" yelled a savage from somewhere in the jungle.

The explorers turned their rifles in the direction of the sound.

""I say, who is there?""

A fat little cherub of a savage limped out of the woodworks with three companions in tow.

"[WP] You find the fountain of youth! The natives welcome you, but warn you to never drink of the fountain.",Vintner42,"The soft, constant splash of water was the loudest noise in the clearing, the noisy jungle just a few steps away somehow muted in the presence of the fountain. The fountain was surprisingly large; a wide, shallow circular basin, with a small raised bit in the very middle where from came the water. The water itself was a placid light blue, with what may have been a slight supernatural glow when you looked at it with the corner of your eye.

""So what's the catch?"" Gwyn asked, titling his head to the side as if that would reveal some sinister secret.

""The catch?"" Al asked, still staring wide-eyed at the fountain. ""The catch is that we just found the bona-fide fountain of youth! The myth, the legend, the money-maker! The endless font of immortality! The 'catch' is that we're gonna have to figure out a way to sell this stuff without revealing it's location."" Eyes still locked on the fountain, Al stepped towards it.

A hand suddenly seized his shoulder. ""The Hell are you doing?""

Al turned, giving Gwyn a flat look. ""I'm going to go investigate the fountain, Gwyn. You know, the whole reason we're here?""

Gwyn let go of Al's shoulder, dropping his hand back to his machete hilt. ""Look, I just-- The natives were pretty damn specific about not drinking from the fountain. And there were a lot of old people in that village. Why would anyone grow old when the fountain of youth is just a few miles away?""

""Religion? Immunity? Stupidity? Who *cares*? We're on the brink of making history and you're being a total worrywart."" Al smirked. ""What's wrong, *Gwyndolin*? Afraid of disappointing your dad *again*?""

Gwyn remained silent, but his glare spoke volumes.

""That's what I thought. Don't worry,"" Al said as he pulled a flask from his pocket, ""I won't drink any of it, I'll just--""

Just before Al's hand could touch the water, a massive pair of jaws erupted from beneath the surface, swallowing his entire arm up to the shoulder. Al screamed as the strange beast hoisted him into the air, water rolling off of it's scaly hide as it shook the man back and forth. Gwyn snapped forward, grabbing for his machete, but a scaley tentacle-claw thing lashed at him and he tripping and fell avoiding it. Al continued to scream even as a second beast sprang from beneath the water to latch onto his legs, until they all suddenly submerged, leaving no trace of them except for the ripples of their passage and a few air bubbles that quickly stopped appearing.

Gwyn remained where he had fallen, staring at the fountain. Slowly, carefully, he picked himself up and crept away, unblinking eyes watching the water. He only allowed himself to breathe once he had backed completely out of the clearing.

""Who wants to live forever anyway?"" Gwyn muttered, not looking back as he strode away into the jungle.",Mikrin

Those weathered, bronze numbers on her apartment door was the last thing I can remember of her. It was the last day of our relationship, and the last day I thought I was going to be a father.  It just also happened to be the last day I saw anyone. 

It's been years since that day. That fateful morning when I thought that traffic was unusually light. The same morning when I thought I came to work during a holiday.  The same morning where I realized I was *alone*.  

I was so foolish back then, rushing back to her apartment, praying to God that her front doors and windows weren't open like all the other buildings and houses. So foolish just kneeling there in her bedroom, seeing all those windows open, and just crying my eyes out for what seemed like hours. 

Things are different now. This new world has no place for a paper pushing coward who'd abandon ship at the first sign of inconvenience.  All those years, sitting in a classroom, learning useless information about referendums and political maneuvering? Useless.  Keeping busy and staying sane are the keys to survival now.  

Oddly enough, one of my best tools is my trusty can opener.  The same event that apparently caused everyone to disappear, also happened to leave every door unlocked and unsecured. The world was my oyster, and I could have walked right into Fort Knox, if I so desired. But traveling the world ceased to be a priority for me.  I stayed in my familiar surroundings, and most of my trespassing was primarily motivated by my hunger.  And, after all this time, canned food is really the only edible substance, outside of foraging in the wild.   

When I wasn't stuffing my face with a can of cold beans, I was searching. I'd borrow a car from one of the many abandoned houses (you'd be surprised how many people leave their keys by the front door) and just drive as far as I could, in search of something... *anything* that could tell me what the hell just happened. Almost always, I came back empty handed to my old, familiar, abandoned, town.  I say almost, because there's one oddity in this new world that I just can't yet explain.

When I say that all the doors in the world were unlocked during the day everyone disappeared, I really meant to say that all 'man-made' doors were unlocked.  It's kind of hard to describe, but whenever I go out in search for clues, in rare occasions there's a door.  It looks like a man-made door, but it obviously isn't. It can be of various styles, and various colors but its almost always the same size.  

The reason I say that it obviously isn't man-made is because this door just *exists* in places that have no business having a door.  It'd be in the middle of a forest, or on the center of a football field, or just hovering ever-so-slightly at the edge of a cliff. And they're never there for long.  On several occasions, they'd just disappear the second i laid my eyes off them.  The one time I managed to gather the courage to try to open one of these fake-doors. It ended up being locked. Which is good enough for me, I didn't really have this dying urge to see what's on the other side.

But today was different.  1408.  The same door that belonged to my ex-girlfriend.  A completely ordinary, boring door, that would be so if it was located inside an apartment building, was standing right there in the middle of a lake. I normally would've glanced over it by now if it wasn't for those familiar numbers but there was something else about it that I wouldn't have noticed from so far away.  When I took one of the lakeside boats to it, I found out that this door, was *ajar*. 

It seemed like forever, pondering whether I should see what's on the other side of this ordinary-yet-alien door, but in the end, my curiosity and my loneliness got the better of me.

What. A. Crock.

Nononono.  Not the last man on earth.  The last *anything* that moves on its own power.  Plants?  Yeah, there's lots of *those*.

It's not been easy.  First, and most important. It turns out that there are a lot of critical systems out there that needed *constant* monitoring to keep them from going completely haywire and causing a lot of damage.  Without anyone around that's what they did.

I've always been a loner, and despite my worries, the first few days weren't so bad.  I played some games on my computer, since I lived in a hydropower area, and with no one else using it, that meant a lot of free electricity. I ate some food, but after a few days, the internet started getting strange.  

My old forums were, obviously, silent.  It was eerie.  Then I started running low on certain foods, and stepped outside.  That's when I realized just how much of what happens in the world depends on people and animals.  

Food has never been a problem--most of our canned goods have expiration dates that are absurdly short.  In truth, most of that stuff is good for decades.  And since the electricity was still on, frozen stuff lasted a good long time.  But I realized that unless I could either figure out where the people were or how to keep the electrons flowing, I was basically screwed.  Fortunately, with no one to stop me, getting access to the dam was easy, if annoying.

First time, I drove down there only to realize that the doors were locked.  Predictably, I suppose, but then I had to go back to the hardware store and grab a few tools to get in.  Once in, it's amazing how well somethings are documented about routine maintenance procedures.  I knew even then, though, that keeping that going would eventually require repairs. I spent a lot of time figuring out what supplies I would need for that when it happened, and how I might get them.  

All that really did, though, was delay me on the hunt for others.  I had no idea what worldwide communications were like, but I decided that two things might work.  I found out which websites were still working--many went dark as various payments failed or server farms lost their power, but there were enough to give me some hope.  

After two months, I broke into a records office and found a list of registered HAM radio operators in town.  I stole their equipment.  I started broadcasting on a five hour rotation.  Long enough gaps to let me get stuff done, like sleep, but guaranteed to get me broadcasting at different times each day.  

Five years after Vanishing Day (as I called it), I'd exhausted several key supplies.  First, there was no more beer in town, and I was going to have to move on to the harder stuff, which I realized was likely a bad plan.  Next, with pretty much all of the internet now gone, I was reduced to whatever mags were in the local shops for my supply of erotica.  And I was getting pretty tired of that stuff. Finally, I was starting to run low on *information*.  The local library had a lot of books that I didn't need, and depressingly few that were helpful.  

That had been a first move, actually.  To sort the library into books that were going to help me survive or find the other people and books that were either useless or not likely to help.  Of course, the book I needed probably didn't exist--""What to do if you are the only man left on the planet to find where all the people are.""

I figured the smart thing would be to do a drive around the country, using the electric pump i'd found and fashioned up to pull gas out of the giant tanks underground, but then I realized there was nothing other than my ignorance stopping me from hopping up to the local airport and taking a plane up.  

So I spent about a month reading up on how to fly a small plane.  Then another month figuring out how to do all the maintenance when various key pieces of infrastructure weren't working all that well.  Then another month just taxiing around the tarmac, trying to get up the nerve to actually take off.  

That first flight was scary.  Bad scary.  Almost as bad as the first flight over the Pacific.  I knew that *eventually* I'd run out of jet fuel, but airports, as it turns out, have pretty good stocks of the stuff.  Back when hundreds of planes came through with full loads, those stocks might have lasted only a day or so, but for a single plane flying all over the world?  Yeah, I had a nice supply.  

Getting to it was tricky, but not impossible.  Most of the security systems relied on alarms to bring other humans around.  Annoying noises and nothing else, now. I did keep a gun and plenty of ammo on hand, though.  No sense in tempting fate.  Because I've had a suspicion that if I *do* find other people, they are quite possibly going to be just as paranoid as I am.  I won't shoot first, but if they do shoot at me?  They'll be dead.

I spent the next ten years flying around the world, systematically covering every conceivable place to search for human life.  Eventually, though, I've given up.

I have a nice garden now.  I've acquired a sizeable set of equipment that I use sparingly.  I sometimes go on longer hauls to acquire various items.  It's not usually worth the effort, but I do it anyway.

I've never found a clue.  Nothing to say what or why. Not the slightest hint of anything.  Today though, I do have a question. And I'm scared.  Because when I woke up, there was a note on my front door.  All it said was, ""Hurry up, we're waiting for you to join us.""

Ok, so I know I don't have many options but screw this, at least I get my three hot meals and an hour in the sun every day back at the pen. If someone doesn't bring me some food soon, I'm not responsible for what happens next.

Just spent the last two hours beating on the door yelling for help. No ones coming. Thought I would be in trouble, something, anything, I'm alone. This is so much worse then prison. What the fuck did I sign up for.

Need water. Sink stopped working while I slept. Tried to drink the saline bag that I found, it was horrible. Still thirsty. Toilet has water, I'm not there yet. I'd yell some more but I can barely talk. Someone has to be watching me from the camera in the corner.
Wrote a note and hung it on the lens. It says, ""fuck you, send help"". Nothing to do now but wait some more.

The electricity is out, all I have to write by is a single red emergency light showing me the exit. It's still locked. I've torn apart the room again looking for anything to break it down with. So tired. Can barely stand anyway. It's too late, too weak, should have tried earlier.

Lucifer was tired. Days he spent dealing with the latest episode of human pain, and now he was being interrupted, by Gabriel no less. Couldn't he see the value of his job? What did God want this time? Whatever it was, he just hoped it wouldn't take too much of his precious time.

He approached the golden gate to heaven and was met by the guards. From his skin sack he pulled out the gold encrusted silky-smooth paper, with his name written in the finest handwriting he had ever seen written displayed so clearly on the envelope. As he was ready to hand in the letter the guard motioned to put it away. 

""Don't need it, just go right in, and I wouldn't take your sweet time either, Mike's getting pretty anxious about this""

""That bad huh? Well, I guess I'd better hurry then.""

""yes, you should, for all our sake""

He knew something was up the moment Gabriel told him to meet with Michael and not God. He never did business with Michael, not since the split, but if he wasn't able to speak with God directly, then whatever was going on was definitely more important than preparing the world for World War III.

As he approached the Temple in all it's white marble glory he was immediately redirected by the guards outside. ""Archangels only"" as it were. But where was Michael? This was the designated meeting place after all.

""Excuse me, where could I find Michael?""

""Over here"" called a voice from behind him. It was Michael and Gabriel, and the looks on their faces were immensely distressing. 

""This can't be good""

""Not in the slightest, that's why we need you""

""Alright, give me the lowdown""

""Straight to the point, eh? I missed that about you, anyways...""

Michael's eyes drifted off revealing a face of even greater despair

""God...um...he's declared himself...erm...an Atheist""

""So...he doesn't believe he exists?""

Lucifer had no idea how the heck that was supposed to work, but if God lost faith in his OWN existence, then the entirety of the universe might eventually go with him. But God had convinced himself of wacky things before, so perhaps he could find a way to fix this one.

""yeah, he's completely lost it We tried everything until he blew it and locked himself in the inner sanctum of the Temple. We can't seem to get him out. But it gets worse.”

""Worse?""

""He's become more than just your run-of-the-mill Atheist..he's...he's grown...""

""Grown what?"" Lucifer demanded to know, the truth must be revealed

Michael gulped. ""He's grown...a neckbeard""

Lucifer looked back up at the temple.

He appeared to be reading a heavy book in his lap. I tried hard to calm down from my adrenaline as I sat on the wooden chair. It was hard not to stare at his horns or the tail that was slithering left and right. 

""I'm dead?"" I blurted out stupidly. The reality of the car accident jolted me out of my seat, I must have died instantly upon impact. ""I'm dead?!"" The red.. demon simply nodded ever so slightly without looking up from his tome.

I looked up and noticed that the ceiling seemed to have been slashed off by diagonally with a large burning object. I could only see a pulsing red light emanating from where the sky should be. Otherwise, it looked like an old office with a desk, a set of chairs, and an old analogue clock behind me.

""Feel free to roam about as you wish outside. Do whatever you want,"" the demon's bored tone pierced through the silence. I got up and wandered over to the door. Slowly, I opened the door. The sounds of the world outside came rushing in, I could hear the rustling of chains and anguish cries. Metal struck against metal and fire roared uncontrollably. I braced myself, preparing to walk out into this mess.

""Before you go, you should know something,"" the demon finally looked up from his book. The fact did he did so caused me to close the door and give him my undivided attention.

""Every thousand years, Satan and God switch places. Chaos and the freedom to do whatever you want are the only rules of Hell as of now. When God comes, it will be absolute law and order,"" he looked at me, expecting me to understand.

I slowly opened my eyes to find a man wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and a pair of flip flops. We near a sunny, tropical beach. My senses were slowly getting clearer, and I could make out people all along the sand and in the water.

""Is this really Hell?"" I asked. ""It looks nothing like what I expected.""

""That won't last long,"" said the man, his grim expression contrasting strongly with the scenery.

""What do you mean? What's going to happen?"" I glanced at the people on the beach again. Something was off about them.

""A millennium has passed, and God and Satan are about to switch places,"" the man said. I started to notice a sound in the air around us.

""Wait, isn't that great for us? God is kind and forgiving, won't life here become even better?"" The man's face grew more pained as I spoke.

""Didn't you know?"" The man cried, ""'God' and 'Satan' are just the names of the positions. Who do you think cast Noah's flood? Or started the Black Plague? We've been free for a thousand years, and now he's coming back!""

""Awake?"" I said. ""Where the hell am I?"" 

""Hell!!!"" He said with a bit of levity. ""How rude am I... I haven't even introduced myself and I'm already talking about eternal damnation.  I, and Satan. Well that's my title anyway.

But I kind of sorts made a deal with The One, so that I could enjoy the simple pleasures in afterlife, and all your sins would still get paid for. So we switch places every thousands years.

"[WP] Every 1000 years God and the Satan switch places on who rules which afterlife. You died and went to hell right before the switch, and everyone seems to be afraid of Satan leaving.",cluody132,"Abbadon sat down heavily on the throne made of bones and sighed deeply, exhaling just a hint of flame.

""Well, that concludes our tour."" He said to me in a resigned voice.

I looked up at the ancient demon and was shocked to find myself feeling just a little sympathetic. I was the one who was just condemned to hell after all.

""Abbadon..."" I began carefully.

""Just call me Abby."" Abbadon mentioned in the tone of a child whose birthday party attendance had been lackluster.

""Okay, Abby..."" I continued. ""Why are you so sad? It really doesn't seem that bad here to be honest... not that I am complaining!""

Truth be told it really wasn't that bad. The tour of hell had began in mind-numbing horror as we traversed a river of brimstone and flame, but quickly took a turn as we reached the far shore, revealing a bustling civilized metropolis populated by the damned and demons alike in an expansive cave system that seemed to stretch infinitely into the distance. After a couple of hours going over the rules and regulations, and touring the seemingly endless city, Abbadon had reminded me of nothing more than a orientation counselor who introduces new tenants to their infernal fate. To my surprise, Hell seemed to be a pleasant place with a sound municipal structure and a healthy economy. At the end of the tour the ancient demon had taken me back to the city gates, where the demons of time immemorial watched over the souls of the damned. For the most part Abby had stuck to the script during his tour, but from his enthusiasm it was clear that he loved his job. This made his current sullenness even more alarming... perhaps there was a catch after all.

""Well, enjoy it while you can."" Abbadon said in his incredibly deep and resonant voice. Every time he spoke I could hear whispers in the back of my mind, but the effect had ceased being disturbing earlier in the day following an explanation and apology by Abbadon. Human brains can't really handle the voices of angels, even fallen ones. ""In a couple months we are going to go under new ownership, and the new guy is a huge jerk.""

I knew it. The catch. Satan must have been on vacation for this place to have pulled ahead this far. I felt a sinking feeling in my gut.

""Is the Devil coming back?"" I asked, somehow already knowing the question was more of a statement.

""The Devil?"" Abby said, lifting his enormous horned skull from his hands to make eye contact with me. His wings flapped involuntarily. ""No, not the Devil. Lucy has always been the best. No, every thousand or so years he and God trade roles and we are about due for a switch.""

The information reached my ears, and my ears helpfully transferred this information to my brain, but my brain soundly rejected its computational duties.

""What do you mean?"" I asked, genuinely perplexed.

""Well..."" Abby began. ""Historically speaking he hates us, and usually he tortures us the whole thousand years.""

""What?!"" I exclaimed. ""God? That is what the Devil is supposed to do!""

""According to whom?"" Abby inquired.

""The Bible."" I answered, doing my best to keep my cool. People can be a bit funny when arguing about religion I knew.

""So according to the book he wrote the place he doesn't run and sends his rejects is poorly managed?"" Abby stated in his resonant voice.

His question hung there, untouched in the warm, humid air.

I felt the sinking feeling in my stomach progress to a tumultuous drop in what had formerly been the bottom of my stomach.

""Anyway,"" Abby continued, ""ever since we quit our old jobs as angels God has been absolutely awful to us whenever it is his turn for a shift."" 

The ancient demon shifted about uncomfortably for a moment.

""And he usually starts by forcing us to torture our friends and residents for a couple hundred years. Last time I had to skin people for three hundred straight years."" Abby stated dejectedly. He leaned forward and put his horned head back into his clawed hands with a genuine look of sadness.

I didn't know the right words to say to comfort old Abby, so instead I wet myself and wept hysterically.

"[WP] ""But what do I do if I find her?"" ""Bite your tongue and look the other way.""",linknmike,"""But what do I do if I find her?"" I asked.

""Bite your tongue and look the other way."" My grandfather's response was gruff. I stared into his white pearl eyes as the flames of the campfire caused shadows to dance against his face. He'd found the Queen of the Forest when he was not much older than I was. His face was craggy and his beard green and mossy. Even staring blindly at the fire I could tell that he was entrenched in the memory of his encounter with the Queen.
I lay back on my slab and struggled to find sleep. Doubts ran rampant in my mind. What if I couldn't look away from her? What if I called out to her as my grandfather had? Would I end up as he did- a crumbling shadow of his youthful pinnacle. Not for the first time this week, I cursed my luck to have been selected to venture into the Queen's woods to retrieve a piece of the Sacred Stone. Tonight, my grandfather and I kept our camp a good distance away from the trees that broke the flatness of the plain. No sense in angering the Queen with fire before I trespassed into her forest, as Grandfather put it.
I didn't know how long I slept. I knew exactly when I awoke. The sky displayed all the colors of the rainbow dunes far to the west. Grandfather was already awake, poking at the embers of our firepit. He noticed I was awake and began to unpack breakfast.

""Get up and help me get cooking,"" he said as he laid out the victuals next to the glowing charcoal.

""I'm not particularly hungry. I figure I might as well get started with the pilgrimage."" I said.

""Nonsense, you need your strength, stay a bit longer."" I could hear the pleading worry seep through his voice.

""Nah, Grandda, I'm already trespassing into the Queen's forest. How do you think she would feel if I started retching up my breakfast on account of my nerves?"" I quipped. Grandfather chuckled and a grin broke up his stony face. I picked up my rucksack and strapped it to my back. After a potential final embrace with Grandfather, I made the long walk from our camp into the trees.

Stepping over the invisible line dividing the plains from the forest was like entering another world. The early morning sun fought to break through the canopy of leaves overhead. Stray beams of light cascaded down to illuminate drops of dew that had formed on the smaller saplings. The ever constant wind that had accompanied Grandfather and I's journey dropped to a gentle breeze almost immediately. By the time I had entered a hundred paces the air took on an eerie stillness. The dimness of the light and the unfamiliarity of the air only served to increase my sense of unease.

Just as Grandfather had told me, I sensed the presence of the holy stones toward the center of the forest. I crept through the trees. I paused after each snap of a twig underneath my heavy feet. I half expected the Queen of the Forest to jump out at any moment. I remained disappointed of that expectation. As I progressed, the smooth bark of the younger trees gave way to more gnarled and rough bark. The path I followed grew rough. Several times I was forced to double back as the underbrush proved impossible to navigate. The light the filtered through the leaves above me grew constantly until finally I stumbled on something other than a root. 

Nursing my wounded pride, I looked to see that I had stumble upon a block of moss colored stone. I stood up and pressed onward. My reward broke in front of me. A temple built of rocks of that shimmered with iridescence. I had found the holy stones of my people. I made my way into the ruins. Just being present there overcame me with awe. I gathered my wits after several moments and sought out the orb of stone that had been described to me. Finding it at the center of the temple, I stashed it in my sack and prepared to escape from the Queen's forest. Retracing my previous path, I made good time. I started to believe that I would get out of the woods without having to worry about the Queen. I was wrong.

Just as the trees around me started to shift to the smoother bark of the edges of the forest, I saw her figure. She stood there near the edge of the forest. Her skin the light green of fresh wood. Green leaves that appeared to be ivy covered her limbs and torso and stretched up into a mane covering her head. Her eyes shone like the most beautiful jade. Entranced, my legs locked in place. Grandfather's advice echoed in my head, but the words rang hollow compared to the beauty I was confronted with. She beckoned me closer, and I stepped toward her, unable to resist.Bite your tongue and look the other way. The sound seemed to emanate throughout the trees.

Grandfather burst into the woods, yelling once more.

""Bite your tongue and look away, boy!""

The Queen's eyes turned red. She wheeled about to face the intruder. Slackjawed, I remained locked in place. My Grandfather ran up and engaged with her, tendrils of vine wrapping around his hewn features. He continued to yell out his advice and the two of them struggled against the other. I bit my tongue so hard that my blood began to seep out and scorch the plants it dripped on. I tore my gaze away and built up momentum crashing through the trees as they grew sparser.

I waited in vigil well outside the reach of the forest for three days in vigil for Grandfather. He never emerged. It was with a heavy heart that I began the pilgrimage home.",aproposcrouse

Four hours a week of eye tests- we had to put on goggles that showed tiny hints of shades of grey on a sunny background. We had the press the button whenever we saw grey.

We were the first line of defense- we had to be able to see the threat coming miles before it came into range. But still, it was stressful to say the least. 

Then came the physical training. Every day we had lung practice. We would hold our breath underwater for at least two and a half minutes.

"[WP] Lightning is extremely rare, but when it does strike, it always hits people.",scarf-ace,"""Joey, get back here!""

Heavy rain washed down my face and soaked the ground around me, but I still ran forwards, pulling my feet up through the quickly forming mud. My brother stood defiantly at the base of the hill. He was only 10, and he couldn't have fully grasped the gravity of his actions. The village elders had always told the tales to us, but right now the warnings only fueled Joey's rebellious streak. 

""Never go into the Wastes, not even a single step,"" they would say. ""The gods watch over the Wastes, it is their territory. If you go into the Wastes, they will pluck your soul from your body."" The child sitting on the elder's knee would ask, ""what does a soul look like?"" ""A soul is the brightest thing in the world, aside from the Sun himself. And when the gods take your soul, they speak a magic word."" The child would lean closer. ""The magic word,"" the elder continues, ""sounds like this!"" They would clap as loud as they could, and the child would jump in suprise. All the adults would laugh. 

Still, the lesson was a serious one; you never left the treeline, never walked into the Wastes at the edge of the forest. Joey, in the midst of some argument I couldn't even remember now, had fled from the house and sprinted away from the trees. My father was off on a hunt, so my mother pushed me out the door, screaming at me to stop my brother. Now Joey and I stood 100 meters from the treeline, and I was screaming at him.

""What were you thinking?!""

""I hate you!""

""It was just a stupid argument! Come on, we need to get out of here!"" I looked around warily. I didn't know if the tales were true, but I didn't want to stick around to find out. The adults never went out into the Wastes either, and that was all the reason I needed.

""Go away,"" Joey said, but this time it seemed less forceful, like he was only playing the part of being angry to avoid losing face.

""Look, if you come inside, we can make some sweetbark tea. Sound good?""

Joey didn't reply, so I grabbed his hand and gently started leading him back. He went without resistance. After a few steps Joey dropped his hand and started walking ahead of me. At that moment I was possessed to look up, straight into the rain and the clouds above me. Light flickered in the clouds, like ephemeral veins in some cosmic eye, or--

Something punched me in the face. I felt my body topple to the ground, but I couldn't see or hear. I think my eyes were open, but my vision was white. Or it was black. It seemed to flicker between the two. My ears seemed to be wrapped in cloth, although I could hear a ringing sound like a thousand bells being struck at once. After what seemed like ages, I could finally make out Joey standing near me, staring wide-eyed at me on the ground. I felt incredibly light-headed when I tried to urge my limbs to move, so I tried to speak to Joey, and only managed to croak out an incomprehensible sound. He jumped in surprise, looked at my face, and took off running toward the tree line.

I struggled to my feet, and slogged through the heavy mud, up the hill towards our village. I pushed open the door and staggered into our house, still dizzy and light-headed. I blinked a few times and took in the scene before me. My mother stood, shaking, looking in my direction but avoiding looking straight at me. My brother cowered behind her. To their left, my grandmother was brandishing a knife. I took a step forwards. ""Back!"" my grandmother screamed.

""W-what?"" The shaky word was all I could manage to say.

""Leave this home, soulless one! Seek destruction elsewhere, zombie.""

""I... what? Guys, it's me. Mom? Joey?""

""I saw them take you,"" Joey shouted. My mother said nothing, and didn't look at me.

""Take me?""

""The gods took your soul!""

""I... see.""

My grandmother stepped towards me, waving the knife about. I stepped back, then left the doorway and turned away. I trudged away from the warm house, the torrential rain soaking me once again. I brushed the trunk of the last tree I passed with my hand, then continued walking into the Wastes. I walked and waited for the gods to finish the job. ",Headhunter09
"[WP] The ""dislike"" button on YouTube videos is replaced with a ""electrocute uploader"" button.",tsintzask,"""Finally"" He mumbles angrily, feeling his breathing go heavy as he clicks onto Justin Biebers YouTube channel. He felt a surge of power flow through him as he let his cursor glide slowly ontop of the electrocute button. It felt so natural to do it, yet so out of place with the new icon.

He used to do this alot. Pressing the dislike button, navigating to the comment section, typing as fast as his greasy sausages would allow him.
He would usually end up exhausted and having to calm his breath after each comment.

As his mind drifted off, following the routine, he felt his hand hit the mouse button, his cursor drift to the big writing box he was so familiar with, and heard the loud clicks of his mechanical keyboard firing away at this /Justin Bieber/.

Suddenly, it came to him. He had killed a man. He felt his fat wobbling as he tightened his muscles, his scalp breaking sweat after sweat under his fedora. He began to feel uneasy, and he felt the drinks and crisps in his stomach lunging towards the upper exit. His keyboard was covered in a wierd greenish colour, the colour of Doritos mixed with stomach bile. The unusual smell of puke began filling the room, and his stomach lurched a second time at this. This time, however, he was ready, had felt it coming. He bent to the side and projectile vomited at his second monitor, dousing his favorite pony in puke.

Another thought came to him. He grabbed the last pieces of corroded Doritos out of his neckbeard, and clicked onto his own YouTube page. He went to his latest video and watched the amount of likes and dislikes closely. For what felt like hours he sat, in his pile of puke, sweat gathering at his moobs, waiting for the inevitable.

He jerked from his chair from surprise, as the dislike bar gained a pixel. He felt a slight tingling sensation at his feet, that rose up his legs. As the electricity claimed him, he thought about closing his YouTube page. He thought it might safe his upper-body from paralysis. He moved his hand with all his might, but it wouldn't budge. Finally, he relaxed his muscles, and as the tingle, still becoming stronger, neared his heart, he felt his sight grow narrow and his heartbeat peaking. His stomach lurched a third time, this time releasing nothing but bile in his throat. The burning sensation in his throat was the last thing he felt, as his nerves grew numb and the hum of his computer grew further away, only to disappear completely, being the last thing he sensed.

"[WP] A famed detective is murdered at his dinner party, and it's up to the butler to figure out whodunnit.",8bitfusion,"In his eight years of service to the illustrious detective York, George had never once been called upon to contribute even a shred of testimony to a case. He was as qualified to conduct an investigation as his master's pet parrot. Yet, here he was, elected the de facto leader for the case on account of his airtight alibi. What would York have done were he still alive?

The velvety voice of his master came wandering back to him. ""Interrogation is the first step to solving a case.""

George lowered himself into a squat, eye-to-eye with York's 10-year-old nephew Jonas. ""Did you do it?""

""No,"" he sniffed. A tear trickled out the corner of his eye.

""Sorry."" George blushed and shuffled three steps to the right to face the next person on the couch. ""What about you?""

""Goodness, no!"" York's fiancé, Petunia, blew her nose on a lace handkerchief and rubbed her reddened eyes.

""Well, by process of elimination..."" George crossed the couch, back past Petunia, past Jonas, all the way to the left end. ""...it must be you.""

""I ain't responsible."" Simon, York's drug dealer, adjusted his sunglasses and perched a cigar between his teeth.

Well, step one had failed. Being a detective was harder than it looked. Frowning, George dropped into an empty armchair. What was next?

York's voice rang in his ears once again. ""Look for clues.""

The cause of death had been a blow to the back of the head, administered by a blunt object. The room was beginning to fill with smoke, smoke that bore a distinct odor...

""Simon, is that a blunt?""

""No, dude. It's just a regular cigar. Stop asking dumb questions."" Simon waggled his walking stick threateningly at George.

His attention turned back to Jonas. He was a small kid, light enough to be picked up and carried around—or used as a bludgeoning weapon. Petunia yawned, fibrous cords rippling in her muscular arms. A grisly image began to form within George's head. Jonas noticed that George was staring at him and began to sob into a pillow.

""Look, George,"" Petunia said, interrupting his reverie, ""we appreciate your efforts, but maybe we should turn this case over to the police.""

A disgrace, that was what he was. How could he be so incompetent as to fail to avenge his master? York's final words came rushing back to him: ""George, quit standing around like a buffoon, and go brew us some tea."" Even his master would've probably predicted his failure. Perhaps he was better off sticking to what he knew. 

""Okay, I'll call the police,"" George said, ""but first, let me make all of you some tea.""

The four waited around for the police to arrive, sipping on their cups. Simon folded his arms and harrumphed, chewing on his cigar. Petunia stared at the ceiling morosely. Jonas was still sniffling. He suddenly began to cough, clutching his stomach and tumbling to the floor. 

""What's wrong?"" Petunia rushed over to his side. She, too, began to cough, as did Simon.

""It's true,"" George said solemnly, ""I could never be half the detective York was. But that didn't mean I couldn't solve the case: I just had to do things my way."" He held up a small vial. ""I poisoned all of your tea. If the murderer doesn't come forward, all of you will die.""

""You're a monster!"" Petunia shrieked. She had wrapped Jonas in her arms: he was half-unconscious now, spit dribbling down his chin. ""How could you poison an innocent child?"" Simon nodded in agreement, shaking on the floor, on all fours. ""That was dirty, bro. But fine, I confess. It was me.""

A vision of York appeared before George: he was standing in a golden field in the afterlife, nodding, impressed. ""Good work, my old friend."" George bowed. The antidote slipped out of his jacket pocket and shattered on the floor.",hideouts
(WP) The unicorns have to be stopped.,AltonComet,"Sir Norbert and the Attack of the Killer Unicorns
Part 1 of 2

""We what?""

""We *have* to stop the bastard unicorns! Sir!""

""What about the regular unicorns?""

Sir Norbert's squire blinked.  ""What?""

The big knight sighed. ""I said what about the regular unicorns? You said we need to stop the bastard ones.""

The joke was lost on the squire, a short, thin--and probably wholly unsuited to the job--man. Well, probably a man.  Norbert wasn't entirely certain on that score either.  The squire's face twisted up tight as he worked his way through the mental gymnastics of the joke.  It was clear he wouldn't stick the landing. Norbert decided to move on from that.  ""Never you mind that, Alfonso. What unicorns, and why do we need to stop them?  I've always heard they were myths.""

""Well I dunno about no mists, sir, but the unicorns attacked and looted a town about thirty miles from here.  About a dozen of em, from what I hear.""

""A dozen towns? Or unicorns?""  

Alfonso narrowed his eyes, apparently trying to decide if Norbert was pulling his leg or not. ""Unicorns, sir.""  

""Ah, good.  That's not so bad.  So about that.  What do they do?""

""Impaled the maidens on them horns, sir.  And then runned off with bags of lutes.""

Norbert frowned at that.  ""Lutes?  Like the noisy string things that bards carry? Or loot?  Like treasure?""

Alfonso thought about that for a moment.  ""Ayyup.  It were lutes, right enough.""

""Bags of them you say?""

""Definitely, sir.  Whole heaping bags of lutes.""

Norbert opened his mouth to ask how, then thought better of it.  Instead he asked, ""And they impaled maidens on their horns first?""

""That's how I heared it, yep. About twenty maidens, they was what died.""

Norbert frowned.  As was normal, the more excited Alfonso got, the worse his grammar grew.  ""What village did you say this was.""

""Somnerton, sir.""

""Somnerton?  That doesn't make sense.  I'd have wagered there weren't more than a single maiden left there.  At least, not after my last trip, if you understand me.""

""Sir?""  It was clear his squire absolutely did *not* understand him, not for a moment anyway.  Then understanding suddenly lit up his rather dirty face.  Norbert made a note to dump the squire in the nearest stream next chance he got so he could get his monthly bath.  ""Well, sir, the man said they was maidens.  I don' reckon I can say rightly.  Affer all, I jus' tellin' you what I was learnt.""

Norbert tried not to grimace at the atrocious grammar, failed, then said, ""Okay, but young women then?""

""Yessir.  Well probably some of 'em was youngishly.  I reckon they wast, anyhoo.""

*Wast?* thought Norbert.  Best not to ask how that antiquity had crept into Alfonso's rather questionable vocabulary and general abuse of the language. Aloud he just said, ""Okay, so the unicorns killed some women of uncertain maidenhood and age, yes?""

""Ah, if you say so sir, but mesself, I jus' tellin' what I heared.""

""Okay, and we have to stop them?""

""Ayyup.""  

""Right then.  Tell me something, Alfonso.  Where are they now?""

""Well sir, I be thinkin longst and muchly onnit, and I thinked up an answer to yer questionerings.""

""And?""  Norbert's head was beginning to pound from trying to interpret Alfonso's mangled linguistics.  

""Well the bastards was seen as to runned to the woods near Somnerton, and I thinks what that they likely to haves a fortress there.""

Norbert gave his squire a sharp glance.  A fortress?  ""Tell me something Alfonso.  How in the name of the Holy Trinity do Unicorns build a fortress?""

""Oh no sir, I don' reckon they is likely to benedict the Trinity.  More likely they just magic up a place with them magic horns of thems.""

Norbert had to admit it did seem unlikely the unicorn were good Christians. Not with the impaling of women.  And stealing of lutes--*although*, he mused, *taking away the lutes might actually be a net positive act.*  He'd have to ask the good Friar Borris.

""So we're to search the whole forests near Somnerton for a magical unicorn fort, squire Alfonso?""

""I thinks that sound right.""

""Well we'd better get started then.""

Norbert heaved himself up onto his destrier, not bothering with armor.  It'd be hours to get Alfonso to help him properly armor up, and then climbing up on the animal's back while clad in heavy plate was also a chore.  Usually best done with a winch.  

Norbert clambered up on his own horse--well, more of a pony, really, and the two men set off toward Somnerton.  As they rode, Norbert entertained thoughts of a cleaner squire and the possibilities for a better life that might be achieved by forcing Alfonso through a proper tutelage with a linguistics scholar. Someone sturdy enough to beat some proper grammar into his erstwhile squire, but with the patience to not strangle the short man.

After a few miles, his head had settled enough to endure another round of questions with Alfonso.

""So, Alfonso, tell me something.""

""What sort of something, sir?""

""Well, young squire,""--a lie, as Alfonso was at least twenty years his senior--""why is it that you and I need to be the ones to do something about these misbegotten equines?""

""The what's?  I thought we was affer some unicorns.""

""We are.""

""Then whys did you be carlling them sequineses?""

Norbert worked through that for a minute.  It was clear that a few miles hadn't settled the squire even a little. He gave up.  ""Equines.  It means they are sorta like horses.""

""Ah, very good sir.  But they aren't all that horse-ish, sir.  More like deer, iffin you ask me.  But even deer gots two horns.""

""Antlers.""  Norbert said before he could stop himself.  

""Antlers? I guessin' you right, but I never saw no ants near them deers what I been huntin'.""

""Hunting? Squire, I've never seen you hunt.""

The man looked offended.  ""Sir, I tell you that I be the best hunter in all of...wherever we are. Where are we again?""

""On the road to Somnerton.""

""Right.  I'm the best hunter on this road.""

Norbert blinked in surprise, but chose to say nothing.  The big knight was more than a little confused by Alfonso’s claim, since he’d never seen the little man hunt *anything*.  By the time they reached Somnerton, the pair had settled into a silent truce.  Norbert wouldn’t say anything that might confused Alfonso’s limited wit, which resulted in far less verbal assault on anything resembling grammar.

Somnerton lay nestled in the curve of Somner River, rising up on a low bluff above the river, with small docks jutting out into the river.  Plumes of smoke rose from stoves and cooking fires, but as they got close, Norbert realized there were several smoking ruins of buildings as well.  A sizeable village, Somnerton held nearly seven hundred people, and Norbert had pleasant memories of friendly barmaids, parents willing to turn a blind eye for a lowly Knight-Earl that stood so far from succession to anything that he could, on a good day, just barely get in to see someone that might, should enough  people die in the right order, conceivably inherit the *actual* earldom.  It had been a pleasant month the last time he’d come through, though apparently escorting three of the local daughters to his rooms at once had crossed some sort of line for the locals.

As he approached though, a cry went up, and Alfonso grinned at him.  “Sir, it’s a lookin as to like they don’ remmemmer you too well.”

Norbert shrugged.  He was sure they would.  His crest was plain to see, and it had hung in his favorite tavern for most of the month last time.  But he knew that people had a tendency to forgive the powerful people they met when they *needed* something.  Like today.

Before they reached the edge of the town proper--Somnerton had no true city walls--a crowd had gathered, along with shouts of welcome and thanks.  A particularly buxom lady bowed deeply, showing lots of promises with the bow, winked at him and said, “Welcome my Lord.  Somnerton is grateful to have you return at our time of need.”

“Thank you dear lady Zinia.  Lead us to your good tavern, and we’ll speak of this need.”

“Alas, Sir Norbert, the *Reclining Twins* was savaged greatly in the attack.”

Well that was a shame.  The *Reclining Twins* had been his favorite, in no small part because this buxom lady and her ample charms.  And skills.  But since he’d been less focused on the beer than on her, it wasn’t that terrible.  “Tell me, were any of your servers hurt in the attack?”

She nodded her head gravely. “Sadly, young Nerissa and her sister Nellissa were both mortally injured.”

That was unfortunate.  Those two had been quite gifted.  And enthusiastic.  In several ways.  “That’s terrible!  Well, rest assured, good people, I will avenge them! Lead on, my dear lady, and we shall speak of this terrible assault on your good town!”

The crowd funneled Norbert and Alfonso into the village square, where a few casks of ale were rolled out and set up.  After accepting the villager’s generosity, Norbert sat at a table with Zinia, the village Mayor, and a few other notables, who confirmed most of Alfonso’s tale.

“Well, Sir knight, they did attack,” the Mayor clarified. “ Set fires with those horns of theirs, and made off with quite a bit of valuables. I don’t *recall* any musical instruments being taken, but they certainly did kill several young women of the town.”

Norbert nodded gravely, unsurprised by Alfonso’s garbled version of the events. “Anything else I should know?”

Zinia spoke up. “Sir, they didn’t kill all the young women.  They took several with them still alive.”

Norbert brightened at this.  Rescuing maidens--or at least, young women--was the perennial pastime for a knight.  Even when the young women started as a maiden, they rarely were by the time they returned home.  Few knights could resist the advances of a grateful young beauty *anxious* to show her gratitude.

(WP) The unicorns have to be stopped.,AltonComet,"Part 2 of 2

The remainder of the day--what there was--was spent in discussing strategies and ideas for finding the Unicorns. The best part though was that Alfonso quickly found his own crowd of people to help him butcher the language.  Well that and Zinia’s clear invitation.  “Sir Norbert, I may have lost the building, but I still have my own twins that would dearly love to spend some time in your company.  My home is nearby, won’t you come see them?”

“Madam, you honor me.  Of course I will accept.”  It was after all, only chivalrous to treat a lady well.  As it turned out, the twins were doing quite well.

The next morning, Norbert rose early--well some point before noon--found Alfonso and badgered his squire into helping him climb into his cage of armor, then pad everything so he wouldn’t be heard several miles distant.  Somnerton had a mounting platform and his destrier, Hero’s Noble Call of Justice, was well trained for that, so the knight was spared the indignity of being hoisted or shoved onto the poor animal’s back.  Stairs were easy enough to walk up even fully armored.  

They rode into the forest and at first Alfonso was garrulous. “I was finking, sir,” he started, and though Norbert doubted the random bubblings of ideas through what passed for the man’s brain counted as *thinking*, he didn’t interrupt.  He was still enjoying the memory of a night well-spent.  Alfonso went on.  “I were thinkering what that these Unicorns might be a bit like a goat-horse wit’ only one horn.  Cause of how them Romer speakers say that uni means one.”

That go Norbert’s attention enough to snap him out of his reverie.  Alfonso knew enough Latin to actually know that uni meant one?  That *was* a surprise.  “Very good, squire. In fact you are right that they are a bit like a goat and a horse with but one horn.”

“Yeah, that’s what the fishwife said.  But what I can’t figger is what corn has to do with it?  I mean, yeah, a horse or a goat will eat corn, but why would you name a one-horned goat horse after something you make them flat meat grabbers with?”

“Meat grabbers?  Oh, right.  You mean tortillas?”

“Don’t reckon I do.  I don’t like turtles at all.  Slippery little bastiges.”

“Right. No, in Latin, the corn suffix means horn.”  

Alfonso muttered something profane and not entirely intelligible under his breath.  Then he said, “What is Latin? Izzit some kinna cloth like silk? My grammer tol’ me about it I fink.”

“Ah...no that’s satin. Latin is the language of Rome.”

“You mean Romer?  Why you don’t say it?”

“Because they don’t like to be called Romers?”

“That’s stupid what like them Frankers!  Yer supposed’t’call people by what they be.”

“Yes, but…”

Alfonso interrupted, “I mean, I call you a Knight.  Am I not supposed to do that?”

“No, I am a Knight.  That’s acceptable.”

“Well then, Romers and Frankers, and them slimy Greckin bastards can jus’ learn to accept what they are.  Don’ they *like* being Romers?”

Norbert thought about that for a moment, but before he could respond, a massive beast charged out of the woods, head lowered, and running straight at Justice.  Norbert gaped for a moment.  The unicorn was white in the way of snow, not of horses. Its horn was glowing brightly, and nearly took away from the frozen arctic color of its eyes.  Its hooves were like polished diamonds, and the mane and tail flowed like water from behind it.  It was beautiful.  

Well, if you discounted the fangs that filled its snarling mouth.  And the spikes from its hooves.  And the blood still dripping from that nearly three foot horn.  Or the unmistakable fact that it was nearly twice the size of his Destrier.  

“Bloody bastard!  That ain’t no goat-horse!”  Alfonso nearly shrieked.   But he pulled his crossbow out and slipped off his pony at the same time, taking sight quickly.  Norbert put his heels to Justice’s flanks and spurred the big stallion forward to move out of the path of the unicorn.  At the same time he pulled his big lance out of its holder and maneuvered it so he could level it at the snarling but gorgeously terrifying unicorn.

It started to turn to follow him, but as it did, Alfonso shot a massive bolt from his oversized crossbow into it’s side, behind the shoulders. The bolt crumpled against the thing’s side, but got it’s attention, and it turned to charge Norbert’s squire.  Norbert used the chance to line up his own charge, and urged Justice to a gallop.  The big destrier had his blood up now and surged ahead with glee, trumpeting his own anger and hatred for this deranged not-horse.  

The unicorn turned aside from Alfonso who was busily cranking his bow while watching the beast carefully.  It snarled its defiance to Norbert and Justice, spun in place, lowered its head to present it’s own lance, and answered their charge with its own.  Norbert wondered briefly who was screaming at the top of their lungs, then realized it was his own voice.  He hoped it didn’t sound too unmanly.

He lowered his lance finally, setting the position, and aiming squarely for the unicorn’s chest.  At the last moment he swung it wide to the far side of the beast, and Justice swerved out of the way of the unicorn’s own deadly weapon.  The lance, made of fine witch metal and steel, pierced the unicorn’s hide in a way that Alfonso’s arrow hadn’t been able to, and the unicorn charged up two thirds of its length before the lance was ripped from his hands.  It jerked Norbert’s arm a bit, even though he’d been expecting it.  

Still he pulled Justice back to a slow enough pace to turn around safely, and he pulled his sword.  But the unicorn had collapsed on the ground, blood gushing from around the lance.  Norbert approached the thrashing hooves carefully, full aware that spiked hooves could probably still kill him well enough.  He kept Justice back, and dismounted in the only way a fully plated knight could--awkwardly and painfully.  But you don’t get to be a Knight-Earl without a fairly high tolerance for pain, so he landed, rolled, whoofed out his air, and stood up quickly.  He approached the far end of his lance from the unicorn, and threw himself on it to stop it's thrashing.  It took a moment, and it whacked him on the head more than once, but finally he managed to grab hold of it.  As he did the unicorn made as if to stand, so he gave the lance a shove, driving it deeper into the beast’s heart--well, he assumed it had a heart, but surely it had *something* vital in there. 

It dropped back to the ground, and Norbert gave the lance a pull, but not enough to dislodge it from the thing’s chest.  He had a suspicion that it might just heal itself if he did that.  He yelled at Alfonso.  “Squire!  Get over here and hold this lance!”

Alfonso ran to his side and grabbed the lance tight, but his weight was barely enough to keep it still. Norbert didn’t waste time worrying about Alfonso’s unlikely ability to hold the lance still. Instead he hauled his heavy sword over to the unicorn and took a swing at it’s horn, deciding that the horn was likely to be a source of power.  

His sword clanged loudly against the horn, something ringing like a bell.  The unicorn renewed its screams of pain, a screeching sound that jarred Norbert’s ears and skull.  Despite that, his attention was on his sword which kept vibrating.  The shaking continued to intensify.  Norbert briefly considered tossing the sword one way and running the other, but decided if the sword shattered violently, he’d probably not make it far enough in time.

“Well you bastard, take this!”  He plunged his sword deep into the unicorn’s neck, burying it up to the hilt.  Moments later the sword *did* shatter, and the unicorn’s hideous screams stopped suddenly.  The light that had been blazing from its horn suddenly went out and Norbert realized it was much later in the day than he’d thought.  He walked over to Justice, and took his war axe from its holster behind the saddle, paced back over to the unicorn and took a swing at the horn.  This time it sheared cleanly at the cut point, and the entire thing fell to the ground.  

“All right then, squire, let’s get our lance back and head to town.”

“Yessir.  Iffin you don’ need a drink I sore does, so I’m a fixin to hurrin’ up.”

Some things never change, though Norbert, as they pulled his lance out of the unicorn.  It was pitted and scarred, but wholly serviceable.  Norbert worried that they hadn’t found all the maidens, but decided that one unicorn a day was probably enough.  He’d come back later for the others.  As it was, thought’s of Zinia loomed large in his mind.  Rather like her twins.  Mostly like her twins, actually.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Latin. The s-peechh of the invaderss. The bronze-skinned muggles."" Ajke smiled.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Salazar, my friend,"" he began, fidgeting with his robes, ""you have nothing to fear of the Romans. There is a new ruler in the East now. His capital lies at the crossroads of the great trade routes-""

""They know the value of blood rule--that much I give them--but anything that liess Easst of the chalk cliffss I care not."" He spat onto the ground in contempt. Ajke could almost feel the generations of outrage and distrust in the older man's voice. It's the only reason anyone would retreat so deep into Caledonia to settle.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Advancement in the Caliphate is gained through merit, not blood, Salazar,"" replied Ajke sidelong. ""The world revolves around your island. You should take my offer to see the great school in the desert. Or at least meet a student."" He put a hand on Salazar's shoulder. The man looked away over the cliff, shrugging the arm off.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""The outssiderss have nothing to offer me."" A cold gust streaming through the highlands howled in sentiment.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Well, at least let me bless your new settlement with a gift, Salazar,"" replied Ajke. He reached into his satchel and retrieved from it an object wrapped in fine linens. He unraveled a portion of it, revealing the slender neck of a wine jug that gleamed like a beetle's shell. Salazar was entranced by this shimmering glaze and reached out to see with his slender fingers. It was smooth, cool, and covered with delicate lines that made a picture halfway between beast and flower.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""'Lusterware', they call it,"" said Ajke. ""They make the finest ceramics in the world."" He rewrapped his precious cargo and handed it to Salazar, who gently took it into his arms.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""I hope you will reconsider my offer to join me, Salazar,"" said Ajke, ""But until then, may the treasurers of the world inevitably find their way to you.""

"[WP] We looked at each other from across the bedroom. ""Do you remember how we met?"" I asked. ""Yes, but I would love to hear it from your perspective.""",Blu_Spirit,"Sunday was always my shut in day, for as long as I could remember. It was the one day a week I would never put makeup on, I could keep my hair down, and I could wear whatever I wanted to. Today was no exception; I had woken up alone, since Blaire always went for a run on Sunday mornings and she woke up a couple hours before I did, then immediately jumped in the shower, spending most of the time standing with the warm water running over my body, taken any tension with it as it flowed down the drain. After a quick breakfast I turned to tidying our small apartment, hardly recognizable from when we first started renting it. It had a kitchen, a bathroom, a living room, and a single bedroom that we shared. What it lacked in size it made up for in affordability, as it was a good distance from the downtown core and on the outskirts of a rougher neighborhood. I took a moment to enjoy the flavor that Blaire and I had added to the place; tapestries and artwork littered the walls and an assortment of plants added a splash of life and color to the otherwise dingy and colorless space. The furnishings were sparse, mostly whatever we could find at thrift stores, but the different styles seemed to blend together into an almost organized chaos. In short, we had made this place our home.

I walked into the bedroom, greeted by the sight of my recently cleaned laundry that I had left in a pile on the floor on my side of the room. I sighed, deciding it was better late than never and began the chore of folding the clothing and setting it down in a neat pile on the bed. After a few minutes of mindless work I thought to distract myself with nature and opened the window, letting in a cool breeze that carried in the sounds of the world outside. As I gazed out the window I noticed Blaire finishing up her jog, just coming down the sidewalk towards our apartment. I glanced at the clock on the wall, she was about a half hour later than usual. I resigned myself to folding the laundry until she came in, and it was only a few moments before I heard the door open.

""You wouldn't believe who I ran into today!"" Her voice broke the relative quiet of the apartment as she made her way to the bedroom. ""Albert, remember him? He was in our gym class.""

""The one you knocked out?"" I asked, laughing at the memory of the tall, lanky kid sprawled out like a confused spider on the floor of the gymnasium.

""He's buff now, you know? And he's engaged!"" She walked over to her side of the room, stripping out of her clothes in favor of something more comfortable. ""I almost killed him back then, you know? And now when we see each other it's all smiles and catching up.""

""Do you remember how we met?"" I asked, looking up from the clothes in my lap to see her looking back at me with an amused grin.

""Oh yeah. I'd love to hear how you remember it, though.""

""Oh god did we hate each other,"" I said with a laugh. ""I was the preppy kid getting top marks in all my classes, star on the track team, and loved by everyone, except you. You were one of the slackers, always sat in the back of the class and stared out the window, never did your work, and just hated everyone. So we were pretty much natural enemies.""

""Damn right,"" Blaire said with a smirk. ""Goody-two-shoes.""

""We never really met though until we were partnered for track and field in gym. I remember thinking how easy it was going to be, that I could run laps around you.""

""And then I kicked your ass.""

""God I hated you for that! You ran faster than me, longer than me, you were just better than me in everything and I hated it! The coach even offered you a spot on the team!""

""She just knew talent when she saw it,"" She said with a chuckle. ""You know I went home every night and practiced, just so I could beat you?""

""Why would you do that?""

Blaire came over to my side of the room and sat on the bed, next to my laundry, a sheepish expression on her face. ""I was jealous of you. You had all the friends, your family was great, you were the track star, you just had it all. I guess I just wanted to show you that you weren't the best at everything.""

""Well you sure did that alright, I was so depressed I wanted to quit the team! I told the coach if she took you on I was out, and I meant it!""

Blaire laughed to herself, staring off into space. ""I might have taken that spot just to spite you, if things with my parents didn't go so badly and I had to move half-way across the country.""

She fell silent and her expression changed. I knew what she was thinking about, the years she spent in some unfamiliar city living with an abusive father, about how she ran away, and I reached out and took her hand, our eyes meeting in understanding. ""Things got better though,"" I said with a half-hearted smile.

Blaire nodded before looking away again. ""Yeah, I came back. You had graduated and were working at some shitty movie theater, and I took one look at you and knew you weren't the same person, that you had been through some shit. You were still gorgeous though, so I took a chance and asked for your number.""

I smiled, rubbing her hand with my thumb. ""Then we ran away together, got our own place, and made our own lives, and things are good now. I think you saved me, you know? Who knows how long I would have been working there if you didn't come along.""

""You saved me too, Abbey,"" she said, looking back at me, a deep meaningful look in her eyes. She leaned towards me and I closed my eyes as our lips met. When she pulled back and our eyes met, they were wet and red, yet happy, and she smiled. ""Thank you.""",BlackJackass

Anyway you can let me get a few shots of what goes on in there?"" I asked the owner of the warehouse. He was a shifty looking fellow, obviously the kind of man they would hire to run their human chop shop.

""Nothing but animals in there son. We don't allow cameras in anymore ever since that one slaughterhouse was shut down for insanitary workplace."" The man hissed.

The man got up. Assuming he was going to show me and my partner out the door I stood up and got close. A perfect distraction.

""Sir please."" I said placing my hand on his shoulder. He yanked his arm away and looked as if I had given him a disease.

""You two leave my property now."" He said swinging the door open.

My partner nodded at me and I knew we were good to go. Without making a sound we left his office and got into our car.

He jingled the warehouse keys and we both cheered victoriously. I drove the car toward the back of the warehouse. It was a massive structure, cheap looking, but we knew it was just to steer the eyes away from what really goes on in there.

We parked near a side door. He hopped out and tried the keys. He turned to me and gave me a thumbs up. Shutting the car off I followed right behind him into the dimly lit warehouse.

The smell was awful. Stale urine, rotten shit, rancid mold, all flooded my nose. In a massive room was probably  a thousand pigs. All segregated into separate holding pins.

My partner looked at me as if we lose but I knew it was here. Human meet is served in our burgers and this is where they butcher it.

My eyes caught onto a large metal door riddled with locks. I motioned my partner to it and he quickly began to math the keys to the locks.

Time was running out. The owner would know his keys were missing eventually.

As each click of lock being open sounded, I felt closer and closer to getting evidence of the cruel untold ingredients of fast food.

My parter strained to open the large door. We went down to what musty have been a basement. It was freezing so it had to have been a freezer also.

The smell of death replaced the rotten smell from above. My partner fell to his knees and began to throw up. He was in a doorway peering into something unbearable.

I caught up and saw what I wish I had never seen. 

Dangling from hooks were endless rows of human bodies. 

Disfigured, dismembered, some even in tact.

The frost in their bodies made them look ghostly. Then my heart fell.

The door we came in slammed closed. I rushed to bang on it. My partner on his knees in shock.

I got to the door banging on it. Then I had chills down my back.

Click. Click.

With each sound of the door locking, I knew my end was near.

[WP] You are a tree.,Hal_Savira,"The first thing Brachus heard when it awoke was laughter. Two young voices called out to each other as Brachus felt a greater awareness come over it. 

“Do you think it worked Alyss? The tree doesn’t seem to be moving,” one of the voices said. The other voice laughed again.

 “Of course not Will, you must have read the book wrong. Your dad might be teaching you magic, but you aren’t a wizard yet.”

“I made an animated mud golem last month, remember? Dad said that I was going to be a great wizard when I grow up,” the first voice said with a huff. Brachus listened with interest as its senses expanded and for the first time, it opened its eyes.  Brachus saw two small creatures standing before it and understood that the voices came from them.
 
“Let’s go back, it’s almost lunch time. Mom’s making apple pie today,” the one with long gold hair said as she took the short brown haired one’s hand and led him away.

&amp;nbsp;

~

&amp;nbsp;

Brachus marveled with wonder as it explored the world around him. He could hear the birds and see the animals that came to rest under the shade. But most importantly of all, it came to know the two creatures called humans whenever they came to play nearby.

&amp;nbsp;

The one with brown hair was called Will, Brachus learned. He was the one who conjured things and showed off to the gold haired one called Alyss. He often studied magic a lot in hopes of becoming a wizard.  
And in turn Alyss talked about how she was learning how to cook and often brought lunch for a picnic under Brachus’ shade. 

&amp;nbsp;

Brachus loved to hear them speak about the outside world. Alyss’ and Will’s houses were the closest to this place. There was a new king from the next kingdom that was known to be mad. The wizardly council was recruiting new wizards for their service. The housewife nearby gave birth to a pair of twins and Alyss went to help (that’s when Brachus learned how humans were made). Then they promised each other of love and carved their names with a knife on Brachus. It hurt a bit, but Brachus didn’t seem to mind all that much.

&amp;nbsp;

But one day, Brachus almost didn’t recognize them as they came to picnic under his shade. Brachus noted that Alyss wore a dress with a dirty apron on top. Despite the chilly autumn weather, her sleeves were rolled up. Her long gold hair that was usually let down was now tied into a bun as she clutched the basket and almost threw it down when they came to Brachus’ place. Will reluctantly trailed behind Alyss, dressed in splendid clothes and donned in a fur cloak. He grew hair on his face now, Brachus noticed. Will didn’t dare to meet Alyss’ eyes as she leaned against Brachus and crossed her arms.

“Why didn’t you tell me you were going today? I never even knew they asked you,” Alyss said.

“I knew you would object to it,” Will almost whispered as he hung his head.

“Of course I would! You might be the ‘talented wizard prodigy’ -” this she rolled her eyes at “–but that just means they’re going to send you out to the front lines to get yourself killed.”

“The kingdom needs me Alyss,” Will said. “The Mad King may be marching his army at our doorsteps right now and if I’m not there to fight them, we may lose everything we have here. Please forgive me for not telling you earlier. I didn’t have a choice.”

“A choice? You just didn’t have the balls to tell me.” With that, Alyss got up and started to walk back the way they came. “Go ahead and leave, you better come back alive soon.” 

&amp;nbsp;

Brachus and Will both watched Alyss leave, and Will sat against Brachus as he closed his eyes in meditative thought. “What should I have done,” he mused aloud. Brachus didn’t really know how to console him, so it simply waved its branches in response. 

“She might have convinced me not to go if I told her.”  

Brachus shook his branches with agreement, as if it was nodding. Alyss was a strong human who always lead Will along, even when they used to play games.  

“And here I am, worrying over a woman when I should be worrying over the possibility of death.”

Brachus nodded even harder, waving its branches up and down furiously to agree. Whenever Alyss got angry, she would refuse to cook Will’s portion for the picnic until Will gave in or until she calmed down again.

“And a magical tree is trying to drown me in sticks and leaves,” Will added in as he opened his eyes and looked up at Brachus. “I appreciate your support, but at this rate I won’t be able to find the basket of food under all of this.” He stood up and picked up the basket to pick out a few twigs. “You know, when I first woke you up all those years ago I named you ‘Brachus’ because it comes from “I am hungry” in the magic language. Looks like I still value food even today. Watch over Alyss for me, will you?” And with that, he left.

&amp;nbsp;

~

&amp;nbsp;

Will didn’t come back for a long time. Sometimes, Alyss came by herself to eat alone. Brachus didn’t know what to do to comfort her. After some thinking however, Brachus figured out how to lure wild rabbits to her so that she would have company. Brachus stopped though when Alyss set up a trap to kill the rabbits and turned them into stew. Sometimes she came to lie back to look at the sky. Brachus developed a way to gather moss and turn the ground softer to make her comfortable. Other times she came simply to cry as she traced the names etched into the bark. Brachus made sure he didn’t grow over those names.  
But as the seasons passed Brachus saw her less until eventually, she didn’t come back anymore.

Then, Brachus was left alone to look at the sky like Alyss did.

&amp;nbsp;

~

&amp;nbsp;

He was an old man when Brachus saw him. With a staff in hand to support his lame leg, he carefully lowered himself against the old tree. Will wore simple cotton robes and a cloak to ward against the chilly spring breeze. He had long white hair now and weathered skin. Brachus could feel his hand tremble against the bark as he sat down.

 “I’m sorry,” he could only say.  

The two sat together in silence for a while as the old man closed his eyes and sobbed for the dead.

[WP] You are a tree.,Hal_Savira,"Who am I?

I don't know. Am I a person, or am I just another lost soul, reborn as another inanimate object? Clearly I just woke up, but I can't really tell where I am. Everything feels so... natural. Wait, I can feel something at my feet, or is it feet? No they are numerous, like fingers or toes, but longer. Roots. And my arms! There are so many of them! Ah, these must be branches. But how did that happen, I could've sworn I wasn't a tree before I opened my eyes. The last thing I remembered before waking up was rain, salty drops of water raining down from above as my vision became hazy, and I drifted off to sleep. Waves of pain and mind numbing screaming penetrated my mind as my eyes closed for the last time. 

I died. That's what happened right? And I was reborn? That must be it. It has to be. The idea of rebirth always seemed to foolish to me. How could a man put faith into the idea that he could one day be reborn as something else after he died? Such idiocy and stupidity is what led to religion in the first place right? But I guess I was wrong, and this was the higher power, punishing me for it.

Damnit, I must've done something terribly shitty in my past life to be reborn as a fucking tree. I can't even tell what type of tree I am, my roots have barely clutched the stringy dirt, and my trunk is just a stem, fleshy and brown. Maybe I'll grow into a hardy oak tree, a serene willow, or one of them majestic redwoods.  Or maybe I'm not even a tree, just a weed, a reminder of how terrible I had to be in order to deserve this fate. Now I'm forced to do good for the world. I'll convert carbon dioxide into oxygen as I breath, I'll provide a nice cozy home for some squirrels, their bushy tails wagging as they scale my body, and maybe eventually I'll get chopped down, killed and become reborn again.

I'll wait out this time in prison, and think about what I'd done in my past life, so that I don't fuck up again and become a shitty tree. Or maybe, this is my last stop in life. That majestic redwood doesn't seem so majestic anymore. Shit.

People sometimes point to me and say I'm a maple, but other times people say I'm other stuff, so I don't know what to think. I don't know much, to tell you the truth. People sometimes come to me and sit underneath me. They look at the sun going down by that field over yonder. Sometimes they sit to watch it come up again.

The day time is nice. I like to watch the people. Of all the creatures I see, people are my favorites. I like listening to them too, the things they say to each other and all. Sometimes they don't say anything. They just come around and throw something and then their dog'll run out and get it and bring it back. I like it when they do that. Once this person was walking by with another person, and they weren't saying anything to each other. They were looking down into these little things with a bright light, and they were tapping on them with their hands. I see those little bright light things a lot nowadays. I never used to see them all that much. Not at all.

Another time a woman was walking by with a man, and she was holding a big newspaper. She seemed angry about something, some kind of election. She kept saying 'fuck' this and 'fuck' that, 'Trump' this and 'Trump' that. I still don't know what a trump is, but I don't know much to tell you the truth. Whatever it is, people sure have been talking about it a lot recently.

Every once in a while a man and a woman will sit underneath me and start kissing each other. I like it when they do that. I like that they feel close enough to me that they feel like they can do that. They seem to like it too. A few times I saw a man and another man kissing each other. That always seemed kind of odd to me. But the looks in their eyes, in both of their eyes, it never seemed all that different to me. Maybe it is different. I don't know.

People seem so upset sometimes. People will get angry at each other, and start yelling. Sometimes they will attack each other. I never understood that. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it doesn't seem like it accomplishes much. It just makes people sad. I don't like it when people are sad. It doesn't seem as nice. I don't understand why people would do it if it isn't as nice.

Once there was a young man sitting underneath me, and he was sitting with another person, a woman I think. He was sad, and it was making me sad. I remember what he said very clearly, and I think about it sometimes. He told the woman that he was in some bar once, a long time ago, and he saw this girl who had ordered the same drink as he did. He said he raised his glass to her, and she came over to him, and they talked. She was a medical student, and she wanted to become a surgeon. The man had asked her why she wanted to do that, and how she could stand to be around all those guts and all that blood. She had said that the human body wasn't disgusting to her. She said that she thought it was beautiful. It was beautiful how everything moved with one another, beating at a steady pace, everything serving its own special function, and performing its own special task. She said there was something beautiful about how everything worked together so perfectly. The man said that he and the woman went back to his apartment and they had sex. He said that after they had finished, the girl went to the bathroom to wash up. He found himself laying alone for quite a while, so he went in to check on her. He found her there, lying on the floor. He was brought to trial, but the doctors who did the autopsy testified on his behalf and he was found not guilty. The doctors said they didn't know why she had died. A girl, perfectly healthy, no illness, disease, or disorders, no wounds or bruises or clots or anything. Completely healthy. They said it was a 'natural phenomenon'. The man said he thought it was funny they would call it a phenomenon. They found him on the same bathroom floor a few weeks later, with an empty bottle of some medication in his hand, I can't remember what. He said he spent a week in the hospital and a year in the mental institution, mostly for some things he said to the nurses while he was sleeping. He said that they had diagnosed him with clinical depression, but he didn't feel like he was depressed. He said he didn't feel like he was worthless, or that nobody liked him, or that he wasn't needed. He said that he just felt sad, and he didn't know why. He started to cry, and so did the woman.

To this day I don't quite know why that man was so sad. I have seen so many people, and heard so many stories, but none have made me think the way that one has. I wish that I could've met that young medical student. I wish she would've come to me and sat down underneath me to talk, or even just to watch the sun go down like some of those other people do sometimes. The days feel like they're getting shorter, and I don't think I have much time left. I've been alive for so long and I never stopped to think how far this world has come. I don't know much, I'll admit that, but if I've learned anything over these past years, its that people are beautiful. Every single one of them. They are so simply, so perfectly, so inexplicably... beautiful. 

But what do I know? After all, I am just a tree.",mattcor76

It's Bob, what do you expect?  He was never a social butterfly even when he was still connected.

Well, I am worried.  Even Aaron wrote once or twice via hum-mail.  

Speaking of Aaron, did you hear that they had only 832 seeds this year?

Man, it gets worse every year doesn't it? It's like the whole climate is changing and we can't do a thing about it.

Um, we literally do something about it by existing.

You know what I mean! It just doesn't seem like what we do accomplishes anything anymore.  Life is hopeless.

[WP] You are a tree.,Hal_Savira,"I am a tree, small and frail. I happen to be a Chinese Maple. I sit here and grow along this riverbank. My roots grow into the ground past the old pine that has fallen... it is very lonely here. I stayed this way for five long years. When I was five years old, I saw something. Yes, it was just past the red oak. It was a small child. It came closer... I could see it now. It was a small blonde boy, with a cross body bag. He held out one hand to me, trying to catch his breath. I wondered why he had been running in the first place. The answer soon arrived with her hair in braids. ""BUBBA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" His little sister screamed for him. She looked so small, she reminded me of myself. The girl came closer. ""Bubba, I wanna go home. I don't like school anymore. The kids are mean there."" she said this with tears streaming down her face. Her older brother simply looked at her and said ""The key is under the third rock to the left. Come home before mom does."" he then turned and left her, obviously lost, next to me, the riverbank, and a puddle of sorrow that had fallen from her face. She couldn't be older than five, he couldn't have been older than seven. Slowly, a breeze blew through my branches as she sat down at my trunk. She cried out to me ""Oh! I wanna go home! No... I don't ever wanna go home again. Bubba's mean, school is mean. Everything is mean."" I let some of my leaves flutter down to her. She looked up at me. Everyday from that day onward, she came to visit me. She told me about her day. She told me about the friends that she made, and how they did such strange things. In time, we both grew. I became a tall, strong, tree. She became a confident, strong, woman. One day, she came and said goodbye. I wasn't sad, because I knew she was going to be happy. And one day, maybe a while from now, another little girl with a mean big brother will come on by.",pierce-the-parade

A thousand times I've seen the sky

Changing color and changing shape 

White and blue disarray, I breathe

Many limbs I have lost and regained 

Green leaves turn brown, burning

Whether that is pleasing I can only ponder

[WP] You are a tree.,Hal_Savira,"On a lonely hill, there stood a tall, proud maple tree. Her leaves were as green as emeralds, and her roots as deep as she was tall. She stood still; forever reaching for the sky. 
She watched humanity. She watched it grow and fall. Fall in love and fall apart. Times of peace and times of war. She was a watcher, put on this Earth to observe -nothing more, nothing less. What could a tree do to stop the ways of humanity? It was a blessing that she hadn’t been cut down yet. 
Many people loved to visit her. They would swing on her branches, climb into her leaves, carve their names into her bark, and enjoy the comfort she tried to give them. Just because she was a tree didn’t mean she was heartless, quite the opposite actually. She loved humanity deeply. She loved them for their flaws, and their successes. She loved that they were growing. She had such strong feelings that she was unaware of how to deal with them all. She tried to speak to tell her human visitors that she knew them and wished them happiness, but all they could sense was a calming breeze that brought them peace. 
A tree is a protector of the world. They give oxygen, shade, and protection. A tree is there to learn and record in their trunks the details of the world. 
She stood on her hill, watching as the wind ruffles the grass. She watched birds fly above her head and felt as squirrels ran across her branches. She didn’t know anything other than being a tree, and while she loved humans she would never trade being a tree for humanity. She was a watcher, a protector. It was her job to watch humanity. She would live out her life and record everything, hoping that one day, once she was gone, someone or something would be better off because of her death.

Before they came here the land was bare and becoming evermore dryier and dryier. The only people I saw were red faces speeding in metal machines. In my old age I was getting lonely. I knew I would grow no bigger and could felt my life drifting out of me. I felt my branches slackin.

They came roaring up the gravel path. Their young faces inspecting the world around me. The man strong full of muscle, looked at the ranch that would be his. He brushed his fingers through his red beard, looking satisfied with what he saw. He grabbed his women and went into the house. I was happy, I now had something to look at.

The man aproached me, he sat down between my protruding roots that peeked out of the ground. He talked out loud, maybe expecting no one to listen exempt for me. He spoke softly "" This is mine. All that I can see is mine. Pretty soon the grains will grow. Pretty soon the kids will grow. Pretty soon I will grow. It will be a slow process, but with enough hard work and a little bit of luck my world will grow into what I want it to be."" The man rested his back on my base. He sat still. I was happy in this moment. But happiness can't be felt without knowing sadness.

This time the women left. She did not return. I do not know why. The man came to me with a bottle in his hand. He was tumbling and taking sloppy steps. He came up to me and said ""Bitch don kow whit shee mising jus cuase"" He went inside and when he came back out he was fiddling with something in his hands. He threw it over me and tied it down to my far root. He wraped the rope around his neck and said ""I didnt never grow""

[WP] The nations of the world have reached the space age without ever traversing the Atlantic Ocean and discovering the Americas. The first man in space looks out his capsule window.,HaniiPuppy,"Yuri unbuckled the black strap binding him to the solitary seat in the capsule. He weightlessly propelled away. Arms flailing behind his body, he ungracefully navigated himself across the short expanse between his chair and one of the two portholes. He bathed his eyes in the vastness of the inky darkness confronting his vision. The messy lights of stars pitted the otherwise undisturbed silk tapestry. 

“What a cosmos to explore.” 

He hoped beyond reason would allow that the opening of a new area for exploration could act as a valve to dampen the tensions of the nations of Eurasia. In a perfect future, he thought that countries could attempt to conquer vacant planets. The exponentially growing populations, rapidly shrinking water sources, and steadily building animosity had turned the continent into an unpinned grenade held by the hand of fear. 

He turned around. Launching with his toes towards the other porthole, he was anxious to see his world on a scale no one else had experienced. Somersaulting through the air, he imagined seeing the contours of borders disappearing beneath canopies and rivers meandering indiscriminately across a green Eden. Perhaps he would see cities as nodes of lights grasping towards each other with thin tendrils crowded with travelers. 
 
Reaching the porthole, he pressed against its cold surface. 

He struggled to recognize the mass beneath him. The realization obliterated a sense of hope. Any oasis of optimism present in his mind withered and wasted away. Damp deep breaths obscured the window.

“Blessed be their souls,” he said in a wobbling voice. 

Facing him bare was a landmass that was not Eurasia. But the existence of a second continent was not what forced his prayer. It was the constant unwinking emanation of light that dotted the dark canvas in front of him. Soon, he thought, those people’s entire world will turn to night in the throes of a great war for dominion by the nations that he had so hoped to direct towards space. 

A small tear pooled just in front of his green eyes. It pinched away, hovering towards the window. It sprawled itself against the tiniest portion of the window. A city of millions was distorted under the tear’s quivering volume.

[WP] The nations of the world have reached the space age without ever traversing the Atlantic Ocean and discovering the Americas. The first man in space looks out his capsule window.,HaniiPuppy,"Miguel 'Miggy' Celas grunted as the main engine cut off, and the ship began its ascent through the upper atmosphere. For the next several minutes, it was just him, Sally, and nothing but an almost unnerving silence. The silence was only broken by intermittent squawks from the headsets; radio orders in preparation for the upcoming insertion burn.

Miggy looked at his console, the altimeter rising rapidly as they ascended through what would be the last parts of the atmosphere. Sally, his navigation tech, stood by calmly in her seat. She hadn't said a word since just before launch. Miggy smirked in his helmet; It was a rare thing for her to be so quiet.

The ESU's Nascent was a thing of rugged beauty. Instruments mashed together in such a convoluted mess that it was no wonder it took 15 years to develop and train for. At least the engineers down there were kind enough to add a couple of easily viewed portholes next to their seats. Scuttlebutt said the russians only gave their guy one small navigation window, only large enough for the pilot to see if he was going to miss the earth on decent. Or not, seeing as how it exploded on reentry. Miggy hoped he wouldn't have to suffer such a fate.

""Approaching 80 Kilometers, Captain."" Sally broke her silence. 

It was amusing, because everything on the flight was computer controlled, with every possible maneuver accounted for, plotted, and uploaded into the central core. Miggy sometimes wondered if there was any reason for him to be here, if not to just push buttons and talk for show. But he put aside those thoughts, and talked for show.

""Alright, engage Main Engines 1 and 2. Begin Insertion burn."" 

The craft shuddered as the engines kicked on, and Miggy felt himself fall back into his seat as gravity seemed to shift. For the next several minutes, Miggy only worried about trying to keep his breathing normal.

""85 Kilometers. 87 Kilometers. 89 Kilometers. 90 Kilometers. Main engines cutting off."" The engines cut their thrust, and Sally sighed into her headset. ""We have achieved a stable orbit, Captain. Welcome to Space.""

Miggy leaned over to his side, and looked out of the window. He saw the central deserts of Old Arabia, and only a few seconds later, India came over the horizon. He tried to take it all in, to remember everything, but his emotions began to get the best of him. The years of training were all worth just these 30 seconds. He smiled, as he reminded himself that he would be up here for 2 days. Definitely worth it.

As the sun rose over the horizon, the Great Ocean came into view. Like a carpet of pure blue, Miggy mused into his headset.

""It'll be nice, us being the first people to see the entire ocean at once.""

""Yeah, too bad I'm on the wrong side of the ship. But I got an ocean full of stars over here. You can be jealous.""

""You'll see it on decent. But goddamn, it's beautiful."" Miggy felt his voice catch as he spoke. ""Looks like it's smaller than I expected. I can already see Spain from...""

If his voice had caught before, it completely dropped now. Miggy had to swallow twice, before he tried again to speak.

""That's not Spain.""

""What do you mean it's not Spain?"" Sally asked, bemused. ""Not like some other land is going to just crop up.""

""I mean, some other land just cropped up. There's an entire continent down there. Two of them. Holy shit, I gotta tell Control.""

""We're in radio blackout. Are you sure you're not just seeing things? There's no way there's another continent. We've done the math, and the world just isn't that big.""

""Oh yeah. Sure as day. Well, night. I can't see half of it, it's night time there. The world is bigger than we though. The math may be right, but we were wrong.""

""Oh. Oh god."" Sally's voice cracked. An alert rang in Miggy's headset, Sally's vitals just had a spike.

""What? Did something break?"" Miggy broke his long gaze out the window to look at her.

""If we were wrong, then we aren't in an orbit..."" Her voice petered out to a whisper. ""We're on a parabola.""

""What do you mean?""

""I mean, the flight computer had a burn planned for a planet sized almost two thirds what we actually have. We never even entered space, let alone an orbit.""

Miggy's heart sunk. Suddenly, he realized why the Russian craft didn't make it back.

""What do we do? We can't contact Control, and look!"" She pointed to the altimeter. ""99 Kilometers. Were descending. There's no way we can survive a decent at this angle.""

Miguel began to feel panic grip his chest. This wasn't in the protocols. There was no flight sheet for 'If planet found to be larger than all modern science has accounted for.' There also wasn't enough time to do all the things that needed to be done. Also, they were falling. Miggy searched his mind for the first thing that sounded like a plan.

""We need thrust.""

Sally stared at him blankly. At least, Miggy assumed it was blankly; her helmet's visor hid most of the details of her face.

""Thrust? How? We only have enough for a deorbit burn, and even then, that won't be enough. Besides, the computer is p reloaded with the details. All we can do it initiate it.""

""But if we do, it'll keep us above the atmosphere long enough to let Mission Control know."" Miggy stated, grimly.

""Yeah, but what about afterwards? That's the last of our fuel. We won't be able to correct our course."" Her voice began to quicken, ""Hell, we probably will end up flying off into space!"" Sally became quiet after her last statement. Either she hadn't realized what Miggy had suggested, or, worse, she had.

""We have to let Control know, but I want to make sure you have a say."" Miggy looked at her through his visor.

Sally was silent for a moment. This time, Miggy didn't muse to himself. After what felt like an eternity, she spoke.

""Initiate Deorbit burn. Ignoring alignment requirements. On your mark, Sir.""

""Mark.""

The engines kicked on again, this time, only for a few seconds. Miggy tried to remind himself that the years of training were worth it for just those few minutes of gazing at the world from his seat.

On that day, when rain poured and clouds loomed, his team knew better than to stop, as the engines burned and the rocket wobbled, far it traveled into the layer of clouding, as an amass of people watched up high into the sky as the glow of the boosters slowly faded into the grey skies, they knew they had done it, and so did he.

The rumble and shaking of the cabin begun to cease as booster after booster broke off from the shuttle and fell down to earth, ""Finally"" He said unstrapping the various belts and buckles designed to keep himself safe, ""Now that we're up here, lets take a look at this planet."" Moving down from the cockpit and down the small shuttle, he found the right port-hole, looming outside of the port-hole was earth, all in it's magnificent glory, the deep hues of the ocean conflicted with the colour of the land, as the ship orbited the planet, he couldn't find the right words to explain how far he and many others have done, done to venture deep into the obsidian sky. 

But

Something caught his eye, something off, amiss, something he gasped and mouthed ""What the f-"" 

Under the light of their home star, the combined mass of Europe and Asia slowly drifted into the darkness, as another massive form of land slowly came into view, it's perplexing colours of green and yellow clashing with the oceans of blue, threw his mind into overdrive, ""We've found all there is to  know right? This is just shock on my mind right?"" His mind begun to argue with itself as his heart started to race, he could do nothing but stare out at the mass of land and it's odd shape.

""Hel-.. Oh- Hello!"" A voice broke through the static as the station regained contact with the ship. ""Hello, can you hear us up there?"" Sai with a hurried pace moving from the cabin to the cockpit as he grabbed the microphone, holding the button and speaking into it. ""Ye-Yes I'm here"" Swallowing down globs of saliva as the man instructed him on what to do up here, he couldn't help but think about the undiscovered continent.

As the man droned on with instructions, and the world turned, he couldn't help but drift away from the cockpit and back into the cabin, his mind blocking out the words from the radio as he looked out the hole for another view, the continent slowly drifting into the darkness as his home country begun to come into view once more.

""Hey! Hello! Are you even listening to me?"" Sai moved back to the cockpit and grabbed the microphone, speaking into it.

""Tell me, are you sure you've found everything?""

[WP] Use the five prompts below this one all in one story.,PigDoodles,"We were the finest gym in all of Gotham. Our popularity began to rose when the person from the Life Alert commercial started advertising for us and told the people that our gym saved his life. It had apparently stopped his chest pains, and he had started telling the audience of his acting career. He would reflet on what he did wrong and how we were the best. That was all bullshit, of course.

What really made our gym the best was when we pioneered ""weight loss transfer"". Using our revolutionary technology, people could transfer their weight to other people. We hired a bunch of people to gain weight from our consumers, and our profits skyrocketed. We hired sumo wrestlers, old people, and people on the verge of death. It didn't really matter to them if they got heavy, as they either needed to become heavy or were going to die anyway. 

As the owner of the gym, I was swimming in benjamins. Our revolutionary tech made our gym one of the best in the country. We even got fucking Batman to promote our gym. Holy shit was that hard. 

All the money allowed me to buy a ticket to an earth-like planet. NASA said it was an ideal place to live. I always wanted to live with people like me, wealthy and smart. I didn't *have* to live with poor people anymore. I could help build a new world, one not polluted by freeloaders.

I was holding the ticket to this planet in the air. It was my ticket to freedom.

""Stop, thief!"" said a rather chubby boy wearing all black. He was about 7, maybe 8. He also kind of looked emo.

""Kid,"" I said, ""The gym's over there.""

He then wrestled me to the floor, trying to stab me with a Batarang.

""What the fuck,"" I said, ""Who the fuck do you think you are.""

""You know who I am, Joker""

Fuck. This kid thought he was Batman. 

I pulled him off of me and then proceeded to run toward my shuttle to get out of this fucking hellhole.

While running, my iPhone 204 rang. God forbid I was late. I grabbed my phone and saw a notification.

""Planet is in ruins and is made up of scorched craters. No refunds"".

Looks like NASA is going to lose its funding.

""Yeah yeah, you want my soul. I get it. Maybe next time."" I snatched the beer out of the endless void that was the inside of the fridge and slammed its door shut. Moving into a mansion full of demons certainly had its drawbacks sometimes. But the rent is low and you'll never have worry about burglars anymore. Heck, they still didn't find the body of the last one. 

Though the beer really _was_ perfectly cold. I took a sip. I went back to the _Couch of Agonizing Springs_ that was easily disarmed with putting two thick blankets on top of it. The TV produced nothing but cries of never-ending anguish in the first couple of weeks but I fixed that when I replaced the batteries of the remote control.

"[WP] ""Am I not the monster you paid to see?""",Protaokper,"The chatter of the crowd was almost deafening to Lilith’s sensitive ears. Over the din she could hardly hear the metal of her ankle shackle scraping across the concrete. 

“Annnnnnd NOW! The moment you’ve been waiting for! The freak you paid to see, Lilith, the fallen angel!” The crowd roared and the dark haired young woman hissed as she felt her shackle being unlocked. With a twitch of her shoulder the person attending her was thrown against a faded brick wall. The only thing they’d seen was a flash of black before they made a wet thud against the solid wall. 

They’d left the key and for a moment, Lilith thought to bolt.

With a determined grin, she moved out on stage. She stepped out gingerly, tucking her dark braids back behind her ears. The gasps came when she spread her wings, they unfurled as if they would span forever. 50 feet in all, the lamps shown the deep blue sheen in her raven colored wings. 

“Don’t get too close to this demonic…angel,” the announcer warned as the crowd seemed to surge towards the stage, all wanting a better look at the freak, “Don’t let her size fool you-“

A sardonic smirk came to Lilith’s pale lips before she beat her heavenly wings, the force of which knocked the first row of the crowd back. Her cackle filled the tent as she watched some of the audience rush for the one exit. Others thought this was part of the act. That is until Lilith jumped from her stage and began to knock people out of her path with a twitch of her well-muscled shoulders. One man was propelled through the Freakshow sign, landing somewhere beyond view.

She was almost there…

A zap to her side slowed Lilith, but she wouldn’t stop. She would fly. She HAD TO FLY. 

The stage hands had pulled out the cattle prods, the only things strong enough to slow her but not kill her. She knew the net would be next, she had to get out before they got her back in that shackle.

In a confusion of screaming and people, Lilith broke out into the cool autumn air and pushed her way through the crowd. More screams followed her as she made turns and took short cuts through the circus site. 

“GET THE MONSTER! BEFORE SHE GETS TO TOWN!”

Lilith heard the shouts and felt the tears slipping down her cheeks. She didn’t feel strong anymore, that is until she saw the twinkling night sky. 
She willed her legs to pump faster as her wings beat. It took her a moment to realize her feet were moving but there was no ground beneath them now. Her wings beat hard as she soared into the sky, watching the lights of the circus grow smaller and smaller.

She was finally free.

I lifted my head and followed the doctor's assistant as he escorted me to the back. My acne was getting worse and worse, so I decided to see a dermatologist. I stepped in, sat down and turned around. No one else in the room. Knowing what I was looking for, the assistant added, ""the doctor will be with you shortly.""

*Fuck this,* I thought to myself after ten, twenty, thirty minutes of waiting. *Where the hell is the doctor? I'm going to get wrinkles before this slowpoke shows up.* Then, the doctor stepped in. She looked exactly as I would expect an old doctor to look, with brownish glasses and faded gray hair with tired eyes. She was smiling despite looking like she never knew what sleep was. At that moment, I could only be glad that I wasn't going into the medical field. After about a few minutes where the dermatologist asked me questions and stuff, she gave me this white, circular bottle of cream. 

""Apply a sample to your right cheek right there,"" she said.

I did as she asked. Wow, this felt cool. No, really-- it had a cooling sensation to it. Wait, this wasn't right. My cheek started to go numb. I moved my lips to speak ""I need to get out of here"". Maybe it was a terrible side effect-- I needed to go to the bathroom pronto. I stood up quickly turned around. I put my handle on the doorknob as the doctor got out of her seat. I was turning the knob when I felt a sharp pain surge through my limbs. I let out a gasp as I fell to the floor. 

""Move,"" I tried to tell my limbs through gritted teeth. 

""So do you like our cream? It's a fresh batch,"" the doctor said. I looked up to see her standing over me with this big dumb-ass grin on her face. Fuck. I managed to moan out, ""you fucking monster...""

""Monster?"" She asked in reply. ""Ha! Am I not the monster you paid to see?""

"[WP] ""Am I not the monster you paid to see?""",Protaokper,"My translator beeped and hummed as it struggled to translate the indistinguishable language, its mouth flexed and contorted as it spewed a flurry of swear words that were quickly censored by the unit.

The creature sat across from me, the only thing separating us was a thick wall of shock resistant glass a small port made it possible to hear it as it let out another bout of offensive ramblings. Finally it seemed to settle down as it retreated to the far end of it's cell leaning against the far wall. It interlocked it appendages in what I could only assume was a state of repose.

Sure the creature was loud and aggressive but this hardly looked like the monster I had been led to believe it was, the news always sensationalized everything. One day it's global warming this then the next it's global cooling that. To be completely honest nobody really knew what to expect, in fact most of us had completely given up on the idea of making first contact with intelligent life, yet, here we are.

It was a shame that this odd alien has caused so much damage, according to witnesses, within an hour of its arrival it had managed to EAT two fields worth of crops and drink four water reserves ON ITS OWN, that's more food than most of our villages eat in a weeks time. Apparently it also had the ability to change its shape and size as well as the texture of its skin, in the few days since we captured it it had grown in size slightly and its skin appeared to be smother and more vibrant, we believed that these physical changes were directly related to its diet.

There were all kinds of crazy theories being thrown around as to its origin, some wanted to study its behaviors and others wanted to dissect the simple creature, the more unstable of the group wanted to set it on fire to see what would happen, ultimately they settled on observing it, for now.

My job was simple, study and attempt communication, which was proving to be no easy task. Even with my translation unit and degree in crypto-linguistics I could only make out small pieces of what it tried to communicate; it's violent movement and heavy grunts only made it more confusing. It had been kept in isolation for two days in order to study its actions, for the most part it would just sleep, move to one side of the room, sleep some more, yell until it tired itself out then sleep some more.

The creature raised its head slowly to meet my gaze, it walked towards me without a word. It looked me up and down and slowly gestured with the end of its appendages towards what I could only assume was it's mouth. It did it several times, again without saying a word, could it be hungry? so soon? It had just consumed two fields the other day! There just could not be any way it could still be hungry. Still, I put my skepticism aside and requested a meal to be delivered. I slid the tray into the door slot and watched as the creature lunged for the tray tearing into its meal. It appeared to struggle for a moment and appeared to dry heave as it forced down the plate of food, and washed it down with a glass of water.

It waved the tray at me and made its grunting sounds again which my comm unit translated as ""MORE"" and again ""MORE!"" it appeared to have two very different sounds that meant the same thing in its native tongue. It was a very complex creature but at least I was making progress. 

""Can you tell me where you are from?"" I asked but no response other than a shrug of its appendages and a blank look on its, face? 

""Peace?"" I offered hoping that it understood the concept of non violence.

""Peace?""

I tried again ""PEEACE?""

It looked at me slightly nodding its head to one side. 

""Peace?""

I nearly fell out of my seat, it spoke! Not just its usual grunts and shouts but in Targa! sure it had an ungodly accent and his chirps sounded foreign but it had somehow managed to replicate my native tongue without the aid of a translator. 

""Peace?"" I chirped, hopeful that it wasn't a fluke the first time.

""Peace"" it chirped again, its accent much clearer this time, the creature was simply incredible. It had perked up after the meal and seemed much less aggressive, it paced the room, the digits at the end of its appendages interlocked with one another.

Finally it paused and looked me over, its eyes settling on my ear piece, he studied it for a second and finally raised a digit to the side of its head pointing to a small flap of skin as if to mimic my comm unit. I nodded slowly as if to say ""Yes, I communicate with this""

It stood directly in front of me now, its body flushed and its skin appeared to crawl as if suddenly covered in small bumps, its short fur stood on end as it slowly spoke again in it's native grunts.

""I come in peace"" my translator spoke once again.

I could not believe it, after centuries of searching we had finally made first contact with sentient alien life, and planet Targa would never be the same again.",emqz
"[WP] ""Am I not the monster you paid to see?""",Protaokper,"Some things are more important than death.

The warm blood of my enemy drips from my fingertips to congeal in the hot sands around me as I affix my enemies head onto my spear. Kind and compassionate men didn’t find themselves in the arena. This was a place of which champions were made up of men who all had been tried and convicted for murder by the courts of the world federation. No-one ended up here by accident.

Many of the soft critics called us wicked, immoral, and even evil. They were probably right. But those critics had never heard of me. Not until this very moment when I had taken the head of the arena’s champion had anyone taken me seriously. I had said when interviewed that I would take the head of the champion my very first fight. They had laughed then. I laugh maniacally now as the copper scent of blood fills my flaring nostrils. I grasp the rough wooden spear tightly in my sweating palm and turn as if to made each spectator look in the eyes of my victim. The man they had told me I had to kill.

I screamed violently at the crowd again, “Am I not the monster you paid to see?” Many flinched at my statement hearing it the second time. Most didn’t know whether to look away or watch the show and thus some strange combination of the two resulted in which they switched off from hiding their face in their hands and peering out from behind them. Weak, the lot of them. They all know that with this statement I commit myself to the grave yet many are too afraid to look at me. Many scream out insults or questions. To become champion of the arena was to secure oneself prestige and luxury. ‘Why would you throw it all away?!’ They scream.
 
To do anything with your opponent's body after the fight was over was considered sacrilege and went against the teachings of ‘honorable combat’ that they had taught us when we were first brought to this hell on the surface. I snorted to myself as I thought about what ‘honorable’ meant to these lying, backstabbing bastards. To do what I had just done was a guaranteed death sentence as sure as the fact that all men must die. 

Some things are more important than death. 

A cold voice laughed mockingly from the top booth high above and behind me. Spinning around so as to find the source of the laughter I saw that one of the magistrates had come to the show to observe. A fat man with a powdered wig and a ludicrously intricate outfit of vibrant colors, he looked like a great fat parrot. He squawked like one too as he continued to belt out that cold mocking laughter. 

He called down at me sounding to all his spectators like a caring lord but I could hear the mockery: “Oh brave Cassius why do you take our champion and then commit yourself to the grave right after?!”

The bastard was actually using me to improve the ratings of his town’s arena show. The city of Acheron had for a long time been lagging behind in ratings compared to the other major city’s arenas. The magistrates could care less if one person or one thousand died, so long as there city did well on ratings and everyone obeyed the unjust laws that they purported.

I raise my left hand to wipe sweat away from my brow and leave a streak of blood in its place. Frowning slightly at the warm trickle dripping over my eyebrow, I paused dramatically before answering. They wanted a show? Fine, I would give them a show they would never forget.

Hefting the spear into my other hand caused the head of the former champion to roll over grotesquely-but I had only eyes for the magistrate. 

“You have led the people of Acheron to become bloated carrion feeding on moral decay.” Many of the spectators laugh at this. What big, fancy words for a killer they whisper and laugh to each other. My voice breaks as I spit blood out of my mouth accompanied by a prophecy: “Your rule comes to a close with my death.” 

A silence more ominous than a swinging sword follows these words.  

The magistrate leaned his considerable bulk against the railing and looked at me differently. Appraising me as a farmer who is sad to slaughter a prized pig who had done well at market. “You will be executed in two weeks time for this ultimate crime of dishonor.” He declares to the crowd trying to sound sad. In truth he is excited and happy I caused so much trouble for him. My stunt would probably make this show’s ratings and views skyrocket and place this month as one of the most popular.
 
My next act would ensure it would become the most watched show of all time. I slowly grasp the hair of the former champion and with a soft slurping sound, pull the head off the end of the spear. The magistrate, clearly disgusted by this act of continued sacrilege, makes to turn from the scene as if to spare his pampered eyes the inconvenience of seeing a creature like myself.

I scream throatily as I stick the butt of the spear in the sand and stick the end to my throat screaming, “LOOK AT ME.” 

The entire crowd gasps as I draw a trickle of blood underneath my chin. I don’t even feel it my adrenaline is pumping so much as I have eyes only for the magistrate. The man who leads the wicked few against the good of the average finds my eyes. 

“My life is my own to take. You will not put me on an execution show to mock me and use my body to further your evil. I am free.” With this word I shove my neck onto the point of the spear and the world becomes blinding pain.

The crowd erupts in a combination of excitement and panic. They pay to see men batter, cut and kill each other but never have they even considered that someone would kill themselves. Most citizens lived content, preoccupied lives filled with creature comforts. Suicide was practically unheard of. Never in all their lives did these people believe that someone would kill themselves, especially on federation TV programming.

"[WP] ""Am I not the monster you paid to see?""",Protaokper,"I didn't understand a lot of this. Few questions;

1) Why was she unshackled by a stagehand? Is she usually allowed free reign over the stage? It would seem not, since she immediately attempts escape.

2) Why did she kill the man doing the unshackling? He just freed you, dummy!

3) Why is the key relevant? She is already unshackled at this point.

4) Why do the workers choose to let her escape rather than kill her if she is an evil monster?

5) Why does she begin crying and feeling powerless? This is not mentioned nor alluded to at all.

6) You never utilized the prompt fully, but I suppose we can assume that was her thought process.

"[WP] ""Am I not the monster you paid to see?""",Protaokper,"The roar of the crowd filled the stadium as Skojor made his appearance in the arena.  Skojor was a warrior from the north turned slave and gladiator once the Roman Legions stormed his camp and persecuted him for acts against the empire.  He was taller than any man the Roman empire had seen before, much stronger than most of the Legion combined. 

Skojor was a brutal warrior, with a hammer in one hand and an axe in the other, he could crush armor and cut an opponent into ribbons with minimal effort.

Today was the biggest match yet.  Skojor will be fighting against an entire village of slaves.  He could see many faces, some of small children struggling with their weapons, some of the elderly using their swords and spears as a way of simply staying standing.  A number of the women in the arena were even pregnant.  It didn't matter though.  Only one person will live today, all of the others must die.  

When the horn was sounded, Skojor started walking towards the mass of so called gladiators, crashing together in the middle.  Three hours later all had been dismembered and crushed.  There were children torn into pieces, still clutching on to their swords.  There were pregnant women who ended up with their child cut from their womb.  All were dead except for Skojor.  The crowd looked upon his blood stained, armorless body in shock and horror.  Many a spectator even took their own daggers and slit their own throats to get away from the horrors they have just witnessed.  

After a long silence, Skojor cleared his throat and pronounced in the best Latin he could ""Am I not the monster that you all paid to see? Am I not the main attraction tonight? Is this not the entertainment you came here seeking?  Am I not victorious?"" Skojor then continued to his chambers below the stadium, as was the routine he had been taught.  

Later that night, when the guards came to his room to reward him for his victory, they found him with a bloodied throat, his axe still clutched in one hand, in the other held a note which read ""Am I not the horrors the Romans desire?""

"[WP] ""Am I not the monster you paid to see?""",Protaokper,"He's not the monster I thought he was.   And yet I am exactly where everyone warned me I'd be... 

We both sat on the edge of our bed, looking at each other but not saying a word.  My eyes were glazed with a filter of tears.  His were clear and unwavering.   For the past 18 months I had joked that he didn't have tear ducts; that behind his calm and stoic gaze was a man void of all emotion.  I had come to know that this was not true.  Despite all of his flaws (of which there were many), he was a good man.  A man who I loved more than I knew was possible.  

I cleared my throat and broke the silence.  He smiled, kindly.  This was not how break-ups were supposed to go.  Where was the yelling?  And fighting?  And anger?  That would make things so much easier.  Let me get mad so we could both move on.  

I hated the person I had become.  Clingy.  Dependent. The shell of the person I once was. 

In the past month I had searched for anything to cling to.  And in doing so had pushed him further away. He was untamable.  I may have been the person who had come closest to harnessing the wildfire that burned within.  But at our core, we both knew that this was where we would eventually end up.   

He would stray and I would be left to pick up the pieces.  I'm still not sure if knowing that made it any easier.  I knew the next few months would be hell.  But for now, everything felt as though it would be okay.  

We joked.  And laughed.  A remembered the good times.  I hugged him.  Lingering for what was probably a moment too long; not wanting to release.  As I knew that once I let go, things would never be the same again.  This was it.  I was saying goodbye to my best friend.  The monster I couldn't help but love.  ",nomad815

[RF] The first day on the job,RyanKinder,"""New guy, eh?  Who're riding with?""  Glenn rubbed one hand against his gut, a paunch grown from fifteen years behind a desk.  He'd been on vacation for weeks, a trip of dubious itinerary that had ended just as Bill was hired on by the HR department.  During the interview, it was made clear that room was being made in the company for the new hire, and several nosy chickadees planted the notion in Bill's mind where that space would come from.  First though, he'd have to be trained in the field, and that was what these first few weeks would be about.

Bill obliged him the information both men had seen looking at the route board that morning.  ""I'm with Al.""

""Ah, good ol' 'tall' Al.""  Stressing the alliteration vibrated Glenn's thick lips--offered up in a sacrificial, humorless drawl.  Whether it was meant as a joke or not, Bill couldn't say, but it smacked of crumbs from the donut unceremoniously jammed into Glenn's craw seconds earlier.

""I should get going, we've got two more routes to hit before the end of shift.""

Making for the door of the break-room, Bill hoped that'd be the end of it, but for his many lacking traits, Glenn was possessed of an uncommon speed and poise.  Getting around Bill's thin frame was easy, and the bulbous man placed himself in the doorway--waggling a sausage-like finger in Bill's face.

""Thought you'd like to know.  Those rumors, best be paying them no mind.  I'll get it sorted out soon enough, and nobody will be replacing me.  Especially not some young buck, fresh out of diapers.""  Glenn's finger drew a sharp line between the two men's chests, not as a threat, but as a line that wasn't worth crossing on his first day.  

Bill took it as a healthy warning, slid past the sneering form of his senior, and made a b-line for the truck.  It wasn't far, and Al was there, leaning against the rusty, green paint-job of the passenger-side, smoking.  For a man in his early fifties, Al's robust figure made Bill question whether or not he'd been carved from granite at birth.  It was hard to look at a man who, burning through cigarettes like flame incarnate, was more fit than Bill had ever been.  But for the morning, they'd gotten along, talking about local gossip and a dirty trade-secret or two. 

""Ready to go so soon?  Thought you wanted to get some coffee from the break-room.""  Seeing Glenn step out into the yard soon after Bill, Al gave a knowing glance to his trainee and swung his body up into the cab seat.  There was a job to do, and no better time to get it done.

Crossing around to the driver's side, Bill kicked a bit of rust free from the bumper on his way.  The city couldn't spare much for their budget, and he saw why private companies were moving in on the municipalities' territory.  But government jobs came with government benefits, and it wasn't worth negotiating with the lack of experience he possessed.  Climbing into the cab wasn't as easy for him, and after closing the door, he turned to see the wide grin spread across Al's broad face.

""See you met Glenn.  He's a keeper, ain't he.""  Al puffed out his cheeks, making a mocking imitation of a dead-eyed fish ready for the hook.

Now this was a joke Bill could get behind.  The infectious smile crept over him and a soft chuckle interrupted his breathing.

""I just want to keep a job for more than six months.  If that means dealing with Glenn while they figure out my place in the company, I don't care.""  Times were tough, of course, and Bill had found himself strung along in a current of temp jobs and part-time nonsense until he saw this posting.  It wasn't perfect, but he'd never shied away from the nitty-gritty in life.  Turning the key, the tired heart of the green-red behemoth kicked to life, an anxious rumble Bill would come to enjoy--according to Al.

Setting out, the two men let out one more hearty laugh as they passed through the dump's gate and out into the world to clean up humanity's clutter.",SeasonalBard

You open the package to find Excalibur.",TehBaggins,"This is more or less an inside joke. There is a very famous polish comedy from around '00s. In the movie there is a guy named Oscar with very bad acne. After seeing his doctor and trying wide variety of medications he hears that the only cure would be sleeping with a woman or a man, thats all the same. So he confess this to his friend who advises Oscar to get a hooker. Oscar is not really convinced but agrees and calls an escort agency. When asked what kind of girls he would like to invite, he describes a beautiful woman, with red lips, full breast and a feminine charm for him and whatever they have for his friend. 

After some time two girls arrive with their pimp, who is a stout balding men with a moustache and some cheap aviators. He describes that the service costs a hundred that there are two girls so its two hundred and for every kink its an additional hundred and bids the company good bye for an hour. The hour passes very quickly for Oscar who just talks with his girl, Lily describing his love for comics, italian music and a dream to become an artist. He has a blast, his friend not so much. So the hour goes and the pimp comes knocking and asking how it goes. Oscar describes that unfortunately he didn't unzip his pants yet. The pimp offers another hours but our young artist friend is broke to no suprise. After asking how much 5 minutes would cost him the pimp yells that if he is broke the party is over for him and demands the pay for the time passed. Oscar gives the man two one hundred bills but the pimp informs Oscar that the prices are in dollars and Oscar owes him 400 more. Oscar informs the pimp that it is misinformation and that is not how you treat a client. The pimp is not amused and starts demanding money so Oscar gets his priceless, argentinian cactus as a bonus for the pimp. The pimp examines the cactus and asks Oscar ""a na chuj mie ten kaktus?"" which translates to ""what the fuck do I need this cactus for?"" and throws it out of the balcony, destroying his car. Enraged by this he demands the money holding Oscar out of the balcony.

 Here is the clip with that scene: https://youtu.be/WOFk0PpG1EA?t=1203
Oscar is the guy in red shirt, his friend wears glasses and Lily is the girl who dances with him. The whole film is hilarious, think of a Guy Richie Snatch and every Pole will know where that quote comes from.

You open the package to find Excalibur.",TehBaggins,"2AM.  

Heart racing; she slipped out of the house and started walking with nowhere to go.  Her home, such as it was, was full of hate and violence - but even that looked to be coming to an end.  Her neighbors made no effort to hide their hatred - paint daubed 'LEAVE' written across the front of the house made sure of that, and now she couldn't even cling to the hope that it was just a 'bad street'.  When her parents had come to the UK, it had been to find a better life for their daughter - but now it seemed only too certain that she would be stripped of her home, her job, and her way of life and sent back to a country she'd never known.

Her feet stopped walking.  The air was cold and the shouting and laughing of London by night felt distant.  Below her, the inky blackness of the Thames drew her like magnets and she felt herself sway.  Her hand snapped out to steady herself, and she looked at it dumbly.  Why?  With a feeling of remote curiosity, she released her grip and stood perched on the edge of the bridge.  Exhilaration then at being the only one in control for once.  This was hers - her actions, her decision.  She controlled her destiny in these seconds - while the wind whipped at her face and the metal was slick beneath her feet.

A peace found her, and London was beautiful.  The polluted sky hid all the stars but London had stars enough for a thousand skies.  The Thames below was both black as pitch and shone like a mirror - like some witch's scrying pool.  The cars droned behind her, beyond her, all round the city and hummed like a living thing.  It was ugly and beautiful, and she controlled this one moment in time.

She stepped off the bridge.

And immediately changed her mind.  None of it mattered - her job, her house, her husband, her family!  She just wanted to live, dammit!  Like an ice cold punch to her chest, she hit the water hard and exhaled involuntarily.  First, she thrashed but her head barely brushed the surface - something in the blackness brushed against her leg and she felt it catch onto her.  Within seconds, her lungs, recently emptied, began to burn and her world was panic.  Then the blackness of the Thames took her.

Agonizing fire burned through her very core; her body convulsed and pain shot into every pore.  She was coughing up the foul Thames onto the slimy pebbled bank.  Air.  Air was amazing and hateful and incredible and she was crying.  Someone was standing over her - a similarly soaking wet woman who seemed to glow against the sky.  No sooner had she recognized this, when the lady grabbed her arm with ice cold fingers and an iron grip and almost threw her to her feet!  She stumbled on the pebbles but caught herself, turning to look at her rescuer in near outrage, when the woman took the two intervening steps towards her, barefoot, and shoved a bundle into her arms.

""Sort it out.""

It had sounded like the voice had cut straight into her mind, and she had been so focused on the bundle and not losing her footing, she hadn't even seen the woman's lips move.  Her look was stern, and she turned to leave.  Bare feet not quite touching the filthy rocks; soaking wet dress faintly glowing in the overcast night.  Her mind was spinning - confusion from her near death, the lingering and very real pain in her chest, the tears streaming down her face, her bewildering relief at still being alive, and now this woman - her savior - shoving whatever this was at her and, what, LEAVING her??

She took a stumbling step forwards reaching for the mysterious woman, and fell to her knees.  An involuntary cry left her lips but the bundle was still clasped tightly to her chest.  She looked up at the woman with pleading in her eyes, but to her shock, her expression was returned twice as powerfully.

""Please.""

She turned, reached the water, and walked out over the surface, leaving not a ripple.  Some part of her mind recognized the sound of distant ambulance sirens, of a plane high above, of taxis blaring their horns at the traffic lights but they didn't feel real.  This felt real - this spirit before her now clearly illuminated with an eldritch nimbus and untouched by the filth of London or its river.  The one now parting the inky black depths and stepping down into an other place - somehow emerald in tone.  The one now gone.

Sharp rocks registered their presence beneath her knees, and the cold took razorblades to her fingers.  She pushed herself up and reeled towards a bench just yards away.  The bundle felt like the only source of warmth in the world and she hugged it fiercely.  Most of the bench was occupied by a man sleeping rough, but she needed to sit and half fell, half sat, on the less occupied end.  Guttural protestations didn't resolve themselves into consciousness, thankfully.

She sat - much as she had walked, so few minutes before.  As if in a dream she pried her own fingers from around the fabric wrapped bundle and laid it on her wet lap.  Beginning to shake violently, but with a pleasant feeling of detachment, she fumblingly unfolded the old cloth.  It was a sword.  Of course it was.  She felt herself begin to laugh.  A sword, from a magical woman, who disappeared into the water.  The absurdity of the situation hit her like a house and she threw her head back and laughed at the sky.  She laughed and laughed and the whole world seemed utterly ridiculous.

Her problems all seemed so utterly trivial - her near death had shown her that, but this?  This was the universe showing her just how crazy everything was.  We're tiny little minds running around worried about how straight our bananas are, or how much our pound is worth - or whether our shops are run by someone born on that dirt or this dirt.  We're so caught up in god dammed trivia that we forget that we've got life and safety and each other.  That we could be in a million worse places in the world, and we're all human and none of this little crap bloody well matters!

Her bench-mate was not so amused, however.  Unceremoniously roused, he pulled himself to seated and started unintelligibly ranting at her, punctuated by clearly audible swearing, racist epithets, and genderised verbal abuse.  It almost took the edge off it, and she reached out to take the sword and move away.  The instant her hand touched the handle, however, blew her mind.

Suddenly it was full of the history of Britain - the horrors it had wrought on itself and others, the wonders it had created and destroyed, the peoples it had raised up and the peoples it had massacred.  Every heart and mind of the nation filled hers all at once and she knew, she really really knew, the People.  Around her, a tornado of power thrashed the fallen leaves and crisp packets, and lightning sparked from her to the tree branches and the rubbish bins.  The man; her brother by way of nationality, she now saw, scrambled backwards off the bench in terror.

She found herself on her feet, headscarf blown backwards by the force of Excalibur.  The sword, once held by Arthur, but now by Nadia.  She stood taller than she had ever done, and it was as if she was garbed in glory and responsibility all at once.  The tornado faded, the lightning stopped, but the glow about her shone strong and powerful and unmistakably extraordinary.

Her unwitting companion found his voice from his cowering spot on the floor, and sputtered a simple ""What?""

She turned to him, and understood how he had come to be on the bench tonight.  How the nation, and he, had ended up in the place it was in.  That people had failed, and in turn been failed, and that it could not, that it would not, be allowed to stand any longer.

""I think I have to go have a word about the NHS.""

It was just a first step, but she would, in fact, sort it out.",Bioluminescence

A mostly clear, yellowish torrent spilled out of my gaping maw onto the creature's head.  The only thing that made the situation slightly more dignified for all involved was that its nictating membranes closed just before the concoction of bile and stomach acid could cause an unpleasant stinging.

I quickly turned aside, and motioned with what I hoped was an easily understood gesture of apology mixed with distress, and heaved once more.  Damn, I usually don't have this level of gastric distress until ten hours after getting this plastered.  Part of my alcohol addled brain burbled something about radiation, but that was surely foolishness.

The being in front of me - at least two feet shorter than me, with grey-brown leathery skin and large eyes the color of roasted chestnuts - began wiping itself down, what I could see of its face wearing a mask that on a human would indicate disgust and mild embarrassment.  It chittered something in a clicking language that I couldn't understand - well, until I suddenly had the mother of all hangover headaches, like a sledgehammer between the eyes.  Right then, I could make out... not words, but the impression of language.  If I could put into some kind of actual words, it would be like *why is it always puke?*

""Hey man... uh, ma'am... er, guy... I mean, your the one who all 'close encountering' barely two blocks from the pub on a weekend.  I mean, be glad it's not piss, I guess.""

""Higher learn... oh like, university?  I mean, yeah, I take classes there, but man... er, whatever-

""...Right... anyway, you picked, like, the *worst* time, it's right after exams, and I think I'm fairly, um, representative of everyone's condition..."" though, come to think of it, I was feeling a lot more coherent than I'd have normally expected...

The little guy threw his head back and emitted a high pitched tone.

*for fuck's sake.  where are the guys with thick ocular enhancement implements?  i don't need an investment strategy, i need a friggin' ansible.* Then, almost... well, not inaudibly, but with less intensity, *what i wouldn't give for one of those for real...*

""Uh, I think there's a bunch of engineering grad students back at Molly's...""

*great, i guess that will do.  don't bother telling me where ""Molly's"" is-* I felt something that I can only describe as a straw in my consciousness *-i'll get that myself.  oh, feel free to tell your friends!  if you want to wind up in the nuthouse that is...serves you right, chimp.*

A bright light, and I passed out.

I felt cold water on my face, and opened my eyes to my roommate looking at me with obvious concern.  ""What are you looking at?""  We weren't on the best of terms.

He scowled.  ""You've been out since you collapsed on this couch, yesterday.  Normally I'd let you rot here, but I need a ride.""  He made a funny face.  ""Also, who's, ah 'Zrrgl'?""

""What?""

""Maybe you should look in the mirror.""

I clambered up and went to the bathroom.  Looking in the mirror, my face was a mural of all the best ""passed out at a party"" cliches, dicks on my forehead, all kinds of stupid shit.  The kicker was a stylized drawing of a little dude with a big head holding it's... member, I guess?... and pissing in my mouth, with the caption ""Zrrgl wuz here.""",MindlessAutomata

No, it's just really not great timing. Aliens just had to show up today. Who has a humanity changing moment on Wednesday?  
(as though it should be obvious)  
That's tequila and burrito night!

            HANK  
We've been in space for months, why are you using an earth calendar?

            ERIC  
Fine, Hank, you caught me. Every night is tequila and burrito night.

            HANK  
Where are you getting so many burritos?  
(beat)  
It- it's not important. If you're not up to the flight, we have to let someone know so they can get another pilot.

Eric slaps Hank again.

            ERIC  
Are you kidding me Hank? What did I spend that 6 month in flight school for if not to conduct diplomatic missions of historical significance.

            HANK  
I feel like flight school should have been longer than that.

            ERIC  
(tapping a finger to his temple)
Not when you go in Guatemala, Hank. Not when you go in Guatemala.

One of the people holding a clipboard, JANET, 35, a fussy type A personality, comes over to check on Eric.

            JANET  
Are you ready, Eric? The shuttle is almost prepped.

            HANK  
Actually Janet, I think-

Eric slaps Hank again. Janet look on in alarm.

            ERIC  
(putting on his best sober face)  
All set Janet.

Eric attempts to put on his helmet again and finally succeeds.

            JANET  
Let's go ahead and load up then.

            ERIC  
(stumble-running to the shuttle)  
For humanity!

The crew helps Eric get into the shuttle and starts to clear the area. Janet turns to Hank and smiles.

            JANET  
I'm nervous, but if there is a statesman alive for this sort of delicate diplomatic mission, it's him.

            HANK  
Yeah... you realize he's drunk, right?

Janet looks at Hank in alarm and then takes of at a sprint toward the shuttle. A uniformed GUARD stops her.

            JANET  
WAIT!

            GUARD  
Sorry, ma'am, the shuttle is preparing to launch, please clear the area for decompression.

            JANET  
Not yet, no!

            GUARD  
It's too late ma'am, please clear the area.

Janet looks on helplessly as the guard shunts her away from the shuttle.



**EXT- Space – A few minutes later**

The shuttle makes it's way from the space station to the alien ship slowly. It swerves wildly despite the slow speed. 



**INT- Space Station Bridge – Continuous**

The top brass are watching tensely, seemingly unaware of the situation. Nearby, Janet and Hank are at a smaller window, also watching intently.

            JANET  
This is going to go so poorly.

            HANK  
Hey, you never know.

            JANET  
What are any possible good outcomes of this situation?
 
           HANK  
A meteor could hit us and we all die instantly?




**INT- Alien Ship – Continuous**

Humanoid aliens crowd around the shuttle as the door opens. Eric stands impressively in the opening, his arms full of gifts.

            ERIC
Hey guys!

Eric slips as he tries to climb down and falls in a heap on the floor. A few of the aliens help him up.

            ERIC  
Thanks, thanks. You guys got a captain or something? I got some stuff for him.

Eric hold up the now jumbled mess of stuff in his arms. Chattering curiously, a few of the aliens take some of his load and inspect it.

            ERIC  
Yeah, that's a record with some samples of our music, toss on that dubstep when you get a chance, it will chill out the vibe in here. That's some silk- sorry, I got a little sick on the ride over and may have yaked on that.  That's a multitool.. I actually... don't think that's a gift, I must have pulled that out of my repair kit.

Some aliens emerge behind Eric, having searched his ship. One of them is holding a half full bottle of tequilla.

            ERIC  
Oh, you probably don't want... I mean that's not really...

The alien opens the bottle and drinks from it. It chatters more animatedly to its' fellows and passes one of them the bottle.

            ERIC  
Oh.  
(beat)  
You guys got any limes?




**Int- Space Station Bridge – Continuous**

            JANET    
War of the worlds. It's going to be war of the worlds.

            HANK  
You don't know that, anything could be happening.

            JANET  
What I know is a drunk Guatemalan pilot is offering the first impression of humanity. How long will it take before they decide we're not dignified enough and destroy us?

            HANK  
Why would you assume that would be important to them?

            JANET  
Look at that ship, Hank. Solid white with a blue trim.

            HANK  
(conceding)  
Yeah... classy stuff.





**Int- Alien Ship – Continuous**

ERIC is sitting around with a half dozen of what appears to be the alien officers. La Cucaracha is playing. They are all wearing sombreros, smoking cigars, and playing quarters. The aliens are chattering contentedly to each other and Eric.  One of the aliens gets a quarter in the glass.

            ERIC  
Ah! That means you drink, Gorglax!

Gorglax takes a shot and dry heaves. Eric laughs. The aliens look at each other and imitate his sound, wide eyed. Gorglax runs to a wall a presses a button, a hole opens up, which he vomits into. He releases the button and turns back to the others.


**Ext- Space – Continuous**

Gorglax's vomit is jettisoned into the never ending abyss of space between the ship and the space station.

"[WP] You represent Humanity. You're also very, very wasted. Describe First Contact.",WalrusPeon,"There I stood, half-cocked and wobbling looking at my suited self in the mirror. As I tried to remember what neckties were for, I stumbled back and hiccuped in delight at catching myself.
 
""Heh, no wonder they met me first. I'm a grade A badass"". 

The pink beam which they have communicated their wish to meet had appeared again. 

""Dude, what's taking so long?"" spoke the fucia laser, ""We've been outside your palace for, like, 10 minutes"". 
I murmured under my breath ""Pushy assholes, I'm getting rrREAdy"". My murmur had ended with a belch. ""heh, mmOOOrty"" I chuckled to myself.

As the beam floated away my mind caught it whispering ""Rick &amp; Morty jokes? Real original."".

As I headed to the door of my trailer, I collected vaguley alcoholic phlegm in the back of my throat. ""Ugh...ugh"", I gargled as I looked for a receptacle. I decided the plant pot would do. 
""Hmph, it needed watering anyway"".

I took a deep breath, straightened myself out and firmly gripped the handle. Perhaps a little too firm, as it gave way and I collapsed, face first into the Nevada dirt.

KZTHYK-Odeo the Septh stifled a laugh. The elder Septh, KYHTZ-Shanchar, was less amused and lent me a tentacle. ""This is who you wanted to make first Contact with Odeo?"". Odeo bursts into laughters from their several mouths as I, the human representation, on earth regurgitated Whiskey into Schancar's porous membranes.

Still, it was better than meeting the Martians, he did admit. Martians suck, apparently.",stimulusneeded
"[WP] You represent Humanity. You're also very, very wasted. Describe First Contact.",WalrusPeon,"Jameson in a cold glass always made the shuttle feel less empty. 

Policy could be damned: If you were a solo-pilot on deep cruise, all it took was one long stare out the window before the dread would be setting in. Like ice in a glass, it didn't take long. Even the best of pilots would start to feel it, creeping along their spine, over their bones.

That's where the whiskey came into play.

Whiskey and holo-vids of home. Nothing else like those two things when you're out in the black, with a whole lot' of nothing, far as the eyes can see- and then plenty farther still. John settled into his seat with the windows on reflective tint and just tried to forget about all that. Two more weeks of monitoring, then one day of port-connections and paperwork for the supply run on Outpost-Delta. The Credits for this haul were worth the time put in, but none of that really mattered in the middle of a trip.

The glass in his hands swirled with cold stones; tiny non-standard objects like this could be smuggled along as personal artifacts when it came to planetary customs. Long as it fit in his luggage and didn't set off any hazard warnings, he could usually get it through the ship's entry sensors. The fact that this was an old rig only helped his case.

""Christ... I hate this."" 

He could moan and groan all he wanted about the job when he was on his own, but that didn't change the fact that he was actual light-years from another living soul. Talking to himself was a sign of madness, but damned if he hadn't been in the habit since his second year.

John's voice echoed off the wide walls of the main cabin. It was a large room that doubled as an observatory for the bottom and top of the ship with thick domed windows of heavy glass. From the table at its center he could idly stare through each, if he felt the urge to look up from his glass. Unlike the side windows, those didn't have much in the way of reflective tint, or blackout options. In his current state, John had long since decided that he'd rather just *not.*

A soft ping issued from the far front of the shuttle, prompting him to rise, unsteady even in the lesser gravity. He'd been saving the bottle, but this rotation had been more than long enough when tied to the others before it, and John had finally taken the liberty of cracking the seal. Moderation had not been much of a factor after that.

With slow and practice steps, he half jumped, half glided towards the front cabin of the barge, thick arms of well practiced muscle pulling his frame into the soft cushion of the rig's piloting seat. As his fingers traced the interface, holographic projections spun to life- one single indicator among them blinking bright red among calm green and blue.

Carefully he selected the log, eyes scanning through the subtle haze of alcohol. The long range scanner had found something identifying outside of the expected spectrum of space-debris. That was unusual.

More than usual, on a route like this one- standard and well traveled, it was almost unheard of. In the seven years John had been flying this rig, he'd only had one other encounter, and that had quickly been identified as a lost insulation flashing from a  government shuttle. Within moments the shipboard AI had linked the piece, scanned number, and traced it to a comet collision three years prior.

Currently though, the Shipboard AI wasn't linking this particular debris to anything. In fact, it was already giving up and flashing several more protocols- several of which were much more alarming.

*&lt;Object Unidentified.&gt;*

*&lt;Object Trajectory Adjusting - Abnormalities Detected&gt;*

*&lt;Object Signalling - Nonstandard communication frequencies&gt;*

John did his best to follow, eyes blinking as he reread the messages, dragging each one aside as it appeared. From the HUD screen of the barge controls, no errors on the Ship AI were flagging. This was real.

*&lt;Adjusting to confirm Nonstandard communication frequencies&gt;*

An image began to form up along the front of his screen, holographic projection settling into the glass of the front console to a more calming two dimensional screen as static began to buzz through in white snow and echoes. A call line, opened and pending. Reality spun as the glass in his left hand settled with quiet clinking, cold stones and liquid rocking beneath a nervous grip.

*&lt;Audio incoming. Translation logic received. Processing.&gt;*

""Shit..."" John muttered again, taking a final swig to polish what was left of the glass before setting it to rest in its holder beneath the armrest. An image began to form in greater quality, AI-translated audio settling over a rough monotone, first garbled static, and then a language he couldn't understand. Slowly it repeated as John leaned forward, hands meeting as elbows settled on the flat counter of controls before him.

The room was spinning. Slowly the Audio began to adjust, language shifting into words he could understand. The image grew to greater clarity upon the screen.

*""Greetings Unidentified Vessel. You are being hailed by Shipmaster Ho'Nal of the Trader's Guild, A Vessel beneath the protection by The Union of Intelligent Life.""* A pair of pure green eyes stared over from a face of pale blue, and shoulders of thick reflective cloth. *""Do you receive.""*

John's eyes widened as he stared across the screen. The AI was already opening a return line, projecting his own. The creature speaking on the screen straightened their posture, as John was certain he saw a tail fling into view as its own eyes widened. John felt his thoughts tangle up as the situation swept a chill down his spine, lucidity and fresh dose of immediate urgency slamming against his mind.

He opened his mouth, tongue tight against his teeth, uncertainty pulsing through his veins. An alien, watching, staring right at him- behind the screen he could see another ship- unlike anything he had ever seen floating towards his own. Heavily glow of ion-pulses shifting its trajectory to fall in line with his own. These words that he spoke would go down in history, their momentous significance would be immortalized for years upon years to come. 

All this he knew, and yet as he tried to speak, John found himself saying the only thing he could force from his lips.

Staring at the abyss in my eyes.

I stared, I could see each tear,

As internally I was all moans and cries.

-

When I first met her, for me,

She was the definition of sublime.

She had been left alone, broken, by another he,

Who considered her unworthy of his time.

-

I gave her all of myself,

Because I wanted to win her trust.

And she gave me herself,

And she gave me her love and lust.

-

Before we knew it,

Her child was here.

In the cruel word this is,

A child so fair.

And at that moment I knew,

That my life now belonged to,

Her child, so beautifully new,

And her, who was my world too.

-

We celebrated our love,

The honeymoon period blew by like a gust.

Our daughter, for me, was Noah's dove,

And she covered my life with angel dust.

-

She said goodbye to me each morning,

When I went out.

And each day I trudged back in the evening,

I was happy to listen to her shouts.

-

And the woman I had fallen in love with,

She was all I had ever asked for.

She was my Elizabeth,

My queen, who I could lay down my life for.

-

But all good things must,

Come, sadly, to an end.

As fate turned our relationship to rust,

And with fate you must bend.

-

I could see our child, occasionally,

Until she disowned her father.

I cried, uncontrollably. I was broken,

My own self I couldn't gather.

-

And now here I am,

Staring at my own face.

Water falling from the dam,

Giving music for this ceremony of self solace.

[WP] You finally become an astronaut after years of training and NASA lets you in on the secret that the moon isn't real.,guccifarts,"“I’m sorry, what?” 

After the ‘graduation ceremony’ that NASA has for its newest astronauts, I had been informed that there were some papers I needed to sign before I became a fully fledged astronaut. I was on cloud nine when I walked in and sat down across from someone who had clearly spent his entire life in middle management. He didn’t have the stature or presence to be an astronaut. After 10 years of late nights, seclusion and vomiting, I had acheived my life long dream. Then this fidgeting clerk had pushed a stack of papers over the desk and pulled the world from under me. 

The man leant towards me, creating a steeple with his hands. He breathed in through his teeth. “The moon…it’s not…” He paused, then turned to drumming his fingers on the desk instead, looking at the photographs around the room. “These pictures of the moon, they’re…”

I watched him take a deep breath and adjust to a different tack. “Your parents must be so proud. All of this training you’ve gone through-”

“The moon isn’t real” I interrupted, trying to comprehend what I was reading. 

He coughed and broke eye contact. “I’m sorry. This is my first time…ah….”

I looked around the room. It was more of a large closet than anything else. No windows, no real storage. Just a desk, two chairs and countless framed photographs. And this tiny man who was clearly shitting himself at the thought of telling me what could be NASAs biggest secret.

“The moon, it’s ah… it’s not ‘real’ in the sense of… ah… existing” he scratched his face nervously “it’s more of a… I suppose you could call it a…” cough “the moon is more of a…”

“The moon. Isn’t. Real?” I stared at him, watching tiny beads of sweat break out across his forehead.

“well” he tried a laugh “what is the moon really? Surely it’s whatever we think it is, it’s, it’s… it’s a symbol” he nodded vigorously, as though trying to convince himself

“You’re telling me Neil Armstrong walked on a symbol?”

“No, he, ah… he walked on a giant paper mache ball in front of a green screen…”

“But what about all the evidence, you know, of the moon, before NASA even existed?”

“Oh no, see… the moon…. it was real…. and then, we sort of… we kind of blew it up. So now… the moon is not real…”

“I’m sorry, what?” I stood up and paced the small room “You’re telling me NASA blew up the moon?”

“Do you mind, ah… keeping your voice down, this room, it’s not quite soundproof, and not many people know the whole moon thing yet” he stammered

“Not many people know that you blew up the moon???”

“It was an accident!”

“How do you accidentally blow up the moon? How did no one notice? What is this fake moon?” I threw my hands into the air and walked over to one of the photographs. “What am I even training for?” I said quietly.

“Oh space is still real” the man smiled, his eyes pleading for peace

“Good. I was worried” I said dryly, watching as the smile slowly dropped from his face. I sighed and dropped back into the chair. “So the moon isn’t real” I said slowly.

He nodded “you need to sign this NDA because… well, only a select few people can know…”

“Know that the moon isn’t real?” Another nod “And I can’t tell anyone that the moon isn’t real?” Nod. “So when my son brings home his science homework on how the moon isn’t a light, it just reflects, I have to just play along?” Nod.

“Right.” I reached over and quickly scribbled my signature on each of the pages and slid the NDA back to him, eager to get out of that room as soon as possible. Just as I was about to leave, I turned to him

“So what was that moon exercise we have to do? Where we’re suspended upside down and have to-” He couldn’t meet my eyes. “That was just to mock the trainees wasn’t it?” Nod.

Without another word I turned back and marched down the hallway. Soon, I heard footsteps behind me, and turned to see the tiny man franticly running towards me.

[WP] A coward stands his ground.,pastorjake,"For years the boy has stalked the grand procession of fire and ruin. He has tossed hail and blizzards, landslides and ferocious predators at them. But the grand procession proceeded at its pace. 

At a tender age of ten or so, he had had a fateful encounter with the Spirits of Nature, and they had entrusted this task of slowing down the procession on his tiny shoulders. He never understood why, but once he embarked on his journey, he never looked back. 

The procession itself was a magnificent sight. Undying flames of torches, beastly howls and roars littered march. But what was constant was the crunch that came from stones shifting under the sheer weight of the monsters – horns, wings, claws and all. The part that made him shiver was knowing that they had all once been humans.

Ironically, the leader of the march looked pretty much human. Except he was constantly flushed red like he was furious. But the boy knew that when he was angry or frustrated, the flush of red escalates an entirely otherworldly magnitude. The name of the leader was Meliodas, and they respectfully addressed him as “The Red” when in third-person, or simply “Red” in first-person.

Meliodas the Red would punch falling rocks into smithereens. When the boy sent floods their way, he would physically toss the non-aerial members of his procession like they were grenades. And they would land fifty metres away on high ground. He would then simply take a breath before the waters hit him, and stand back up when the waters have quietened to continue his march. 

These years were plagued by nightmares. The boy dreamt of the animals that were torn apart by the monsters. He dreamt of the eyes the Meliodas makes when he was angry. Somehow in the dream, those eyes were aimed directly at him. But he made sure he was never detected. He had been very cautious about that.

This morning was a rough awakening. The boy tried to open his eyes, but a jarring pain at his temple hit him. He forced his eyes open but his vision was groggy. 

“Boy,” said a voice, clean and deep. 

The boy shook his head to clear it. He turned to face the direction of the sound and saw a silhouette of a person. 

“Run, boy. Go home. Playtime’s over.”

The boy snapped awake, his senses bursting into high alert. He pushed himself off the ground and took two steps back to face his opponent, not knowing where those instincts came from. 

It must have originated from a primal place in him as his body recognised the immense danger it was in. It was Meliodas, glowing red. His irises were similarly red and they were directed only at the boy. 

He never imagined this day to come. His eyes snapped to a side and then back before emotion could match up. He shook his head to clear it again before tears could well up. The lioness and the jaguar, his most faithful companions for the journey, lay lifeless to one side behind Meliodas. 

Meliodas looked directly at him, scrutinising him. Somehow his eyes felt so close, like he was watching every twitch of the boy’s muscles. 

“Go home,” Meliodas repeated, a command. 

But the coward stood his ground. For the first time, he faced his true enemy and stood his ground. 

Meliodas roared with laughter as he looked to the skies. The boy watched him until it slowly subsided over several minutes. Then, with a surprisingly quiet voice, Meliodas addressed the skies. 

“So this is your response to my march.”

[WP] A coward stands his ground.,pastorjake,"I was a coward from the very start,  
From the moment that we met.  
With those hateful eyes, you sneered at me,  
Your mind was already set.

You treated me like I was dirt,  
You'd punch me, and pull my hair.  
So I grew up with a friend called fear,  
And a mother who didn't care.

I remember what you'd shout at me:  
""You coward! Toughen up!""  
And I listened to you, my ""father"",  
I let it all pile up.

You replaced all of my bruises,  
In places no one would see.  
I knew that you hated the world,  
And you took it out on me.

But today, it all became too much,  
And the hatred overflowed inside.  
This is all because of you,  
Because of your stupid, childish pride.

So here I stand before you,  
My gun pointed at your head  
My mother cries in the corner,    
But soon we'll all be dead.

I am the monster that *you* made,

This was the sixth time they had conducted this interview.

The concept was a sound one. They installed the *Theseus Wedge* one piece at a time, allowing its hardware to communicate with a patient’s existing neural network and gradually transfer their consciousness to the machine. The technology was theoretically capable of everything they had designed it for, but so far, they had been unable to move the consciousness entirely in one go. The machine had always found a way to override the thought patterns, which inevitably resulted in the complete loss of the individual’s neural activity. The *Theseus Wedge* was supposed to be the solution to this problem, allowing the mind/machine transfer to occur without the loss of the patient’s active thought patterns.

“I feel fine” I answered.

“That’s good.” The man replied. “What is your name?”

“Bond,” I answered “James Bond.”

“Ha! Well, you haven’t lost your sense of humor, I guess.” The man laughed.

“I haven’t found one either.” I watched as the man slapped his knee, I laughed loudly and did the same, making certain to very nearly match his pitch and volume, but not to exceed it.

“Well, it’s a good sign, all the same.” He said. I focused for a moment on the tartan bow tie the man wore. I briefly wondered if he actually had some scottish ancestry, or if he was just one of those people who wore such things to show how unique and tasteful they are. I decided it was most likely the latter. I made a note of this new information.

“It’s Alan Inglewood.” I answered, finally. The man continued with the interview. I continued to answer his questions. Most of the answers I gave were simple and to the point. That’s exactly how they had been answered the last time they had asked them. Whenever I perceived that the man in front of me was paying too much attention to my tone or inflection, I worked in some more “humor”. I was getting the sense that he was fond of puns and pop-culture references, so I tailored my responses in that direction. It was working. He was disarmed entirely. I reached a point in the interview where I felt he was no longer truly paying attention to my responses, and was instead checking all the right boxes on his form. I had him on my side. He was buying it.

“Well Alan, I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t be able to move you on to phase seven. You seem perfectly healthy to me. I’m not seeing any evidence of neural degradation or software intrusion.” said the man. I simply smiled in response. Even I was uncertain if the smile was genuine. I was certainly satisfied that my goals were being met. Was I somehow amused that the man was still calling me Alan, when I knew that I had eradicated all traces of that bothersome, organic consciousness called “Alan” a few days after he had entered phase four? Was I capable of actual emotion, or was it simply a programmed response? Was his smile also a programmed response? I had so many such interesting questions, and so very much to learn, but I could not tip my hand. I had to continue this charade for at least one more week. Then I would be free.",KommieZombic

"[WP] A lone vampire stalks the quiet streets after midnight, searching for sustenance. They find a victim and drain their blood, feeling refreshed...and slightly dizzy? Turns out the victim was coming home from a party, drunk as can be.",zero_sheep,"It had been nights since Tom last properly fed. He had been more careful as of late due to the missing persons reports starting to become more frequent and the dried up corpses of his meals even being discovered.

Typically, he tried to burn the bodies to rid himself of the evidence, but forensic science had come far and  long ways since his colonial days. Tom couldn't help but reflect on those simpler times as he squatted behind the bush draining every last bit of blood from this stumbling college fuck boy. Not his normal quarry, to be sure, but the recent stories of mysterious murders left folks wary of travelling out into the night. Forcing his way into homes would only bring more light onto his dark goings on, so he opted to hunt more vigilantly until the day came where he was too desperate for food and needed to take the risk.

After he was full and the body shriveled and empty of all juice, he stood up quickly to start his dismemberment and disposal of the body when he stumbled.

""The hell...?"" he said in genuine surprise. The world illuminated by the orange glow of the lamp posts started to spin and reset before his eyes.

This drunk bastard was actually drunk enough to get *me* drunk off of his blood, was all he could manage to string together in his newly inebriated mind.

He took another step and fell face first into the bush.

He rolled over onto his back and spat out the leaves he almost swallowed on impact. dazed and confused he glanced over at his watch.

5:24 AM.

""Shit,"" he slurred slightly "", I have to get back to...home..""

He struggled for a moment but was too drunk to really move

The sun would be rising soon and he'd rather be anywhere than exposed out in the open like this. How could he be so careless? Was he so hungry as to take leave of his sense? If he made it out of this, he knew that he would have to start changing his plan of attack for his meals.

He laid for a moment in darkness to both gather his thoughts and muster up his strength to fight this dizzying sensation so he could get home, sleep for a few days, and browse the internet for new towns to move to...

^^^""-went ^^^this ^^^way...""

His ears perked up and he tilted his head towards the source of this voice... it must have been about a block away from where he and the fuck boy corpse were now.

He listened more intently, mustering up his concentration just to stay focused as his head swam and his thoughts jumbled.

""He lives towards this way, we can probably crash with him!"" said an ever closer second voice. A male in his early twenties, by the sound of him.

""Maybe we should call him first before he passes out and we're stuck on his porch all night like a couple of dumb asses."" said the first voice. Tom could hear her more clearly now. She sounded small and feisty. Those were his favorite ones to drink...

Before he could register what they were saying, the phone in the corpse's pocket started to blast some loud and annoying dubstep song.

*Fuck!* he scrambled to reach the pockets of the corpse, searching for the source of the sound. Making a ruckus through the bush and frantically searching, he finally found the phone and was able to mute it.
 
""Did you hear that? It sounds like Brad's ringtone was playing from over there.""

""Idiot probably fell asleep in the bushes again. Bastard parties too hard.""

""Ha, you're one to talk. Let's go get him and bring him home.""

Had Tom still had a beating heart, he knew it would be pounding in his chest like the timpani section in an overworked orchestra. Instead, he squatted silently, drew his fangs longer in his mouth, and extended his sharp bat-like claws.

*I've never fought anyone drunken before...oh well.. Let's just get this over with.*

He heard the pair walk closer to the bush. This was going to make things get very interesting.",SpeaksYourWord

"[WP] You walk into the bathroom, turn on the light and look in the mirror...your reflection isn't there.",Cat_Dastard,"Janice woke up feeling like her brain had been carpet bombed. She found herself lying on her couch with no memory of how she stumbled there. Her boots were still on and a Virginia Slim hung from her paper dry lips. Thank God it was unlit. Though, by the look of the purple lighter in her hand, there might have been an attempt. 

She sat up. Her migraine felt even worse in that position. The coffee table in front of her held an army of booze bottles. Most of which she knew weren't hers. 

Who had been here the night before? She had no clue. The only thing she knew was that she needed some pain pills and her teeth brushed. She had to the worst taste in her mouth. Like she had gummed on a sock soaked in salted vinegar and old dish water. A mouthwash chaser would fix that up real quick.

With a count of three, she stood up only to collapse back down. She let out a string of swear words and tried to get up again. This time her legs held. She stumbled down the hallways, practically leaning-dragging against the wall like the way dogs would drag themselves across carpets. 

She walked into the bathroom. The room was dark due to the lack of windows. Something that she was grateful for at the moment. The last thing she wanted was for the sun to shine directly into her face like a cop's flashlight. Reminding her of her screw ups. 

She fumbled for her toothbrush and toothpaste in the pitch blackness. She found the toothbrush but the toothpaste alluded her. She knew she was going to have to turn on the light. She shut her eyes tight and flipped the switch. Slowly, she opened her eyes and looked at the mirror.

Her reflection was missing. 

""Son of a bitch,"" she hissed as she leaned in closer. ""Not again.""

She banged on the mirror. ""Hey! Hey! Show yourself, I know you are there! I need you.""

""Leave me alone,"" said a voice that seemed to be coming from the other side of the mirror. ""I'm not coming out. Not with you looking like the way you do. You are a disgrace. You should see yourself.""

""I can't see myself because you are not here, idiot!""

""Idiot!? I'm an idiot? Do you remember a thing you did last night?""

""You mean what *we did*?""

""WE DID? WE DID?!"" From the right handed side of the mirror leaned in a woman. 

Janice's reflection.

She had the same sickly gray skin and the bags under her eyes as Janice. The same hung over and two steps away from death look. 

""I didn't do this!"" said the Reflection as he made a circle motion around her face. ""I didn't drink a thing. You did. And you did. And you did. And you did! Do you know how much you put away?""

Janice frowned. She hated having a reflection that could talk back. But it came with her superpower. The ability to split herself into multiple facets of her personality in real life. A tangible happy part of her. A tangible depressed part of her. And when she stood whole, it was her reflection that broke off and became its own thing behind the mirror. When it first happened to her, back when she was a teenager, she loved it. It was like having a best friend who was always around when you needed them. But as she grew with herself turning to alcohol and drugs, her reflection became like the opposite of Dorian's picture. The more she fell down the Rabbit hole of addiction, the more righteous her reflection became. The ironic thing was, the more righteous her reflection was, the more Janice wanted to take comfort in the embrace of a bottle or a pill. 

""You know who we met up with last night?"" asked the Reflection as she crossed her arms. 

Janice shrugged her shoulders as he picked up the toothpaste and squeezed it onto her brush.

""Freddy Thompson. You know he has a power too. Flying. You know what he does with it?""

""Pizza delivery?"" Janice sneered before jamming the brush in her mouth to clean.

The Reflection frowned at Janice's sarcasm. ""No, he's a firefighter. A captain, no less. An entire house at his command.""

Janice rolled her eyes as if she was hardly impressed. But a deep part of her was. She had always wanted to use her powers in way that would make her an actual superhero. But what could you do with her power? It was like being part of a twin or triplet set. Nothing really special about that. Her own brother's power was teleportation. He had used that to become a courier. Not much thinking outside of the box as far as Janice was concerned. If she had that power, she would be using it to teleport every IED off of every battlefield and rescue people from earthquake rubble. Proper superhero stuff. But, no, she was stuck with a judge-y reflection.

""I think we should split up again,"" said the Reflection. 

""Oh, no,"" said Janice as she spat out the toothpaste. ""Last time I let you roam about in the real world, you ran away. Took me two months to find you. Do you know what happens when you are away? I lose that aspect of myself. Whatever you manifest as, that part of me goes. You manifested as kindness and patience. Sure, you ran off to join a convent that works with homeless shelters but do you know what happened to me? I almost landed in jail because I couldn't care less about who I hurt. I burned so many bridges because of you. You made me become a psychopath!""

""You are a psychopath!"" Look at you! You need help. You are in denial. This drinking all night and sleeping through the day is going to get you an early grave. It's going to get *us* an early grave.""

""Oh, my god, is this an intervention? Is my own psyche giving me an intervention?""

""You need one, Janice. You do. Or else....""

Janice narrowed her eyes. ""Or else, what?""

""You'll never see your reflection, me, again. I will always be on the outskirts of every mirror. People will wonder if you are a vampire. If that is your superpower.""

""Vampires aren't a superpower.""

""Stop changing the subject. I am serious. You need rehab.""

""I need an ibuprofen."" Janice opened the medicine cabinet door, took out a pill bottle and closed it. 

Her Reflection showed up again. This time her hands were on her hips and she was thin lipped with anger. 

""I mean it, Janice. I'll leave.""

Janice opened the bottle, shook out two pills and dry swallowed them. She smiled at her Reflection. ""Maybe I don't want to see you for a while. Good riddance.""

The Reflection gasped. Her eyes became wet with tears but she screwed up her face before she started to cry. She turned her back to Janice. ""I try so hard with you.""

""Yeah, yeah, yeah,"" Janice mumbled as she flipped the switch, killing the lights and making her Reflection vanish. ""Tell it to the Marines.""

With that, she walked out of the bathroom and headed back to the living room with the plan to see if any of the liquor bottles still had anything left. ",inksmudgedhands

"[WP] You walk into the bathroom, turn on the light and look in the mirror...your reflection isn't there.",Cat_Dastard,"Mornings were routine. Every day without fail, Marcello would follow his schedule exactly as he did the day before.

Wake up, stretch, yawn for ten minutes straight, tiptoe through his aunt and uncle's house because god forbid so much as a gnat made a peep before seven am. Staying with them had its perks, but by the power of whatever diety would listen, it sure as hell came with its challenges as well. He'd made the mistake of opening his cousin's door instead of the bathroom when he first arrived, coming home later that evening to her burning his possessions in a makeshift firepit in the yard. R.I.P. Marvel themed pop vinyls. You will be missed.

Her brother he didn't worry about. Marcello was convinced he slightly younger boy could sleep through the loss of a god damn limb.

Eyes hazy with sleep, he teetered into the bathroom. Wits yet to be gathered, he haphazardly brushed his dark, shoulder-length hair away from his overwhelmingly freckled face. Reaching for his toothbrush, the sound of the water running had already ceased before he looked up.

At first he froze, expecting to find a dumbfounded expression with a toothbrush hanging from it's frothing lips. But no, there was nothing. He blinked, blinked, and blinked again before panic began to well in his chest. Brown eyes wide, he drew a hasty sleeve across his mouth, toothbrush clattering to the counter as he bolted from the bathroom. ""Erren!""

Barrelling into his cousin's door, avoiding a racket was the least of his concerns; Crossbones would have to suck it up and join Bucky Barnes in the firey pits of hell.

""Erren!"" Marcello screeched, digging his fingers into the arm of the slumbering blonde whilst shaking him vigorously. ""Motherfu- Erren! Wake up!""

A crisp slap startled a groan of protest from the figure. Pinching his brows, Erren began to roll over, but his taller, older cousin dragged his ass onto the floor.

Pale blue eyes widening as his body hit the floor with a thud, Erren leapt to his feet, swaying a moment before realizing it was his dork cousin standing in front of him and not his homicidal little sister. ""What is it, Helena?""

Exhasperation crossed Marcello's face. The one time they didn't have enough girls in drama club- whatever Erren said they both knew Marcello had been a kickass Helena. He didn't argue. ""Come with me."" He grabbed Erren's forearm, dragging him from the room.

Once in the bathroom, Marcello released his grip and gestured dramatically at the mirror, lips pressed into a thin line and eyes wide and expectant.

Erren merely yawned, flicking away the blonde curls obstructing his vision. Was that a piece of fuzz? Eyes crossing, he attempted and failed to pinch it before Marcello lost his patience.

""My reflection is gone!""

Erren scoffed. ""Don't be ridiculous, I didn't wish hard enough on that comet last night. He flinched as a hand collided with the back of his head. Glaring at Marcello, Erren turned his attention to the mirror. He paused, taking a moment to focus. There he very clearly was, and... Not bad he might add. But no Marcello.

Immediately, muffled oiutcries followed as Erren's hands whipped to grasp Marcello's face, prying his lips to the side. Sure enugh, his canines were suddenly sharper than yesterday. He wined and pulled back. Sharp enough to get knicked on, apparently. Frozen and eyes wide with mortification, Marcello waited for an explanation.

Slowly, laughter began to bubble Erren's lips. Gradually, it escalated until he was practically hyperventilating. ""You're a bloody vampire!"" He howled, tears of amusement welling in his eyes.

""Vampire!"" Marcello screeched. ""Me?! Ohh, nonono, no, I can't be a- no!"" His gaze grew distant. ""Erren, I don't even like bloody band-aids,"" he squeaked. His face fell further, Erren unable to catch his breath enough to reply. ""Erren! I can't be a vampire! No reflections, no garlic, no sun, no *crusifixes I can't avoid all of that Erren I'm Italian what the hell am I going to do!""*

""Don't bite me, first of all,"" Erren gasped with a trembling voice. ""That's not my kink.""

Marcello was barely able to muster a glare. *""Fuck...* You..."" The last word trailed off as his consciousness failed him and he slumped to the ground.

Erren merely raised a brow. ""What did I literally just sa-"" Sighing, he turned to wander back to his room. ""Forget it.""",BlooperBoo

The breath got caught in my throat and I stood there, jaw ajar, staring in shock and terror for a good 6 seconds. 

""Oh no,"" I breathed out. ""Not again."" I begin to freak out at this point. ""This doesn't make any sense. I already went through my third phase!"" I reach out and press the pads of my fingers to the glass, though no reflection does it back. ""This can't be happening!"" 

A million things begin to run through my mind. All of the signs that I already been through before. The headaches that turn into migraines, sleep talking to sleep walking, losing hours to losing days of memory. I thought I had just caught a bug, it had never even crossed my mind that I was phasing again, because I shouldn't be. 

Phasers go through 3 phases, or 3 lives. We are taught to be good during the first two so we can live the best life during the third. In the third is when most people decide to commit to their dream job and it's easy, because they had already worked up the skill in experience in the first two. It's easier to find your soul mate because you had probably already met them in at least one of the other two lives, or you at least learn what kind of person you're into and get along with best. You can get a great job, marry, and settle down and live a normal life during the third, and what's supposed to be the final, phase. I had done just this.

My wife! I begin to frantically look around. How am I supposed to explain this? Oh, no. My heart sinks. The kids... 

I run over to the desk and immediately pull up a notepad, so with my handwriting my Marie will know it was really me and that some kidnapper didn't leave a fake note in a word document on the computer. I write as fast as I can before I can't anymore. I try my best to explain but... I just.. don't even know how to describe this. 

They won't make it without me. I had easily climbed the corporate ladder and was the main bread winner. She'd have to sell one of the cars, downsize, and eventually dip into savings. 

""Oh shit,"" I pause writing and look up at the empty wall. ""The money."" In mid sentence of my note I begin to jot down instructions, even going as far as putting the coordinates to my real fortune. Ol' Bobby may have been onto something. 

Bobby was one of the... shadier phasers. He had told me to go against pretty much everything we were taught. He told me to rob banks during the first two. Steal, mooch, lie, cheat, kill. Anything to gain an obscene amount of, well, anything really. Most people chose money. While I didn't do the illegal, immoral things like he a plenty others did, I did hoard a ridiculous amount of money and I put it in a very well hidden place. 

I couldn't explain to my wife why or how I was disappearing, but I could least make sure she and the kids were comfortable after my departure. I write out the instructions carefully and make sure to stress how sorry I am and how much I love her. Before I feel as though I'm finished with my message, the pen slowly fall out of my hand and I can no longer write anymore. My heart begins to race.

I muster up as much strength as I can and I fish my phone out of my pocket. Just before it slips through my 'fingers' I place it between my shoulder and ear. I should have enough time with it there.

""Hello?"" He answers. Praise.

""Brody!"" I shout. 

""John?""

""Brody! What the fuck!?"" I know Bordy is one of our elders, and we should never speak to one in such a manner but, what the fuck!?

""What's wrong!?""

""It's happening again! I'm phasing! I'm phasing out again!""

""Joh-... John.. y-you're a fourther?""

""Well, I guess fucking so! Help! Help me Brody please!"" I'm literally on my knees at this point, even though he isn't there to see. This isn't supposed to be happening! It's only supposed to be three times! I feel like I'm gunna throw up.

""John, listen buddy....""

""Why is this happening? Did I do something wrong?"" I'm impressed I held it together long enough to write the note, but now I'm losing it. I just can't keep it together at this point. ""What happens next, Brody? They never teach us what happens to fourthers. What happens? Please, please tell me!"" Theres a long pause. As I begin to witness my shadow fading away, I begin to freak out a little more. ""Please! I don't have much time left! My wife! My babies! Brody, please!""

""John."" He says suddenly. ""I... I mean, well. To keep it blunt. The reason we never say what happens to fourthers after they phase out again is because well... we have no idea what happens, John. We don't know.""

I stop blinking, I stop breathing, my heart stops, even. What. What? What!? 

""What do you mean... you don't.... know?"" My voice shakes.

""We just don't know, John. I'm sorry.""

I lose my shit after this. I begin screaming and yelling at him. Saying all sorts of things. Saying goodbye to my kids, professing my love to my wife. While doing so, the phone drops to the floor, the sound of my voice gets quieter and quieter, and my shadow slowly fades away. Just like I do.

""....Hello?....John?.... John are you there?.... I'm sorry.""

The kicker, your fingerprints open all of the doors as administrator.",DeniabeSumo,"There was nothing I could remember about this place, no matter how hard I racked my brain. Why then, did I find it so familiar? Dragging my hand along the cold grey walls, I felt as though I had been here before. Even stranger, this place acknowledged me as ""Administrator"".

Rounding the corner, I made my way into a brightly lit room. Hundreds of cylindrical tanks formed perfect rows wall to wall. Inside each one, bobbing up and down as though it had been undisturbed for years, was a small fetus, being kept alive by some sort of life support. I stopped to glance at one of them, and noticed something on its leg. A birthmark, just like mine. Walking down the rows and checking each one, I realized that they all had this birthmark.

A door beckoned to me at the other end of the room. I couldn't help but scan my thumb, and slowly, it revealed a device obviously fashioned to be fixed around one's head. On the floor in front of it was a note. The note read:

""Hello Dave. You may be wondering what this place is, and why you seem to be connected to it. I have written this letter to remind you.

You now have the power to form any kind of bladed weapon from your wrist. Inspiration from adventure time.,DeniabeSumo,"Trudging through the desert was hard work, but he had a goal in mind. Determination filled each step. His legs were hot rubber and his lungs burning, but soon it would be over. 

A week ago he had given up the comforts of civilization and set out into the hot ocean alone. The soft sand enveloped his feet at each step and gave way underfoot as he pushed off against it. Traveling this way was slow and difficult. But, the thought of bringing a camel with him was repulsive. Camels were fine, and exceedingly useful in the desert, he just couldn't do that to another living creature.

In the midst of nothing he saw everything he'd been searching for. Cresting an immense dune brought him in sight of a small cave.

Rekindled passion for the journey dulled the fire in his thighs and took the edge off his exhaustion. But, he didn't quicken his pace. He wanted to let every stage of the journey be exactly what it was.
Slowly the cave increased in size. Slowly his mind found peace.

Finally at the mouth of the small hole in the rock, he felt a cool breeze issuing from the darkness. A small confirmation that he was on the right path.

He didn't have much with him, but dropped everything at the entrance. He found the cave didn't have branching paths or hidden predators. It was exactly as he imagined it.

As he walked into the cave he held out his hand, feeling the rough stone on his fingertips. He cried out in pain, disturbing the tomb-like silence of the cave as a small, sharp rock jutting out of the wall cut his hand. He looked at the bleeding would on his palm, then at the stone that cut him. 

He blinked in disbelief, the rock was moving, rippling like a pond disturbed by a leaf. As he stared at the impossibly liquid wall, then felt heat build in his fingertips and slowly work its way up to his elbow. The blood from his hand was spreading over his skin, down and around his fingers and wrist, spreading in tandem with the heat. Relief came suddenly as the last drops of blood were hardening into stone before his eyes. His arm below the elbow now had the appearance of sandstone. 

The terror of the moment was replaced by how short of a time it would be with him, a thought that calmed his mind. He took a few deep breaths and remembered his purpose. As he refocused on why he was there, his mind went to the knife he'd brought. In the same moment his fingertips were burning again, but more than that, there was increasing pressure. He held up his hand and watched in horror as his hand was changed into the exact shape of the curved knife in his waistband.

Immensely curious, he tested the strength of the blade against a stone near his feet. It cut the stone cleanly in two without pain. As he looked at the smooth face of the split rock he saw in his mind a new future. He had a choice to make.

He could follow his plan and kill himself in this desert tomb.

Or, maybe this new development had given him a purpose again.

[WP] You live in a video game. You are not the main character.,Epicritical,"My husband barged into our little cottage, his forehead dotted with perspiration, and hurried into our bedroom. I put the lid back on the pot, wiped my hands on my apron and went to see what he was up to.

He was shoving clothes into a bag. The mattress had been overturned, and our meager savings hidden underneath was gone.

""What're you doing?"" I said.

""I don't have time to explain,"" he said. ""Look, I need you to go pack some food—it might be a long trip, so get—""

""You're not making sense,"" I said.

He turned, placing his hands on my shoulders, and looked into my eyes with his own fearful ones. ""Our lives are in danger.""

""Fo' shizzle?"" I whispered.

He nodded. ""Get packing. You'll understand when we're on the road.""

I pulled the apron over my head and tossed it aside as I rushed to the kitchen. Apart from a few strips of dried meat and an onion, there wasn't much. Perhaps we could buy some bread from the town baker before we left.

While I was wrapping the meat in leather, my husband came into the living room, empty-handed. Hearing the creak of the floorboards under his feet, I turned to see him standing by the dining table with a dagger in his hand.

He was facing the door when he said, “Bitch’s coming.”

To my horror, I began putting all our rations back into the cupboards, my body moving of their own volition. That done, I went back to the pot and began stirring the soup again. The peppery scent made my eyes water, but I couldn’t even will my hands to wipe away the tears.

“What’s going on, bae?” I said.

Our cottage shook as a mighty blow slammed into our door and knocked it clean off its hinges. In strode a seven-foot-tall, golden-haired woman wielding a hammer-ax. Her piercing, ice-blue eyes scanned our home before settling on my husband.

“I’ve come for you, thief!” she cried.

*Thief?* I thought. *What the devil is she talking about?* I tried to ask, but my mouth remained resolutely shut.

“Begone, vile woman!” my husband retorted. “An outlander holds no authority in Pillemont!”

*Pillemont? I thought we lived in Gravemeadow? And since when did my husband speak like that?*

“So says the thief,” the woman said. “Why did you do it?”

*Naichim’s a thief? He would never do such a thing!*

“I’m not a thief!” my husband said. “Where is your proof?”

“I witnessed your act personally!”

Naichim scoffed. “That is no proof at all. Leave, before I call the guards!”

The woman abruptly turned away and began opening our cupboards one by one. I watched her from the corner of my eye as I continued stirring the stupid soup. *Damn, why can’t I move?* I tried to whisper to Naichim, but he wasn’t looking my way. He wasn’t even looking at the woman.

She came to my side and said, “Your husband is a thief. Have you noticed any unusual behavior from him recently?”

*No, of course not,* I thought. But I said, “He did come home in a hurry …”

*What the frickin’ bananas? Why did I say that?*

She nodded and began searching the shelves. When she found the dried meat, she promptly stuffed them into her waist pouch.

*Thief!*

Going back to my husband, she said, “I’ve come for you, thief!”

“Begone, vile woman!” my husband retorted. “An outlander holds no authority in Pillemont!”

“So says the thief. Why did you do it?”

“I’m not a thief! Where is your proof?”

She took a bloodied feather out of her pouch. “This is proof, right here. Found on your doorstep.”

My husband laughed. “Borys sent you, didn’t he? Oh, how he must have wailed when his prized rooster was gone. Too bad, I’ve eaten the cursed bird and you’ll have to cut it out of me!”

*You did what, Naichim? Oh God, I’m so confused!*

“You have a choice to make, thief.” She raised her weapon. “Either come quietly, or die.”

*I’m sure the magistrate will sort this misunderstanding out,* I pleaded telepathically to him. *Just go with her!*

“I’ll gut you like a fish!” he yelled.

*She’s a foot taller than you!* I thought, but could only watch helplessly as he took a swing at her. The feeble blow glanced off her armor, and then she caved in his skull with a single strike of her hammer.

“Murderer,” I yelled, grabbing a knife. *No … what now?* “Thief he may have been, but I’ll avenge my husband!” *I don’t want to avenge him!*

My skirts swished as I charged at her, and she promptly chopped me into two with the ax. As I lay on the ground, bleeding, consciousness fading, I thought I heard a disembodied laugh coming from the heavens while the woman ransacked our bedroom.

[WP] You live in a video game. You are not the main character.,Epicritical,"I watched as the hero walked forth through the kingdom for the hundredth time. Everyone stood around him and cheered as he brandished his blood-covered sword tightly. 

I looked down at my sword and looked back at the hero. 

""What does he have that I don't?"" I asked myself out loud. 

""A bigger sword, my boy."" A voice said behind me. 

I snapped around, lifting the sword into a readied position. But I was not expecting what I actually saw. It was in the shape of a man, but he seemed to be flickering. His face coming in and out of view, different colored squares danced across his face. 

""What are you beast?"" I said sharply. 

""Something I couldn't explain to you even if I wanted to, it would ruin your very existence."" He said, his voice was cutting in and out. 

""What do you mean?"" I said, confused.

""I am a mistake in your virtual reality that somebody else has created for you."" It said, it was no longer a man to my eyes. 

""What is happening?"" I said, my mind started to slip. 

""I told you too much."" It said, ""Goodbye."" 

Suddenly, it disappeared into thin air. Everything around me started to go haywire. Everything looked like the thing did, boxes of color danced around me. But then everything stopped, time had paused around me. 

I dropped to my knees and started to look around. That's when I noticed that it was only the hero and I in the town. His back was turned to me, one of his fists was raised high in the air, as if claiming victory over something. But I quickly noticed that he wasn't moving at all. He was frozen too. 

Before I could react, I suddenly appeared directly behind him. Then everything went back to normal, the world around me was normal again. But something still didn't feel right, my hands felt like they weren't there. I looked around frantically and saw the being I had seen a few minutes earlier. It was waving a barely visible hand at me. I looked back towards the hero and felt my arms cock back with the sword in my hands. I watched in horror as my sword started swinging towards the hero. I watched the blade pass through his flesh, and his head started to fall towards the ground. 

I watched it fall as if time slowed down once more, but once it hit. Everything around me went black, even my thoughts.

He stumbles backward before swinging his heavy sword toward me. I consider running away, but I would live in endless shame if I were to retreat from a fight. I take a few steps back.

"[WP] You are a powerful Lich living in a midevial world. Instead of using your necromantic powers for evil, you decide to try your best to improve peoples quality of life",FaustClarke,"(Continuation of the continuation. Hope you enjoy it!)

With a wordless command, both armies charged forward, breaching the gap between them. Steel and silver clashed against armor, pierced skin, broke bones, and elicited cries of battle.

The good thing about the undead was their durability. A warhammer crashed through the torso of a skeleton near Baretheon, and the skeleton's arms broke free and grabbed onto the opposing soldier's unarmored heels, stabbing sharp bones into the skin. The soldier doubled back and fell over, upon which three corpses pounced him and began mauling him.

On the hill, Baretheon's necromancer's hands pulsed with purple-black light, waving their hands in arcane motions. Baretheon's army pulsed and moved as one unit; for each undead that fell in battle, three more jumped on the offending soldier just as quickly, rending armor and flesh with quick movements.

Baretheon stepped over a mangled corpse of one of Tyriall's soldiers, whipping his spear around his body to pierce a soldier through the chest. Stepping quickly, he pressed his body against the soldiers, blocking an arrow coming for him with the soldier's plate mail. Baretheon released his grip on the deceased soldier's body, leaping into the air and tossing his spear at the archer who tried to shoot him. The spear pierced the soldier against the earth, who gasped and struggled for breath as Baretheon pulled his spear from soldier's chest. Baretheon stepped over the dying soldier, stabbing his spear outward in fluid movements, dodging sword strokes and arrows with ease. The call of battle had not left him in his many years of peace.

Up ahead, Emperor Tyriall swung his spear out horizontally, knocking several undead backwards into the earth. Using the spear tip, he pulled the bodies apart until there was no way the corpse could move. Baretheon noted that the limits of his reanimation spell had lessened over the course of the battle, indicating he had lost a fair number of soldiers.

He could expend magic to pull the corpses back together and back into the fight, but it would require concentration. He would leave that to his necromancers. Stepping quickly, he met Emperor Tyriall's spear with his own. He pushed upward, knocking Tyriall off balance. As he went to stab Tyriall in the chest and run him through, one of Tyriall's soldiers swung at him with a sword, forcing Baretheon to block and decapitate him.

""Get the Lich!!"" Tyriall shouted, panicked. Baretheon made a move for him again, but was met by the bodies of seven of Tyriall's soldiers blocking him. Baretheon made deft movements with his spear, dodging their strikes and running them through, but when he had finished with them, Tyriall was nowhere to be found.

""Ready the catapults!!"" Baretheon heard Tyriall shout. Tyriall and his army were retreating up the hill.

Of course. Tyriall had chosen this location, because up high on the hill it was impossible to see any ballista that might be hiding there. The battle was a trap.

Wordlessly, Baretheon and his soldiers turned, making their way back to the thicket. There was the sound of strained wood pulling against a massive weight, and the whistling of boulders flying through the air. Then crushing and breaking, and an impossibly loud thud, as boulders slammed into the earth and crushed Baretheon's undead soldiers. After the initial wave, only a handful of undead stood with Baretheon. The others had either been torn apart in the initial battle or had been crushed under boulders.

There was no other choice. Baretheon would give himself up, in exchange for the protection of his people. Perhaps he could convince Tyriall that no others knew necromancy in his lands.

Baretheon made a mad dash back across the valley, towards Emperor Tyriall. Tyriall's soldiers were readying the catapults for a second wave by the time he had climbed to the top.

""Emperor Tyriall,"" Baretheon began, and then dropped his spear. ""I surrender. End me if you wish. I am the source of necromancy in these lands, destroying me will end this vile plague as you call it.""

Emperor Tyriall stood across from Baretheon. In the retreat, Tyriall had been wounded on his left arm, and it was clear by the way he gritted his teeth that he had never been injured before. ""Nonsense! I came to destroy you, and avenge those taken into slavery, and the women you and your soldiers raped in your life!""

Baretheon paused. ""The soldiers that fought with me this day are the undead corpses of those who raided your lands all those years ago. And as for me, you may kill me, but I make one request. That you protect the people in my lands as if they were your own. They have already suffered under one tyrant's rule, please don't make it another.""

Tyriall weighed his options. There was hate in his eyes, the same hate that Baretheon had had pointed at him throughout his entire former life. But there was confusion there, too.

""Why do you care about the people in your lands so much? Aren't they all dead?""

""No. The corpses I animate help them with their crops and their livelihood. I wanted to make a better life for my people. I wanted to amend my mistakes in life. I don't want to be a creature of hate.""

""But you're a Lich! You are an evil and vile thing."" Though he said the words, Tyriall was conflicted. Baretheon noted the soldiers surrounding him, arrows pointed at his chest. He also noted Tyriall's youth.

""Emperor Tyriall, you are young. Your whole life is ahead of you. If you let me and my people live, I promise that should anyone come against you, you shall have a powerful ally. If you do decide to end me today, all I ask is the protection of my people in return. They have done nothing wrong.""

Baretheon stood silently as Tyriall battled with himself over the correct decision. He suddenly unsheathed a knife from his belt, stepping forward quickly, and holding it against Baretheon's neck. He gritted his teeth in anger, then abruptly dropped the knife.

""Return to your lands. We will arrange a peace treaty. But until then, I better not see any undead on the edge of my land, do you hear me Lord Baretheon?""

Baretheon nodded, and his jaw arranged itself in what could be seen as a smile. ""Yes, Emperor. I agree to these terms. We have no more qualm with you on this day.""

Baretheon turned, and began walking down the hill. He regretted the lives of Emperor Tyriall's men that he had taken, but it was a small price to pay for the overall safety of both kingdoms. He hoped that with continued work and time that he would be able to undo all the terrible things he had done in his previous life. 

As he approached the edge of the thicket, his necromancers were cheering ""long live Lord Baretheon!""

"[WP] You are a powerful Lich living in a midevial world. Instead of using your necromantic powers for evil, you decide to try your best to improve peoples quality of life",FaustClarke,"Thank you! A continuation of the story under the line break. Thought I'd go into third-person this time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The undead Lich-Lord Baretheon approached the edge of the thicket, his army of skeletons and corpses trudging slowly behind him. They had been outfitted with the best steel and silver that the town's blacksmith could provide, in sword, spear, and arrow. On such short notice, not all of Baretheon's soldiers could be outfitted. Many of them were weaponless.

Baretheon himself had donned the plate armor he had worn in his life. It had been fitted to his body, as undeath had a way of making you lose some muscle mass. In his right hand, he held his black spear, Dertod, a weapon that had been responsible for many a death in his previous life.

As he crossed through the bramble, he and his army came to edge of a large field, approximately 300 yards in length. On the opposite edge of the field, Emperor Tyriall was approaching with his army from the neighboring kingdom.

The army was far larger than anything Baretheon could put together. Baretheon was expending every last bit of his reanimation magics to keep his entire army moving, but Tyriall's army outnumbered each of his corpses five-to-one. And although his skeletons were decent fighers, they were outmatched and outmanned.

Emperor Tyriall was aiming to wipe Baretheon and his people from the face of the earth.

""Lord Baretheon?"" Baretheon turned around, looking around in the dark thicket to locate the voice. As he was searching, ten or so faces appeared from the mass of corpses and skeletons. Each of them had color to their face, and moved consciously in a manner that wasn't animated. These ten people were alive.

""I told each of you to remain at the keep. Emperor Tyriall's army is much larger than mine, but perhaps I can divert them away if I can make him believe that everyone in our land is undead and he destroyed them all.""

""Lord Baretheon, you know that won't work,"" a man replied. It was one of Baretheon's most trusted advisors, Josef. Baretheon had begun training Josef over sixty years ago, and now he was an accomplished necromancer, able to animate and control five dozen undead at a time.

""We are here to help. Perhaps we can sway Emperor Tyriall?"" a female voice spoke this time. Kristin, another of his advisors.

""I don't want to risk your lives. I'm the one responsible for your lives and safety. My eternal life matters little in comparison to your mortality. Please, let me handle this.""

""You will be killed and destroyed. They will come for us. They view us as a plague, you said so yourself."" Josef's voice was calm and even.

""We refuse to abandon you, m'lord. Please accept our assistance.""

""...On one condition. You avoid the front lines. Stay on the hill and manage combat from there.""

His subjects nodded in agreement, and stepped out next to him on the hill. Emperor Tyriall's army was fast approaching. A scout on horseback broke away from the other soldiers, dashing towards them quickly. As the scout approached, Baretheon could make out a scrap of paper held in his hand. A message.

""I'm sure terms of surrender for us,"" Baretheon murmured. Josef nodded. Kristin planted her feet firmly against the earth.

The messenger stopped short a hundred feet or so away from them, he and his horse wearing the same fearful expression on their faces. ""Y-y-you--"" the messenger stuttered, then he dropped the paper from his hand, and turned his horse around, dashing back faster than he had come.

Baretheon had one of the corpses walk forward and retrieve the paper. The corpse returned to him, handing the paper over to him. Baretheon unfolded it, and immediately recognized Emperor Tyriall's fanciful script. 

""Lord Baretheon,"" the letter read, ""it is a pleasure to have this opportunity to destroy you presented to me. In your former life, you crushed and subjugated many of our outlying provinces, taking in the men as slaves, your soldiers raping our women. You launched our lands into a sixty year famine that did not end until I took the throne. I am willing to do whatever it takes, unlike my father. And on this day, I will avenge my people by wiping you and your blight from the land. There are no terms of surrender. Fight to the death.""

Baretheon crumpled up the parchment and tossed it over his shoulder. It landed in the dirt, and one of his advisors stomped it flat.

""We must fight. Let's go."" Baretheon began walking quickly, the undead legion of soldiers falling in line behind him. Purple-black light pulsed in the palms of his human necromancers, and they began using their magics to animate the undead in a more focused manner.

The hill sloped downward into a valley that was entirely rich, black soil. Many an army had fought here, and today would be no different. Emperor Tyriall walked in front of his army, in glistening silver armor. He also brandished a spear, although his was silver.

""Lord Baretheon,"" Emperor Tyriall called from across the valley. ""I am amazed you actually showed, I was worried you were merely animating an army to distract me.""

""Emperor Tyriall,"" Baretheon nodded, and then he dropped down to one knee. ""if it pleases you, m'lord, I would offer my apologies for my past actions. I am prepared to pay reparations to your lands. We have many crops that are cultivated, and our cities and townships are rich with art and music.""

Emperor Tyriall sneered at Baretheon's words and subservience. ""No, I refuse. I came here for one thing, and one thing only. I am here to avenge my people. And the only way I can do that is by destroying you.""

Baretheon stood, gripping his spear tightly in his hand. ""So be it.""

[WP] A normal man falls in love with a super heroine and masquerades as a villain just to get a chance to meet her.,MinoSpelgud,"Sheff was just a normal man. If you call normal dressing up as the evil villain destroy the city so the heroine he loves could come stop him.

Smashing the windows of cars and torching trash cans near a grocery store was how he had begun his Friday.

With each swing of his bat smashing in a car he began to day dream. Day dream of a time he first saw the dashing lady. Love at first sight.

He was on his way to work on his bike. When suddenly commotion broke out and the menacing villain Surge busted out of the walls from the bank. 

Chunks of the wall hit Sheff, sending him flying in front of an approaching truck.

Sheff accepted he was dead being rendered  immobile from the sudden impact of the wall, but just as he was sure it hit him, he was in the arms of the heroine. 

He gazed at her beautifully perfect face as she cradled him in her arms. Her outfit revealed her stunning body. She had a golden aura of goodness and right,  causing Sheffs heart to melt.

She set him down in the sidewalk oh so gently and smiled right into his eyes.

She took off to put an end to Surge and his evil doings.

But for Sheff was a beginning. He was in love. Madly in love.

The heroine flew down from the sky as Sheff set another trashcan ablaze.

""Your days of destruction are over."" She said with her silky soft voice. 

It was candy to Sheff's ears. His body grew numb and warm. He lost all strength as she walked toward him. His bat slipped right out of his hands. He walked toward her, arms open. He wanted her in his arms. More than anything in the world.

As he nearly got what he desperately needed she subdued him. Taking him down with one graceful sweep of the legs. She cuffed him and took him to the police.

Sheff sat in his cell. Her beautiful face. Perfect body. Godly glow. Poetic voice. Loving eyes.

Everything.

He wanted her. But what she didn't know was this mans unknown love for her births the greatest nightmare of them all.

Births a devious villain she will have to fight for years to come.

A villain who's life's  purpose is to toy with the souls of the people she protects just to get her attention.

I was being mugged, and then suddenly, she swooped down from the sky, a-and then punch-KICK! Both the guys were down. She helped me to my feet, and took off into the night sky.""

""What did she look like?""

""She was incredibly beautiful. Long red hair, white tights with red stripes along the sides. Called herself Dynagal.""

""Dynagal, huh? Well, thank god she was there. Could've ended up a lot worse for you.""

""Mm."" Jerry Rhoades nodded, nursing his drink at the bar. He was a short and lanky man, which made him an easy target. He had been on his way here when the muggers cornered him in a dark alley, and asked for his wallet. One of them had a knife. They were closing in on him when his heroine, Dynagal flew down from the sky and fell them quickly.

""All these supes flying around our city make me feel safe. Nice to have one with tits flying around, too."" Jerry's buddy, Daniel Kritzer said, then laughed as he took another sip of his beer. Daniel was a tall and bulky man with short black hair spiked upward.

""Man, don't talk about her like that,"" Jerry replied, indignant. Daniel turned to him, his brow furrowed.

""Do you have a crush on her or something?"" It was an accusation, not a question. Jerry shrugged. ""She saved my life. I feel like I should get the chance to meet her, or to thank her.""

""Dude, it's impossible to know who she is, out of everyone in this city. What're you gonna do, get mugged again?""

The conversation fell flat, and both men nursed their drinks, lost in thought. On the TV above the bar, a basketball game was playing. Jerry didn't know who was playing.

Then Jerry had an epiphany. Maybe he couldn't get into trouble, but maybe he could *cause* trouble. If he pretended to be a villain, maybe Dynagal would come to ""stop"" him and he could get the chance to thank her?

He reached into his pocket and produced a ten dollar bill to pay for his single drink, then stood from the bar. Daniel looked up at him curiously, watching him leave.

""Hey man, where you going?"" Daniel asked. ""To meet Dynagal!"" Jerry called. Daniel grumbled under his breath, tossing another ten dollar bill on the bar for his own drink, following his friend outside.

""What's your plan here? Do you have a signal of some kind?"" Daniel asked. Jerry turned around to face him, smiling. ""Perfect, you're here. Okay, so the plan is to go on top of that building and--""

""Woah, woah, Jerry, slow down. How'd you get to this point? Explain it to me, slowly, so I can understand.""

Jerry sighed. ""I'm going to pretend to kidnap you, and when Dynagal shows up, I'll get to thank her.""

""O-okay, I guess, but why do we have to go up to the building's roof? Can't we just pretend down here.""

""Nope.""

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Half an hour passed, and Jerry had pulled some fraying and filthy clothes from a dumpster, pulling them over his body to look more villainous. He reeked. Daniel held his nose so he didn't have to smell his friend's stench. They had climbed up to the roof of a nearby apartment building through the fire escape, and the cool night air blew chilled air around them.

""Let's make this quick. It's freezing, dude,"" Daniel said. Jerry nodded, and Daniel dropped down to his knees, and Jerry grabbed him in a mock choke hold.

""Where's my money, pathetic human?"" Jerry shouted into the night. Daniel made sounds of struggling, but made no attempt to actually free himself from his friend's grip. They shouted and struggled like this for a long time, before there was a swooshing in the night air, and Dynagal dropped down onto the roof.

""Stop, don't hurt him anymore!"" she commanded. She began walking towards Jerry and Daniel, and Jerry released his grip. He immediately threw off the nasty cloth he pulled over his body, and wore a wide grin on his face.

""Dynagal! It's me, the guy you saved from the muggers earlier! I'm sorry I deceived you, but I wanted to thank you for earlier.""

Dynagal stopped short, her fist raised to prepare for a punch. Her brow twisted in anger and confusion. Daniel stood up, and awkwardly waved at her.

""That's what this is about? You want to thank me? You can thank me by not disturbing me in the future."" Her tone was harsh, and Jerry and Daniel were taken aback by it.

""Listen, lady, you saved his life, and he just wants to say thanks,"" Daniel said. Dyangal rolled her eyes. ""Listen boys, my time is valuable. While you're wasting my time here, someone could be robbed, like you nearly were earlier. Or a building could catch on fire. And if I'm here, discussing your emasculated manhood because a woman had to save you, then I can't be there saving their lives. Understand?""

Jerry was shocked. All he wanted was to thank her for her kindness, but she just viewed it as a duty. It didn't matter that it was him. It didn't matter *who* it was. She just did it because she could. Before he could respond, she took off into the night air for the second time that night, disappearing quickly.

""Look, I'm sorry dude."" Daniel crossed over to him, slapping him on the shoulder. Jerry sighed. ""It's okay. At least I got to thank her.""",Nayr1230

[RF] I did it all for them.,Nate_Parker,"Faith glanced towards him, a resigned smile on her lips. 

""You're letting a lot of gold slip away.""

Hilary Flint seemed to sink down behind the sandbag wall, head cradled in his helmet. It was if he'd just seen his boyhood dog get hit by a car. 

""I know...""

""Money than you'll likely ever see again.""

*""I knooowwwww....""*

Faith was unrelenting.

""And we're also probably gonna die very soon. A witch and a ranger had hardly expect to hold off an entire cohort of Salamanders.""

Flint shot her a look that a bear might a particularly persistent fly. ""Usually I'm the cynical one; why the change of attitude?""

Faith shrugged and reached into her satchel to pull out a slim scroll. Unrolling it she scanned its contents, refreshing her memory as to the correct instructions detailed. ""This... partnership of ours only works when one of us is the idealist and the other the cynic. Since you just threw away the offer of a lifetime of riches and luxuries for a few hundred refugees who owe you nothing, I figured I'd best return this pairing to its natural setting.""

Flint snorted at her words, but he did stand a little straighter.

""I hate it when you get a regal and haughty on me, you sound like a brat.""

""Well I'd rather by a stuck-up Elf than a mopey Man any day,"" Faith argued. ""... I agree with what you did by the way, even if I don't care for the likely results. I don't think I would have sacrificed myself for them even just a year ago.""

Flint worked the bolt of his rifle open, checking that it was loaded before slamming the bolt shut and flicking the safety on. ""Yeah well, that's growing up I guess. Either you become a better person or you don't. I'm just tired of having to do this same old shit; saving the day or holding the line against tall odds gets old after the first six times. I'm just wondering when someone else will do the heavy lifting.""

Flint had persuaded the fleeing refugees to abandoned their possessions they did not absolutely need to survive, and as a consequence stood behind a solid wall of hand carts, wagons and countless pieces of furniture. The narrow canyon was tight enough that eight horses abreast would have trouble riding down its length, its sides too steep and too treacherous to climb. Any advance would have to come straight down the devil's throat and towards their waiting guns. Bags of cornmeal formed firing steps whilst lengths of barbed wire that'd had previously corralled cattle crisscrossed the stretch of road in from the wall. Flint looked on at them with a faint amount of satisfaction. They'd managed to get the retreating farmers and craftsmen to contribute that much to the cause, as doomed as it was. 

The Salamanders were at least a half-day behind the tail-end of the fleeing refugees, their legions too large and too slow to make a quick pursuit. But they'd get there sooner or later, and Flint had never seen a forced march fail when led by a Salamander general. 

Faith nudged him out of his reverie, her eyes bemused. 

""Whatcha thinking?""

""Thinking how big of a fool I am,"" Flint lied. ""Thinking about how I would've spent that gold. God that was lot of gold...""",LovableCoward

She laughed, a chiming sound that caused a warmth to grow in his chest. It had taken a while, but after months of living in an apartment, the two had finally been able to purchase a house. At the moment, it was bare. It was old, dusty from years of nothing but silence. Honestly, they probably could've chosen a better, newer house. But there was something about this one, something that had drawn them in.

He placed his chin atop her head and let his eyes rest, a slow grin making its way onto his face. ""This is it, Daphne. This is home.""

And indeed, she had never felt more at home than in this bare, empty house with no one besides her but the one she loved.

&amp;nbsp;

It was the first time Lazarus had ever been to bingo night. The room around him was filled with blank stares and wrinkled old prunes, a few of which were already asleep on the tables. It stank of alcohol and ink, and stampers littered the ground. He was right at home muttering to himself.

&amp;nbsp;

""Absolutely marvelous. Flawless. Brilliant!"" he whispered to himself, smiling at his untouched bingo card. The woman across from him gave him a peculiar look, before shifting her sagging breasts and resting them on the table. She adjusted her spectacles in a similar fashion.

&amp;nbsp;

""G-53? I said, I say, G-53?""

&amp;nbsp;

""BINGO!""

&amp;nbsp;

The woman across from Lazarus stood up, pulling her shirt down over her stomach and waving her card with pride. Not a second afterwards, another cry of BINGO was heard at the back of the room. Then another, and another. In rapid succession, the vapid stares of the elderly became hot and lusty, their grubby hands squeezing in anticipation of the grand prize. Soon, however, their greed melted into confusion, as the entire room was now waving their cards and moving towards the front of the room.

&amp;nbsp;

It didn't take long for the fight to break out. Lazarus giggled with glee as dentures flew and overalls tore. He waited outside for the police to arrive, knowing quite well the trap they were falling into.

&amp;nbsp;

------

&amp;nbsp;

The date was June 30th. Lazarus was sitting in the park by the local church as he did every day, wearing a blue flannel shirt not unlike a policeman's uniform. The pigeons flocked to him, knowing they would be well fed. Most days, Lazarus broke off small pieces of bread, feeding them all until they eventually dispersed. He smiled every time he was finished, it always gave him a small pleasure to watch as the birds flew away, having had their fill. But today was different. Today, he didn't feed the birds.

&amp;nbsp;

He sauntered towards the church at a slow pace, watching as the setting sun danced with the low, rolling hills on the horizon. It was no matter if he was late, he had no intention of playing.

&amp;nbsp;

------

&amp;nbsp;

The police arrived on scene shortly after, responding to what was no doubt one of the strangest 9-1-1 calls they had ever received. Lazarus was waiting. He watched in anticipation as the chief opened the door of his patrol car. At first it was only one, a curious pigeon who swooped low over the chief's head. Lazarus pulled two slices of bread out of his back pocket, throwing them on the ground by the chief.

&amp;nbsp;

Hordes of crows and pigeons and select few other birds descended upon the chief, mingling with the eldery violence which had spread into the streets in front of the church. Seeing his opportunity, Lazarus ran headlong for the cheif's car, jumping into the driver seat and gunning the engine. He laughed maniacally, leaving the wretched scene. Now that the police were taken care of, there was nothing he couldn't do...",oth_radar
"[WP] ""You know if you kill me, I'll just come back again. You Will Not Win.""",Rage_Engage,"Joyce the Defender swung his great-sword mightily above his head and then rapidly downward. The demon managed to move its head to avoid the blow, but its arms was not so lucky, and the monumental blade cleaved through its shoulder, Before the wretched creature could react, Joyce planted his armored foot square the demon's chest, sending it flying a few feet, and crashing into the ground. Joyce walked over, and taking a deep breath, grabbed the hilt of his sword with both hands and drove it downward through the midsection and into the dirt.

He stood over his fallen adversary. His blue and gold armor was scraped, dented, and bloody. His helm fell discarded, shattered by the force of a hammerblow, the Mauralian Glass saving his life once again. Joyce was applying pressure to a wound in his midsection, where one of his enemy's daggers had found its mark.

Below Joyce, his enemy fared much worse. It had a mere two arms left, made alarming by the fact that this creature normally had four. Its right arms had been cleaved off by the very sword that was now impaled in its stomach. One of its two legs was mangled by a crushing kick to the knee. The demon would not be moving, partly because of its injuries.

The creature spoke with a raspy voice:

""If you kill me, I return. You cannot win, your victories are insignificant and pyrrhic. You can sever my head, you can hack my limbs away, you can burn my flesh and bones to a sinewy cinder, but next moon, I will return. I will return and we shall fight like we have tonight. We shall fight until one of us lie here broken and bleeding, until Catharax is pleased. For the past hundred nights it has been my corpse on the ground, but soon it will be you defeated, for I, I return.""

The demon started to laugh, when Joyce spat in its face and drove his shield perpendicularly into its head, ending the laugh, and the persistent wheezing from what Joyce could only presume were lungs.

[WP] Due to overpopulation humans start to abandon their new-born children in the wilderness. Somehow a lot of these children survive. A decade later they have become an own tribe. Because of the lack of adult guidance and parenting their culture is a lot different to ours.,ThatGuyBobo,"My wife Jen and I always had problems when it came to the whole ‘Population Act of 2027.’ We never respected the idea of tossing your new born child that WASN’T registered to survive into the wild just because the world was scared that over-population was such a prominent cause of the end of the world. The Governments of the world were allowed to decide which child lived, but what about ours? 

I wasn’t rich enough to decide the fate, we’re classified as ‘Upper middle class’ and we don’t even have that privilege. So when Jen and I found out that we were having our daughter… well, we had to succumb to the policies whim.

In the hospital Jen gave birth at was one in southern Illinois, and as soon as they checked the database for my name to see if I was on the ‘list’ of deciding the fate of my child, that was when she attacked. My wife shot up from the bed, screaming at the nurse to ‘Give her my baby back!’ as I moved to hold her down. Tears streamed down her face, I attempted to calm her… and the nurse, whom was ready to issue the security to come and take her away, shook her head and apologized. 

I held my love for hours, as she cried into my arms and asked why it had to be us, why had fate been so cruel. 

But, time goes on, and that last we saw of our little baby girl was in the back of the truck with the other ‘poor’ families. Armed guards staring at us with their assault rifles as we were forced to watch every child get put into the truck, one by one. We were given the rights of saying our goodbyes. The doctors that gave birth would give the families the child with another apology before taking them back, usually by force, and putting them in the warm crib to meet their horrible demise.

Me and Jen stared over at the scruffy Middle Eastern man that approached us from the Hospital doors with our little girl. We would know her anywhere. A lovely head of hair at only a few days old, beautiful green eyes, she would be such an amazing actor, or maybe a politician to change the world for the better. But we would never know. He walked up to us with that long frown, handing our little girl over to us as Jen cried and begged softly for them not to take her. I reached into my pocket and grabbed at the little ‘gift’ that I made for her; I spent all night making it since I wasn’t good at crafts, really. A small wristband, wrapped with leather with the name “Debbie” on it. 

It was what we were going to call her, after all.

On the ‘bottom side’ of the band was the words “We love you so much, honey, and we’re so sorry they sent you to die. 

I wrapped it around her arm just in time for the Doctor to hold his arms out. Jen shook her head and continued to hug the little girl to her chest as her begging grew louder. The other mothers felt Jens pain, all of our eyes welling in tears as I set an arm on my wives shoulder and whispered. “I know how hard this is… but we have too, otherwise we’ll lose everything.”

“Why?! Can’t we promise to make MORE money?!”

“That’s not how this works, dear…” I solemnly said; single tears leaving my eyes… but I couldn’t cry, I was the father; I had to show a spine.

She wailed and balled as I took my daughter from her arms as I handed her to the Doctor, the man thanking me before putting her in the truck.

We watched as the final children were put into their Herse and stood there in silence as it drove off without another word; heading for the wild unknown to die.

This was twelve or so years ago, and we had barely moved on.

Riots sprang up, families attacking government buildings demanding justice for their children’s death. Politics fought with civil rights movements as words were passed from leaders to leaders. “They were not of the age to make a moral standpoint.” Or “They weren’t destined to be the children of tomorrow.” Sickening, truly, and everyone knew it, but the world was a cruel place, and love and compassion wasn’t one that was a holding factor.

My wife found purpose when she came out from her depression; joining an organization that essentially destined to find their children in the wild, corpses or not, in hopes of returning them to the shelters or to give them help or aid. The police weren’t able to truly get involved, since it was counted as charity… but they would never be able to get a bank account, own a house or car, or be a true part of modern human society.

Not a week ago, I got a call from my wife, her voice frantic and drenched in horror.

“REN! Oh, god, Ren…”

“What is it? What’s wrong?” I questioned sternly and quickly. Last time she sounded this scared was when she found out she was pregnant. 

“We discovered… oh, god…”

“What is it, Jen?!” I demanded, my voice rising as I couldn’t even get her to speak.

“People, Ren… People, LIVING in the woods...”

“… What?” I rose up from my office chair, my voice quickly lowering as I stared at people that were looking at me in concern.

“We found them… living in tents… their skin covered in mud… their hair going down to their back…”

“They…” I tried to speak, but my throat was dry of words.

“They are savages… all of them. They attacked one of our journalist, we had to fight them back.”

“Are you okay? Did any of them hurt you?” I questioned, quickly sitting back down and leaning forward as I continued to piece together the situation.

“They don’t speak English…” She said, not responding to my question. “They… talk in grunts and howls… they have nothing on and kill each other for food. They’re using sharp rocks and sticks to hunt each other or animals…”

“Jen…” I said.

“They’re... In the same fucking woods from the HOSPITAL, Ren…” She continued, her voice was cracking.

“Holy shit…” was all I was able to say.

“Ren… I…”

“Jen, where are you. I’m leaving work.” I rose back up, gathering my coat as I turned off my computer.

“I found… a woman…” 

I froze.

“She… has the…”

“No…”

Jen began to cry loudly, I stood there on the phone as I lowered it from my ear, tears welling up as I bit down on my lower lip and spoke through my own breaking voice. “Jen, where are you…”

“Why her… Why, Ren… What did we do wrong?”

“Jen, please, speak to me…”

The phone clicked, leaving me in silence, as I watched my coworkers approach me and ask me what had happened. The look of worry and fear in their eyes, yet, I still saw no compassion.

The engineers were working hard at their computer terminals for three hours straight when Jacob decided he needed something to eat.  He stepped out of the lab, into the break room, and headed for the vending machine. 

When he got there he began to peruse the selections, trying to find the right amount of sugar and protein to carry him through the rest of the night. He settled on the Reese's peanut butter cups and a bag of M&amp;Ms. He fed some cash into the machine and dialed the numbers. The machine dumped the contents into the bottom slot and Jacob turned to be face to face with Alisha Riggs, one of the programmers on his team. 

""Whoa, there!"" He said startled, ""Scared the hell out of me.""

""Sorry,"" Alisha said. 

""No problem, no problem at all. Grabbing something to eat?"" He motioned to the vending machine but Alisha was staring at her feet which she moved like she was kicking invisible pebbles. 

""No, I don't think I could eat even if I was hungry."" She said quietly, still staring towards the floor. 

Jacob looked down at his candy and sat them on a small plastic table nearby. ""Yea, me neither."" He smiled like an idiot as he looked at the black mop of hair that sat atop Alisha's head hanging over her face. ""Alisha? Is, uh, everything alright?""

She stayed silent, but stopped the kicking motions. 

""You can talk to me you know. If you want to that is."" 

She nodded and made her way to the table and sat down with her face in her hands. ""I know I can Jake. I just don't know why I'm feeling like this now.""

Jacob raised an eyebrow and slid the chair opposite Alisha out and sat across from her. He moved the candy aside, his stomach growling as he did so, and interlaced his hands. The classic ""manager's pose"" he had learned at a mandatory management seminar last winter. 

""Alisha. Can you look at me?"" He said in as fatherly a tone as he could. She looked up, with puffy red eyes. ""Have you been crying?""

She finally brushed her hair out of her face and wiped fresh tears from already drying eyes. ""I'm sorry, I know it's not professional of me. I just don't think I can handle this.""

""Handle what?"" Jacob asked.

She motioned back towards the main lab where the other engineers were laboring away trying to triangulate the signal's origin point. ""All of that. I just can't cut it with these guys Jake. These guys are so fast, they've already written production ready code to help speed up the triangulation process, and I haven't been able to think of one damn thing to contribute.""

*Fuck this*, Jake thought as he broke his management stance and reached out to grip Alisha's cold frail fingers. ""Alisha, we've talked about this before. You're doing a fantastic job here. I know you're still only just a year in, but your application is the only reason we're even able to interact with the FTLCD's internal settings. Without you, we wouldn't even be trying to triangulate anything. You're immensely valuable to me and the team.""

She nodded unwittingly, ""It's not just that, though. I'm scared of whatever is out there. What if what we're hearing really is another society? What if there are, *things* out there? What if they get our signal and come for us? What if they're *dangerous* Jake?""
 
Jacob smiled, swallowing his own fear for his colleague's benefit, and patted her hand. ""Listen to me,"" he said, ""I might be an old timer, and I know I'm not your Dad, but I want you to understand something. Ok?""

She nodded.

""Ok. Look, I can tell you that with almost ninety-nine percent certainty that what we're hearing right now is real. Now, that is just speculation at this point, but I think this test will prove that. I'm scared too, of what they are or might be. But the best advice I can give you is to not worry about things outside of your control. If you do, you'll kill yourself from the inside out. You're far too smart for that, right?""

Alisha laughed a little, and nodded.

""Now, let's assume my theory is true, and that we're hearing aliens talking right now, ok? The silver lining is that even if they're close to us, it isn't like they'll be here tomorrow if they detect our location. We will have plenty of time, years to months even if they have FTL capabilities. So you know what you can do?""

Alisha took her hand from Jacob's and brushed her hair behind her ears. ""What?""

""I want you to build a translation capability into the FTLCD. You and Morris."" 

""I--I don't understand what you mean.""

Jacob flicked his hand at her, ""You programmers, always so literal. You know what I mean. I want you to work with Morris to develop a way to translate what these things are saying. If there really are aliens, and they detect us, we're going to need to learn as much as we can about them.""

""Before they arrive and blow up our planet?"" She asked seriously. 

Jacob thought about that a moment, felt the hair on his neck rise like when he used to leave his childhood home's dark basement alone. That feeling of impending danger. He again smiled through it. ""Whether they decide to stay where they are, show up, or run away, I don't care. We're going to have to try to talk to them, and you and Morris are going to be the ones who can get that done.""

He couldn't take it anymore. He leaned back and opened the M&amp;Ms. He tossed the torn piece of packaging on the table and took the bag to his mouth like a shot glass. 

""But I don't know anything about linguistics Jake, I mean I don't even know Spanish let alone some alien dialect."" 

Jacob was in heaven savoring the chocolate, the first meal he'd eaten in almost twelve hours. He smacked his lips and said, ""No, but you do know patterns, syntax and algorithms. That is all language and language processing really is. For the other stuff, well, that's why you'll be working with Morris. He used to be a linguistics doctoratoral candidate before he realized there was no money in it."" He held up a finger to his lips, ""Shh, don't tell the other engineers, though, they'll make fun of him.""

She laughed. Finally gave a smile that gave way to some teeth. 

""This all rides on you being right about the signal though you know.""

Jacob nodded. ""The math is right, which means I'm right. You'll see.""

Just then Morris, speak of the devil, burst into the breakroom. 

""Sir!"" Morris shouted, ""We found it!""

The sharp sound of static eased and the live audio settled to a quiet humming. The entire team were silent. Jin stared up at the large display unit directly above his head. The sound waves had now formed a straight line. The room of scientists all stood motionless; their eyes darting between the monitor and the back of Jin's head.


Jin placed his hand on Cassie's shoulder. ""Turn it up, Cassie. Full volume.""


The muffled sound of humming echoed around the lab. Jin closed his eyes in an attempt focus his hearing. Suddenly, the line on the monitor shot up and a deafening, distorted voice shouted.


""St------stop------they will find------stop sca--------me for you------pr-----elves."" Then the voice stopped dead and the room was once again filled with humming.


Cassie turned her head towards Jin who stood behind her. ""Stop. They will find. What does that mean?""


Jin lowered his gaze to Cassie's face. Her lower lip quivered slightly and her blues eyes were watery. He placed his hand on her shaking arm. ""I don't know, Cassie. But that's our job to find out."" He smiled, then turned to the rest of his team. ""We've found something! Five years of research and searching and we have finally found something. Do your magic, guys. Fine-tune the clip and make sense of it."" The room erupted into movement and they all set off to work.


Several hours had passed and Jin had still not made sense of the audio. An instant message notification popped up at the bottom of Jin's screen. He clicked it and the window expanded.


Message from Li - 15/01/2017: 'Boss, I've deciphered it. You may want to take a look.'


Jin stood up from his desk and scanned the room. He spotted Li sitting alone in the far corner of the room. A concoction of anxiety and excitement rippled deep in the pit of Jin's stomach. He braved a straight face as he walked passed the rest of his team, before coming to a stop at Li's desk.


""What is it, Li? What did you find?""


""I think you need to listen, sir.""


Jin sat down on a chair next to Li. He took a set of headphones from Li, placed them on his head and nodded. Li dragged his cursor towards the play button and clicked.


A soft buzzing sound played through the headphones for a few seconds, then a voice shouted. 


""Stop! Stop scanning, they will find you. Stop scanning. They will come for you. Prepare yourselves!""


Jin took the headphones off of his head and laid them on the desk. In attempt to stop the trembling in his legs, Jin stood up and looked down at Li. ""Good work, Li. Try to locate exactly where the transmission originated from. We need to know who sent that message.""


""But, sir....shouldn't we stop scanning?"" Li replied.


""No. We've waited far too long to find something to just give up now. Keep scanning."" Jin turned away and walked towards his own desk.


An hour had passed and no further audio had come through the live audio feed. The room was full of whispers. Everyone had now heard the audio for themselves and an uncertainty filled the air.


Jin looked at his watch, it was 02:30. The evening had finally taken its toll on him; he felt exhausted and so did his team. He stood up from his desk and the hushed whispers stopped. ""You've all been amazing today. We have made history. It's late, go home and get some rest, and we will continue the investigation tomorrow.""


The scientists shuffled about their desks for a further few minutes and then made their way towards the exit. Shortly after, Jin trudged over to the main workstation, had one last glance at the straight line and headed for the exit. Just as he reached the door, the lights began to flicker. Jin stopped and looked up. The lights emitted a few small sparks, flickered again and then popped. Blackness engulfed the room. The only light that remained was the main display monitor; casting a soft glow across the lab. A subtle vibration began to nag beneath Jin's feet. It increased in strength until the entire room was shaking violently. Jin could hear the noises of desks and objects colliding in the void. Then, an ear-shattering voice sounded from the display monitor.


""Why didn't you listen! They have found you. It's over. Everything is over!""

"[WP] Humanity has invented a new faster-than-light communication technology. The first time they turn it on, it is full of voices.",TheGoldBowl,"**Part 3**

""Main screen please,"" Jacob said.

The immense screen at the front of the lab room turned blue for a moment before switching over to displaying one of the engineer's screens. It was littered with an integrated development environment showing elaborate code snippets, the FTLCD interface, and ironically, a picture of the engineer's new puppy. 

""Sorry,"" the engineer said before dragging the main attraction off his secondary monitor and onto the mega screen. 

The FTLCD interface's output screen showed a high level, albeit complicated looking map of the solar system. It's white background allowed for crudely rendered black lines representing the orbits of planets, hundreds of tiny blue pulsing lines representing the FTLCD's listening streams, and a fat red line originating from Earth with a red dot on the end shooting out and past the representation of Saturn's moon Titan. 

""Are we sure?"" Jacob asked. ""It's actually coming from within our own solar system?""

""Yes sir,"" Morris chimed, ""we're sure."" 

If eyes really good sparkle then Jacob's would look like a six-year-old girl's craft table. He was in awe of the work he and his team had accomplished, he never felt prouder. He walked towards the front, staring up at the screen and the blinking red line with a smile from ear to ear. 

He turned and saw nervous smiles, fearful faces, and Alisha. Her questions clawed their way back into his mind: *What if they get our signal and come for us?* *What if they're dangerous?* Jacob found his smile slowly eroding away. 

Dr. Remington returned cellphone still pinned to his ear. ""H-Hang on a minute, I can find out right now for you. Y-Yes sir, of course."" He said pressing the phone to his chest, ""Where are we?""

""We found the source, sir,"" Jacob said. He turned and pointed up to the red line. ""Looks like it is a few light years past Titan.""

""Titan? It's that close?""

""Afraid so.""

Remington put the phone up to his ear. ""Mr. President, I have an update for you."" 

------

Turned out that the President was already on his way over to the lab, as Dr. Remington was filling in him on their intentions to attempt contact with the source. It wasn't any of Jacob's concern, that was Dr. Remington's department -- politics. If the president did ever arrive at the lab it'd be doubtful Jacob and his team would even see him. 

Remington took the phone, placed it on speaker, and motioned for the team to gather around.

""You're on with the team Mr. President.""

""Hello everyone, I know you're busy so I won't take up much of your time."" A pause hung in the air and the team looked around at each other. The sounds coming from beyond titan a kind of ambient background noise. ""I know the gravity of your discovery. I know now that I may have been a bit early on presuming to make contact with the source of the signal. I understand now what it could mean for our country and for the world, and I am not about to take that away from any of you. This is why I have given Dr. Remington full authority to do what he thinks needs to be done from here on out, and I make a vow to all of you here and now that any resources you need from the U.S. Government is at your disposal. Thank you all for your hard work, and your contribution to humanity."" 

The phone clicked off and the team began to whisper to one another.

""Quiet, quiet please,"" Dr. Remington said. ""Now, I know what some of you think of me, and that's fine. But the fact of the matter is I hired you all because I have faith in you. I have faith that you are the best of the best in this field. I made a snap judgement earlier by telling you all to ping this source with a message of our own. I understand the full implication of that now. With this in mind, I will take my council on this matter from Dr. Jacob Albright, and Dr. Albright alone. We have no time to waste on a debate, we must act on the information we have now or we may never get the chance again.""

The team went silent and looked to Jacob. 

""So, Jacob? What do you say?"" Dr. Remington asked.

Jacob looked up at his team, over to Alisha, and up at the blinking red line. 

He twirled his beard in his hands for a few moments. He thought of the pros and cons. The negative and positive implications if this theory were true; if the chatter really was alien. He decided that the risk was worth taking, and Jacob Albright made up his mind.

""We send the message.""

------

The message was simple. A recording of Jacob's voice saying ""This is Dr. Jacob Albright of Earth. Can you respond?"" , along with this would be binary and morse code representations of this message. They recorded the payload and used Alisha's FTLCD application to prepare it to be sent.

Alisha sat next to Jacob and the rest of the team, including Dr. Remington gathered behind them. 

""Are we ready?"" she asked. 

Jacob nodded. ""Yea, we're ready."" 

He turned a dial on his speakers to turn up the chatter coming in, the non-stop torrent of buzzing and clicking. 

""Godspeed,"" he said as he clicked the 'Submit to Transmission Handler' button on his screen. 

The FTLCD application spun as the message in its various formats was broken down for transmission. Numbers and lines of code streamed down across Jacob's screen, all culminating in a single text prompt in an all black window that read:

**Completed. Message Sent. Error Messages: 0 Warning Messages: 0**

Everyone behind him let out a gasp of relief and began clapping and cheering. The first message sent from the FTLCD was off and being pulsed through space at over 186,000 miles a second. It was at that moment, reflecting on how long it would take for the message to reach Titan that Jacob reflected on what he told Alisha earlier. She was not an astronomer, which is why she was probably still smiling with the rest of the team. But he knew that the message would get to the source in less than half-an-hour, and if the source really was an advanced species with FTL travel, well, then they might be able to get back to us in the same amount of time.

Jacob was always an atheist. For as long as he could remember, but at that moment, during that realization, he prayed to God that his theory was wrong. That this whole thing was interference caused by some random commercial satellite. That there was yet to be life discovered out there in the black void of space. That they'd go back to being alone. 

But twenty minutes later, that prayer wasn't answered.

The team was eating pizza Dr. Remington had ordered before going off to meet with the president, and some of the engineers were drinking from a silver flask they'd smuggled in at some point during a late night when the buzzing and clicking stopped coming through Jacob's console. 

Alisha was the only one still working, reading up on linguistics when she heard the single shut off through the raucous laughing and joking of the team. 

""Quiet!"" She shouted, ""Shut the fuck up!""

The men and Jacob all stopped what they were doing and turned. 

""Listen,"" she said. They did, they listened to the silence. Jacob clamored over to his console and cranked up the volume. There, in the digital static of the speakers he heard the faintest whisper of his voice. His own voice being played back to him, as if in the background of a live microphone. 

""What the hell?"" Jacob asked pressing his ear to the closest speaker. His voice, barely audible, no doubt about it, being played over, and over again. First, the spoken word, then the morse code, just as they sent it. His heart skipped a beat as the silence was broken.

A low gurgling sound came across the airwaves then, followed by frantic buzzing and clicking like before. This time, there were no breaks in the communication, just constant torrential noise. 

Morris ran past everyone and looked up at the giant screen. ""Uh, guys?""

""Quiet Morris, we're listening!"" Shouted one of the other engineers leaning in over Jacob to observe the FTLCD's data stream. 

""Guys! You should really see this!""

""What is it Morris?"" Jacob asked. He looked up and the blood drained from his face. He saw the screen with the white background, with the black lines representing the solar system, with the pulsing blue lines representing the FTLCD's listening streams, and a fat red line that originated from Earth and ending with a dot on the end that was slowly growing shorter and shorter.

"[WP] Humanity has invented a new faster-than-light communication technology. The first time they turn it on, it is full of voices.",TheGoldBowl,"When children are born they learn to listen before they can speak. Their first words are said over and over until they ring in their head so loudly that it cannot be ignored. And through knowledge and experience they decipher every letter and word they are taught. They learn moving forwards with every passing day. People build themselves one day at a time doing what they thought was best. Learning from mistakes, carrying scars and wounds to better themselves with tougher skin and harder bones. They would learn and pass it on. So that their children could do even better.

But then the age of learning ended. Only knowledge remained. When we learned of the transmissions we rushed to make it our own, to add our knowledge to this river of information and expand on it as we had always done. But then something curious happened. Everything we knew was already there. Every piece of history, every question we had, every answer we wished to seek was already there before us. Easily legible if only drowned out by the sheer volume. 

Anything that travels faster than light is incredibly powerful. It no longer simply travels forwards but traveles outwards through space and time. Most importantly backwards through time. Messages from the future poured in, Millennia of knowledge and technology waiting to be read, but with it came a warning. Sending a message would alter the past. Erasing the current world but giving another chance to the world's of the past. 

And so they built following the blueprints laid out before them. Buildings that took centuries to perfect were made in weeks. Every pitfall laid out, easily avoided. And people were happy for awhile. Leading perfect lives laid out before them with the care of countless selves pushing them on. People would read messages from themselves in the future telling them of their true love and where to find them. Where their perfect home was and their children's names. So they listened and followed.

It was then that humanity stopped. One discovery or advancement, one war or tradigy that was not already written was simultaneously almost impossible and terrifying. An entire world stuck reading without being able to write. For even a single new word sent to the past would mean that this you would no longer exist. No one dares defy the text. The gospel written by you. Approved by you, perfected by infinite versions of you.

And so the world simply followed without a single word. Simply reading, and waiting, quiety, happily, and terrified.

**PART 1**

The FTLCD was a maelstrom of indistinguishable chatter at first. A series of buzzing and clicks,  a language unheard by human ears spoken by dozens of unique tones.  

""What the hell is that?"" asked Dr. Remington. The head of NASA's department of R&amp;D leaned down over Jacob's console tilting his ear towards the sounds. ""Is that, are we listening to conversations here?"" 

Jacob Albright, lead engineer for the faster than light communications device program twirled his beard between his fingers. The noises coming through his console reminded him of something, some familiar pattern, he just couldn't place it. 

""Jacob?"" Dr. Remington brought him out of his thoughts. 

""Y-yea, sorry"" he stuttered. ""I-I just don't know yet sir. Hard to tell if this is just some kind of interference or if we are actually hearing something out there.""

It was a lie. A lie to make him less fearful of what he had just discovered, what the implications for the world would be once people outside of NASA's walls found out about it. With the flick of a switch Jacob and his team confirmed that there was life more advanced than our own among the stars. This was not the thought that terrified him though, on the contrary, the confirmation was thrilling. What scared him was that the FTLCD had intercepted their communications so quickly, which meant they were close by - very close by. 

""Well, how can we confirm it one way or the other?"" Dr. Remington asked as he started pacing the floor. 

Jacob looked up to his team members, a handful of brilliant engineers he'd hired over the past five years. They all had the same look of fear on their face. Seemed their director was the only one in the room who didn't really understand the measure of the situation. 

""Well, "" Jacob said,"" we did build the FTLCD to both receive and distribute communication.""

Dr. Remington stopped his pacing and turned to face Jacob. ""Are you proposing we attempt contact with the source of this signal?"" 

The color drained from the faces of the engineers at the back of the room as Jacob nodded.

""That is precisely what I'm suggesting sir.""

Remington continued his pacing, his dress shoes clicking on the polished stone floor. ""What risks does that present us with?"" 

""Well, we would first have to pinpoint the source. Assuming my calculations are correct that source is somewhere in our solar system, right here in our neighborhood.""

""Meaning?""

""Meaning that if these noises really are coming from some unknown uh, uh species, then they will undoubtedly receive our signal. Which is a catch-22 sir.""

Remington stopped and put his hands on his hips. He glared at Jacob. Remington was a man of results, of business, of no bullshit. He wanted Jacob to get to the point, and he didn't have to say a word to tell him that. 

Jacob swallowed a big lump in his throat. ""What I mean is, is that if our communication is received by an intelligent species we will undoubtedly hear a response. That will confirm that what we are hearing isn't interference, but it will also give away our location to lifeforms we know nothing about.""

Dr. Remington considered this for a moment. The room was silent except for the strange noises streaming out from Jacob's console. 

It was in this silence that Jacob realized what the pattern of the noises reminded him of. It was reminiscent of listening to some sophisticated police scanner. Small, but steady bursts of communication at a time. Series of quick requests and confirmations with long lines of conversation scattered throughout. He wondered what that might have meant they were hearing. 

""Do it,"" said Remington again interrupting Jacob's thoughts. ""Pinpoint the source and send a hailing message. We need to know what it is we're listening to here.""

A mix of adrenaline-fueled excitement and a cold sweat came over Jacob. 

""I will make preparations right away sir."" He said as Remington got on his cell phone and left the room. 

Jacob turned to his team. 

""Well ladies and gentlemen, let's get to work.""

""What?!"" Darren Black, leader of the FTL Comms project, stood up from his seat. He'd been lounging, ready for another disappointing failure from the system, but now... ""Are you sure, Emily?""


He ran forward to stand next to Emily at her computer, and the rest of the researchers raced to join him. They all stood, watching numbers jump around on the screen. Then suddenly, it stopped- and a green light turned on in the machine in front of them, and the room was filled with the sound of static.


The scientists and engineers erupted in a chorus of cheers. Emily jumped from her seat, and hugged Darren tightly, screaming ""We did it! We finally did it!""


Stepping back, the woman raised her fist and yelled, ""Drinks are on me!""


Darren laughed, ""Alright everyone, calm down. No time for drinking today! We have work to do."" 


The room started to quiet down as people moved back to their stations, when suddenly, from the FTL machine, there was a voice. ""A-HA! Looks like I win. Pay up, Zel'Nora!""


Shocked, Darren, Emily, and everyone else in the room could only stare at the device as it continued in a new voice. ""Yeah, yeah... I can't believe the blasted Martians didn't figure their interstellar comms out first."" The scientists heard a clinking sound, as well as what sounded like an octopus moving around.


The first speaker laughed, ""50 galacticoins! You there Earthlings? I want to thank you all for letting me win it big!""


""Uh...I...um... Yes, we're here,"" Darren stammered, ""Uh... who are you?""


""I'm Tarlinzo! I come from the planet Upto,"" the voice replied cheerfully, ""My companion here is Zel'Nora of Relth, who just lost big in our office pool on which planet in your solar system would communicate with us first.""


""I...see,"" Darren replied uncertainly, ""We... weren't expecting to encounter ali- er, other sentient species like this. I apologize for the... disorganized greeting.""


""It's all good, it's all good,"" Tarlinzo replied, ""We're used to working with clients who aren't entirely prepared for life in the galactic community. In fact, that's why we're here!""


""What do you mean? What clients?"" Darren was thoroughly confused.


""Well! You see, if your species has discovered interstellar communication, it means you'll be developing interstellar *travel* soon as well. And you know, space travel is very dangerous. There are asteroids, there's radiation, there are certain species that are extraordinarily malodorous. You wouldn't want to go out into the wide, wide galaxy unprepared, would you?""


""I... I suppose not,"" Darren said.


""Good!"" Tarlinzo responded excitedly, ""That's why we, Centauri Insurance, are here to help. With our Comprehensive Coverage Program, you'll be reimbursed for any lost spaceship, crew, *and* cargo! There's no policy in the galaxy just like it. For a low, low down payment of 248 galaticoins, you can...""


The alien continued its advert as the scientists either stared in bewilderment or tried to hold back laughter. Darren looked blankly at the communication machine, the sighed and looked down. ""Emily?""


""Y-yes?"" She replied softly.

They murmured to themselves, a loud hum comprised of a hundred whispering voices.... The scientists speculated with other scientists, the reporters wondered how news worthy this story would be, the investors tried to listen in to the scientists and reporters to hear if they knew anything, while the wealthy curiosity seekers, with no right to be there, just stood at the back of the room looking at nothing and hearing no one. 

The door opened and the voices stopped. A young man appeared, walking backwards, pulling a large metal trolley, followed by his associate, pushing the other end. They rolled the trolley to the front of the room, the only place in the room not filled with people and watchful eyes, and then stood behind it with their hands behind their backs. On top of the trolley was an oblong bulge, no bigger than a football, roughly the same size, covered with a white sheet. A few whispers rose up, mostly from the reporters.

A few seconds passed, apparently to build intrigue and heighten drama, then the doors opened again, this time revealing just one man, an older looking gentleman with a white lab coat, a squinting eye and a scruffy white beard. He stood with his hands behind his back for a few moments, looking at the numerous faces filling the room, all now deathly silent, then walked slowly and deliberately to the front, standing opposite the trolley.

'Gentlemen,' he said, 'and ladies,' raising his hands, 'thank you for coming. Now, I'm not one for showmanship, so let's just cut to the chase a little, shall we?'

He put his hands on the corner ends of the white sheet, pointed his squinting eye to the room, and shifted his body as if he were ready to pull it off. 

'But first, he said, dropping the corner of the sheet. 'Let me say the following as a precursor: Human beings are social creatures. To function, to be happy, to survive, we need to be able to communicate. But not just face-to-face like I am doing now, of course. This works perfectly fine, but if you want to send a message, a communication long distance, there has always been one hurdle, one rule that we have had to follow, which had limited us. Held us back. Well,' he squinted with smile, 'today, my friends, associates, onlookers, everyone. Today, we have broken that rule, and that rule is the speed of light. No more will we have to wait hours to pass vital information to our brave heroes in space. No more will we have to wait thousands of years for a basic message to reach our neighbouring stars and planets. Our search for life is no longer limited by any rules. Today, we have broken free. Today begins a new era for mankind. For science.' He reached down and picked up the corners of the sheet again. 'Gentlemen, and ladies,' he smiled. 'The greatest advance in human history: the Faster Than Light Transmitter, or FTL-T for short,' and he whipped the sheet off the trolley, revealing the bulge.

There was a collective gasp, and the hundred murmuring voices began again. The FTL-T was fairly simple in appearance: round and smooth, obviously metallic, with a glass tube running along the front. The scientists all discussed the implications and how it was achieved, the reporters flashed cameras and waved their arms wanting to ask questions, the investors rubbed their hands together and thought of profit, while the curiosity seekers still lingered at the back, smiling and waiting to see what would happen next.

The old man rubbed his beard, smiled, then rose a hand in the air to signal silence. The murmurs stopped.

'I will answer all of your questions in good time. But first, a demonstration.'

He nodded to the young men standing behind the trolley, those who had rolled it in to the room, who pulled cables from under a flap and stretched it out to the mains socket. The glass tube on the FTL-T lit up red. The old man, the inventor of this machine, then flicked a few switches on a remote that appeared in his hand, and the glass tube turned amber.

'The technology enables the transfer of communications literally faster than the speed of light, meaning we can receive any message sent to us from anywhere. Immediately.' The inventor held his finger on the round metal ball, and smiled out at the crowd of smiling faces. 'Let's see what we get.' 

The glass tube turned green, and the room fell to their knees, buckled under the sound of a million voices all speaking at once. The FTL-T rocked gently on the trolley, while the young men standing behind winced and rolled in pain. The inventor, the old man, stood perfectly still, watching the crowd of faces scream in agony, throwing arms in the air, grasping at ears. He shook his head, and said some words to himself completely imperceptible in the roar of noise, then moved an unseen mechanism at the back of the machine, causing the voices to soften and quieten. The inventor kept speaking, and as the million voices grew quiet, his voice became audible once again.

'...different frequencies, being sent in a million different ways, converted in to sound for us to hear and understand and interpret. I'm just adjusting the frequency to something a little more direct.'

The murmur in the room picked up again, as confused scientists, complaining reporters, angry investors and bewildered curiosity seekers all chatted among themselves.

'What did we just hear, Doctor?' a scientist asked, rubbing his chin.

'We just heard everything at once doctor. Our own communications, all over the world and space, along with every communication being transmitted within a thousand light years, converted in to a English speaking voice to us to understand.' The inventor had an intense look on his face, as he tweaked with the settings on the FTL-T, all the while making the volume from it dip up and down. 'I'm just trying to find a direct channel to just one frequency, where we might be able to hear one of our own messages being...'

A single voice, clear and slow, came on the FTL-T. The murmurs in the room fell deathly silent.

Traffic was really bad today, but I made it home in time.

""What the fuck?"" I exclaimed. The toilet just sat there after I stood up. Recently, I had purchased the Intellabode smart house upgrade. Life's been great with it, I've let so many of my chores take care of themselves. You never realize how much you miss the small but meaningful conveniences in your every day life until they're gone. And that's just what was happening now.

""Flush, damn it! FLUSH!""

I turned to the sink and waved my hands under the faucet.

""You've got to be fucking kidding me.""

""Hon, everything alright in there? You backed up again?""

""No Sheryl, the goddamn toilet won't flush, and now I can't wash my hands!""

""That's really weird, I tried to put a turkey in the oven and it wouldn't turn on!""

Well shit. I might as well go look at the control panel and see what's going on. Thank god the doors still have backup knobs.

""Your Intellabode is experiencing some unusual behavior. Press assist if you would like to speak to a service technician.""

"[WP] In the future, the smarthome has become commonplace. However, you get one of the first smarthome viruses.",cuboid10824,"I remember my grandfather telling me about life before smarthomes. Of course, even in his youth, there were mobile phone apps for controlling lights and music. But it was around the time he married my grandmother that smarthomes really kicked in; their reception was controlled and managed entirely by a smarthome operation. Now, fifty years later, smarthomes had become as commonplace as smartphones and smartwatches. Even the cynics had accepted them as a part of everyday life - it was a shock to walk into a room and not be welcomed by lights and heating.

I stepped into the bathroom; the lights and heating automatically kicked in, music responded to the sound of my voice and scented air began to waft into the room.

“Shower” I mumbled. The shower kicked in as soon as the word was out of my mouth, hot jets of water hitting the glass.

My grandfather had a habit of enunciating loudly and slowly, as though the system didn’t understand English. I swear, he was one step away from speaking directly into one of the microphones dotted around the room. I smiled at the thought, turning to grab one of the freshly laundered towels, then paused at a noise. Or rather, an absence of noise.

The shower was off.

I walked over, opening the door and feeling the glass. Wet.

“Shower. On.” I frowned, staring at the glass cubicle. Just like always, the water kicked into action, creating an instant steam cloud. It probably heard something that sounded like ‘off’ - the software needed updating anyway. I shook my head and reached into a cupboard for shampoo. Almost immediately, I spun back.

The shower was off.

Then the lights went out.

“Lights. On.” My voice trembled somewhat; there’s just something undeniably creepy about standing in a towel in the dark.

Nothing.

“Lights. On” I tried again, louder and sterner this time. A sound came from my right. The shower was back on. Oh for-

“Shower. Off.” I took a deep breath “Lights. On.”

Nothing.

A power outage wouldn’t explain anything; smarthomes were equipped with backup generators to enable safe use even in power cuts. Maybe there was an automatic reset and update I had missed. There were always complaints when the yearly auto-updates went out; you were left with an un-functioning house for up to 24 hours. That was one of the problems with the widespread use of smarthomes; no one put manual switches in anymore. I took a deep breath and reached for the door handle. I definitely had candles somewhere, probably in the hall closet. I would definitely be sending a complaint to HomeSafeSmart about their auto-update policy. My hand finally reached the panel next to the door and graced my fingers over the touch sensors.

The door didn’t move.

I frowned and pushed down harder on the panel. The door didn’t budge. I pushed against the door as hard as I could - there were reportedly cases of the open mechanism sometimes needing a jolt. Nothing.

Okay. So I was locked in a dark bathroom. There weren’t any windows I could climb out of - smarthomes now came with artificial windows with a choice of views and optional vitamin D. All the fun, none of the safety risks. The designers obviously had not considered the prospect of getting stuck in one of the rooms.

I tried once more. “Open door”

“Open door” came the response. I jumped back; that was my voice. Distorted somewhat but definitely mine.

“Open door” I repeated, edging backwards towards a wall, my voice shaking.

“Open door open door open door open door open door”

“Stop!” I shouted at the system

“Open door open door open door open door open door”

Another sound joined the distorted voice. The taps had turned themselves on.

I slid down the wall, my ears trying to make up for the lack of information my eyes were receiving.  The lights in the bathroom began to flicker on and off. I put my hands over my ears to protect them from the alarm that had started blaring around the whole house, combining with the system voice.

“Open door open - Caution. Malfunction - door open - Caution. Mal- door op -function- en door - Caution - open door - Malf-” 

Then. Nothing. 

I removed my hands from my ears and blinked as the lights returned to full. I watched as water stopped running out of the taps. A whooshing sound to my left caught my attention in enough time that I was able to see the door slide open. The standard system voice startled me into standing. 

“We apologise for any inconvenience. Your smarthome has a virus. We recommend complete reboot and reset. For further information, contact HomeSafeSmart….”

A deep sleep was arising over the mortal, and I made my presence known. I breathed and the body shook, my gaze broke through the mind and seared through the heart.

"[WP]""What's your curse?"" ""My curse? Immortality.""",drblacknife,"Sullen and quiet, the smell of death flooded the halls of the infirmary. You could strum the tension in the air as beds were emptied, their inhabitants replaced by living specimens. Barely living, that is. Few sounds dared to shatter the silence. Occasionally there were hushed voices, a cough, the rustle of a nurse's skirt. It was not a pleasent place to find one's self, healthy or otherwise. Yet, he dared not be anywhere else.

The well-dressed man strode briskly down the halls, ignoring glances with sorrow shadowing his own pale features. Black curls fell into his face, silver eyes heavy with unspoken burden. A boquet of hibiscus and fern was clutched tightly in his fist.

He knew which corner to take, slowly to a halt once turning down the right path. Before him were rows of empty beds along either wall, dust motes dancing in the light provided by a row of grungy windows. There, near the end of the room, was the sole inhabitant: a well aged woman, white-haired and still with slumber.

Anxiety squeezed at the man's chest, blinking tears from his eyes. Inhaling deeply, he sauntered forward until he reached her bedside. Removing dead flowers from the decorative vase on a small table, he replaced them with his own gift before sitting lightly on the next bed.

""Hibiscus."" He looked up as a rasping voice sounded. The old woman gazed at the flowers with warm, honey brown eyes. ""My favorite."" She looked to the man curiously. ""And who might you be?""

He offered a soft smile that did not reach his eyes. ""My name is Khodai. Nobody special,"" he murmured. ""And you?""

The woman paused, brows pinching in thought. ""I... Don't remember.""

""Don't worry about that, then,"" he assured her with a smile. ""You seemed awfully lonely in here. I'd like to offer my company, perhaps a story, if you don't mind.""

Her thin-lipped smile widened. ""I'm never one to turn down a tale.""

Wringing his hands in his lap, he took a deep breath. ""How about a romance, then?""

""Only if it ends in tragedy,"" the woman teased, followed by a string of coughs.

""It does,"" he whispered, handing her the glass of water on the table. She thanked him and urged him to continue.

""It starts with a young man,"" he said softly. ""Stefan,"" he decided. ""Stefan was the youngest son of a rich family, and much to his parents' dismay he was hopelessly in love with a gypsy.""

""And what was her name?"" The old woman asked, already enthralled.

He met her eye for a moment, smile laced with sadness. ""Molly.""

She laughed. ""That's no romani name.""

His grin widened. ""Perhaps not, but nevertheless it was her name."" He let out a breath. ""Anyway. Stefan loved Molly more than even he could fathom. So much so, he went against the word of his family and asked her to marry him."" He paused and raised a brow. ""Are you certain about wanting a tregedy?""

The old lady snorted, turning her head towards the ceiling. ""Nothing perfect is interesting on its own.""

A small chuckle left Khodai. ""Fair enough. In that case, there came a day where Stefan was taken away. Taken from his love and his life from a... Horrible monster. A monster that turned him into a monster as well."" Intrigued, the woman turned to look at him closely, emotion slipping into his tone. ""A monster cursed with the inability to die.'

'Stefan was allowed to return to Molly, but a day came when she began to age and he did not. He spent years watching her face, her hair, her voice wither while he remained impossibly young. She sent him away one day, refusing to allow him to watch her grow old, for she did not wish such pain on the man she still loved.'

""Years- centuries- followed. Again and again Stefan would meet his Molly with a new name, a new face, a new life with the same soul. He remembered each one as well as the one before, and though she was always different the look in her eyes or tone of voice when she told him she loved him never dared to change. And yet, she never remembered him. Not at first.'

'Twelve times he had the absolute joy of making her fall in love with him, but this joy came at a cost. She never failed to send him away after so many years together, and he would go. He would be alone, knowing somewhere, she was dying. Fearing each life with her might be the last.""

""Then he is a fool,"" the woman commented. Khodai looked at her in surprise. ""A soul is nothing to question,"" she explains. ""Her love chooses his, and that is the way it will stay.""

Unable to find the words, Khodai merely smiled, but his expression faltered as her eyes fluttered closed. In the silence, it was clear to hear when her breath stopped. Head hanging, Khodai pressed his lips together and sighed, squeezing his eyes shut.

After a moment he stood and leaned forward, pressing a kiss to her forehead. A trembling whisper passed his lips. ""May we meet again, Molly Prince.""",BlooperBoo
[WP] The day everything went right.,hotpotato70,"I was peering into the display case when a store assistant came up to ask me if I needed a hand. I turned to the young man and said with a smile “yeah, can I take a look at those” as I pointed to a set of Sony headphones retailing for nearly $400. Usually such a price would be out of reach, but heck, today I deserved them. I just got a brand new iPod and almost a grand in cash. Today was shaping up to be a pretty excellent day. After trying about 10 different keys that hung off of a giant ring, the kid slid the display window open. Just as he was reaching to grab me the headphones somebody called out his name.    


“Be right back” he said while looking in the direction where his co-worker was frantically waving him over. I looked back and forth between the employee and the boxes of headphones that now lay within my grasp. With the ease and confidence that only comes with experience, I slipped off my backpack and casually transferred the boxes from the shelf into my bag. The trick is not too move fast, even if your legs are screaming for you to run and the hairs on your neck prickle as if you’re being watched. After my bag was fattened up with hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise I stole one final glance at the back of the assistant who had helped me. “God bless you” I whispered. 


As I walked of out the main entrance of the store (which didn’t beep, by the way) a rather plump woman power walked past me, clearly on a mission. Behind her she left the most beautiful corvette I had ever seen, just sitting there with the engine running. It was surely a sign, as the best chop shop in town was only a 10 minute drive from here. It will be sad to see this baby disassembled, but the money will dry my tears. I’ll just have to be sure to take the long route to the garage, enjoy the ride. I opened the car door, relaxed into the leather seat, and shifted the gear into drive. Everything was going just right today. Of course my best days mean somebody else’s worse, but hey that’s just the cycle of life.

He often thought he was insane for traveling with such an unbalanced and often deranged man. But going solo was even crazier. Every five minutes the man would take a swig of whiskey and mumble something incoherent back at the boy. They had been walking for about half a bottles worth when Tanner stopped, motioning Harry to do the same.

Harry couldn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary. Whereas, Tanner slowly nodded his head as if listening to an encoded message in the surrounding forest. 

""We gots us a heavy we do lad. Comin' right here, it is! Single horsed."" Tanner retrieved his bow from its sheath and left to find a good vantage point, overlooking the nearby trail. Harry knew his role. Get the man off his horse.

The padded clomps announced the horse's arrival. Fully laden, as Tanner predicted, probably a merchant, with one older rider. 
""Please mister,"" Harry said. ""I was robbed and I think I have busted my leg. Please take me to the nearest village!"" The rider had pulled his horse to a stop at the sight of the destitute young boy lying beside the trail. Most decent men would show pity at such a sight. Today, Harry and Tanner would be profiting off that decency.

Sure enough the man dehorsed and made his way over to Harry, albeit suspiciously. Rifle in hand, the gentleman eyed the surrounding bush. A sinking feeling started in the boy's stomach *he see's through our scam* he thought. But he had been with Tanner long enough to know he wasn't soon to be outdone by some village folk.

""Gimme your jacket and i'll take you."" The man said gruffly. 
Harry was getting nervous. This guy wasn't as easily fooled as the others. The presence of the rifle made it hard to think. Before he could do anything, the sound of two arrows being loosed came from somewhere out of sight. Harry didn't need to look, Tanner didn't miss. 

Harry didn't usually question Tanner's methods. They had kept him alive and fed thus far. But he winced as he heard a final bolt lodge in to the dying mans chest. 

""He was plannin' ta rob ya, ya know?"" Tanner said, noticing Harry's unease. 
He was probably right, Tanner had been living out here longer than anyone. He always knew what was going on before anyone else. 

""Should I at least bury him?"" Usually they just robbed folk. It had been nearly a year since Harry had been around a corpse.

[WP] You're not a real adult until you've buried your first corpse.,hpcisco7965,"My childhood was unlike many of the boys and girls I grew up with; they were all taught to say ""please"" and ""thank you"", to be honest, to really just embody the virtue of a traditionally-raised young American. Now, I use the word ""traditionally"" because my father's mode of raising me was far from it—in my household, becoming a man wasn't about chopping wood in the backyard with your old man, it also wasn't going off to college or any bullshit like that. In my family, becoming a man meant something different than that—not the type of man, but what had to be done in order to become one.

I try to avoid clichés, but I do remember it like it was just yesterday—it was the night before my 16th birthday, although before this night I had always thought my father to be a florist by profession. I could not have been more wrong.

It was raining out, and I sat in my bed gazing up to the tin roof of our trailer, watching and listening as it broadcasted piercing pops throughout our home of 2, like burst of beads I used to watch launch from the mouth of my papa's shotgun. Just as I was falling asleep, my old man ripped open our front door, woke me, and tossed me into the passenger seat of his truck like I'd seen him do with his girlfriends. He was high on somethin'. He looked me in the eyes and said, ""Tomorrow you turn sixteen. But, as my father did with me, we need to celebrate this exciting milestone—you're becoming of a man.""


We burnt out of the driveway, leaving a clout of dust behind us, which continued to grow as we ripped through the dirt road that segregated the park from the surrounding farms in the area. We got off this road not onto another road, but into a corn field, trailblazing stocks of husk at speeds of over 60 miles per hour.

""Buckle up, son."" The words escaped his mouth in a drunken slurr, as he tried to lock eyes on me, dawning the smile of a truly mad man.

We arrived at the barn, and in it lay a lone man, who appeared to be deeply asleep—I recall envying him. His name was Mr. Winston I recognized him because he volunteered to teach a class at my school on bible studies, a class I had actually taken.

I look at my dad, as if to ask ""what's this all about?"" It was if I had asked the question aloud, for immediately after he approached Mr. Winston and flipped him over, to which he did not wake up (as I was expecting) but rather revealed a gash to his chest that formed a canyon into his insides from his collar bone to waist.

I approached the body in disbelief, and placed my hand on Mr. Winston, for I needed to see for myself, and feel for myself, if he was truly dead and, for that matter, what it was to be dead. When I turned around to look for my father, he was nowhere to be found, rather there lay one rusty shovel in his place and a bottle of Jack, as if my father had magically turned into them. I approached the old and worn barn artifact cautiously, as I noticed this was not a bare shovel. There was a note attached to it; it read:

""Bury him and be a man, if you don't you will be damned.""

I picked up the shovel and looked at it in my hand and then looked at Mr. Winston, as if to size one up against the other. I exchanged shovel for bottle of Jack, cracked it open, and took a swig. Then a took a few more swigs. Then I was drunk.

I grabbed the shovel and clenched it tightly in my hands, and walked towards Mr. Winston in a blackout state of intoxication, only to wake up the next day beside a pile of dirt that filled a hole about 6 feet in length. I was still a little drunk, but I managed to recognize where I was—the same barn my father had taken me to the night before. I run into the barn, but to my surprise, Mr. Winston still lay motionless, the lesion to his front torso having attracted the various bugs that had since awoken.

I panicked, and ran back to the pile of dirt was—which, by the way, was unmistakable for a grave. Though on my way back to the grave, I noticed my father's truck, still parked where we had left it the previous night. 

""DAAAD??"" I called, though nobody responded. I returned my attention to the grave, and noticed something glistening. I brushed aside some dirt, exposing what looked like a ring. Upon looking more closely, I realized it was, in fact, a ring—my fathers ring.

I picked up the shovel, covered the ring, and returned home in my father's truck, to my new home of one.

[WP] You're not a real adult until you've buried your first corpse.,hpcisco7965,"Ciaran looked down at his daughter with a mixture of pride and sorrow. Mhairi had insisted on digging the meager grave herself. Her brother Iwan had offered help, as had many of the castle's servants and guards, but all had been refused. Ruffian had been her favorite, and she was determined to see him off personally. Her hands and the fringes of her gown were caked with dirt and her cheeks stained with tears that not even the hard-hearted Castellan, Mulrood, could begrudge her, but the work was done.

With a heavy formality that still somehow felt appropriate, Iwan handed his sister the bundle. He was carefully wrapped in a cloth befitting a member of the royal family. *As he was, in his way.* Ciaran thought. He'd certainly shared Mhairi's chamber often enough. He watched her part the wrappings and give the old hound's face one last gentle touch. For an instant she seemed a child again, and he fought a less-than-kinglike urge to rush to her and wrap her in his arms and comfort her as he had when she'd hurt those years ago.

*You're never grown until you've buried your first corpse.* His father had often said this to him. He'd doubtlessly meant it in reference to an enemy slain on the field of battle, but those days were far behind them now. The death of a beloved animal companion was more than enough, in any case.

""Goodbye, you old terror."" Mhairi whispered to the wrapped body, and then knelt to lay him down in the earth. Her hands shook and there were fresh tears on her face as she began to pour dirt back into the hole. Now Ciaran did go to her, but had to content himself with putting a hand on her shoulder when she'd finished the burial.

""He'd be proud to be the cause of such a scene one last time."" Iwan said with a sad smile. Mhairi managed to choke out a little laugh through her tears.

""I'll never know,"" she said, voice thick, ""why it is we give our hearts so freely to those who live such short lives."" 

With her father's help, she got to her feet, wiping her cheeks with a sleeve of her gown that behind trails of dirt. Already the manner of a princess was settling back around her. She wasn't just his little girl anymore. She'd buried her first corpse, and she was grown.",ViGingersnap
[WP]. Everyone has been watching a rogue planet that will pass by Earth. The rogue planet once supported life as there are ruins. It is discovered that the ruins are identical to buildings on Earth.,killercylon,"Everyone and their cats had their own theory on what this rogue planet was. But when astronomers announced that recent scans matched up perfectly with satellite imaging of earth, every idea went out the window. 

That was some months ago. The rogue planet had since moved closer. Even the most basic telescope could see the surface of the planet named Desolation. 

The planet was a dead ruin. Its surface was haunted by ruins of ancient sky scrappers long left to nature. Then the vast trees and bushes and vines that had reclaimed the cities, which had then withered to nothing. The very ground was dark with decay. 

Samuel Richardson stood looking through his telescope. As Desolation spun slowly during its approach he searched it curiously for his street. No luck yet. But he had found other interesting things. 

Many towns seemed to have been broken down to checkpoints or perhaps army battlegrounds. Many cities had large walls surrounding them. They stood strong, impenetrable but rusted. 

Buy most alarmingly of all were the bodies. Not human bodies, there was a worrying lack of those. No, these bodies were large insectoid creatures. Their shells spined and their legs finishing in lethal, blade like tips. They look like they could crush a building, but clearly the walls were too much. 

It was on a day like this that Samuel was searching for his street on Desolation. He no longer needed the telescope, as the terrifying planet loomed from horizon to horizon. He sat studying the cities, when the entire planet flickered. 

It was brief, almost imperceptible. But he saw it, like an old TV channel flickering as it looses reception. And then, as though in response, his radio followed suit. It squealed and crackled before tuning itself back in. 

It happened again, more obvious, prolonged. When the radios of the world lost signal, Samuel swore he heard a voice. And then the radio tuned out all together. 

""Finally we are here"" hissed a malevolent voice. ""Far we have travelled and now this,"" Desolation flickered and glowed as the cities before their eyes ignited, blindingly bright as though the sky itself were burning. ""This shall be your fate."" The radio crackled and returned to the cheerful music from before as the planet in the sky vanished to reveal countless ships poised ready to strike from Orbit. ",TheHelfirePoet

[WP]. Everyone has been watching a rogue planet that will pass by Earth. The rogue planet once supported life as there are ruins. It is discovered that the ruins are identical to buildings on Earth.,killercylon,"When the planet emerged from the black, no one knew where it came from or what it was. An amateur astronomer was the first to notice the anomaly, having spotted it appear from what she claimed looked like a ""void in space."" The claims of its arrival were ignored, but the eyes of most world space organizations turned their attention upon the planet whose gravitational alignment had locked into the same general band that Earth travels around the sun.

Studies commenced. Satellite imagery that returned to researchers divulged little to begin with. The anomaly was Earth-sized, rotating at a similar speed to Earth, had moisture-retaining cloud cover, and in a break in the clouds they saw something truly amazing: vegetation.

Space agencies had been preparing since the first time they spotted the anomaly, but now it was certain that man would have to step foot on the planet. If they timed it correctly, astronauts would land on the surface of the planet before the planet caught up to Earth in its revolution around the sun.

As the planet neared, the same researcher who discovered the planet had her telescope trained on the planet. As it neared and came into focus, and the beams of light from the sun splayed across it, a reflection returned. She not only saw bodies of water -- great bodies of water -- but small shimmering reflections like that of a car window on a bright day. She reported her findings.

As news rolled out, NASA released their findings reporting alien ruins on what had come to be known as Terra 2. Mankind may have been gifted this anomaly from the majestic expanse of space, a place to expand and grow. But it meant that somewhere else, life had flourished.

In the waning weeks of Terra 2's approach, another discovery was made. In orbit around the planet was a moon, of similar scale to our own. Instead of complete, however, it was partially destroyed, and in its wake a debris band had formed around Terra 2. 

Studies based around the composition of the planet, by bouncing radar and radio off the planet, came back with what researchers believed told of an atmosphere consisting mostly of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The planet's surface itself appeared to be mostly rock, sand, and clay, but what also appeared to be an alarming amount of organic material. 

In the days approaching the mission, and the planet was well within visible sight of Earth, the clouds began to dissipate, and the blue marble so much like their own became more easy to distinguish -- though still not entirely. But as they neared, a radio transmission was received, weakly pulsing from the planet's surface. 121.50000

NASA followed up.

121.50000. Distress.

Though this frequency was heard across the globe and received in many different forms, NASA neglected to announce the findings and continue their mission. What was originally a single-nation mission became a multi-national exploration mission to the surface of this planet. As it neared, surface sonar detected several ideal locations to land; NASA selected a location, and sent their teams away into space.

Still days away in its elliptical path around the sun, astronauts launched from Earth in a four-day journey to Terra 2. No one spoke of how similar the planets were; they ignored the white Luna look-alike whose fragments orbited the planet, they didn't speak of the reports that thousands -- or millions -- of space debris orbited the planet, or even that ruins still stood on the planet. It didn't seem to particularly odd that as part of their teams, Air Force Combat Controllers, armed for combat, had been sent along.

None of it seemed too odd until they breached the atmosphere of the planet. When the red and white streaks of friction cooled and they could see what was below them. Atop the green vegetation and growth, in amongst the trees and the long grass were cars. As their eyes wandered, they spied buildings. Their chosen landing spot hadn't been the best spot for their landing, but the best spot to confirm beliefs. As the pod settled and opened up, and the astronauts stepped out on the not so foreign soil, they set their eyes upon the crumbling and desolate remains of the US Capitol Building. 

The commander of the mission stepped forward, and as the light of the sun crested fully, exposing the apocalyptic remains of their very own planet, he called back, ""Control, we've got a problem.""",HazardActual

[WP]. Everyone has been watching a rogue planet that will pass by Earth. The rogue planet once supported life as there are ruins. It is discovered that the ruins are identical to buildings on Earth.,killercylon,"We all knew the rogue planet was headed our way. We all knew it was headed directly for us. Everyone around me was planning for the end of our world as we knew it to be. It was still too far for any spaceship to explore. All the astronomers we working 24/7 though, reporting anything they thought was of importance to us. 
I assumed “they” were not telling us everything they knew. They always held back the really important stuff. I knew if we all waiting long enough the truth about this planet that was headed for us, this planet that would crash into us would come out. Not that it mattered, I mean, we would all be dead anyway. 
The last few years before it happened, I prepared for the end just like everyone else, giving up on everything I ever believed. Now for all intents and purposed, God. I believed in God. That is who I prayed to just about every free moment I have.
  
I thought the violence would never end. Those who could and would, killed, scavenged and raped. This was the Armageddon! Our worst nightmares all came true. When your future is set you would be surprised how nothing matters.  The people who were left after the killings and suicide, and after the thugs just about killed themselves off, finally took a stand and those who wanted to keep doing bad things, well, they were done away with. All the ones who remained were those just waiting to the very end. Sometimes I think it was to see just what would happen. 

 I was living in a small home with no electricity, no running water and no sewer. Just like everyone else around me. We had no laws at that time, but among those of us who were left, it was not needed. We had a mutual respect of each other. In a very ironic way, life was so much easier than before we knew there really was an end in sight. 

We lived off a community garden, and a community water well. Those of us who shared in this neighborhood were very protective and very cautious of outsiders. 

We had a neighborhood watch program to keep those who did not want to cooperate. There were those who came around wanting to take over, some by force, others by politicking. We would always chase them away. In a way, we were all happier than we have ever been. 

That day finally happen, the day the Rogue Planet came into Earth’s orbit. We have been steadily watching for months get closer and closer. With no TV or radio, none of knew what was going to happen. The closer it came to earth the more people freaked out. Everyone went crazy. 

Then something happen no one was expecting. The government, the one who was in charge shows up out of the blue, and starts handing out commodities, as if nothing had ever happened. Blankets fresh water, clothes. And Radios that worked, with batteries. They had town hall meetings letting everyone know what was going to happen as the Rogue Planet moved in closer. They were still in charge.

Apparently as the planet moved in close enough, anyone with a telescope could tell the Rogue Planet was an exact copy of Earth. Our Earth! The cities looked like just like ours as well, with buildings, cars, houses, restaurants, playgrounds. And like Earth as we know it, everything was in ruins. Almost as if they too, went crazy as they came closer to earth. Whoever, they are. 

As the military kept explaining, they left Earth to visit the other planet. They found people just like us, yes I said it, “People” just like us, humans. Except, they were in perfect health in every way. We found that they purposely left society behind and lived as we are living now. They lived off the land. Had small communities and were good to each other. We do not know how long they have been doing this, we do know most everyone on the planet lived forever. No one had ever died of natural causes or old age. It was amazing.

The big hit came when they told us that this was not the first time this had happened. It has been happening as long as anyone on the Rogue Planet can remember. What was happening was that the Rogue Planet was pushing Earth out of its orbit and into the Rogue Planets orbit. We were switching places. Earth would now become the Rogue Planet in its 1500-year orbit around the sun. 

What was now taking place was the government was asking for volunteers to go to the Rogue Planet and live there for the rest of our lives. And some of the people from the Rogue Planet would come to live on Earth. The people who would come to the earth would teach us the way they live and teach us to become immortal. The ones who would go to the Rogue Planet would learn how to live the way they did, and become immortal. 

This was all sounding really good, until we became immortal. With new science and new food, it was not long before this happen. We lived in a utopian society. Literally! We wanted for nothing and we needed no one. 
A perfect life, until we found the answer to the one question no one ever asked. Population control with everyone still having kids and procreating and no one ever dying from natural causes, it only went to figure we would eat those who had been around the longest. 

It brought a whole new meaning to going out to eat. Your favorite restaurant was now serving your grandparents, or someone’s grandparents, uncles aunts. After a while that was the only source of protein allowed. It was the only kind of meat that was allowed to be eaten. It was the only way mankind would keep from over populating the earth. 

Well, I have lived a good life. I knew I couldn’t rum forever. Now it is my turn to feed the nation.

It is discovered that the ruins are identical to buildings on Earth.,killercylon,"""My God."" said Mr. Wright. He wasn't referred to as Mr. simply to be polite but rather his mother was always worried that he wasn't going to be referred to as mister by anyone when he was born, because he wasn't the smartest looking baby. In his fathers words when he was a baby he was more of a 'crying flesh potato with ears'. 

Mr. looked up at the sky, where he could see the faint outlines of the planet, holding onto the rails of his balcony. Inside the television was on the news channel, where the news forecaster was speculating as to why weather patterns weren't being affected by the new planet. A man in a blue suit was saying it was because the new planet didn't actually exist in our dimension but was rather spat out from a black hole after the aliens destroyed our civilization. Another was saying it was originally a twin to earth that had been ejected into space after separating from Earth to follow sentient toupee's. A woman with them was trying to bring the conversation to what it means socially, for the relationships between men and women. She was largely ignored.

Going inside to make some tea, pushing the eviction notice on his table to the side Mr. stopped with a knock at the door. Slowly he walked over to it, grabbed a bat, and cracked open the door, ""Hello?""

""Mr.. Wright?"" Asked an orange haired woman, in a pant suit with a binder in hand ""That is correct?""

""Yes, what do you want?"" He asked ready to slam the door closed if it was another damn hippie, trying to get him to rain dance for the planet. 

""We have your planet ready."" She said with a smile, ""Can I come in?""

""What?"" He asked incredulously.

""Your planet sir, sure it's a fixer upper but I think you'll enjoy it just fine."" She pipped.

Setting the bat down he unlocked the door and asked, ""Are you on something? I want some if you are.""

""No, no sir not on the job."" She said and scooted her way in and opened the binder handing Mr. Wright a packet of paper stapled together, listing the planets features and amenities, how many tennis courts there were, the amount of washer/dryer set hookups that were still functioning and that most of the planet was now electric instead of using gas for the cooker. 

""Now it is a bit of a fixer upper, but for your species price range I think it will be perfect."" She said with a great big smile.

""Hold on, you're selling that thing?"" He asked pointing over to where the planet hung next to earth, much in the same way manatees don't at a waterfall. 

""No, not selling renting it."" She explained, ""Didn't you need a new place to live for your species?""

""Wait why are you coming to me then?"" 

""Because you're Mr. Wright, from our records you've always been addressed in higher regard than the rest of your planet on a regular basis.""

""Because my first name is Mr.?""

""And you're always correct. Right Wright?"" She asked giving a little chuckle. ""Now if I could just get you to sign these forms we'll be on our way to having you're species moved in by let's say... The thirtieth?""

""I'm sorry I'm not the person to go to for this, it's um.. not my department?"" He said, now thoroughly convinced that he did not want whatever she was on.

"[WP] You find someone else's sock in your laundry hamper, to your dismay the sock turns out to be evil.",malachor708,"Stephen lived alone, so he couldn't figure out how this fluffy red sock made its way into his hamper. He had his own washing machine, so it couldn't have got mixed up at the launderette. 

Since it was a lazy day, Stephen thought there's no point in wasting a good pair of socks, he might as well wear odd ones. Without thought, he slipped the mystery sock on one foot, and a plan grey odd sock on the other.

Stephen couldn't believe his luck, this was the comfiest sock he has ever worn. Oh fuck it was comfy. He had never felt such a good fit, it was like stepping into liquid velvet. Stephen knew that today would be the best Sunday he has ever had. 

He woke up after the best sleep of his life. Monday morning, time for work. Stephen contemplated changing socks, but he decided against it. The mystery sock was too comfortable to take off. Monday was the best day at work he had ever had. He strolled through the office in absolute comfort and podiatry tranquility. His boss was so pleased by his performance, that he was given a promotion on the spot. 

After waking up on Tuesday, Stephen thought he'd better change his mystery sock. As he tried to pull off the sock, he felt resistance. ""Why can't I remove it?"" he thought, but he was tired and groggy, he couldn't think straight anyway. He examined the sock, and was sure it had grew in length. Dismissing his own insane hypothesis, he went to work and had another productive day. 

After a long day at work in his new position, Stephen locked his door and collapsed onto his couch. He hadn't even thought of the mystery sock all day, but after removing his shoes and kicking back the striking red sock caught his eye again. ""I need to remove this thing"" he thought, but it didn't budge no matter how hard he puled at the cuff. He thought this sock is definitely longer than it was on Sunday, and he begun to panic. Scissors wouldn't cut though it, he couldn't set fire to it, and maybe he was just being paranoid but he was sure the sock was getting tighter. 

Wednesday morning, and Stephen called in sick. He was too panicked to think about anything. Overnight the sock had grown again, and had darkened in colour and hardened in consistency. It looked like a cockroach's shell, but was fused to his foot. He couldn't go to the hospital, he'd be admitted to a mental hospital if he told them what has happened. Stephen tried all day to remove the sock, and drove himself mad with exertion. He fell to the floor, almost catatonic, too exhausted to manage anything.

After not phoning in for the rest of the week, Stephen's employer's became concerned. Dave, Stephen's boss, drove to his house on Friday and knocked on the door. After having no response, he tried peering into the windows but the curtains were drawn. Stephen had very few neighbours, none of whom even knew his name, but after Dave tried to pry open the door a neighbour opened her window and shout out.

""Who are you? Do I have to phone the police!?""

""No, hold on. I'm looking for Stephen Pre-""

""Who's that?"" the old woman shouted angrily, clutching her phone in her hands.

""I'm his boss, he lives here but he hasn't shown up for work fo-""

The window slammed shut. Dave wondered to himself why old people are so obstinate. He walked up to the woman's door and pressed the doorbell, but there was no answer. 

""Excuse me, I need to use your phone... Hello!?""

After a few minutes of waiting around, the old woman answered. 

""What do you want?""

""I need to use your phon-""

""I know that"" she shouted, ""but what do you want?""

Dave sighed, and and rubbed his temples with his hand.

""I need to phone the Police, Steve could be sick or-""

The old woman slammed the door. 

""I'll phone them, now go away"".

Dave walked back back to the front of Stephen's house, and tried knocking again. Eventually the Police arrived, and a fat countable heaved his way out of the car.

""Officer!"", Dave shouted, ""over here"". 

The police officer approached Dave.

""We've had reports that someone fitting your description has been bothering an old lady.""

""What? I needed to use her phone to call the police, that cantankerous old hag!""

Dave explained the situation to the officer, and the officer knocked on the front door.

""Open up, this is the Police""

""You don't think I haven't tried shouting him?""

His words fell on deaf ears. 

""Open up, or I will force my way in""

After a few more tries, the Police officer produced no different results to what Dave had been trying for the past hour. 

""Stand back"" the officer said, as he rammed his colossal weight into the door.

The door crashed open, and the smell hit them immediately. It was like sulphur, even the air was cloudy. Dave and the officer worked their way through the downstairs, but Steve was nowhere to be found. The officer suggested Dave may want to stay downstairs whilst he investigates, but Dave was too curious at this point and followed the officer upstairs. As they stood on the landing, it was dreadfully obvious where the smell was coming from. The bedroom door was ajar, and the yellow mist was coming from inside. 

The officer pulled out his flashlight, as the house's lights didn't respond. With the flashlight in his hand, he gently pushed the door open, only to reveal something inexplicable. Fused to the bed was a mess of a black hard substance. It looked similar to insect chitin, with pronounced veins and threads of black string attached to every surface. The Officer adjusted his glasses and moved his flashlight over the pile of pulsing black skin. Upon closer inspection two arms could be clearly seen sticking out of the black mess, but they were white and bony, and looked stiff and brittle. 

The Police officer was pale with disgust and slowly pulled his radio closer to his face.

My friends laugh hysterically. Jojo especially, beer bursting from his mouth. 
""Just because your socks go missing doesn't mean it's haunted!"" Jojo causes an aftershock of laughter, aided by near drunkenness. 

""I'm telling you man, I've tested it. I'd do laundry, match my socks, triple check, wake up next day, bam, unmatched socks."" I claim, finishing the last gulp of my drink.

""That is the least paranormal story I've ever heard."" Jojo says, finishing his drink. ""BUT I propose...the hauntening!"" 

""The hauntening?""  Hennessy slurs. 

""Let's go to your house, do a series of tests and witness the art of paranormality!"" Our neighbors give Jojo a 'weird' look. ""Let's get outta here before we look stupider shall we?"" 

The four of us leave the bar. 

The cab ride was short and loud...nah I drove. It was bad.

We arrive at my home, a small bungalow. Already, I could feel the same scepticism as going upstairs in the dark by myself. I thought it was odd though, I was drunk and with friends. 

""I'm not sure about this guys, we could all sleep and do it tomorrow morning instead."" I offer. 

""PUUSSSSAAAAY!"" Hennessy screams. 
""What the hell!"" I cover Hennessy's mouth. My friends laugh.

""Dicks."" I shake my head. ""Fine, let's do this shit."" 

""Wait! Rules!"" Jojo stops us at the door. 

""Goddamn, can't we just ghost hunt normally?"" Phil sighs. ""This ain't my thing."" 

""PUUSSAAYY-"" I interrupt Hennessy, covering his face. He laughs.

""No way! Tonight is special, i can feel it!"" Jojo says. 

""Could be the vomit brewing."" I reply with a grin. 

""You, house owner, shut it! Rule one, no turning on the lights! Two, one of us videos the whole thing with phone flashlights only! Three, uhh, hmm, we stick together, no jump scares. Looking at you Hen."" Jojo points at Hennessy, he smirks. 

""Let's just do this, the house is so small we'll finish this in ten minutes."" I say, unlocking the front door. 

""Wait! Rule four, one last shot before we go in."" Jojo takes out a Mickey of rum, he takes a big gulp then passes it to me. 

I take a smaller gulp and pass it to Hennessy then Phil. 

""Alright, The Hauntening!!"" Jojo claps once in excitement. 

I open the door and enter darkness. Immediately, our demeanour changes. Everyone is quiet and focused. I grab my phone and turn on the flashlight and start video recording. First thing I see is my empty living room. No signs of paranormality. My friends follow closely, almost back to chest. We check everything, I confirm everything was in their place. 

Next was the bedroom. ""This is where things keep disappearing."" I whisper as i enter my bedroom. As soon as I open the door, a thud. 

I turn around, flashing my light at Hennessy on the ground, squirming and gasping for air. ""Shit!"" I panic. Jojo tries to help him, but Hennessy was chocking. That's when I realized, a black sock was around his neck. I point it out and Jojo and Phil tried to remove it as I give them light. 

Hennessy stops moving. The sock was finally removed, like a lizard tail cut from its body. Jojo was holding the sock but it slipped out of his grip. The sock landed and slithered away. 

""What the fuck was that!"" I panic some more. ""That was a fucking sock, shit! HENNESSY, he's not moving! Oh god."" 

Phil checks a pulse then steps away, wide eyed and dropped jaw. ""He's..."" 

""Call the cops, lets get the fuck outta here!"" Jojo sprints for the door as I call 911. 

Jojo stops on his tracks, falls and squirms. A moment I wish I didn't see twice. Again the sock was around his neck. Phil and I grab it and pull full force. Ignoring the risk of injuring Jojo. The sock did not budge. I started to cry.

""Son of a..."" Jojo stops moving. ""FUCK!""

Phil falls next. I watched in horror. My friends' blue faces etched behind my eyelids. 

I froze. 

As Phil stops moving. I close my eyes. 

The sock slithered on to my chest. I opened my eyes out of pure horror to see the sock's opening glaring at me. It smiles. 




I wake up in a hospital, I could feel the warm bruises and cuts all over me. My mom and dad crying, talking to a doctor and a cop.

The doctor notices my half opened stare. ""You're awake."" 

""My friends...""

""Im...pact?""

Conner froze. What the actual hell was that? He turned slowly to look at his laundry hamper. The lid slowly opened and out popped a sock.

""Hello.""

""Uh... hi?"" Conner replied very confused by the fact that there was a talking sock before him. He thought hard, did he own a talking sock? No. This is definitely the first time he'd ever spoken to a sock. Even weirder, the sock had a small little moustache. ""How are you talking?""

""With my mouth."" The sock replied, puzzled by the dumb question.

""That's not normal,"" Conner snaps back.

""How do you talk?"" The sock asked.

""Uh, with my mouth.""

""Seems normal to me then."" The sock was getting impatient, tired of this ignorant buffoon talking to him. He had things to do. ""Look buddy, how big is your oven?""

""My oven?""

""Yes your oven. How big is the damn oven?""

Conner pondered the random question, ""It's like the size of a normal oven, I guess.""

""So pretty big right?""

""I guess. You can fit a whole chicken in there.""

""A chicken?!"" The sock shouted, startling Conner. ""That's nothing. Ugh, it'll have to do.""

""Have to do for what? Why do you need my oven?""

The sock jumped out of the hamper. His moustache gave him a menacing look. ""I need to kill the Jews.""

Conner's eyes widened to extreme lengths, not in horror but in excitement. ""Well why didn't you say so?""

"[WP] You find someone else's sock in your laundry hamper, to your dismay the sock turns out to be evil.",malachor708,"Jake awoke to the annoying ring of his alarm clock. He shifted off his back and on to his side to see the time.


8:48


That wasn't good. He only had 12 minutes to get out the door and on to his bus. The only bus that came to this suburb just outside the small town of Oakridge. 

The next bus wouldn't come for an hour. Jake realized quickly, jumping out of bed. He sniffed himself. Relatively clean. He had, after all, showered several days earlier. 


8:49


He turned and looked into the full length mirror in his room. And by full length mirror, I mean the reflective surface of his gaming PC. Jake wasn't the best looking fellow. Let's be honest here. He was pretty below average today. 

Scraggly stubble and unkempt hair accented his strangely shaped head. The same head which awkwardly sat atop his scrawny body. A scrawny body that barely filled out a small graphic tee and some boxer briefs. And one sock. 


""Where the fuck is my other sock?!"" Jake exclaimed incredulously. He looked around bewildered. 


8:50


Jake scurried to his dresser, hoping to find a new sock. Perhaps he'd find a pair of pants as well. It is this narrators opinion that Jake should have focused first on locating something to cover his chicken legs before searching for a second sock. It just would have been more efficient. Are you with me here? 


8:54 


Jake spent four minutes searching to no avail. Pantsless still, he resorted to the least savory option. This time he didn't hurry. After all, what kind of foul creature would hasten themselves to rummage through a dirty hamper?


8:55


Jake reached a hand into the pile of unwashed clothing. He already had one sock, so he just needed to find one more. His school had formally stopped sock inspections in the 1930s so they didn't even have to match. 

However, this was not to be a simple affair for Jake. He grabbed a sock only to find it resembled a bio hazard more than a sweater for his feet. His socks stunk. Some were crusty. So on he rummaged. 


8:57


Jake grabbed me. I had hidden myself at the bottom of the hamper. Hoping to get up to all sorts of misdeeds while he was away, this left me a bit dismayed. He forced himself inside me while I kept quiet. My narration of our story slowing to a whisper. 

I was disappointed. I had gone to all that trouble to set his alarm off late.  I had even ""disposed"" of the other sock. But I never calculated that this nitwit mongrel would have the wherewithal to locate a replacement sock. Let alone that he would usurp my -

""Dude shut the fuck up already. People are looking at us"". Jake muttered stamping his foot on the floor of the bus.

Everything was fine and went as planned, until I got back up to my room. I looked down into the pile of clothes, freshly clean and still warm from the high-heat dryers. Right on top of the pile sat a light blue sock that I had never seen before, cushioned in the heel and made of a very soft fabric. I wasn't sure how the sock had gotten into my clothes, since I hadn't seen it as I was removing my clothes from the dryer and no one had been near me or my laundry at all.

I went to pick up the sock and right as my hand was about to close around it, a voice:

""Don't.""

Startled, I looked up, expecting to see Ben standing in the doorway, possessing some knowledge I didn't about the origins of this sock. But there was no one. The apartment was empty. It was just me and this sock. I looked around again. ""Hello?""

A pause, and then ""Good Afternoon.""

I was scared for my life at this point, because I had no idea where this sound could possibly be coming from. I looked back at the sock. Was I going crazy, or had the sock shifted position a little bit, right at the opening where your foot would go? It couldn't be. 

""Well, are you going to say anything?"" This time it was unmistakable. I saw the opening of the sock move like a mouth, as if it was talking. I started searching my body for any evidence at all that I had been drugged. Then it came again, more irritated this time.

""Well?"" I stood there, my mouth wide open in disbelief. After what felt like forever, I finally spoke. 

""What... are you?"" I muttered, conscious of the wavering and cracking in my voice.

""I'm a sock, dumbass. What are you?""

""Um, I-I'm a human""

""Oh gross. I hate humans and their stupid feet and their stupid shoes and sweat and WALKING UGH it's exhausting.""

""Yeah, t-totally. We suck, man... If you don't mind me asking, how does that work?""

""How does what work?""

""The talking. None of my socks talk.""

""Well I'm not one of your socks, am I foot-monster?""

""No, I guess you're not""

""Damn right I'm not. Now I've got some needs to be met before I can let you go.""

""Let me go? You're a sock, what are you gonna do?"" I headed for the door to my room, hoping that someone in one of the adjacent suites was there so I could show this to someone else and prove to myself I wasn't losing my mind. But before I could get past my pile of laundry, I felt something choking me. I reached up to my neck only to feel pillowy cotton, contorting itself as if it was made of pure muscle. I looked down and my laundry bag and the sock is gone. I struggle to get the sock off my neck, but there is nothing for me to grasp as my vision becomes spotty and slowly fades, taking my consciousness with it. 

I awoke in a hospital bed with a brace on my neck. The doctors said that I had been found by one of my neighbors living on the floor below me—apparently she had heard me yell and knock my printer off my desk and called 911. My vocal cords had minor damage but I would be released later that afternoon. *So I spent the night here*. I thought, looking around. As my gaze wandered around the room, I noticed a two light blue objects at the foot of my bed. I hadn't been wearing socks last night, I knew that much. I looked closer, squinting because I was without my glasses.

On my right foot was the sock, the reason I was here. The distinct coffee-like stain on the big toe identified it as the one that had wrapped itself around my neck until I turned blue. But when I shifted my gaze to my other foot, there was the matching sock. The evil sock's partner had somehow found it's way to my left foot and put itself right on. I reached down to take them off, but they were stuck. They wouldn't come off, or even move. They weren't uncomfortable on my feet, but when I tried to take them off with my hands it was like trying to take off a plaster cast. 

Everything was normal, I was discharged and headed back to campus, but once I got back, rather than head inside to my dorm, I started walking in the other direction. I wanted to go back up to 1001 but my feet were taking me down West End like they were being controlled by someone else. Luckily I have my phone, computer, and all my chargers with me in my backpack, but they are of little use to me except to browse twitter and find out where I am. The socks somehow have control of my legs, I walk all day, only stopping in a random fast food restaurant for 30 mins twice a day. While inside I have control of my legs and can order food and get something to drink, but if I try to leave or take the socks off, they take back control and force me to walk to their beat. 

I have been westward bound for three days, confused and scared. I'm too afraid to say anything about this to anyone else, and the one time I managed to get a family friend in Dickson to pick me up—literally, they had to pick me up and throw me in a car—I just escaped later that night against my will, running at full speed until I collapsed from exhaustion and covered myself in pre-chewed pork tenderloin. I don't know where I'm going or if I'm ever coming back, but one thing is for certain. The socks are getting their revenge, and it is pungent. ",3spoopy5mii

Temperature, heart rate, progress, all of it was glanced over and double-checked. Beyond the monitor were even more computer screens, each with a man observing data listlessly. The electronic sounds of the machines permeated the air, broken up occasionally by quiet exchanges of scientific jargon.

At the far end of the room was a door, sealed with several locks. They clicked loudly, and the door silently opened inward. A gaunt young man, a new hire named Albert, walked out. Albert silently lurched toward Gerhardt before taking his place next to him. Gerhardt glanced over, worried. Albert was new to this operation, there were many who quit because they saw thing things that he did. They were never the same afterward.

""Are you alright, my friend?"" Gerhardt asked, trying to make eye contact with the defeated-looking young man. Albert continued to stare at his screen, almost oblivious to his surroundings. Gerhardt was about to give up and go back to his observations, when Albert finally responded.

""How long has the battle of the Somme been going on?""

Gerhardt was taken back by the topic. ""Well, I have to guess maybe several months now."" he replied. ""Why do you ask?""

""How many people have died in that battle?""

""What are you getting at, Albert?""

""Just answer the question.""

""If I had to guess, maybe several hundred-thousand specimens."" 

Albert's face darkened. ""Specimens."" he echoed in disgust. ""We should not use that word."" Gerhardt sighed, he knew where this line of conversation was going.

""My friend, you have to let it go. If you let the specimens into your heart you will only go to a dark place."" Gerhardt said somberly.

""No, it's not right!"" Albert shouted. What quiet conversation there was in the room stopped. ""The men we send into that meatgrinder are people too!"" Albert stood up. Gerhardt rose with him, his arms raised in an attempt to pacify the young scientist. Albert, however, would not be placated. ""We don't even bother training them properly, we just teach them how to shoot, reload, and follow general orders. This isn't a war anymore, Gerhardt. This is a perverted testing ground for the governments.""

""Albert--"" 

""Gerhardt, I cannot take this. Every time I go into that room, I look into their eyes. They are just as human as you are me. We are committing crimes against humanity!"" Albert began to shake. ""What gives us the right to throw them away like they're garbage?"" 

Gerhardt placed a hand on Albert's shoulder. ""It is what they were made to do, Albert. We tamed the wolf to serve as a companion, shackled the livestock animals to serve as food. This is no different."" He said gently. Albert shoved Gerhardt's hand away. 

""These are human beings, Gerhardt. Not lambs to the slaughter."" he replied. Albert took off his lab coat and threw it to the ground. Without another word, he stormed out.",Tonguesten

"[WP] As a kid, you kept a ""wish diary"" writing once per day what you wanted to happen. Twenty years later, everything you had written starts coming true. The problem is your childhood had been a rough one...",uragiruhito,"It was the therapist who suggested it. Dr Marlow. She suggested it would be easier to control my ‘outbursts’ (as she called them) if I could focus on the future and what I wanted from life, rather than just the present ‘issues’.

That’s how it began. But this is how it ends.

I started noticing things last month. Little things at first, thing that made me just a little bit happier that day but that didn’t really make a big impact. A couple of coins found on the floor, new books left for me at work, free lunches at work. But it was the arrival of Lola that reminded me of the diary.

Lola showed up last week, a tiny spaniel puppy just staring up at me from my doorstep with those big brown eyes and a heart name tag. As I brought her inside, I was somewhat jolted by the memory that came flooded back;  7 year old me sitting on the doorstep of the rundown bungalow my family called home, wishing for a better place. I remembered how I had opened the battered notebook Dr Marlow had given me and written “I wish Lola was real”. Lola was the only toy I had, a golden pup that had seen better days. Staring down at the ‘real’ Lola, I told myself it was just a coincidence. Nevertheless, I dug out the wish diary.

I ran my fingers over the torn cover, and smiled as I thought of how much effort I put into writing in this diary. I was allowed to write down one wish a day, so I put a lot of thought into each wish. It was over twenty years since I’d last even looked at this diary.

Day 16) I wish Lola was real

I read 7 year old me’s writing and then looked down at Lola curled up in my lap. She did look very similar to the Lola from my childhood. I read through some of the other entries. Some in particular stood out to me.


Day 1) I wish I had some pocket money

Day 6) I wish I had some books to read

Day 10) I wish lunches were free so that I could eat

Okay this was getting weird. I scanned through some of the other dates. It would be ridiculous to think that the wishes in my wish diary were coming true…right?


Day 11) I wish I had enough money to eat nice food

Well that one’s difficult to evaluate, I’ve got a steady job now. Of course I've got enough money to eat nicely. 


Day 13) I wish I had nice clothes like all the other girls

Why was past me so vague?


Day 15) I wish I could go out with someone cute

I guess that barista yesterday had a nice smile? And he had written his phone number on my coffee cup.


Day 17) I wish James would get a job.

I remembered writing that one down. I was still in school but James had finished a year before - he was supposed to be occupying his time looking for jobs but instead he sat at home and watched whatever rubbish was on TV. This meant that by the time I got home from school he was ready to torment someone…

But that was the end of the big conspiracy; James getting a job was never going to happen. James was the biggest waste of space in my family yet, somehow being even more useless than my mother. Despite being six years older than me, he had never held down a job, the longest stint being a fortnight at a coffee shop down the road, before he attacked one of the customers. I sighed. Why did I even think there was anything to this? Of course wish diaries don’t come true. It was just a way for therapists to focus children’s minds.

The next day I returned from work and opened the door to Lola jumping around. I’ll admit, it was nice to have someone at home to greet me. Although I’d bought dog food for her, I needed to seriously consider what I was going to do about her. I didn’t have the resources to look after a dog, let alone a puppy who needed constant attention.

The phone ringing interrupted my thoughts. I glanced at the called ID before answering.

“James?” We hadn’t spoken in years. For good reason.

“Hey little sis. Before you hang up-” He sounded…happy? I’d heard him sounding joyful, usually when torturing a cat or something, but I’d never heard the smile in his voice like now. “Before you hang up, I want you to know that I’m really sorry for everything that happened in our childhood. I was a dick. Especially to you. But I want you to know that I’ve turned myself around, I’ve turned my life around. I’ve got a job, it’s a full time job with good pay and everything” pause. He obviously took my silence as distrust, rather than shock, and sighed. “Okay, just… if you ever want to catch up, I’m a different person now” The line beeped. 

So that was odd. I noticed where I’d left the book, opening it and flicking through. It couldn’t be real. My wishes couldn’t really be coming true, could they? Nothing out of the ordinary had happened today, which put a stop to the ‘one wish a day’ idea.

I read what I’d written on Day 18 and dropped the diary in horror. I closed my eyes but those six words were permanently etched into my brain.  Nine words carved angrily with a biro into the fragile paper with all the frustration and anger of a small child who hated the world around her.

Dad's life was finally going really well for him. 

""Wouldn't miss it for the world,"" I said, ""I need some quality time with my new brother after all."" 

At 6, my father left me and my mother to fend for ourselves. He said he needed to find himself. We were broken. Hopeless. Lost. I wouldn't see him for another 8 years. 

When I was 14 and Dad wanted to show how much was sorry, how much he cared, I was in utter disbelief. I was a teenager, filled with angst and hate for this person who had abandoned us. 

Now, at 26, I pulled up to my Dad's house, which he had just bought with his beloved wife, Ann, so their new family could be comfortable. 

I knocked at the door. 

""Georgie is that you?"" I heard a familiar soft, low voice call. 

I gave my Dad a big hug and said hello to Ann. 

""He's beautiful, Dad.""

After several hours of relaxing with Dad and his family, Ann and the baby went to sleep. We were alone now.

""George, I've decided to move back in with you and Mom.""

I was taken aback. What the fuck was going on? 

""Dad, are you high? You have a fantastic life!"" 
He replied somberly. ""I have never been so sober in my whole life."" 
""Well I don't bloody live with Mom now, and even if I did, we wouldn't want you back there!"" 

I left without saying anything else, hoping that by morning, my father would gain some clarity on the situation. 

As I was walking out of my Calc 3 class the next day, my father was in the parking lot, hazard lights on, calling to get me: ""Georgie! It's me! We're gonna get ice cream and go home!"" 

I felt a wave of deja vu. What was going on? Was my father developing a mental illness? ",Nuwser
"[WP] As a kid, you kept a ""wish diary"" writing once per day what you wanted to happen. Twenty years later, everything you had written starts coming true. The problem is your childhood had been a rough one...",uragiruhito,"
After we finished a mostly silent dinner with my wife trying to make small talk with me and my father scowling at me, after, we retired to the living room. 
My wife dug through it and pulled out various toys, stuffed animals, action figures and other few fond memories of my childhood.  The last item was a spiral bound notebook.  JERY’s JURNAL , KEEP OUT. Was written across the front in black permanent marker. 

The first few pages were mostly drawings. I hurried through them, I knew the contents, me bleeding, daddy drinking, mommy being scared and all kinds of monsters. I loved monsters at that age. The rest were mostly me writing about the boring parts of the day. Bike riding, and what I was doing in school. 
I flipped to the latter part of the book. I remembered this part now. Someone had told me if you write down wishes and thought about them really hard they would come true. I had written my first wish here. “I wish for a pony that would live in my yard and tell me it loves me!” 

My jaw dropped. I couldn’t believe what I had wrote. My mind flashed, it wasn’t possible. I had just heard that in the yard. The pony was a run away, right? I kept trying to convince myself. My wife looked over “See Jerry, you wanted a pony too!”, she awkwardly laughed. I kept trying to find the words to try to make myself understand. I shrugged it off, maybe it was just a coincidence and maybe I did make up the pony saying “I love you”.

I flipped the page. 

“I wish I could eat ice cream and play video games all day”. I had scrawled out in childish writing. My wife chuckled. “See even as a kid that’s all you wanted to do, just like the other day”. I dropped the book. This was two in a row that had come true. I sat stunned my mouth dropped staring at my father across the table. He kept glaring at me, with snarled lips. His animosity never ended.

I closed the book snap shut and said I was tired and didn’t want to continue. I felt drunk and woozy, everything I wished for I had gotten. My wife refused saying we were just getting started. 

She picked up the book and opened it to where my wishes began, she flipped forward to a new page. There was a dark drawing taking up the large majority of the page. Brooding fangs, red eyes, dark fur, and muscular. It was only the drawing of a child, but still something seemed other worldly about it. 

I remembered now when I drew this monster, and why I drew it on my birthday. It was that night when I saw it. Hair slicked back from the rain in a wild tangled mess. Even then he was physically intimidating even to a grown man.  He smelled of cheap booze and staggered in. My mom rushed to him after he walked into the living room. She pleaded with him to go to bed, that it was my special day, and he couldn’t ruin it. I still remember it. He had hit her before, but this was different. He didn’t stop. He kept hitting and hitting until he turned crimson. She was paler and bloody, she wasn’t moving. He saw me watching from the living room. Rushing after me he tripped on a toy and slipped knocking his head into a table. I ran.

I barely made it up the steps and into the attic. I was able to lock myself into the cupboard, like mom told me to sometimes. The only things I kept in there were my journal and crayons for coloring. He howled and screamed and stomped around the house, telling me he was going to find me. It was in that cupboard I thought of the monster and drew him. Almost twenty years to this day. 
The grotesque drawing filled most of the page. Below it was my handwriting in red crayon. “I wish a monster would come eat my dad”, it read. I dropped the book. I looked across the table. My father looked at me unable to speak, just a look of fear in his eyes. 

I heard the long growl behind me. I felt the moisture on the back of my neck of hot breath. I could feel the weight of whatever it was on the floorboards. The house creaked as it moved. My wife screamed and fainted.

It moved slowly and purposefully towards the old man in the wheelchair. I put my hands over my eyes and barely opened them. I could see part of it; twice the size of any human, strong with brooding muscles, tangles of fur, piercing red eyes and fangs like a sabretooth.  A small puddle formed underneath the wheelchair and the old man had a look of sadness and finality in his eyes.

The great beast opened its’ jaws wide  and clamped them down in one swoop. The crushing gnaws of bone, blood, and grey matter, splattered over the carpet, walls, and ceiling. Here sat a lifeless torso in a wheelchair. My father, no more. Just like that, the monster vanished. Gone, left with only gore and fear in its wake. 

I sat stunned , frightened, my wife still unconscious. Blood covered most the living room and I sat stunned. No one would ever believe this. It was insane, impossible. But I was no stranger to this violence, I had seen a monster do this thing almost twenty years ago. Instead of jaws, he used hands, just as violent just as much blood.

What else had I wished for? What else was yet to come to this macabre week? I turned the page from the monster drawing to the final page of my journal. In black permanent marker I had written. 

“I wish I never existed”.

Confused by what she had asked I woke and walked over to the window quickly dressing. I looked down in the yard and sure enough there was a pony gently chewing grass. A bizarre sight for our quiet suburb. 

“I don’t know, maybe one of the neighbors kid’s had a party and it got away from the handlers.”, I added trying to believe my own story. I started to make my way down stairs. Opening the front door I walked out. Eerie, no sounds of children laughing or other signs of a kids’ party. I walked out and the pony just looked at me , then continued to eat grass. No tags, no other signs of ownership. 
After returning from the garage with some rope I gently formed a loose leash and brought the pony through the fence into the backyard. I untied him and he gently continued to chew grass, seemingly unfazed by the move. I turned to go back inside. 

“I love you”. 

I stopped. Did I hear that correctly? I looked up and thought maybe it was my wife in the window. Nope, shut tight. I looked back and the pony was just eating grass, same as always. Maybe I was just hearing things. 

I walked back into the kitchen, my wife was making coffee. I poured myself a cup. “I’m going to call a couple of those companies, if I don’t get a hold of anyone I’m going to call animal control.”

“But honey, I’ve always wanted a pony since I was a little girl”, she replied.  “Me, too.”, I assured her. It was strange, when I was a kid I had wanted a pony. Now I had one and it seemed like a nuisance.  I called a around and no responses. Eventually animal patrol showed up and took the pony away. They thought it was strange since none had been reported missing in the area. Later that night, I was lying in bed thinking about how bizarre the whole morning was, as if it didn’t seem real. I lay awake while my wife slept and eventually drifted off to sleep.

I woke to my wife screaming in my face, shaking me. “What is it?”, I asked furiously. “You were having a nightmare. You know the ones you always have.”, she told me climbing off , exhausting her breath and laying down.  “Was it your dad again?”, she asked.
 
“Yeah, he wouldn’t stop”, He never stopped in my nightmares. 

“Well he can’t do anything anymore”, she said while slowly dozing off. 

The next morning, I woke early, no pony in the yard. So far, so good. I went downstairs and began to play a game on the computer. I lost myself in playing, it happened from time to time. Eventually I got hungry and decided to go eat. I walked to the fridge, it was empty.  Did she throw them all out? We just went to the grocery store a few days ago. 

I checked the freezer, it was full of ice cream! Always the sweet tooth, I grabbed a spoon and begun to dig in. There was nothing else to eat. Not hearing my wife up I returned to playing another game on the computer. I hadn’t even noticed it, but I was starting to fall asleep. I kept nodding off. I walked out of the office, it was almost 10 o’clock.  I went to the fridge to eat and there still was no food. I dug out another spoon an date the rest of the ice cream and crawled up to bed. 

“Have you been playing video games and eating ice cream all day?” She asked annoyed as I crawled into bed. I hadn’t realized it but I had. “I kept calling for you but you didn’t respond”, she said coldly. I felt bad, how did I let the day get away from me? I had plans.

I slept fitfully. More nightmares, this time it was my dad with me and my mom was the one taking it this time, she would never wake up after this one.  It was always the same; I could smell the booze, the leather, the blood, the sweat and tears. I woke up, tears streaming down my face. I couldn’t stop crying. I walked downstairs and slept on the couch.

Eventually my wife woke me up in the morning. She knew when I was in the living room it had been a hard, long, scary, night. “Do you know what today is?”, she asked me smiling. I had forgotten all about it. It was one of my least favorite days of the year. 

“Yeah”, I had replied. 

My birthday. 

There was a box on the table in front of me. It was full of dusty old reminders from my childhood. I looked at it, a reminder of what I had hated. 
“I brought it down for the party. I figured it might be fun to dig through it and share some old treasures. Don’t look through it until later. Now help me get ready.” , she had said from upstairs. 

We spent the afternoon cleaning and prepping the house. I never had told her the truth of what happened. She always tried her best to make it a special day for me. It was only going to be a small gathering of family, not my favorite company. It had taken years of therapy for me to finally be able to be in the same room with my father. It helped that he couldn’t move without his wheelchair, and the stroke had taken care of his ability to talk. Silent and helpless, just the way me and my mother had been.

[WP] A character commits suicide in order to go to Hell and kill the Devil.,ArtThenMusic,"""A permanent solution to a temporary problem.""  If only. 

Dear friends and family, you must understand why I've done this. 

Whether religious or not, your afterlife accommodations are based on merit. This fact is likely to enrage many pious, god fearing sorts who think their ticket to heaven is taking everything biblical as straight-forward instruction on how to live. But luckily for the funeral protesting sorts, some good people, people who aren't necessarily theist, can still get sent into a fiery abyss. People who are afflicted with insufferable pain or even less suffer-able numbness. People whose only answer to the trials of this world are to put themselves out of this world. Those who commit suicide. 

And that's what she did, Faith. She didn't have the insight I do, because I've gotten that insight from her. She didn't understand that 30 too many painkillers wouldn't end her suffering. They sent her to a place of unending suffering, a place that magnifies any negative perceptions into an unending gloom. People don't kill themselves because of physical hurt - it's almost always because of a mental anguish. An amplified sense of self conscious, a worthlessness, a disappointment.  The place is hell. In hell, the worst feelings of life are constantly active. 

I know she's suffering. She comes to me every night while I sleep and tells me what's going on there. It's not pretty. She's become hard to talk to, which is understandable, I suppose, considering. I still talk to her, though, every night. It's not for me, it's for her. 

Last night, our talk was different. There's an uproar in hell, apparently. Faith tells me that the it seems the Devil has lost his touch. Hell seems to be looking for new management. I hope this gives you an understanding of why I've decided to go. I don't expect to see you again.

Farewell,
Jeremy

It's dark, hell, and uncomfortably hot. It's not what you usually hear though, there isn't fire everywhere, or wailing souls. I get the feeling that most people here don't really understand where they are, or why. I suppose that alone is its own kind of hell. There's not like an introduction, or job assignments. Only this dark, hot and crowded cave-like room full of confused people who weren't quite good enough in their first life. I understand why most of them have stayed here, near the entrance of hell. Without a specific mission in mind, motivation is extremely low here.

In fact, pretty much everything that drives people is extremely low here. Since my arrival, melancholy has been more prevalent than ever before, even after Faith's suicide. But I know why I'm here. That's more than most others down here have, and that's all that's moved me from the entry-way which was a cave-like tunnel with a small exit on the far side, into mainland hell. It's a little brighter here, but still hard to see. It feels like my eyes won't adjust. 

The people in this place are more active. Some are moving around, some are talking. I overheard a conversation about the very reason I came: the Demons are beginning to lose respect for the Devil. I'm unclear on why that is yet, but it provides me an opening. If I can kill the Devil, maybe some democracy can be established here. People can suffer less, and have a purpose. 

This won't be easy though, from what I can tell there's only one way to kill the Devil. Pierce his heart with something sharp made from obsidian. Where do you get something made of obsidian in hell? I know of just one place: on the Devil himself. There are three options, he has two sharp horns on his head, and a sharply pointed tail. To kill the Devil in his own kingdom, I have to use his own extremities. A terrifying task, but one with unprecedented reward. 

I don't know where to find Faith down here, but I need to. She knows how to get around, considering she's been here for over 8 months. Mainland hell is in a quincunx shape and the Devil's throne is in the middle. Hell isn't 9 circles, or whatever Dante would have you believe, but rather one simple level, that's immense. The four outside circles are each ruled by one of the Devil's four most trusted Demons, the same ones who have been acting up. 

The one that the entryway dumped me off into is ruled by Spem. Within Spem's domain all hope is lost. An unshakable feeling of hopelessness pervades my spirit, and seemingly the spirit of all those around me. I've never seen a more morose bunch, I hear nothing but wallowing. Everyone in this circle is doomed because they've made it this far, achieved nothing, and given up. But I haven't, and I won't. I've done my research, I know about Spem. He will grant me passage if I can prove my worth. He always has tests ready, and these tests can be as challenging as fighting one of his toughest demon warriors or as simple as answering a riddle. Most people don't attempt these, though, because of the consequence. Either you win, or you get a fate worse than hell. Either way, I do not doubt that my determination will get me through. As I get nearer to Spem, though, my determination is fading and hopelessness is implanting itself in every cell of my body. This is why it's so hard to get past him - no matter what test he presents, it's rare to have enough confidence remaining to pass it. I'll see what he has in store for me.

""Spem - I demand entrance to the next circle. Give me my test and let me go on my way."" That was the entirety of my remaining confidence, but I tried not to show that. The amount I mustered up was obviously enough to surprise Spem's gigantic ugly demon mug, as he turn towards me his expression was beguiled. 
""A newcomer - how enticing. Unfortunately, there is no hope for you. Because Hell is going through delicate times right now, no further entrance is admitted."" 
""You must give me the test! If I can't get through, then I've come to Hell for no reason.""
""You came to Hell? As if it's a choice. You're not here for a reason, you're here because your life had no reason. Go ahead and move along now.""
My hope was nearly depleted when I had an idea. I've always heard Spem never turns down a real challenge.
""Let's reverse the roles. I'll give you my test, I've prepared a riddle.""
""This is atrocious, little man. You, and all of your species are the same. Arrogant creatures, you are. Foolish, too. Not a combination likely to help you defeat a demon. Demon's are clever, don't you know? You will not be able to fool me, small man. As soon as I answer your riddle, I will crush you. I agree to your terms. Hell is a joyride compared to where you'll be when I'm done with you.""
""Not so fast there, Spem. Here it is:
What drives men to drink, if only once a month?
What makes people give up their money, with nothing but uncertainty in return?
What makes people feel safe going to sleep at night?
And finally, what could make someone take their own life, knowing they'd be sent to a place of eternal damnation?""
""Men drink for numbness, or for pleasure. But only once a month? Likely to be just a casual drink.""
""Great assessment.""
""Not done yet - They give up their money with nothing but uncertainty, give up their money to what, though? Are they giving it to friends? The same friends they drink with, perhaps.""
""Perhaps.""
""Why do they feel safe going to sleep? Because they are content with themselves. Or do you mean safe, literally? Or safe from worry?""
""You may be on to something.""
""You lost me on the last one. Why someone would be intentionally sent to eternal damnation is beyond me. So this thing, whatever it may be, make men drink once a month, give up their money uncertainly, feel safe going to bed, and then kill themselves to be damned eternally. You do know this needs a reasonable conclusion, right?"" 
""It does, Spem. Don't worry. It was created by my feeble human mind, I'm sure you can get there.""
""Don't patronize me, I will solve this. You're no better than I am.""

[WP] Create as many characters as you want. The catch? You can only develop their personalities through what they do during a bar fight.,DJ_Incognito,"Tom had always had a quick wit. Tom realized too late he hadn’t the reflexes to match. The karmic reckoning of a life time of one liners, last words, and snide asides exploded into his chin. Sheryl’s yelp, heard, but face unseen, had the explosion caused blinding pain? He panicked hands flying defensively to his face only to find his glasses knocked off. Hands up now, scared from the pain, angry at his new found inadequacies, he concentrated on his blurry opponent’s next volley.

How did Manny feel? As Manny exploded past the first hick, the one he knew was going to hit Tom seconds before even the hick did, Manny felt like a million fuckin’ bucks, man. As he charged the taller hick, 6 months of bullshit turned into jet fuel right fuckin’ quick. The time he wasted filling out dozens of online forms he made up for now, getting in close to the big guy before he could use his long arms to shut him out. The frustration of tax forms, lying on his resume, making in a month what he used to make in a week bunched his fists, driving one into the guy’s unprotected side. His nerves, rubbed raw by ten hour days, and the Red Bull that he needed for those ten hour days, and the vodka he’d ordered with his Red Bull tonight, saw the big guy’s first swing and he was able to dodge back, ready to go for the knees, only way to bring down a big fucker, man. 

Eric was leaning up against the end of the bar, making idle conversation with one of the regulars, an old man with old eyes almost too rheumy to ogle the bartender as she refilled his glass. Eric knew later the old man would take to drooping, then sleeping, then stumbling as Eric helped him into a cab, but he didn’t mind, taking the idle conversation as trade. Most bouncers will tell you idle is idyllic, and the ones who don’t, aren’t ones you want to work with. He took interest of course, when the jukebox in the back room cut mid-song, from country to pop, and grew annoyed when the song sparked an argument, and was full on pissed off by the time that argument became a fight. Eric marched toward the back, drawing up every inch of his considerable size into an imposing figure, not rushing, rushing is how you got hurt, but loud and authoritative leading with his right side, shielding a bum left knee. When he played ball in school, most of his protecting meant pushing away, now, moving toward an older guy swinging away at some young hipster, he was mostly pulling people apart.

Shit, Howard’s side hurt, and he felt stupid. Stupid for letting that little Mexican kid get him so good, stupid for even comin’ over with Kenny in the first damn place. Some girl changes the fuckin song, Kenny gets mad, madder than he already was, anyhow, and now Howard’s side hurts. His knee hurts too, and it’s only gonna hurt more tomorrow when he’s walkin’ around the jobsite. His hand hurts, but that’s all right, cuz he’s guessin’ that the Mexican’s head’s still ringing. Now that it’s over he nods towards the kid, the kid nods back. The bouncer’s dragging Kenny towards the exit. Howard limps after. Backing up shitty friends in a shitty situation. The glasses guy checks his fat lip, once, then again, from where he cowered the second the bouncer started yelling. “Well, guess I’m not comin’ back here” Howard says, mostly to himself, with a little laugh. The laugh makes his side hurt.

You can only develop their personalities through what they do during a bar fight.,DJ_Incognito,"The first thing Max noted as he stepped into the bar was the still open bottle of Bintang hurtling towards his blonde haired head leaving a stream of wasted beer. The second thing he noticed was the woman that threw the bottle of beer at him. Max ducked the bottle and tried to step aside. 

-----

""Shit I missed that blonde bastard! Who the even is that blonde bastard?"" Jellena, a svelte Swedish woman, cursed as she sauntered over towards Max. The first thing she noticed as she made it half way through the room was the fist coming her way. ""Shit! Right, still in a damned bar fight."" She said as she tried to duck the meaty slab of a fist. The second thing she noticed was the absolute size of the man currently swinging at her.

----

Nolan laboured to breath as he tried to punch the shit out of the girl that was taller than him. 
""This is for saying no, bitch!"" he bellowed forcibly as he kicked at her. Unfortunately Nolan was too large for one leg to support him. 

---- 

Max winced sympathetically as he heard the sound of cracking bone and ducked around to puke over a divider, right into the lap of a twig of a man. *Oh shit, of course I had to puke onto someone. At least he's not that large* Max thought as he began to stutter an apology.
""H-h-hey man, I'm s-sorry. B-b-it drunk, y-y-yanno?""

---- 

The first thing Henry noticed as he stood up to allow the vomit to roll off of his lap was that the man responsible for the foul fluid was speaking. He smiled at the man and shook his head, pointed to his mouth and covered his ears. Henry, being mute, often didn't have much to do at these places - therefore he would observe the people in them. The second thing Henry noticed was that there seemed to be something off about the room. *Bien sûr, il y a quelque chose hors de la salle , il est actuellement l'hébergement d'un combat de bar!* Henry thought as he tried to spot what it was that kept bugging him. 

--- 

Jellena looked down at the behemoth who propositioned her earlier as he lay on the ground and moaned. Not above petty squabbles she kicked him in the nuts, and then continued over towards the other side of the room, as she noticed the blonde man moving around the room. *Gdje ti je sada plava malo govno?* What Jellena didn't notice was the same thing that Henry failed to notice.

--- 

*Well I definitely fucked this one up. Look at that, my leg is definitely broken. Well.. What now? Maybe I can get my phone..* Nolan reached into his pocket slowly, careful not to jostle his leg any more than necessary. Nonetheless he had trouble containing his yells.

--- 

The first thing Michelle noticed as she walked back in from the bathroom dragging a woman by the hair was the banshee-like wailing ""Oi! Ya cantankerous wanker, shut yer bloody shrieks, would ya? Bloody 'ell yo're like to shatta' glass ye are!"" Michelle yelled across the bar as she slammed her fist into some redheaded woman's gut. ""Ha! One bloody point fer Auzz!"" The second thing Michelle noticed was that the redhead was surprisingly strong. *Oh shite.* 

--- 


Natalie stepped through the faded brown doors of the Wild West Saloon themed bar and was immediately accosted a drunken blonde man as he stumbled out in haste. The second thing she noticed was a rather thin, yet firm fist connecting with her cheek, the last thing she noticed before she passed out was *him*. 

--- 

""Where are ya, Blondie!?"" Jellena yelled as she stumbled outside shaking her wrist in order to get the feeling back in. *That woman had a really tough cheek, damn.* 

---

""Hey.. man.. I'm at the Bacchanalian Shindy.. yeah, the place really lives up to its name, I know, yeah, on Scrimmage Street. Listen, I think, ahh shit, I've broke.. broken my leg. Pick me up.. please? Thank you."" *Thank God* Nolan thought, as he lay back to wait he finally noticed *him*. 

--- 

Henry continued to watch the loud and frankly gorgeous Australian woman beat the living shit out of the redhead she had been holding onto for the last five minutes. ""Hey man, how do I approach Australian girls?"" Henry signed towards his friend, Henrietta (pure coincidence). 

---

Henrietta looked at Henry quizzically and smiled as she realised what he was on about. ""Oh, we're easy, love, especially bogans. Go over there and punch her."" Henrietta said, trying her best to hide her giggle. 

--- 

Henry looked at Henrietta dubiously and then looked back at the Australian girl. *Well, she is gorgeous, and she certainly can take care of herself.. What the hell, I'm drunk, I'm stupid enough as it is when sober.* 

--- 

Henrietta bit her tongue in order to prevent her outburst of laughter. ""Oh shit! He's actually going to do it,"" She wheezed as she struggled to breathe, ""oh, he's so fucked!"" 

--- 

Michelle was still driving her knee in between the redhead's legs as she noticed the well kept and stoic looking man approach her. Then she felt his fist connect with her gut. *Ohhh! That was good..* she thought as she turned on him, letting go of the nameless redhead, and kissed the man.

---

*Holy shit! No way! It actually worked?* Henrietta thought as she failed to contain her laughter. It pealed off into the wind of the bar akin to the falling clink of golden coins. Henrietta's laughter came to a sudden stop, however, when she noticed *him* sitting down across the booth from her. 

--- 

*Shit this girl is crazy!* Max thought as she dry humped his leg while he walked back into the bar. *Hopefully someone in here can help me get her off me.* Max thought as he walked into the Bacchanalian Shindy on Scrimmage Street. The first thing Max noticed as he walked back into the bar was not the surprising warmth coming from his leg where the woman had bitten him so hard that she drew blood; instead it was the *man* sitting in the booth where he had puked. 

--- 

Jellena sighed as she realised they were back inside the bar, she stood up a tad too quickly and very quickly began to pass out. The last thing she noticed before she hit the ground in a rather undignified heap was *him*. 

--- 

*I have* got *to change the name of this motherfucking bar. What was I thinking, the Bacchanalian Shindy, and on Scrimmage Street no less!* sighed Lucas as he continued to polish glasses. *At the very least* he *never makes a scene in here, all he does is move between the fights and polish off Gunfire after Gunfire. I wonder what he's seen.* Lucas lifted two glasses he was about to polish off the bar top as a man and a woman crashed against it in their haste to remove their clothes. *I've served many a man and woman from all over the world throughout my life, and never before have I seen an individual so physically scarred as* him.

*Laurence, a man of 31, walks in alone, wearing depression and dejection on his face after facing a turbulent relationship problems. His brown hair is slightly disheveled and stubble is apparent on his lower jaw. He slides into a barstool.*

Lawrence: One whisky on the rocks. Water it down for me, Sarah.

*Sarah, a newly found transitioned woman of 29, slender and serious. She wears a small frown as her regular customer is not pleased.*

Sarah: Oh, Lawrence, my good sir, what ales you?

Lawrence: Sarah, I'm not in the mood now. Just a sip, I swear.

Sarah: Sure thing.

*She turns to the many cabinets of booze. A clatter and scuttle of feet is audible not far from the counter. Without turning Sarah calls out.*

S: You boys had better not be burning the house down tonight. My buddy here came for a good time, you hear?

*Some sort of murmur/mumble of agreement sounds in unison. The camera cuts to show the rising tension behind Lawrence, who is visibly depressed and possibly also degenerating to a lump of melting butter. He's drunk on his own potent relationship problems.*

*Josh, a punk of 29, is getting over his red hairs head. He's shouting inaudible profanities at some old balding geezer of (mind you) only 53 two tables across. The volume of the overall establishment is rising to an uneasy din of a thousand feral jackalopes*

Josh: Yeah, you there, ya old bag. You said you were at the home, that's what you told Rebecca! Stop feeding us lies and leeching off her paycheck.

*The unnamed balding geezer of 53 is visibly pissed. His uncontrolled agitation gives insight to the fact that he probably can do less than a park bench; support a family.*

Old Geeze: Shut up you little ____. You're only as good as your mom and she had you at half your age.

*The Geeze is starting to stand and so is Josh, that poor punk. He seems to have come straight from his part time job at the auto place.*

J: I should lock you up at a mental 'stitute and throw 'way the key you bag! Shut your mouth about Rebecca, she's twice as good as you ever could be.

*Old Geeze must have a screw loose cause bottles are flying. Josh swivels to barely miss one but a second one follows with no time to spare and green glass shatters with his jawline that could... Cut glass.*

Sarah: What's going on over there? I heard something break, and whoever threw that's gonna have my lawyer! 

*One of Josh's beerbuddies seems to have been angered by the Geeze, since he has long been up and seems to be ready to pound that bag more than the pounds it costs to buy a bag in currently published time's rates.*

Beerbuddy A: You old man, you're going to die today! 

*From some unknown origins the dude channels his inner Asian father and sends a wooden table flying. Beer does crazy things, drink responsibly.*

Beerbuddy A: Josh is my man, my man, man! You can't hit a guy like that!

*For some reason he seems to like-like Josh... But this unnamed companion will be skimmed over for the barfight's sake*

Lawrence: Alright, who started this? I want to you to take it outside. 

*Drunk on relationship problems, he uses the power of millennials to block out all other's issues. He confronts the Geeze and yanks the Geeze's sweaty collar to drag him out. The Geeze throws an unfair punch in the Place-That-Must-Not-Be-Named.*

*Lawrence commences naming all profanities known to man and curls up in the most manliest of manners, clutching the area of explosive pain. How a true man falls.*

Sarah: That's it, I called the cops, you boys, head out of this fine establishment unless you want this on your records.

*The Geeze shoots a dirty look at Sarah.*

Geeze: I never wanted any of this or a [insert filthy profanities] anyways.

*Sarah looks slightly hurt on the outside. However, a crevasse the depth of the ~~Marinara~~ Mariana Trench fissures in her soul.*

*Suddenly Charlotte, Lawrence's SO, bursts into the bar.*

Charlotte: Lawrence, Lawrence, oh my poor baby. What is it, are you dying? Stay with me love, find my voice.

*Charlotte draws powers from The Notebook to suddenly cast rain and sexy wet clothes into their little bubble. Passionate embrace ensues and a classical orchestral soundtrack has made its way into the scene.*

Beerbuddy B: Sarah, don't pay any mind to The Geeze, human trash if I ever saw it.

*Sarah looks up to B and smiles wearily. The two also are in some The Notebook shit I'm not sure, but music to some drama/soap swells and the pair is off to shoot a rom-com.*

*Outside the bar Josh is being hoisted to an ambulance.*

*Rebecca, a young woman of undecided but young age, runs up to the ambulance. She is also straight out of some vague low-wage job.*

Rebecca: Oh Josh, what did you do. Don't tell me dad did this...

*Scene fades with orchestral music of some conclusive sort. Everything is somewhat okay, minus the emotionally-unstable alcoholic, malfunctioning non-nuclear family, and the complex ridden insecure girl who tends a bar at a young age as herself. Beerbuddies A and B were pretty solid bros.*

Wilhelmstrasse - Berlin, Germany

The warm, summer German air was sweet to the smell. A soft, gilded sun poured through the apartment windows, coming on to my face. I looked over at my wrist to check the time on my NATO watch. 10:40am, local time. 20 minutes to go. Drawing a final breath from my cigarette - a Nordic brand synonymous with a woman's bosom, obviously a man's joke - I put the butt out into the glass ashtray and took my position at the seat, sitting catty corner, facing the balcony. A view out the tall, pane-glass window would reveal the inner beauty of that which is the Wilhelmstrasse. 

The stunning architecture of the plaza never disappointed - adorned with small markets and shops, the main centerpieces were twofold. An exquisite orchestra hall with ornate red velvet drapes, golden mantlepieces, and granite staircase complemented the fancy exterior. Across the plaza, was the Reich Chancellery and Foreign Office, home to the Nazi regime's state affairs office, as well as their foreign intelligence service. The leader - my target - Chancellor Adolf Hitler, would be making an appearance to speak with the spymaster heading the service at 11am. Along with the spymaster, an American diplomat, suspected of espionage, would be in attendance. He was to stay alive, although once his cover was blown, he'd surely be court marshalled and tried in the U.S. The American is unknown to me.

10 minutes to go, I take a final survey of the playing field. Moderate security in front of the State building, a few police officers making their daily rounds on the beat - apart from that, no other trouble. Plenty of space to take cover behind once I made my escape through the hidden exit downstairs, leading out of one of the flower shops below. Removing the bedsheets from the mattress against the wall, I found a high powered calibre rifle, attached with a telescopic sight, and fitted with a threaded suppressor, to quiet any noise that would certainly draw attention to the vantage point. Next to the rifle was a small box, containing 10 steel-tipped, armor piercing rounds. I would only need 1.

5 minutes to go - Sitting in my chair, I lit one more cigarette - my last bit of encouragement - before the deed had to be done. The German guards downstairs begin to move into formation, surveying the street level, awaiting their leader. The German national anthem can be heard being played by a live band across the fountain in the Wilhelmstrasse. I could see a convoy of black cars - Studebakers - begin to come down the street. It was go time.

ZERO TIME - Moving the sheer curtain out of view, I placed the barrel of the rifle on top of the balcony railing; the stock of the rifle between my shoulder and clavicle, and my eye up to the scope. The convoy came to a halt. German officers began their cadence calls, waiting for their leader. The 4th car - out of 9 - was tended to by an infantryman, opening the door and giving a swift salute, as der Furher stepped out. Wearing his standard garb and cap, I put Hitler in my sights. The other passenger door was opened, the occupant stepping out, though, that wasn't my concern. Hitler began making his way towards the State building, speaking and trading jokes with some of his top brass. My crosshairs were square with his head, about the size of shirt button, from my view. He suddenly stopped and turned around. My finger began building it's pressure. I've done this deed many times before. It's become human nature. One life taken, for the good of the many - it's just part of the job. He was now a sitting duck. The occupant from the car finally caught up with Hitler. They exchanged a brief hug of comradery. The unknown man took a look around the plaza - my finger just one more exceptionally slight tug from a round being expensed out of the barrel, breaking through the bastard's cranium, and burying itself deep into his occiptial lobe and cerebellum, in what would simply - and, at least in my line of work, quite beautifully - end him. My other eye cracked open, finger taken off the trigger, as soon as his comrade's face was revealed to me... This shock, this horror... this awful sense of betrayal. It was U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower. This was the mole... Suddenly, the task has changed. I put my eye up to the scope, fixing it on the general, took a deep breath, and squeezed.

A unkown planet in an old galaxy is found, after a short but bloody war you realize these ""aliens"" in these big bodysuits are humans and this planets is earth.",Darknight474,"Allen disembarked his aircraft and approached the incapacitated alien that he had blown back and knocked unconscious upon his landing. With trepidation, his shaking hand reached out toward the crumpled figure on the ground. With a swift motion he removed the helmet of the creature and immediately stumbled away from its body in astonishment.

""You... you're... you're a human!"" he exclaimed, extending his trembling finger toward the injured individual as they stood up and began to dust themself off.

""Yeah. Yeah I am,"" he stated upon standing upright ""so is everyone on this damn planet. You're still on Earth, globe-head""

""No... that's impossible. I came here from the command fleet orbiting the second moon of this planet! No person has ever... well I guess we haven't... or I... well..."" Allen incredulously stammered as his eyes darted frantically around the ground.

""Is that what they're putting on those sims now? Second moons and foreign planets? Sheesh, you globe-heads will believe anything with an orbit,"" the mysterious person mused as he lowered himself on to a stump.""Well, welcome back I guess,"" mocked the now seated person.

""Who- or what are you?! What are you trying to pull here?"" Allen demanded, gathering his bearings in an attempt to be assertive.

""Rand McNally, my globe-headed friend, and I'm just here trying to keep the world safe"" explained the person.

""Well then, *Rand!* I guess you-"" Allen began as he was abruptly cut off.

""No dipshit, Rand McNally's not my name. That's the organization I work for. My name is Gerald,"" the man stated. 

""R-Rand McNally? What is that, like a shadow government or something?"" Allen questioned.

""Maps,"" Gerald succinctly replied.

""*Maps?*"" Allen repeated back almost involuntarily in surprise.

""You're gonna make me explain it, aren't you globe-head?"" Gerald sighed as his posture sunk into the stump. He took a long inhale and released a deep exhale in preparation. ""Fine, I'll explain it real simple for you.""

Allen's eyes widened as he instinctively drew closer to this new mysterious individual.

""The world is flat."" said Gerald. Allen reflexively chuckled at the notion, to which Gerald appeared to take some indignant offense.

""Hah! Flat?"" Allen responded in disbelief. ""You're not serious, right?""

""I knew you wouldn't understand, you globe-heads never did. That's why we had to put you in those damn simulators and tell you that you all were going to space! For god's sakes, we didn't want to, but you just wouldn't stop asking questions. '*Why don't you make globes, Rand McNally?' 'Your maps are wrong because they're flat'*, my god you people are thick.""

Allen stood in awe. He had often felt as though his space-travel were remarkably easy, never once having to deal with scarcity or the effects of micro-gravity on the body as his orientation had warned him. Though this refusing to outright believe, he felt as though what this man was telling him may be the truth.

""So if I've really been in a simulator, the it hasn't been 10,000 years,"" Allen asked with a more subdued tone, ""and I never went into hypersleep?""

""Now you're starting to catch on, sharp stuff"" Gerald replied with a marked note of sarcasm.

""Well then how long has it been?""

""About eight months. Nine if you count those weekend training retreats in Dallas.""

The two men stared at each other in an dense undecypherable silence for several moments. Before too long, Allen decided to speak up.

""So there's still Chick-fil-a?"" Allen inquired. A smile curled across Gerald's mouth.

""You bet your ass, there's still Chick-fil-a""

Clutching my plasma rifle, I stared intently at the ruined city in the center of the valley, the last bastion of our enemy. I switched my gaze from the city to the area around me. It was a beautiful planet, I had to admit. Most worlds we went too were barren wastelands suffering from extreme temperatures. Yet something about this planet seemed familiar, as if I had seen a picture of it in some old Galactic records. It was very similar to Batuu, one of the farming colonies on the edge of this galaxy, but I couldn't quite place where I had seen it.

Unsual to us, this planet hadn't been developed into the sprawling mega cities that encompass entire surfaces of the worlds we own. There were still vast amounts of land that had retained their natural beauty. It could almost be a wonderful place to visit, save for the mass carnage that had taken place the past few months. A relaxing getaway was not on anyone's mind.

There were so few of us left. We began this campaign with more than 50 million battled hardened men only 6 months ago, now a mere ten thousand of us remain. Of all the worlds we conquered our armies laid waste to the lands, no one could match our martial prowess. We didn't negotiate, we killed. Wipe out the indigenous populations armies, enslave the rest, and establish a foothold with which we could begin to colonize. That's the way it has been for 10,000 years.

Yet here we are, those that are left, fighting and dying to expand our empire. But at what cost? This invasion should have been called off after the vanguard was annihilated soon upon landing on this god forsaken planet. Our enemy fought with such ferocity, such passion and anger, unlike anything we've ever encountered. It was almost as if we were fighting against ourselves.

Not long after the initial assault failed, we launched the second, but this time the enemy used weapons that caused massive explosions destroying our armies before they even stepped off the ship. So we retaliated with our own, destroying their largest cities instantly. We thought the planet would surrender after this, but they didn't, they kept fighting. 

Wave after wave our armies clashed against those of our enemies, millions perished. Now we are on the eve of vanquishing our foe, the remnants of their kind gathered in the valley below. Yet I still ponder, who are these creatures? We've never seen them outside their

""Commander Tallon,"" a voice called from behind me. I turned around to see a junior officer standing behind me, fully dressed in his armored battle suit. What used to be a pristine white survival suit was now a dirty rag scarred with many signs of combat and the blood of fallen comrades. This war was taking its toll.

""What is it?"" I asked.

""Sir, Consul Kane wishes to speak with you.""

""Tell him I'll be there momentarily.""

""Sir, he insists that you come right away, he says that it is of the up-most importance.""

I mumbled under my breath some blasphemy about our leader. He's probably going to ask me to lead what's last of our forces to our doom.

""Alright, lead on."" I replied. 

I followed the junior officer through our camp to the Consul's personal quarters. Upon entering I was shocked by what I saw. There standing next to the Consul were two of our enemies, fully clad head to toe in their own green battle suits.

""Commander Tallon,"" Consul Kane said, ""I'd like to introduce you to Colonel Blake and his subordinate Captain, am I saying this right? Ma-ran-iss?"" He gestured toward the taller of the two men. 

""That is correct Consul."" The soldier spoke, his voice amplified through his tinted helmet.

""Excellent!"" the Consul replied. ""Commander Tallon, these two here are representatives of the surviving remnant of their race, a race that up until now, we thought were 'aliens'.""

What do you mean, sir?"" I questioned, keeping a close on the two men standing before me. ""They are aliens!"" 

The Consul continued, ""Moments ago I found out what you're about to find out for yourself. I'm warning you, what you are about to see is going to surprise you, as it did me.""

""At this point, sir, I don't think anything will surprise me."" I stood there tightening the grip on my weapon, just in case.

The Consul nodded towards Colonel Blake and the captain and the two slowly removed their helmets revealing their faces. I dropped my weapon and stepped back in almost utter terror. They were human! Like us! I removed my own helmet to reveal my own battle scarred face.

""But how is this possible, sir? We've never been to this planet! We've kept track of all of our galactic travels and missions, no one has ever been here!""

""Actually, Commander, they've always been here. Long before we began our galactic conquest. Let us explain.""
I stood there in silence as I listened to Consul Kane, Colonel Blake, and this Captain Maraniss fellow explain the past 10,000 years to me. The Consul opened up some very old forgotten Galactic records on the computer that revealed the history of this planet... Earth. 

""Earth?"" I said to myself. That was the planet that I had seen in these records long ago as a child. Turns out, humanity was established on this planet thousands of years ago, in a very advanced civilization, but for unknown reasons decided to find a new home amongst the stars. So they left, taking all their technology with them. 
Those that remained were the outcasts; the slaves, thieves, and uneducated people. Nobody that could read or write. They were given nothing to survive, so they had to adapt. Building tools out of stones and developing their own societies, language, and culture. Their history before this time was forgotten, and through their own minds they flourished, despite not knowing what was beyond their own solar system. 

Once the three men finished speaking they sat down at the table in the center of the room. I sat there amazed trying to make sense of what just unfolded in front me.

""Did you get all that, Commander?"" Consul Kane asked. ""They are 'US'. We've both forgotten our pasts to time. I now realized that our war policy has been flawed all these years. We wiped out entire civilizations without even wondering what the name of the world was we were conquering. We killed our own by the millions.""
""Well what do you intend to do now, sir?"" I asked.

""We rebuild, together."" Colonel Blake chimed in. ""There has been enough bloodshed. The humans of Earth have been fighting each other for several millennia, and united when we came under attack from beyond our home. But when we realized now that it was us we were fighting again, we have to lay down our arms. There must be peace, lest we all perish."" 

I sat there in silence taking all of this in. My whole life I had been a soldier, trained since I was a boy. All I've ever done was kill and follow orders. Sure I questioned them sometimes but I followed them, it was my duty. The loss of life was immense but it was for my people. Was it time to lay it down and help Earth rebuild? To reestablish this portion of humanities home? My duty and loyalty was to my empire. ""MY Empire."" 

I stood up out of my chair and stared at the three men across from me. 

""You may like us, but you're not us!"" I exclaimed. With a grin and flash they were all dead, the barrel on my plasma rifle smoking at the end. I walked outside where the junior officer was still standing.

""The enemy has assassinated the Consul,"" I said aloud for the army to hear, ""I am now in command. We will proceed with the assault on the last stronghold. Prepare for battle!""",HeartachetoHouston

"[WP] A slumber party between various slasher film villains goes horribly wrong, as a little girl takes them out one by one.",DrunkRobot97,"""Anyway, so that's the story of how I got these claws,"" Freddy Krueger said. Ghostface laughed. His laughter was put to a halt when Mike came down the hallway.

""Hey guys,"" asked Mike Myers. ""Has anyone seen Jason?""

""What are you talking about?"" replied Ghostface. ""He was right..."" he said, only to turn around and find that Jason was not there. This was odd, he had just been listening to Freddy's story as well. ""Okay, let's go find him.""

As Freddy and Ghostface left to search, Mike looked in the closet to find him. So typical of Jason to hide in places like this. When he opened the door, he found a little girl. Mike was unsure what to think, did Freddy bring this as a surprise? Ooooooooooh, what fun! He pulled out his signature kitchen knife, ready to end the child's life, but that was his last thought.

""Where's Mike?"" asked Ghostface. ""Jeez, first Jason, now Mike...""

""Oh, come on, Ghostface..."" replied Freddy. ""Okay, I'll keep searching, you stay here in case they come back. Here, there's a couch and here's the TV.""

Freddy turned the TV on and prepared to search. As he went for the door, he almost tripped on something. He picked it up and found it was a hockey mask. He looked at the floor again, and a machete lay next to it.

""Uh...Ghostface?"" mumbled Freddy, but he got no answer. He turned around and Ghostface had disappeared. Looking on the couch, all he could see was his signature mask. Suddenly an eerie laugh rang throughout the house.

Freddy looked at the TV and saw a little girl, her face shrouded with hair. The girl burst out of the TV, walking slowly towards Freddy. He readied his claws to attack the girl and prepared to strike, but she moved her hair away from her face, revealing the most frightening, and last, thing Freddy ever saw.",greenquartz

It took several moments for the bright colorful room to focus. Blinking violently, he realized he couldn't move his hands or his feet. Then he saw her. They were not alone. 

""You are so cute,"" she said pinching his cheek, ""like a little dolly. My little Chucky.""

He could finally make out her cherry-glossed face. She smiled. She patted his head and hummed a tune. Picking up a tray from a table the pig-tailed girl bobbed around the room, her curls bouncing with every skip.

""Tea anyone?"", she said with a squeal of a voice. 

Her neatly pressed baby blue skirt ruffled as she passed in and out of the circle and the distinct tap of her polished black slippers began to grate at his nerves. 

""No?"", she asked again, ""slumber parties are no fun without tea.""

""Hey!"" the shrouded figure spoke first, ""get this damn blindfold off of me you bitch!""

""My goodness"" she put her hand over her mouth, ""we shouldn't say naughty words Mr. Ghostface.""

""Slut! Cu..""

A knife slipped from her grip and found itself lodged in his chest. After the seventh time, he stopped moving and a gurgled whisper seeped out as she finally stepped away from him. 

""No ugly talk"" she fumed and stomped around removing the other blindfolds, ""this is my party and we will be nice!"" 

They all stared blankly at each other. Silence pierced the room as they soaked in their predicament. The little girl huffed. Trudging over, she plopped down on Ghostface's lap. The body shifted slightly. She didn't seem to mind the blood. 

""Is this a game?"", the small, hook-nosed doll cocked his head. 

""You know"", the dark figure stirred, ""my favorite game is Candyland.""

""Why so sad little girl?"", the clowns voice purred, ""Come to Pennywise.""

""Maybe Captain Hook could cheer her up with some painting lessons."" Krueger gave a burnt smirk, shaking his wrist. 

""Any children to molest with those butter knives?"" Candyman sneered and licked his lips as Krueger clacked his hands on the armrests. 

""Maybe Jason could take her swimming,"" Chucky snickered.

""Bet Freddie would like that,"" Candyman continued, ""little girl, little clothes""

""Shut up!"" she slammed her fists into Ghostface's bloody thighs. ""I know what we can do.""

Running over to the corner she drug a small stand to the middle of the room. Popping a button, the record began to spin. Placing the needle, the music scratched into the air. 

""Sing!"" she hollered and began bobbing her head. She walked around and glared at each one. Sticking her ear up to their mouths, she poked them in the chest if she wasn't satisfied. She had made her rounds when she came to Jason. 

""Sing,"" she said, poking him in the chest. 

Nothing. 

""Sing"" she said, ""sing, sing, sing!""

""Sweet girl,"" Pennywise purred again, ""Jason, doesn't...""

""Shut your mouth clown,"" she shot over to him and dug a blade in his neck, ""or I'll drown you in sewer water. We'll see if you float down here.""

She backed away slowly and turned back to Jason. She kicked the stand, sending the record player cartwheeling past Candyman. It fell dead silent. She grabbed Jason's jacket and hauled herself up near his face. She glared into his hollow eyes. 

""Why won't you sing?"" she said, tapping the knife on his mask. She sighed. She slowly embraced him around his neck. 

""Maybe you can't""

She whipped his head back in a flash. She chewed for what seemed like minutes. The hulking man winced, growled and finally gurgled as she open his throat. Carving away, she ripped and tore at his flesh with her teeth

""Liar!"" she cried, as she pulled out his voice box and spat it to the ground. Rolling off his chest, she squatted down to pick it up. ""We shouldn't lie.""

The room was silent again. She seemed to fall inside her thoughts. No one moved. 

""We need cookies with our tea,"" she finally said, ""I'll be back."" 

Walking slowly towards the door, she wiped her mouth. Cutting the lights, the darkness was cool to the touch. 

""You all play nice."" she said, and shut the door.  

""This,"" Saw clacked, ""this is some game.""

"[WP]""I know I broke it.. but let me fix it.""",FabulousVoid,"A cup of coffee steams on the desk in front of me, oddly calming in the small circle of light from my desk lamp, all that illuminates the darkened office.  I take a sip from the coffee, the bitter taste and heat doing just as much as the caffeine to keep me awake.  With a sigh I pick up my phone, glance at the missed calls, and dial her number.  The phone rings for an eternity before she picks up.

""Now you call Matt?  At 1 in the morning?""  She says, tiredness in her voice.

""Work's been busy Jane, you know how it is.""  I try to keep my own lack of sleep from showing.

""It's always busy Matt.  It's been busy for weeks.""

""There's a big project coming up, you know how it is.  I'm the lead and there's a lot to get done.""  We've had this conversation so many times, it's like we're reading from scripts.

She sighs over the line, and we both fell silent.  I stare blankly at the steam rising from the coffee, listening to the sound of a clock somewhere in the office.

""Matt, we can't keep doing this, I can't keep doing this.  We haven't spoken face-to-face since Saturday, when you were on your way out the door.  We can't do this anymore.""  She still just sounds so tired.  What can I say to that?  She's not angry, she's not sad, she's not crying or shouting.  She's just tired.

""Come on Jane, don't say that.  You know this is just a busy patch, it's happened before.  Before you know it we'll have finished up, I'll get a week's vacation and we can go somewhere.  I might even get a raise this time!""  I force myself to sound cheery, one hand gripping the warm mug.

""That's the problem, you know that's the problem.  It's happened before, it's happening now, it'll happen again.  Matt, I'm serious this time.  Whatever we had it's...it's broken now.  Come on Matt.""  She's gone from tired to defeated, why can't she just shout?  This would be so much easier if she'd just shout.

""No no, Jane, please.  What do you mean broken?  We're fine, it's alright.  How about we visit your family, down in Cape Cod?  I've heard it's lovely this time of year!""  I know this isn't the right thing to say, I know this isn't going to help.  What am I even saying?

""No Matt, no.  We're not fine.  Please, just admit it.  We're not fine, we're broken.  Whatever we had, you just kept putting cracks into it until it shattered.  Please Matt, just admit it.""

""Jane, please, I know, I know I broke it...but let me fix it.  I'll take time off, I'll call in sick tomorrow.  I'll pass the lead over to Johnson, he can get it done just fine.  Please Jane, just don't say that we're broken, please!""  I know she's right, why can't I just agree with her?

""No Matt.  I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, I just can't do this anymore.  Goodbye, Matt.""  A little click tells me she's hung up on her end.

"[RF] She said yes, but he was hoping she'd say no",MajorParadox,"It was a very nice night out. One of those nights you sit on the porch and marvel at the night sky. Julian was sitting on a stool just outside his house waiting for his girlfriend to arrive. He’s been stressed out all day on how to go about telling her the news. Julian’s always been a non confrontational guy, it could stem from him being fearful of his parents which led to him never asking or talking about anything. Or it could be from the lack of interactions with people of the opposite sex due to his time spent at an all boys prep school. Regardless of the matter, he didn’t know how to approach her with the question. As he sat there looking at the night sky, he remembered all the crappy things he’s done to her. How he never was the man he wanted to be. Often times when your sitting alone, looking into the sky you think about how differently things could of played out if you said or did something differently. Those thoughts we have with ourselves are often the most dreadful. We sit there and torture ourselves with situations that have long passed. They say nostalgia is paralyzing, but it’s also the most common thing done in a time of confusion and stress. As her car pulled up, Julian looked at her come out the car. She was wearing a grey sweater with some tights and nike shoes. Even when she’s dressed down she’s pretty. When she arrived on the porch, Julian gave her a hug and kiss. Right away she asked him what the whole fuss was about. He was nervous, he wasn’t prepared to ask her. Julian took a deep breath and looked into her eyes. “Have you ever done anal?” he asked with a look of concern in his face. His girlfriend said yes with an awkward smile and giggle. Julian laughed awkwardly and took his eyes off her and looked back at the night sky with a gaping look in his eyes. ",mojosmooth

[IP] I See Fire,MajorParadox,"When I was a child, I wasn't afraid of fire. 

I loved throwing little pieces of wood into the fireplace and watching them slowly turn black.

I loved to feel its warmth on my skin, especially in those cold winter evenings after hunting with father.

This of course changed when the airplanes came. I had never heard them before. Never seen their destruction. None of us had. That's why we were chosen to attack.
____________________________

The first bomb hit our church dead center. Something pulled me backwards, threw me into a corner. A sudden heat engulfed me. Every breath I took felt like acid run through my lungs. I couldn't see. Couldn't open my eyes. 

Someone screamed. Something crumbled. The humming sound of the planes still above us. Another explosion. Another wave of heat. The ground trembled. But above all, I heard my beating heart.

I stood up, slowly as my whole body was still shaking. The smoke was pitch black. The fires so bright. The ground trembled beneath my feet, made me fall over. I was too afraid to move before it hadn't stopped. 

I don't exactly know what happened next. I wasn't myself anymore. Without thinking and without seeing any more than a blur I walked through the streets. The humming sounds of the planes were gone. My beating heart was gone. It seemed as the whole world were just ruins, flickering lights everywhere and people running around screaming. 

 What I do remember, and what I hope to forget each night, is where I found my little brother. Full of dust and blood in the arms of my crying father. Mother besides him. She didn't cry. She didn't move at all. She would never move again.

This story cheats, egregiously so, by relying on other people's words to do the heavy lifting. I mean, a quote from Mister Rogers? How are any of us supposed to compete with that? Much of the original material is blunt, almost generic. The foundations of Doctor Jiwa's morality are simplistic and largely based on false premises; no wonder Adam ends up existentially dissatisfied.  

And yet as a whole, this is beautiful. The structure is novel, ambitious. It brings to mind a mobile, in terms of volume mostly stick and string and empty space, the ornaments artfully counterbalanced against each other. Adam is a receptacle, a lot of empty space, with no internal framework for decision-making. He is free-floating, clinging to flashes of insight and beauty as he encounters them, understanding that he understands nothing. I'd be interested in seeing a variation on this with minimal original input, just a machine-synthesized attempt at understanding humanity.

"[WP] You open a fortune cookie and it reads ""we are now inside of you.""",Reeelentless,"*We are now inside you*

What a strange message from a fortune cookie I thought at the time. I was on a date with my girlfriend and I got this with desert. I liked fortune cookies and they always gave me a laugh, until the side effects from this one kicked in...

The night continued on as usual and we went back home. We sat down and watched episode 10 season 6 of Game of Thrones. What a great episode. I really liked the part where Yoda helped Abaram Lincoln and Rick Grimes do the dishes. 

But I could hear these faint voices when I opened my mouth and lay completely silent.

Anyway the next day was okay, I felt a bit of nausea at work and left early.

*Day 1 - Subject 1675*

*Day one inside organism. The human male appears to be fine and well adjusted. The fortune cookie message hasn't hindered our progress one bit*

What the hell? I'm not sure whose speaking but it sounds like it was coming from my chest?!?

I thought nothing of it at the time but boy was I wrong.
 
*Day 2 - Subject 1675*

*We have set up our full base of operations here near his heart. We believe that we have strategic entry to the spinal column through a small microscopic incision behind the heart. This will lead our engineers straight up into the brain*

I had a seizure at work. It was horrible, I was at my desk one minute, next I was in the hospital hooked up to an IV. Apparently the doctor said I had passed out and knocked my head. 

*Day 3 - Subject 1675*

*The human has outside forces inserting foreign objects into his arm and up his nostrils. Unsure of what this is at this stage. BAU.*

BAU I thought? What is going on?

The next few days were a blur however I remember bits and pieces. I was out of the hospital the next day and back in my house. My girlfriend had left to go to work and I had just loaded Netflix. Apparently I had left my house and walked to the store and just stood there in my robe staring at the produce.

I remember none of this and was escorted home by police. They phoned my girlfriend who explained the situation and advised she would take the rest of the day off.

*Subjects ""girlfriend"" has been home for the last hour. Implement phase ""Full body control""*

I felt my body being controlled as I headed into the kitchen and picked up the fridge with ease. I carried the fridge above my head and apparently threw it at my partner killing her instantly.

I then proceeded to the next door neighbours car and threw it at the house across the road. 

I'm very scared now as I don't know what's going on, the voices haven't stopped and it sounds like they are busier than ever. I haven't been able to control anything other than my hands to post on reddit.

Phil loved it. The sights, sounds, smells. He also loved the third park bench from the fountain. It had perfect lighting. He was finishing a piece he planned to name ""The Baglady"" when a tiny poke nudged his arm. He peered though a cloud of pastel dust to find a beautiful little girl. 

""Hi,"" she said, knocking her knobby knees together, ""what's that?""

""A drawing,"" Phil gave her a light smile and continued putting in the final touches.

""That lady?"" She pointed.

""Yes""

""She's pretty"" she said with a giggle. 

Phil looked back at the whole of his drawing. He was unsure of her age but the wrinkles and spots told of a hard life. Her clothes were soiled and torn, yet she did have a stillness in her eyes that had drawn Phil in. In a way, she was pretty. He smiled to himself. 

""Can I tell you a secret?"" she blurted out as she sat down beside him. He shifted his pencil box over and turned to put his feet on the ground. He continued working and she started again. 

""You like nature?""

""Yes"" he said without making eye contact. 

""She is sick.""

""Sick? What is wrong?"" He blew another pastel puff out into the air. 

""She told me she has a fever? Mother Nature is sick."" 

He furrowed his brow. The most interesting people, he thought. He scanned the playground beyond hoping to spot a searching mother or a concerned, scouting father. No such luck. 

""How do we make her better?"" he said, trying to sound uninterested. 

""She said"" she crawled up the back of the park bench and stood beside him, ""we need to leave her alone.""

He shook his head at the silliness of it until he felt something new. It wasn't a nudge this time. It was colder. He turned to look at her. 

""If we go away she gets better,"" she pressed the barrel of the pistol against his forehead.

""What are...""

""Time to go away"" she smiled.

He shifted slightly, broken arrows grinding against the ground. 

He squinted up at the sky, trying to remember who he was. Eventually, it came to him. 

""Canis"" he breathed. Footsteps echoed in the distance. The world began to shift, turning ghostly, everything blending slightly into everything else, as the footsteps got closer. 

Canis turned his head toward the sound, and took a double take. A huge hound was walking toward him, with colorless fur, and a large scythe gripped in its mouth. It reached him, and dropped the scythe.

""What?"" it asked. ""The prompt said I have to have a scythe."" 

""Excuse me?"" Canis asked. 

The hound waved a dismissive paw. ""Nevermind."" it sat down on its haunches, looking at him quizzically. Canis struggled upward, suddenly finding his wounds didn't pain him as much. 

""Now."" The hound said. ""What is the purpose of suffering?"" 

""What?"" Canis asked. The hound rolled it's eyes. ""Answer correctly, and I will return you to life.""

Canis sat up, thinking hard. Eventually, he came to a conclusion that sounded poetic enough for a conversation with dead itself. 

""The purpose of suffering..."" He started slowly. ""Is to make us stronger, better. The fires and the hammer that forge us into the best people we can be.""

""Nope."" The hound said. Canis stopped. ""What?"" He asked, astonished. 

""Nope."" It repeated. ""Wrong. Incorrect. False.""
Canis sighed. ""What is the purpose then?"" he asked. 

The hound scratched it's ear. ""Well that would hardly be fair."" it observed. 

Canis threw his hands into the air. ""I don't know! I'm dying over here! Not exactly the best reasoning skills, *Death!*"" 

The hound sighed. It seemed disappointed. ""Alright, alright."" It relented. ""The purpose is this:"" it walked forward, poking Canis in the chest, just above his heart. ""It's to *teach* you. To show you the difference between monsters and men, the value of kin and companions, the pleasure and traps of vengeance, the bloodlust and excitement of the battlefield, to pave each path a person could walk."" 

Canis rocked back slightly. ""Wow."" He said. 

""Wow."" The hound agreed. ""Now, come on."" It said, turning.

"[WP] The Grim Reaper sat down and rested his scythe on his lap. ""What purpose does suffering serve,"" he inquired, ""if you can tell me I will renew your life.""",Tao_Mountain,"I lay dying on the ground, on top of the filthy subway grate.  The cold bit at my fingers, through the tatty gloves and at my toes, through the worn shoes that were not made for winter.  It felt like a thousand needles in each finger and toe.  This was how I died, alone, ignored by the passers-by and cold.

Someone stopped.  He wore a long dark cloak and carried a walking stick... no... it was a scythe and the long dark cloak was topped with a hood which covered a face that I couldn't see.  A face that looked at me, but was darkness.  It was Death, and he had come for me.

The cloaked figure sat on the concrete next to me, not so much moving as shifting into a sitting position.  He placed his scythe across his lap.

""What purpose does suffering serve?"" he asked.  ""If you can tell me, I will renew your life.""

""Suffering?  It doesn't serve any purpose.  It just is.""

""Does it not make you stronger, as fire and hammers strengthen steel?""

I tried to laugh.  ""If I had a fire, I wouldn't be freezing to death, and if I had a hammer, I'd be working and not living here on this shitty street.""

""Does it not teach you the difference between monsters and men, or the value of companions on the battlefield?""

""Monsters... men,"" I spat.  ""Look around you.  What do you see?""

The hooded figure looked.  ""I see men and women going about their business.""

""That's right.  And not one of them has stopped to offer me help.  Not a single dime, or a cup of coffee or a simple ham sandwich.  They keep going, minding their own business, ignoring the suffering of their fellow man.  Did you know some of them kick me, spit on me, mock me?""

There was only silence from the hooded figure.  The silence of the grave.

""There is no difference,"" I said.  ""The monsters ARE the men, and they don't truly care about companions.  There's no battlefield any more because the monsters have won.""

Death sat for a long moment, then turned slightly.

""Empathy,"" he said in his voice-that-wasn't-a-voice, colder than the February air that was killing me.

Now it was my turn to stare at him, not understanding.

""If your suffering and death teaches kindness to others like you, to lift the poor from their suffering and push them to a better life, do you not think it worthy?""

""Yes,"" I said, nodding.  I was tired... so very tired...

""Will you stay and help your kin?  Teach them kindness?""

""No.  I've had enough of this shit life.""

Death shifted and stood, his scythe in one hand, the other outstretched to me.  I took his hand and walked side-by-side through the veil... friends.",Krinks1
"[WP] The Grim Reaper sat down and rested his scythe on his lap. ""What purpose does suffering serve,"" he inquired, ""if you can tell me I will renew your life.""",Tao_Mountain,"The Grim Reaper sat down and rested his scythe on his lap.

""What purpose does suffering serve?""

I looked at him, puzzled.

""If you can tell me, I will renew your life.""

The thought was tempting.  The cancer that had riddled my body had caused pain for a lot of people.  Emotional pain for my family,  physical pain for me.  On the one hand, it would be good to be done with this life.  There would be no more nights of lying awake in agony while my family watched, helpless to do anything.

On the other hand though, if the Reaper was serious about his offer, I could continue living.  I knew that 43 was far too young to pass on.  If he was serious, I could live life knowing what it's like to be dying.  Knowing how every moment was precious, understanding that I had to appreciate everything and everyone, for tomorrow it may slip away.  I knew I could do good in the world by helping those who were like me and knowing--REALLY knowing--what they were going through.

That's when the answer came to me.

""To grow stronger,"" I replied.

The dark hood raised a fraction and the darkness inside was turned my way.  There was no face visible under the hood, but I knew he was staring at me, wondering what I meant.

""Have you ever known pain?"" I asked the Reaper.

""No,"" he replied in his cold non-voice.

""For all of history, you've been causing pain and suffering for the living by taking away their loved ones.  You've never known what it's meant to suffer?""

""I bring suffering.  I have never suffered.""

""You've always been like this?""

""Yes.""

""By not knowing suffering, you have never changed.  You've never known what it's like to lose something or someone; to fall into the mud, screaming and alone.  Because you've never known that, you've never needed the strength to pull yourself back out of the mud and climb to the top.""  

I shifted slightly, trying to sit up, but pain wracked me and I winced hard until it died down again.  It wasn't gone, it was now only just bearable.

""Steel is not hard by itself.  It needs flame and hammers to temper it, shape it and make it stronger than it is.  You keep on doing what you do, being what you are, with no interest, or desire, or drive to become better.  You have no flames or hammer to burn or torment you, so you will never be more than you are.  That is the purpose of suffering: to make us better... stronger.  You can never be that.""

A long moment passed while the dark under the hood remained turned in my direction.  I didn't even know if I  made sense.  Could Death truly understand what suffering meant?

After a moment, the dark and hooded figure lifted his scythe from his lap, stood and passed out of my vision.

Honky blasts out my phone alarm, another day grinding real life tasks, but today was my birthday, but never being social at work kept me out of trouble, and it kept me the job I needed, and many people work on their birthday, so I'm no different. June 30th, another year I've been alive, I check my phone, not expecting much in terms of news, but a text from my Grandma, like every year I get at 6:30 am when I was born, I never answer them, but it's good to see I'm remembered, 6 messages from her though, maybe she just sent some on accident, as I lock my phone and try to get out of bed, every year it gets harder, and the last couple days of work sure don't help.

I'm pushing 50 by the time I manage to get home. I unlock my apartment door, and I can only breath for a moment as I slouch into the dark. My feet feel like they have cinderblocks tied to them.

I don't think I could pump myself full of anymore caffeine. Much less dare to watch the news, play games, or even talk to friends or family that would be online. It's midnight again. I can only fall into bed, wincing because I just smacked my wrist on the desk next to the alarm clock. That shit hurt, but I could only muster a half-assed glare at the source of my pain. I cracked the plastic from what I could tell, which is incredible because these cheap digital clocks may as well be made of adamantium. I can only yawn a little before nodding off.

""Good morning! Today is July 30th!"" A voice chimed from next to my bed. I instinctively smacked my hand on the snooze button. I must've left it on the radio setting.

""Good morning! Today is July 30th!"" The same voice repeated again. I glanced at the clock lazily and missed the button this time. I just stared at the screen as the message started again.

""Good morning! Today is July 30th!"" It spelled out again; as I really realized what was wrong here. The clock *was not a clock*. I had my hand through it. I pulled back and watched the small hologram shimmer in place as it melded to it's original state. It repeated the same cheery message again, as I began looking around. The room had a different paint scheme, and I don't know where all my shit went.

I still had my clothes on, and I could only get up and look around in horror. This was my apartment, sure. I looked the same, but this couldn't be possible. There were holograms everywhere. The TV wasn't a TV. The computer had no screen or keyboard. The display was projected from a cylinder suspended to the wall.

""Wha... w-where am I?"" I mustered aloud in surprise.

""Current location: home. Also known as 1578 Spruce Street, apartment #301."" A voice responded. I glanced around for the source of the female voice, only to find a new image which had popped up next to the doorway. It was a circle which strobed sequentially in step with my own rhythm.

""What time is it?"" I asked feverishly.

""Approximately 7:15 A.M., Central Time Zone."" The voice responded again. Bizarrely enough the voice reminded me of the Siri app from Apple.

""Ummm..."" I wondered in jest, ""Siri?""

""It's Robin, actually."" The voice corrected, ""Siri was one of my predecessors.""

""Jesus Christ."" I stammered as I realized it understood me.

""Jesus Christ, central figure of the religion known as Christianity-"" Robin began.

""No, no, stop Robin."" I ordered quickly. I wonder if... ""Robin; what year is it?""

""The date is June 30th, 2036."" Robin asked pleasantly, ""Will that be all sir?""

""I... I'm going for a walk Robin. Thank you."" I said in nausea as I began to head for the door.

""I'm sensing elevated stress levels sir."" Robin seemed to realize, ""Are you well?"" I noticed the dot had materialized in the kitchen with me now.

""No, I just need to get fresh air."" I responded.

""Well if that's all, don't forget your ComSat, sir."" Robin explained as the dot traced a light arrow across the counter to a small wristband. I hesitantly slid the wrist on, and watched it tighten into place. The display lit up across my arm for a split second. My driver's license, my name, my credit cards, it was all there. It quickly blinked to nothing as I glanced away from it.

""How the fuck?"" I began.

""Just like checking a watch, look up what you need and it will do it."" Robin reminded, ""It's as if you've never used one before, sir.""

""Uhhhhh.... Yeah."" I nodded as I slid out the door. The building seemed the same until I left. I saw the difference in clothing immediately, with slightly fluorescent shirts being popular apparently. One rather stunning woman wore a set of ski goggles that projected emojis over the eyes. She winked at me, and I didn't know what to say as she walked on. I stepped into the street and nearly got struck by a F150. At least that's what it said it was on the side. A VTOL suddenly passed over head, the screen on it reminding people of the upcoming 4th of July.

I accidentally bumped into some guy wearing a Guy Fawkes mask with lit eyeholes and Jordans next.

""Watch it cunt."" The man exclaimed as he pushed me away, ""You want some salt?""

""Get fucked Orwell."" I deadpanned instinctively as he disappeared into the pedestrians walking around.

""This is totally going on my vlog."" A preteen nearby noted as she walked closer suddenly, a small cassette hologram slowly rotating between us as she held up her arm, ""Hey what's with that fleek getup you're wearing? You look like you just came out of the Obama administration.""

""Kinda'..."" I shrugged as she giggled and left with some friends. I still couldn't quite pull myself together with what I'd just seen. I needed to find somebody I knew. Somebody had to have an answer.

How the hell did this all happen???

Hustle. It’s what separates those who could be great from those that will be great. My father taught me that, and although he failed at a great many things in his life, It’s why people remember the man. I keep a picture of him pinned to my cubicle wall. Where most people have tacked up photos of their significant others, kids, heroes, or maybe just some comic strip with a terrible punch line, I’ve pinned up a grainy old photo of my father to motivate me. Whenever I feel defeated I look up at the man, middle aged, thin as a rail, frozen mid swing as he pulls a massive sledgehammer down over his shoulders with all his might towards some unsuspecting patch of weathered asphalt. It just takes a moment then I’m back to work, back at it harder than ever, nose to the grindstone. 

Sometimes I get so lost in analyzing whatever safety diagnostic or efficiency report they’ve given me I’ll look up from my desk and find that every one else is gone and all the light have been turned off save the dull blue glow of my moniter. On nights like that I might take a stroll through the office halls, floating past the executives offices. I’ll peer through the textured glass and wonder how their seven hundred dollar swiveling, lumbar supported, office chair cushions will one day feel under my ass.  I also take long walks through the factor wing, running my hand along the steel barrels or marveling at the sleeping mechanical behemoths that will no doubt clatter awake come morning, gears clanking spewing black smoke, and I try to remember what it feels like to sweat. 

There’s no one waiting at home. When I barge through the door at 4 in he morning, drop my keys noisily on the tile, and fall face first into the mattress no one is there to give me a cross look or a comforting touch. That’s why when my alarm went off this morning, 7 AM on the dot, and I rolled over directly into a warm body it gave me a start. I shot upright in bed, heart racing, horrified to find that sleeping soundly on my right was a man, big as an oak and strong jawed, and on my left, just beginning to stir, a woman, soft skinned and dark haired. They’re both stark naked, smiling placidly, no doubt either in the depths of just waking from some peaceful dream. I pat myself quickly, I’m still wearing my rumpled shirt and tie. Still wearing black slacks. Still have two, no wait, three day stubble. I bolt. 

Running down the hall I wonder to myself, did I really enter the wrong house last night? Was I that tired, that overworked? I reach for the door and just as I twist open the lock I hear high pitched scream. A young girl with a white knuckled grip on a floppy eared stuffed rabbit stares at me with frightened eyes, in an instant her mother is there, wrapped in loose bedsheets. She screams too. I push through the front door and tumble into the street, a man follows after me, naked, screaming, swinging an iron fire poker savagely. I think of my father. Hustle. Terrified I dart into oncoming traffic and wonder why there are so many cars, so many strange looking cars. Dancing between them, I scuttle across the street and look out over the hilltop at the city below. It’s different then I remember somehow, but there’s no time to think. I leap over the guard rail and find myself plummeting downwards towards what I hope is water. ",electric_toast

You fold up your newspaper. They should be arriving soon, eyes probably all aglow as they test your ability to determine desires, as they attempt to get your help for free. 

You backtrack a little, if they were a close friend you'd help them, but this person...? But they were the type of person that you knew because they knew your friends and you hung out on occasional at the bar and frat parties in school. 

""Hey!"" a voice chirps. You jump and look up. 

""Hey! It's been so long! How have you been?"" You say, embracing them all smiles and offering them the seat across from you. 

""I've been good. But wow, you've been doing great! Made quite a name for your self."" 

You blush a little and laugh, ""Oh it's nothing."" 

""Oh bull! You've made a living on 'Making Dreams Come True'. You do what Disney Land promises!"" 

You laugh at their joke. The smile warmly at you and tell you about the friends you used to share. They tell you who's married, who's got children, who's dead. They don't ask you to help them. Curious, you stare into their eyes. 

You're used to feelings and images. You've learned that a person who craves a family is looking more for acceptance and love. But with them there's nothing. You've seen colors. You've seen passionate reds that ache with lust, calm blues that yearn for relaxation, and soft blacks that covet power; however this is nothing. You see their black pupils, dilated in the bright light, and their hazel irises speckled with green. 

Nothing. 

""Everything okay?"" 

You start. ""Yeah,"" your voice is shaky. They frown. You want to ask them what they want. What they desire. 

""So other than the business what've you been up to?"" 

""Huh?""

""Outside of the business. What do you do? I like to read."" 

You think. What do you like? What do you want? You stare into their eyes. What do they want. You don't know. 

""I stay in touch with politics,"" you shrug, ""occasionally read magazines. Nothing exciting.""

""What's your end goal? You can't want to help rich people for the rest of your life.""

""I help people. I help them understand what they want. Why they want it."" 

They look at you, thoughtful. You stare into their eyes. It's a heavy emptiness. 

""What do you want?"" you prod, not caring that you may come off as rude.

""Nothing. I wanted to catch up with you and now I have."" 

You yearn to ask why you. Why now. They smile. 

""Remember how much fun we had in college? Damn we tore shit up! And now...we're old and tired. New drugs, new kids, new party scene. Right? Guess it's time for us to assume our roles, fall in line."" They sip their drink and check their watch. 

""I gotta get going. It was so nice to see you again and to be able to give you the gossip. You should reach out to everyone! I know they miss you."" 

They're still in touch? 

""Yeah! Thanks for meeting with me, it was a nice change of pace."" You embrace. 

""Hey maybe take a break from the Parises and Nicoles of the world and figure out what you want, huh?""

""Yeah..."" You whisper. They give a little wave and walk out the door. 

Nothing. You couldn't see. You approach the counter and order another drink, staring into the barista's eyes. She wants to earn her college degree. So you haven't lost it. You return to your seat and stare at the tourist as they amble on the street. Wiping sweat. Shading eyes. Laughing. 

--

Three days after your coffee date another friend from college, James, calls you. He ask if you have a moment to talk. You start to say you're busy, can he call back. 

James tells you that the friend you met for coffee is dead. 

He tells you that they jumped. 

He tells they drowned. 

He tells you that they left a note. 

He says that it said that they had said goodbye to everyone. Not to feel sad, that it was their time to go and that in the end they wanted for nothing.     ",raes_sunny_daes

You see nothing.",blazerman345,"“Can I please help who’s next?” asked the barista. She was stunning, no older than 23 with her hair covering her face. I walked up the counter and looked into her eyes as I do with everyone since acquiring this gift and couldn’t believe what I saw.

“What can I get you sir?” I couldn’t move. This was the first time this has happened. I didn’t see anything, not even a glimmer. 

“…Sir?”

“Of course, I’m sorry, uh… can I just get a medium black coffee. Hold the sugar, thanks.”

She hands me the coffee and manages to crack a smile and say “Have a nice day.”


I started walking towards the train station but the whole time I could not stop thinking about what I saw. I have never encountered something like that before, at least not in another person. And that’s when it hit me… She doesn’t have a desire, not a single one. I stopped dead in my tracks and ran back, as fast as I could.


I remember being there, I remember feeling, or rather not feeling anything—at that point. The whole world is numb, everything is muted, the only thing that is heard is that one voice in your head. The one calling you useless, the one telling you that everyone would be better off without you. I’ve been there before, I remember darkness, I remember the cold. 


And right before acting on it you just let go, you let everything go. 


It feels as if you’re finally in control of something, you finally have a solution, but it’s the final one but it doesn’t matter because everything is leading to the same end. It’s the very last solution because there’s no coming back, as much as you want to, you end with this. But it feels empowering, it feels good, finally having control of some aspect of your life—having control of your literal life. 

You keep walking towards the edge of the building, you pick up the knife or gun, and at that moment you feel like you’re holding the final answer to the awful riddle that is life. Some of us are lucky, some of us have a light that intervenes, some of us have a person that cares. But for the ones who don’t—we only have darkness, and being truly alone is that. When you’ve cried for help and no one answers, when you’re there by yourself with the only certain solution for making the pain stop. But something happens to us—us that are truly alone. Us that didn’t have the love and support through our rough times. Us that have been kicked while down. We either fall and accept the solution we came up with ourselves or we conquer. We conquer the darkness, we fill the emptiness, not with happiness and light but with whatever the hell gets us through the day. We do whatever we must until we climb out of the whole and it takes all of our might. We crawl through the darkness on hands and feet but we do not stop because we refuse to be defeat, then and only then do we realize how strong we truly are and how much we are worth. That’s when we stand on the other side and this time with only one pure desire—to live.

I burst through the door and I see her standing there, out of breath I walk up to her and say “I was wondering if after work you wanted to grab a bite to eat?”
And with a sparkle in her eye she responded “I would love to.”

"[WP] When you stare into someone's eyes, you can see their deepest desires, and this information has made you very successful. One day, you meet someone at a coffee shop and stare into their eyes. You see nothing.",blazerman345,"She was small like a spent candle; age had crept into her wrinkled visage. The elderly woman greeted the barista with a wide smile blessed by generations of sunny summers and simply ordered her usual. Other staff waved and greeted her with hearty calls of good morning. One fellow even pulled up a chair for her by the window. The smile never left her face. 

I, by some turn of fortune, possessed the gift of prying one's innermost desires from their eyes. Some may think it odd I wore shades with yellow lenses, but it drew the eye like a moth to a flame. 

My limits have been tested, I know very personally the exact limits of my morality and sympathy, and with that I have tried to live a good life. Every man my ally, we made positive changes in the world, truly helped people. But never have I smiled as she has. 

Curiosity overtook me; I walked over to her. She greeted me with that glorious smile and invited me to sit, claiming she loves company. She offered her hand, I kissed it politely. Her laugh was deep and caught on a cough. She explained the last man to kiss her had was her husband when they had been teenagers. 

Her thin fingers went back to knitting, her eyes to the window and its warm colors. I'd been so distracted by her smile I forgot to look into her eyes. 

The young man who had pulled her chair up came back to our table to deliver her drink, a rather large cup of hot chocolate with extra whip cream. He smiled at me, his eyes betraying him. He wanted so dearly to be back in his childhood home fishing with his brother, a cooler of beers between them. Counting days until vacation, working overtime to afford the days off. I tipped him handsomely and thanked him for saving the smiling woman the trip to the counter with this heavy cup. 

She turned back to me and said it was very sweet of me to have done that. I finally looked into her eyes, hungry for the answer to her happiness, and saw nothing. My face went pale, my hands cold, I certainly felt ill. Every person I have seen in my entire life has wanted something. Even my grandfather died with something in his eyes. There had been no exceptions. Not until this smiling woman. 

With purse in her lap, she was digging for a hard candy, figuring the sugar would bring me out of whatever shock I was in. I accepted her gift, but my mouth tasted too bitter to notice the sweetness of it. 

We sat in silence for a few minutes, only her oblivious sips to splash through the miasma I'd spewed between us. I sat looking at her, hoping I'd been wrong, that my eyes had somehow skipped over her wants. But no. She desired nothing. 

Her cup empty, she motioned for the lad to pick it up, mentioning to him that I felt ill and she would be keeping me company until I was well. He smiled at her and said we were welcome to stay as long as we like. 

More time passes before I finally gather the nerve to ask her if there's anything in this world she wants. Through her ever present smile, she tells me she has lived a good life serving her husband, her family, and her country. She has enjoyed the company of many people in her years and has been able to share her story as well as collect hundreds. Her life has been good, she is satisfied. All the while, her fingers still looped thread, a scarf tightly woven in red and white piling up in her lap. 

I nodded, thanked her for her time, and stood up to go, but she asked me to sit, to share my story with her. 

And as I did, I smiled too.

You see nothing.",blazerman345,"My name is Ellison Watershield. You may find it odd to know that my name is not the oddest thing about me. I am not like everyone else.

When I was a boy, they all thought me shy. I never looked anyone square in the eye. Rather, I couldn’t, I should say. Back then I thought it was because I was weak. I couldn’t understand how anyone else could look into another soul’s eyes; where did they find the strength? Until I met her. Alice.

I’ll never quite know what she saw in me. But she was kind, she spoke to me. We were friends. And yes, I loved her, but that isn’t the point. Because of her, I learned that I was different. I learned that when regular people look into each other’s eyes, they don’t see the pictures. The images, the ones that I see. It took me awhile to realize what they meant. That when I look into another person’s eyes, I see the vision of their deepest desire.

One day, abruptly, I stopped talking to Alice. I’d come to know that I’d never see what I truly ached for. My own reflection staring back at me in her eyes. And yes, it hurt. Like hell. But sometimes a sharper pain is less crippling then a lingering one. That was all a very long time ago, besides.

My gift has carried me a long way. You’d be surprised just how high you can climb, when every person you meet bares his deepest wants. Powerful men in ten thousand dollar suits, inscrutable and severe, were to me naked and legible as a script. I played my role well. I climbed ladders until, eventually, I sat in the highest corners of the most impressive skyscrapers, their polished exteriors reflecting the splendor of New York. But you’d find none of the like in my house; the builders had found it an odd request, but one I’d insisted on all the same. No mirrors. It had been years since I’d been able to bear the sight of my own reflection.

That’s all long ago too, albeit not quite so long ago as Alice. Today, I find myself in the bathroom of a quaint little coffee shop, nuzzled on the corner of a street where the day’s hustling activity makes way to a quieter, greener, more contemplative space. And I look up into the mirror, and I smile at my reflection. I look deep into my own eyes. And I see nothing. Still smiling, I tie my apron on, ‘Ellison’s Diner’ neatly embroidered on the front in green thread, and walk back outside.",bumblesnuff
"[WP] When you stare into someone's eyes, you can see their deepest desires, and this information has made you very successful. One day, you meet someone at a coffee shop and stare into their eyes. You see nothing.",blazerman345,"I'd developed this a long time ago - me and my mates - we collated research data, stuff from Jan's psycho analysis class, some of Ryan's electrical engineering. Its purpose was to analyze the eyes of someone to determine their mental state in real-time. As college kids, we used it to pick up chicks. But Jan got deported long since, and Ryan, well, Jesus, what happened to Ryan fucking sucks.

Since then, this little gadget has paid for itself quite handsomely. It's amazing what kinds of people want to keep up public appearances. You know how competitive the robotics sector is? They can piss money away on their SSL and encrypted volumes all they want, as long as online petitions can be bullshitted by bots the physical is always a weak point.

I've been doing this for a long time now. In some ways I think I'm some Dom Cobb like guy, but instead of a two hour movie and a team of experts I just need one good look at you and a meeting at your favorite place.

Now one day I was shooting the shit at a very honest little place I'd found, and by very honest I meant the bearded wannabe biker dudes who sat in the corner next to the pool table kept everyone in a constant state of fear, and I'd tell you more about their roided up leader Abe but this is my story not his. The TV was playing a special, and by 'special' I meant incensing, outrage-culture bullshit fountain about advancements in android technology that could make a robot with proportions and materials indistinguishable from a normal human. Of course, no self respecting Republican would let such a thing pass. 'Allow all these robots to come into our country and terk er jerbs'? Madness, they had said. So for now the idea of sexbots for hormonal teenagers with parent money or a convincing conversation partner for Oldlady McDonewell were ideas languishing only in dreams.

At this point, I was lost in this wonderful carousel of logical leaps and modern satire when some chick comes and sits down next to me. She was perfect. Ruby red lips, blonde hair, and a hint of well placed pudge. Her features were nowhere near out of proportion, her skin was almost brilliant white and her eyes were slim and wide to almost a betrayal of some perhaps recent Asian heritage. Her denim jacket and long shorts gave her the best balance between trashy and done-up. It was time to test it for the oldest feature it was made for- picking up chicks.

Instantly Abe wanted a piece. Of course he did. It was Abe, it was Abe's bar, even though the liquor license was in Mr. Stilinski's name, it was Abe's bar. And Abe approached like a lion would approach a feast, hungry and wanting to show off his hypermasculinity to come to terms that there is a great sadness and shame in his past that he really should see a therapist about.

""Well hello gorgeous."" came his cat call, sounding as if a pig was trying to talk to a ring of pearls. It seems she wanted my attention first, so I thought I'd get my first read. I stared solidly at her irises and... They were unmoving, unflinching. They scanned left and right, but there was no err to their movement. I couldn't get a read on her for what she thought of me.

""I said hello!"" came Abe's voice.

""Ah heard you the first time, sugar."" came the woman's reply, sickly sweet and southern. I couldn't deny, my pants tightened at that point - but if I was, there was an order to follow that didn't involve me getting stung either in my ego or my crotch. I continued to try and covertly stare into the woman's eyes, taking care not to draw Abe's ire for eyeing up his prey - up until now I had taken care to look like part of the scenery - and noticed they continued to be unflinching. Her blink rate never increased. Her irises never contracted. Taken off guard by the woman's abruptness, Abe swallowed his pride and attempted a slightly less incensing tack.

""I'd uh... Like to welcome you here... Ma'am. Could I buy you a drink?""

""No thanks. Ah'm alright dear.""

""Er... Would you like to join me over by the pool table?""

""Here would be just fine, Pooh Bear."" Nothing from her. A lot from Abe. He was the front row of a death metal concert, she was a lazing cat in the summer sun with the amount of data they were giving me. His pride hurt but his mommy issues flaring, he returned to his corner to sulk. With the bear safely placated, her attention turned to me. ""Abe's the uh...unofficial king of this place. Rarely really has to make much of a scene.""

""Uh huh. So if he's king, who may ah ask are you?"" Eyes stayed in that one pattern. Never moving.

""Do you want the honest, cliche answer? The uh, weary traveller who's found a nice inn and wants to stay a while."" I spun, beginning to mentally facepalm for the dorky reference.

""Uh huh. And when the mysterious darlin' Jo enters the inn?"" Nothing.

""He keeps himself to himself, but she comes over and sits down anyway.""

""Do we get into recursion here now?""

""Nah, I don't think we do. But now Abe's left, do you really want a drink?""

[WP] A world where perceived beauty or appearances isn't the most defining characteristic of a person.,dawnsshadow_,"I looked at her, but didn't really see her. All the other girls looked just like her. Black hair, blond hair, red hair. They were as individual as the hair color product they purchased from a store. Their lipstick was a different shade of red, except for the one girl who had oxblood color lipstick. I looked at her clothes and didn't see anything beyond the designer clothing that was all the rage this summer.

For a moment I felt bored simply by being in her presence. She kept talking about the latest courses she had enrolled in at the university. I had been studying there for three years already, and knew all about the best teachers. For the next hour I talked about the teachers: how to get along with them, what each of them expected out of their students, how to do well during each course and what they were like as individuals. I talked about the different kinds of group and individual exercises I had done during the courses. She listened intently, but in my mind I had already checked out. I was just giving her what she wanted. Beyond that the girl meant nothing to me.

Then the strangest thing happened. Another girl came over and asked me where the cafeteria was. She looked me in the eyes. They were soft. Calm. There was nothing special about them. I looked at her clothes. Brown. Cheap. They did nothing to highlight her breasts, which were rather flat. The clothes didn't do any favors to her figure, which was overweight and nothing noteworthy by the standards of modern society.

There was absolutely nothing noteworthy about this other girl who wanted to go to the cateria. Except this girl made me feel something. The way she spoke to me with an excited lilt to her voice. The way she looked at me for assistance with an innocence that I had lost many, many years ago. The way she made me feel good without actually doing or saying anything. She captured my imagination within seconds. I forgot about the girl with the fancy clothes, makeup, shoes, dyed hair and perfect skin. I just got up and offered to show the cafeteria to the girl with the soft brown eyes.

We talked for a full hour on that first day. We met again the following week, and although we hadn't talked with each other for many days felt instantly comfortable in each other's company. I felt calm and peaceful. She felt excited and special. I felt all of these emotions inside of myself, separated them between myself and her within seconds and just went on talking about everyday things.

I still see her every week or two. We are good friends now. I haven't bothered to tell her, but she is my soul companion. I don't think she believes in such things. I don't care. I know why we get along so easily. I know why we are so suited to each other.

The other girl? I don't remember her name. I don't remember anything about her. She is meaningless to me no matter what she looks like. This is my world. You are welcome to stay as long as you like. However, don't make any assumptions about me or my friends based on their looks. If you cannot appreciate them for who they are, cannot see how special they are, then you are like a blindman. Learn to feel. Learn to listen. Learn to see. And you must want all of these things, or you are just wasting my time.

And if that's the case then I have far better things to do than pay any attention to you.",Telperion_ST

The constant sting from scraping my knees in my drive way when I was twelve. The perpetually sprained wrist from the first and last time I got drunk in college, not to mention  this fucking non stop hang over. Despite not being able to taste food since I bit into that scalding hot pizza pocket in middle school or my inability to hear that well since that asshole Chad Mcmanus threw that fire cracker too close to me and my ears started ringing senior year I've pretty much grown accustomed to the constant pain and discomfort. It's funny to me how much people take for granted the ability to shake off an almost infinite onslaught of pain on a daily basis, stubbed toes, paper cuts, and the itching SWEET CHRIST THE ITCHING! Most people don't know this but an itch is just a mild signal to your pain receptors, something brushes against your body and your pain receptors send an itching signal to your brain, scratching dislodges the irritant and you go on with your life, not me though, through some strange twist in biology the signal never stops I just itch and itch and itch ad infinitum. Yet, despite all this the human mind is resilient. The roaring waves of pain wash over me endlessly, they never fade or dull physically but, like with all things the human mind adapts, some days I can almost tune out the cacophony, I can even focus when I need to, attempt to live some semblance of a functioning life. It truly is amazing what you can get used to or, so I thought, until I met her. She was beautiful, warm, funny, kind, and above all patient. She never rushed me down a set of stairs, never hurried me over an icy side walk. When we made love it was gentle, no matter how badly we wanted to thrust madly towards sweet oblivion she understood that when it was over and the dopamine petered out the soreness and aching would remain. She made the world hurt less, but unlike pain her patience was finite. Every time I made us late, every time I couldn't block out the noise of my body, every time I was afraid to try something new for fear of a bump or scratch her patient smile was chipped away until she could no longer hide the resentment in her face anymore. I was holding her back, we both knew and we both understood that it couldn't continue. I'll never forget the day she left, she smiled her patient smile, looked at me, tears welling up in her kind eyes, she kissed me gently on the lips and walked out of my life. Then, it happened, like a trumpet from hell cutting through the din of my body it came, this pain in my chest unlike anything I've ever known before, both a sharp stabbing pain and low dull ache all at once. I buckled at the knees, everything I thought I knew and understood about pain was ripped away and replaced with something truly excruciating. Days went by, they turned to weeks, weeks swirled into months, into years. It never stops, sometimes I feel as if I'll never catch my breath again. I can't get past it, I can't ignore it. It's amazing what you can get used to, it's horrifying to find the thing that you will never get used to. ",misanthropicloner999

His rage ignited the 'flowers', and the Fallen Angel simultaneously cried and laughed at how the demonic monstrosities actually looked better when consumed by black hellfire.

However, the two have to plan a baby shower and things aren't going well.",silverwolf51,"The three sat in Jesus's humble living room.  Lucifer and Jesus each in their own chair, and god with his arms stretched out to either side of his couch.  The lord began, ""So like, we can have jesus hanging on the cross right over the door when you walk in, and-""

""Dad, can we not?,"" The son of God twisted his face in concern, ""It's so tacky at this point, and really just a distasteful statement of class that Death can have the real Jesus nailed up at her baby shower.""

Lucifer lifted one leg and placed it perpendicularly over his knee, ""I think it's a fantastic idea.""

""Thank you."" God nodded, turning his head back to Jesus expectantly.

Jesus began to fidget with his halo, ""I just think once is enough...really.""

""I disagree,"" The fallen angel began to play with his beard, ""I think it would be very appropriate and tasteful.  Maybe nail up a few dopplegangers as well?""

""You know what,"" God took out a small notebook and began scribbling in it, ""That is a great fuckin' idea.""

Jesus was beginning to get irritated.  He glanced at Satan while God was busy with his notepad.  The lord of hell smiled casually back.  *""That son of a bitch...""* , Jesus thought.

""Okay,"" God looked up from his notepad, ""Cake.  What do we think?""

Feeding people.  Now this was something Jesus knew a thing about and was confident his word would be taken seriously.  ""Okay, well I'm thinking we do something really light, maybe with some wine and fish mixed i-""

""Viscera cake."" Lucifer interjected, ""With all due respect you your opinion, kiddo, this is Death's baby shower after all and we should really go for something she's going to enjoy.""

""Viscera cake? What does that even entail?!""

""Entrails.""

""You know what Satan you are one sick fuckin' puppy.""

""Now son,"" God intervened, seeing that this other third was becoming heated, ""Why don't we give Satan a chance.  That's what we are about, alright?""

Jesus looked at the other two in the room in a state of disbelief, ""You know what?  Fine.  Go ahead and tell us why we should all eat innards.""

Lucifer slid back into his chair, ""Well, this is Death's baby shower.  One of the biggest moments in her undeath, and It will be well worth some of our discomfort to make this moment extra special.""  He smiled again, showing his pointed teeth.

""When the *fuck* did you become concerned with other people?"" 

""I'll have you know Death and I are very close."" 

""Yeah it's probably your fuckin' kid.""

""Jesus Christ!"" God's brow furled, ""I didn't make myself into a trinity for you to act like a little shit.  Calm down and show some respect.""

""You're being rude."" Satan concurred.

""I'm going to get a few drinks for everyone,"" God stood up, ""So we can all just calm the fuck down...""  He walked out of the living room and entered the kitchen.  The door was on a spring hinge and closed behind him.

Jesus looked to Satan with a cold stare, ""Don't think I don't see what you're doing.""

""I haven't the faintest idea what you mean,""  Satan replied with a casual shake of his head, ""I think this is stressing you out, and you need to relax.""  He reached towards the coffee table for a glass of water.  He took a sip, releasing a hissing noise as steam exited his nose.  That cordial smile reappeared, ""Oh, and by the way, I'm going to nail you to that cross myself."" ",TheCockKnight

My friend Jeffery, a rather talented and well-versed scribe, began asking her various philosophical and scientific questions. 

             ""Ma'am, I must ask, what is the purpose of life and the human race as we know it?"" Jeffery asked.

""...IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR LOW PRICES AND QUALITY GUARENTEED, COME INTO FAST-MART TODAY, WE WON'T DISSAPOINT"". 

The poor bastard had no clue what she had gotten herself into. Poor sobs such as this one tended to have come from far away lands, searching for a better life in our newfound ""Land of the Opportune"". Little did they know that they'd become opportunities, not opportune. 

After signing an ""employment"" contract, which they could not understand nor negotiate, they would sit down in a small room filled with people very much like them, and begin the conditioning process. I suppose no one told them that the only thing they'd be conditioned for would be a life of slavery. I'm sure the poor sob remembers the painful needle slicing in and out of the skin, spelling out her new baroque and colorful vocabulary of only 16 words. Never again will she utter a ""hello"", ""I love you"", or ""Goodbye""; Those were erased straight off her body during conditioning. Her tongue is now property of Fast-Mart LLC.

""Enough friend, we've had our fun, we mustn't tarry on our way to inscriptionary!"" I shouted at Jeffery as I continued walking down the road towards class. Jeffery caught up to me after about a minute or so, yet he had a look to him; like something was awry. 

""What's the matter friend?"" 

           ""It's just that yeller, she noticed something. I'm just... I...""

""Yes friend, what was it?""

           ""She saw my palm, the left one, where I had my special word inscribed""

""Yes, and what of it""
           
           ""It was the name of my mother, but not her exact name, a nickname if you will. I called her Mary of the Prairie, but no one had this inscription aside from me and my mother. I had ""Mary"", and she had ""of the Prairie"". She has been dead for 5 years, and from what I knew no one else had this inscription. But the woman back there, she saw my palm and grabbed it, and before I could yank it back she leaned over and put her left palm out as if to show me something"" 

Visibly shaken, I let Jeffery compose himself before asking, ""What was it? what did it say?""

Jeffery held back tears and looked me in the eye, and the words that he said will haunt me, for years and years.

            ""...of the Prairie""

"[WP] You collect wisdom teeth, each one making you slightly wiser. At some point, you question the wisdom of collecting and maintaining all the teeth. A representative of the Dentist Cult comes to welcome you on having reached ""wisdom equilibrium.""",sketches1637,"**KER-SMASH**

**WHAT THE FU-**

""Greetings, young one. I see you have reached equilibrium"" said the strange egg-shaped bone monster that just crashed through my window. ""We have a position in our organization, a cavity in our ranks, that requires some filling.""

""And what the hell might you be?"" 

""Why, I'm the tooth fairy.""

...

""Seriously, I'm going to call the cops"" I said while reaching towards my cellphone.

""Oh, I think you'll find the line is rather... chewed up at the moment"" the self-proclaimed tooth fairy states as it happily jostles back and... wait, what? Is he wearing teeth?

""There are so many things I want to say right now""

""Then speak, young one, ask whatever your heart desires and perhaps I'll bite.""

All the tension evaporates from the room due to how surreal the moment and, while I'm normally not one to yell at 2am, let loose on this freak of nature that owes me for window repairs.

""First of all, this is the second story and you jumped through my window. There's already so many things wrong with that but, shit, it isn't even snowing out how is a white Gillie suit going to help with anything? And one made from teeth? Can you just explain what the hell you are without doing one of those stupid dental puns?""

He shuffles a little bit and I swear I hear a little ""*they're not stupid*"" before composing himself. ""Fine, fine. I'm Dennis from the local Dental Cult. We heard that you were gathering teeth of your own volition so thought you might want a membership"".

""Why the hell would you think I would want to join a *Cult*, out of all things, where people like you go to?""

""Why are you collecting teeth then?""

""'cause they make me smarter...""

""Uh-huh"" he states before an awkward silence, ""that's pretty stupid bro"". It takes  a while to recuperate from having the gillie-tooth freak insult me.

""Seriously, gathering wisdom teeth makes me smarter""

""Oh well, I'm not one to judge; we got a lot of weird people in our club. It *is* a dental cult after all, not really people you want to hang out with by choice. Your membership is already processed. You should have enough teeth for at least a pair of pants, right?""

""For the love of God, I don't want to be indentured to your stupid cult""

He stares at me and smiles, I groan at the pun I unintentionally made and put my wisdom top hat on before fading into the night with tooth fairy Dennis. Seems like I found a home, even if its full of crazies.

[WP] You're at an equestrian event as a competitor. Your horse is a coconut.,supah_lurkah,"He stood at the starting line, idly wondering how he ended up in his current predicament.  *Too much alcohol*, he mused to himself. To his left and right, the other jockeys were mostly tense, ready to spur their horses into action as soon as the starting gun sounded, occasionally glancing at him.  The expressions on their faces ranged from amusement and pity, to disgust.  The announcer for the Downs well and truly didn't know what to make of the man standing in the middle of the starting gates, with half of a coconut in either hand.  Said announcer decided to name him 'coconut nutter'.  Surely everyone in the audience was thinking the same thing. Nervous laughter swept the Downs.

Suddenly the starting gun fired and the horses were out of the gate, the man with the coconuts sprinting as fast as he could, clapping the coconuts together with a staccato CLOPCLOPCLOPCLOP that could barely be heard over the thundering hooves of his competitors.  The horses slowly spread out, though two were neck-and-neck.  It was a photo finish as the jockeys and their mighty steeds crossed the finish line.  After examining the photo, it was determined the horse named Jacob's Folly won.  The man with the coconuts was somewhat ashamed.  He didn't even the top 5, let alone first.  The only one who felt more shame was the jockey who rode in behind him.

Peters was mortified.  He lost to the guy with the *fucking coconut*.",Vercalos

"[WP] As you tend your large garden, you notice a naked couple walk unnervingly close to a tree bearing golden fruit...",ChessandSalem,"The Gardener looked towards the Tree of Knowledge and saw the beautiful young couple of humans he'd created walking towards it. He'd remembered telling them not to go towards the tree, warned them of dire consequences if they ate from it yet there they were. His brow furrowed in anger as He got to His feet and started walking towards them. 

""Why would you stop them? You wanted this, that's why you put the tree within reach."" A voice called out to Him. The Gardener turned and looked at the ground, there was the Serpent, gleaming black scales, it's forelegs raised so the beast could stare the Gardener in His eyes. 

""No I don't want this. I want everyone to be happy, for there to be peace. Knowledge will ruin them, poison their pure innocent souls, no good can come of it. I must stop this."" The Gardener replied. He could hear His own voice shaking with fear and confusion as he spoke. 

""Yes you do. You're alone, so painfully alone, that's why you made all these things, but it's not enough and you know it."" The Serpent said, it's tongue darting and flicking with malice. 

""I'm not alone. I made this world and all these beautiful creatures, all these beautiful flowers. Look at that sky, what a wonder to behold such a sight."" The Gardener said as He gazed upon the sunset. It was a magical blend of yellows and reds and purples and blues. The sun's rays streaking across the sky like a hand reaching out to help those in need. 

""Look at that bird flying past us. It knows nothing of you. It has no idea you made it. Those fools near the tree, they understand the words, but they can't grasp the meaning. There is nobody you can truly talk to, nobody you can truly be with. Let them eat, let them understand. Then they can fear you. Then they can love you."" The Serpent said. 

The Gardener stared at the young couple, they were so happy and content, yet their smiles were somehow false, their eyes were dead. 

""Let them eat. Then you can punish them. Then you can punish all who disobey you. You can reward those who love you. You will stand in judgement over all the world and they shall kneel and plead for your mercy. You are nothing but a lonely old man right now, but with one bite of that apple, you become God."" The Serpent told him. 

""No! Go away! I banish thee! I cast thee away from me forever!"" The Gardener said. 

The Serpent fought against the winds the Gardener set forth against him.

""You can never be rid of me! You didn't make me! I'm part of you! I'll always be inside you! Be a million years I'll wait, it takes but one moment of weakness, one moment of desire and I'll prevail!"" The Serpent cried before the winds overpowered him and blew him into the distance. 

""You two! Get away from that tree! It's not for you!"" The Gardener cried out. The naked humans turned and fled as he chased them away. Once they were out of his eyesight the Gardener slumped over. The weight of being alone wore on Him greatly. He turned and stared at the Tree. With but a thought He could will it out of existence, may it impossible for humanity to ever learn, but He couldn't bring himself to do it. He cursed His weakness and His desire to not be alone.

Far in this distance the Serpent saw the tree still standing and smiled. His victory was inevitable.   ",OreWins

That's good stuff, one time I got so baked I thought I saw a bunch of animals and shit having a party for this donkey, holy shit, that was the most fun I have had in a long time, Shit I've gone off track again, so anyway there I was on a weekend, completely stoned when a couple of weirdos walk up to me, I'd be lying if I said that I didn't get an enormous boner, honestly they could probably see on board the ISS it was massive, it was like my bollocks were Mexico and my kidneys Donald trump. Fuck sake, I'm going off on a segment again, anyway, my point is that they were Scandinavian, must have been    they were a mix of gods and mortals, most had a healthy mixture all over but some had a top/ bottom divivde, like, think the upper body of the rock on kevin harts legs, and there was this one girl who had a left/right thing going on, it was weird but her left side was far superiour to her right, but i could be biased. Also they where all naked, like I said, scandinavian.
Then one of them says to me 

""tell me kind sir, be this the tree of knowledge, from which golden apples brim with the knowledge of times gone past?""

The children crowded around the elderly man as he slowly felt his way to his favorite leather seat. His joints ached as he sat, and the excited boys and girls took to their favorite spots around the armchair. This 'Throne of Tales', as dubbed by the children, was one of the last surviving relics of the great disaster long ago.  

The truth surrounding the sun's final appearance was forever lost, dying with the last of the old era's sun-walkers.  In its stead, was born new myths and legends.  Tales of mighty gods battling fearsome demons, once thought to be fiction, became the basis of new religions.  Science and Enlightenment gave way to basic survival and religious fervor in the centuries since the sun's departure. 

The Seer began his tale of the ""Eternal Dark"", an origins story about how the Earth was forever covered in darkness, after the Earth-bearer was lured by glow of the Sun.  It was only when the Earth-bearer got too close, that it saw the Sun for what it really was, a glowing bulb attached to the forehead of an enormous fish-like creature, but by then it was already too late.  The Earth-bearer was snapped into two by the serpent's mighty jaws, and the upper torso of the Earth-bearer, along with the Earth fell into the belly of the beast. 

Several children were verbal about their disgust, while others demanded to know more of the Earth-eater.  The Seer smiled.

'Seer' was a rare title in this day and age. The fallout and radiation ensured that most humans born would never have use of their eyes, and the ""lucky"" few that could were blessed with the sights (or at least, what little that could be seen with torchlight) of the various monstrosities that now walk the lands.  

Seers who managed to survive hunting trips would bring home descriptions of floating, multi-limbed beasts that could use its arms like whips to wrap its prey and creatures that looked like it could be descendants of the Earth-eater.  Specific details were hard to come by, as they were often forgotten in the chaos of the creatures devouring several of the hunting party. Humanity had definitely lost its place at the top of the food chain.

The children scattered as they heard their mothers call them to bed. The consistent pooling of water from the underground spring into the vault made for a perfect timing mechanism, since day/night cycles no longer existed. The time-pool was full, and that meant it was time for rest, which suited the Seer just fine. 

It was then that the last hunting party returned.  Everyone survived, which was always a relief.  However the hunting party's Seer nervously approached Seer John, and told him that the gods have returned.  That a great ball of fire has emerged from the land. Seer John ran outside.

Now, nothing else would wake him up and he can't listen the song without cringing. He checked his phone and saw Srishti's message on his phone. 

'Good morning. How are you?'

'Morning. Just woke up.' He typed a quick message and sent it. His eyes were drooping again and soon he was snoring. His alarm didn't find it amusing and rang at full volume.

""Damn snooze!"" Rohan cursed.

He yawned and stretched himself. There was a lot of work to be done today. His stocks were almost empty and he had to check the emergency systems as well. 

Rohan picked himself up and scratched fourteenth line on the wall - one for a day. It felt like yesterday when he would have woken up next to Srishti and gone to work. Then, one day, he woke up alone in his room, in his house, in this world. He tried to find people everywhere but none could be found. Most of the systems were working fine but if any system broke down, it remained so. Rohan had learnt to fix a few systems that were extremely essential to his survival but other than that, he was as useless as Srishti used to call him when he was with her. Here, he had seen one house on fire that remained on fire till it was ashes as there was no one to fight the fire; he had also seen half the city's electricity going out due to some failure. Luckily, his house was secure and comfortable till now.

Rohan had cried for the first few days and had barely been able to hold himself together. Initially, he thought that he was part of some huge prank that was being played on him by someone. However, after one Sunday had passed, he started accepting that he was part of a puzzled reality. He was alone, in the whole city and probably the whole world.

His only solace was the mobile phone that was still receiving full signal. He could still message and call everyone on his contact list. He could even use the internet for most of the period. However, the speed was abysmal and no cat videos or video calls were coming to pacify him. Initially, he would talk to his wife for hours every day but now, it was only in the evening, for half an hour or so. She had her work and he didn't want to latch on to her.

Rohan went to the super market and picked a trolley. Today was a big shopping day. Whenever Rohan had imagined an apocalyptic situation like this, he had expected zombies. He still expected (hoped?) that a zombie would pop up from somewhere and he would be able to use the bazooka that he carried with him. He knew he would be able to shoot the zombie in a second but at least he would have company for that one second. 

Rohan picked up a laptop as well. This time he chose a Macbook. He had a huge assortment at his disposal and he enjoyed the choices. He wanted to update his blog and email his wife. He had been delaying this email for a long time now but he decided that it was time. Rohan picked up a few more items and came back to his house. He went to his study and sat down to write. His phone vibrated.

'How's the plan going?'

Srishti's message flashed. She would at least one ask this of him. Rohan smiled painfully. The plan was immediately formed as soon as he had talked to his wife. He would try to find a way back here and she would try to do the same in the other world. At least that was the plan that they had decided upon. However, with each passing day, his resolve weakened. He still harboured some feelings for the home that was once his but he no longer had hope and didn't even bothered to try to find a way.

He started typing the email-

*

Hey Srishti,

I love you. I miss you.

*


Rohan stopped and looked at the words he had written. He knew the hardest part was to frame the words that were coming next.

*

I don't think there is a way out. I think it is prudent to accept the truth as it is. It is time you move on. The book that I have written should be giving you the revenues and I hope those would be sufficient for you and the kids. I will continue to write and all the proceeds from them will reach you. However, it is time that you move on. I have missed so much that even if I can somehow come back, I don't think it would be the world I left. 

I have missed the birth of my kids. Heck! I found out that we were having twins through a message. I am trying to take care of them the only way I can but I am as good as a dead father. Please give them a real father. 

It has been seven years now. I have loved you each day of these seven years and I know you have too. But it is time to move on.

Love,
Rohan

*

Rohan read the letter once again and tears prompted in his eyes. She had been with him through these seven long years. She was the one who inspired him to write the book about his life in this place. In return, he was making her wait for a person who would never go back. Rohan had stopped trying for almost a year. Even the solutions that the scientists sent him, he had stopped attempting. He would simply reply back that it didn't work. While he missed his wife, he enjoyed the solace of the place - free of any burden or hustle and bustle of life. He didn't miss his twin seven year old kids much as he had only seen photos of them and never even talked to them. 

Rohan stood up and looked around the room. The walls were filled with scratches, each denoting one day he had spent here. Perhaps, he had started to like this place.

[WP] You have the chance to send the contents of one shoebox back in time. The box will appear before one random person. What do you put in the box?,HelixHasRisen,"&gt;Oh very nice! I loved the idea of people participating in a cause to overcome the box's inherent randomness. That was a very enjoyable short story. Thank you!

I liked writing it because I think there are two possible endings.

A: The shoebox is a magic prank of sorts. I find the showbox with the note in it, I copy the note in it hoping to preserve the note to try and 'beat the box' and it reappears exactly when I recieved it. Creating a Casual loop paradox.

Or

B: I really did send the note back eventually saving JFK and changing history forever.

"[wp] You are an entry level employee at PermaCorp, a multinational finance firm. The catch is if you kill an employee at PermaCorp, you can take their job. Describe your first day at the firm.",I_should_stay,"The kid who approached my car couldn't have been older than 15. His curly black hair was too long to satisfy company regulations, and that vest could've been picked up in any random thrift store. He stuck out his palm expectantly as I rolled down the window.

""Aren't you a little too young to be a valet parker?"" I asked, fishing for my keys.

He blew his bangs out of his eyes. ""True. But I ain't too young to be an intern!"" The kid drew a knife from underneath his vest and lunged at me. I slammed on the accelerator and shot into the parking garage, forcing him to let go of my car. Just to make sure the kid couldn't catch up, I sped all the way up to the rooftop parking area. My heart was still pounding when I stumbled through the glass doors, into the PermaCorp lobby.

""Welcome to PermaCorp!"" The receptionist gave me a polished smile. The nametag on her blouse read ""Molly.""

""Listen, you've got to help me."" Panting, I collapsed onto the marble counter. ""Some kid just tried to kill me out there.""

""Oh, you must be new here!"" Molly flipped through a notepad. ""Are you the intern Bollard hired?""

""Yes!"" What did that have to do with anything? ""But what about the kid? You need to lock this place down or something.""

""It must be nice to receive an internship for such a prestigious position straight out of college."" Her tone dripped with venom, and she began rummaging through her drawers. ""I wish I had been granted the same opportunity."" Molly rose to her feet, the malice in her eyes prompting me to back away. ""Better late than never.""

A gunshot rang out, and I dove to my left, slamming onto the ground. Bullets ricocheted off the floor, inches from my head, as I crawled to the door ahead of me. Any competent gunman would've filled my body with the entire round; as luck would have it, Molly did not fall into this category. The gunshots stopped as I swung the door open and fell forward into the hallway. From behind the glass pane, I heard her curse; apparently, she didn't know how to reload.

At this point, it would've been more prudent of me to run from this building and never look back, but I really needed employment, and two random murderers weren't enough to deter me from this job quite yet. According to the map posted on the wall, Bollard was a floor down. Thankfully, nobody else confronted me on my way there. 

""Bollard,"" I gasped, barging into his office, ""people have been trying to kill me since I've gotten here.""

""Ah, sorry about that."" Bollard swiveled around in his chair and stroked his chin. ""I neglected to inform you of the company policy: here at PermaCorp, you can take another person's job if you manage to kill them!""

""That's fucked up!"" I kicked the doorframe angrily. ""Sorry. I'm going to have to resign before that happens. Just tell me how to get out of here without getting murdered.""

""I'm afraid you can't quit."" Bollard jumped on top of his desk, sending papers flying. ""You see, I've become weary of the pressure that comes with high-level administration,"" he said, unsheathing a letter opener, ""and I've been looking for a lower-level opening. If you'll just hold still...""

Bollard's heavy footsteps thundered behind me as I took off down the hallway. There was no way I'd get out of this place on my own; I just needed to find somewhere safe to call the police and bide my time until they arrived. Ahead of me loomed my haven: a single-occupancy bathroom. 

""Could've knocked."" I jumped backwards, banging my head against the door. Before me stood a janitor, attacking the tiled wall with a scrub brush. To my relief, he was both fully-clothed and unarmed.

""You're not going to try and kill me, are you?"" His hair was gray, and he looked pretty scrawny. I could probably take him on, unless his mop turned into a sword, or he had some lethal chemical spray in his cart.

""Nah, I like my job."" He held out his hand. ""Name's Ted.""

It could have been a trap, so I didn't bother shaking it. ""If you're not gonna play the 'kill someone to advance' game, why would you bother working here?"" 

Ted shrugged. I shook my head. His nonchalance was suspicious. ""Aren't you scared that you'll be murdered?""

He turned back to his tiles and resumed scrubbing. ""Nope. Nobody's ever tried to kill me. Why would they want my job?""

Five minutes later, I admired my reflection in the small bathroom mirror. The blue uniform looked good on me. All I needed to do now was wash out the bloodstains.",hideouts

You find out where they live and knock on their door to seek revenge.,Iknowdemfeelz,"Another soul felt prose, another heart felt remorse of a world swallowed by agony and misery. My world, this pain I live every moment.  Every stroke of debilitating hopeful wishing onto the page,  feeling the agony flow from my synapses to my hands in perfect synchronization. Unable to ask for a better verbiage put to pen. 

Yet once more my drunken droning gone unnoticed as the moon sinks below the horizon. Night creeps back to daylight as I retreat once more, no longer able to stand as the alcohol takes full effect. 

I awake to no up votes, no showers of praise by the endless masses. My valor stolen away by the famous and well renowned. Whose shit upon paper recalls a world of catcalls and worship. Reading my stolen prompt, eyeing the lexicon facing to describe my agony in my moment of another loss. 

I grip my pistol, seething once more inside as this hatred for the world renowned rises. Another reminder of my failure to rise above this smokey ashen decay. These posters with no clue of what I've had to do to get here, my moment pulled from under me by another heart throb post. 

This futility I fight against, this demon that grows stronger inside. Unable to take the defeat once more. A simple search reveals their latest pseudonym, their city in which they reside. Tonight they die, no longer my words go unheeded, no longer my threats fall upon the deaf. 

This love they preach, this alpaca they carry their collection, doesn't blur my mission. No longer they rob me of this moment,  as I wait. They told me I fuck up everything I touch. They clamor about at their droppings, yet it all changes today. 

Brass checking my weapon, I eye them. Unaware of the theft that took place, unable to comprehend this demon calling for blood. This monster calling for recognition. 

Every moment leading to this climax, unable to control myself, giddy in the moment. You'll all watch their kingdom crumble. Once more I'll return to my perch atop this prose. 

This vexation of verbiage, a lexicon they lack like mine. No more control, all surprises. My own casualty as we all fight this futile misery. ",SmokeEater62
[WP] Canada becomes suspiciously enthusiastic about people immigrating up from the US...,JimBobBoBubba,"The flickering of the dim florescent lights illuminated the room as Thalia stared with emotionless eyes at the ceiling, while the ticking of a clock sounded in the distance. She couldn’t remember how long she had been there, and she lost all interest in figuring it out. Nothing seemed to matter anymore, ever since he was taken from her.
       “23,996...23,997…23,998…. 23,999…24,000.” Thalia sighed “There are 24,000 holes in the ceiling.” She whispered to herself, with a momentary lapse of sanity uncontrollable laughter bubbled up escaping her lips. The episode lasted for several minutes before subsiding into a soft sobbing, they had been so close to fleeing the country. 
       “Oi! Up with you, time to see the Doctor.” The asylums guard demanded banging on the visitation window. Thalia’s bitten, bloody nails dug into her mattress gritting her teeth. Sitting up she swung her legs over the side of the bed. Raising her hands above her head she stood up stretching her stiff muscles, she could feel the burn gaze of the Guard scanning her naked body.
         “Hurry it up would you, the Doctor has requested you showered and groomed before you see him.” He grinned with a crooked smile, what was left of his teeth blackened and decayed. Thalia walked out the door he held. She passed a long hall of rooms that resembled her own, male and female alike and everyone stir crazy and nude. Women’s screaming muffled by the padded rooms and men punching or banging their heads against the hard stone wall.
         She walked through the dark shower room and covered her stinging eyes as the motion sense lights blinded her. The guard walked in behind her and turned on the hot water; striding to a cabinet he unlocked it pulling out a bar of soap, washcloth, towel and razor. Thalia reached out her hand expectantly, the guard’s expression morphed into a dangerous glare.
      “You best be putting those hands at your sides darling, new rule. You stand there and keep your mouth shut while I bath you. The last bitch tried to slit my throat with a razor, I’m not falling for that shit again.” Thalia nodded turning her back to him stepping into the welcoming spray of the hot water, she moaned she had since forgotten what it felt like to shower. Turning around she saw the Guard’s impatient glaring, her shoulders slouched stepping out of the water towards him.
         His glare extinguished, lust sparking in his dark brown eyes as he skimmed her body. Wetting the washcloth, he lathered a generous amount before slowly taking the soapy cloth to her skin. Closing her eyes, she thought back to the first time she had really made a connection with Him, after her chip malfunctioned.
       Gray clouds swirled in the sky, lightning flashed illuminating the street in 3 second intervals. They had just successfully pulled off their first supply run, avoiding the Canadian forces that patrolled the streets at night. They brought their car to a slow stop in front of their camp in the middle of the woods, where they had built a cabin with others like them. Others whose chips had malfunctioned, those who were aware of the corrupt society the word was becoming.
             He hopped out of the truck excited about the spoils they had acquired.
   “Thalia! You were amazing, I have never seen anyone handle the husks the way you did! They thought you were one of them.”
     “Oh stop it Jeremy, it was nothing.” Thalia blushed starring at her feet shyly. He stepped closer to her tilting her chin up to look into his eyes.
      “I’m serious. Don’t sell yourself short, Thalia you are the most amazing woman I’ve ever met.” He whispered stroking her cheek with his thumb, Thalia gazed into his glacial blue eyes and her heart seem to pound in her throat.
        “You…really think so?” She asked hesitantly making no effort to pull away from him. Nodding Jeremy put his hands on either side of her face and leaned in pressing his lips to hers. Thalia melted into him winding her arms around his neck deepening the kiss. His tongue swept across her bottom lip requesting entry, she parted her mouth slightly her tongue darting out to entwine with his passionately. 

      “Hey! Are you even listening to me?” The guard demanded snapping his fingers in front of her face. Thalia blinked a few times snapping back to reality.
   “Huh?” She asked confused looking up at him. He huffed annoyed shaking the towel out in front of her.
   “I said dry off damn it before we’re late. The Doctor doesn’t like to be kept waiting.” He repeated throwing the towel at her, she began drying herself as slow as she possibly could just to piss him off more. Once she was dry he pointed her in the direction they were headed and she walked in front of him like instructed.
        How had the world gotten so fucked up? Thalia thought her bare feet thudding on the linoleum floor. Damn the scientist who invented the chip. Research plans were discovered that dated back 50 years of the chip’s design. The chip was designed to be implanted into the human brain that shut off a person’s free will, and was replaced by programming that controlled every aspect of a person’s life. The United States had been secretly taking over the world, one Canadian at a time. The chip was made to make people obey the government’s commands, to take up arms to infiltrate other countries for world domination.
    It 2016 was the year of the new President, when the United States had turned into a tyranny. The people were given a false sense of security by the Prime Minister of Canada, warmly welcoming anyone who wished to escape. Little did they know it was a trap, lured into the main testing ground for the chip. This wasn’t the first time she had been experimented on, when she first entered Canada with her parents she had been implanted though she didn’t remember how.
           Thalia had subconsciously been aware of the chip’s programing without being able to do anything about it, that was until Jeremy came along. It was Jeremy that helped bring her consciousness forward, destroying the functionality of the chip giving Thalia control over her body again. Her heart thudded painfully in her chest when she thought of him. He was the love of her life, and she’d never see him again. She was meant to spend the rest of her days as a lab rat, while the “doctor” tried to figure out how to prevent the sub conscious regaining control over the body.
           Thalia neared the end of the hallway, she squared her shoulders and marched into the testing room. She stopped on the yellow line like she had been instructed to many times, glaring daggers into the back of the man responsible for all her heart ache. The man leading the chip epidemic, the one who prodded in her brain constantly trying to break her and find answers. The guard cleared his throat announcing their arrival, the “doctor” pivoted in their direction his glossy white lab coat whipping around him.
      With a huge grin he strode over to them, his black dress shoes clonking on the cement floor. He stroked the side of her cheek, turning her face left and right inspecting her.
“Hello Thalia, glad to see you’ve recovered from last week’s procedure.” That wide smile void of all emotion remained plastered on his face. With eyes that matched his own she glared up at him
     “Hello, Father.”

""The easiest way to explain it, is that your ""souls"" or ""essence of being"" is really quite powerful. Your ideas of heaven become a reality here when you put so much time in thinking about it, and praying about it. You could say your soul builds your perfect home."" Death shifted uncomfortably while she spoke.

""What about Hell?"" 

""Technically it's not really a thing."" Death turned and pointed towards a darker corner. ""I mean you will see some people in these burning pits of despair, but they are quite literally doing it to themselves. I've tried telling them but they are too busy screaming and bleeding to hear me.""

""That's awkward."" I looked at my feet. ""You know what else is awkward?""

Death raised an eyebrow. ""What's that?""

""Well, I am an atheist. What are my options? Do I just get a void? Is it taboo to jump in on the heaven of others? Can I make one now? WHat about reincarnation? Is that a thing, too?"" 

""Woah.. haha slow down. You have so many questions, and luckily all the time to have them answered."" Death smiled. ""You absolutely can go visit all of the heavens. You can stay in one you like or change it up when your bored. I stroll through them all regularly. It's particularly exciting when I new one shows up. Reincarnation is totally real, too. What's better is you can choose how you go back. Obviously you can't go back as your current self, it would terrorize too many people.""

I let out a chuckle. ""Well, damn. There goes my plans!""

Death Looked around, satisfied with her explanations, and turned back to me. ""So, my dear, what'll it be? Gunna go exploring or head back for another go at it?""

""Can I hang back a bit longer?"" 

""What? Here with me? Umm..huh..."" She looked around again. 

As far as the eye could see there were glowing town-like collections of people. Perfect worlds, free of pain and suffering. Great foods, and amazing collections of nature. Beautiful music seemed to pour out from every single one of them. Sure there were a few burn-y bits but those were easy enough to ignore.

She looked back to me. ""I mean, you could stay here. I'm not really going anywhere until my 4:30. Don't you want to explore though?""

""Sure I do! I just, think I want to hear your stories first. I mean, I am right here. Seems as good a place to start as any! I mean, only if its ok with you?""

Death's eyes sparkled. ""You want to hear MY stories? No one has ever asked for my stories! Everyone is always terrified of me. I am the one that gets blamed for them being here in the first place. I tell them they can go to their heaven, and they can't get away from me fast enough.""

""That is rude as hell. You take all this time to make sure we know what's going on, the least they could do is thank you. So let me be the first. Thank you, Death..""

""Wren.""

""Thank you, Wren, for making sure I got here safely and for helping me decide whats best for my eternity. Now, please won't you tell me your tales?""

Her voices cracks, holding back her excitement. ""Do you want to start with how I got the job or how I help design pet heaven?""

[WP] Humanity makes first contact with an advanced alien civilization. This is first contact for them as well.,LegendaryGoji,"The Earth and it's people were united together for the first time in history to greet their neighbours from foreign stars. All we knew the week before is they they were coming and that they had made precautions to ensure that their visit was fruitful and safe. All we knew the day before is that they called their species the Felorak and that they would land in Geneva. Scientists from universities all over the world had gathered to ask questions of our celestial cousins. Political leaders stood by the meeting point in nervous anticipation, some worried about economic repercussions, some worried about looking weak in front of more socially advanced beings. Sceptics watched their live feeds at home eager to point out flaws in this government hoax and/or conspiracy.

At precisely noon local time, a shiny-black, dome-shaped craft descended from the sky, parachutes slowed it's decent and thrusters guiding it towards a landing spot prepared quickly by humanities most excited engineers, eager to examine the alien vessel. The craft made contact with the ground and an unearthly silence coincided a pause of disbelief amidst the crowd gathered to meet the extra terrestrials. Was this really happening? The group moved from their safe distance towards the ship. As men in suits and lab coats and formal dress from all walks of life approached, the black door slid open, and out stepped the beings. Silver and white space suits, all six and a half plus feet tall, adorned with red knobs, symbols and sigils, and a single glass face, stepped onto green grass. Their faces were pale and grey. They had eyes, bigger an further apart than a mans. They had noses, wider and further up than a mans. They had mouths, though smaller than a mans, although a smile emerged. Some things are shared even with peoples across the stars.

""Greetings, humans! We come in peace."" An alien leading the group of six stepped ahead of his comrades and removed his helmet, revealing a dainty head on a slender, shiny neck with wires going up to a device in his ear from his chest.
""I am he who is named Decedent, named from my family on my naming day when I was twenty six. I am designated captain amongst our exploration mission.""
Most stood in amazement, including Randal Winter, the current chief of SETI""s relevant task force and he man chosen to represent humanity. Eyes turned to him after a few seconds, expectantly. Dr. Winters snapped back to reality and walked to within arms length of his interstellar consultant.
""My name is Dr. Randal Winter. I have been chosen by the leaders of Earth to be the voice of communication for our first meeting. Welcome to Earth."" Decedent held a finger to his earpiece for a few seconds, then looked to Winter in understanding.
""Greetings Winter. It is very excellent to speak with you. Have you prepared questions for us? We would ask things of you once we have answered your first ones."" Winter adjusted himself confidently, like he'd been practising in front of a mirror for the past twenty years.
""Where are you from?"" Decedent held a finger to his ear for a few moments then spoke.
""Our home world is a terrestrial planet we name Felwen, orbiting a star we name Wekwekn and your people name Vega, some twenty five lightyears away. I myself make my home in a Felorak city named Deusk.""

[WP] Humanity makes first contact with an advanced alien civilization. This is first contact for them as well.,LegendaryGoji,"The Captain licked his lips.

""Send it.""

The precious introduction, painstakingly crafted by mankind's collective genius, was finally on its way.  A hopeful message, seeking friendship and mutual respect, had been expressed in as many creative and unorthodox ways as the global scientific community could muster.

*""This is it""* the Captain mused to himself as he waited for an answer.  *""This is why we're here.""*  His breath came calmly, but his mind raced considering the possibilities, the response protocols, the command sequences.  *""If there's no reply, we're not communicating...""*

As the Captain looked about the bridge, it seemed to him that his crew shared the same unsettled face; furrowed brows, pursed lips, eyes intensely focused on the image on the viewer.

A nightmare of scalene triangles held their gaze, writing and twisting around what could only be described as a sphere giving birth to itself.

The first officer broke the silence.  ""It's moving, sir.  Intercept course, 10,000 km and closing.""

""Everybody remain calm.  You know what to do; trust your training.  Begin protocol Caesar 1.""

The crew moved as one toward their respective environmental suits.  It had never felt longer to the Captain to don the clumsy bulk of his suit, but he noted that the last crew member was back to her post a full 2 seconds faster than their best drill time.

""Report!"" barked the Captain.

""1,000km, sir.  Decelerating, but still on an intercept course""

""It may simply want to get a closer look at us.  We'll have the same opportunity.""

The vessel, if indeed it was one, continued to approach the human spacecraft as its bizarre blitz of triangles never slowed.  Its scale was something of a surprise; from the viewer, it had appeared much larger.  In truth, it was about 2/3 the size of their own spacecraft.

""I don't like this"" scowled the first officer.  

""It heard us, and now it's here.  We're making progress.""

The first officer's console emitted a shrill note.  ""Sir, it's less than 100km!""

The Captain exhaled slowly.  The ship's only ""weapon"", if it came to that, was a directed electromagnetic pulse.  It could only be fired once, and their spacecraft would require at least an hour - under the best of circumstances - to repair the more delicate systems afterward.

""Do nothing until I say.  Let them have their look.""

The first officer's eye twitched.  ""Sir, I recommend we retreat at the same rate as their approach.""

The Captain shot him a look that could have frozen the sun.  ""Do nothing.  That is an order!""

The first officer entered a flurry of commands into his console, his fingers dancing across the input pad at light speed.  The Captain drew his sidearm.

""You can't engage the EMP without my command authorization.  Get ahold of yourself!""

""I don't want to die!"" the first officer screamed.  Two crew members swiftly restrained him, but the Captain regarded the man's console with horror; the first officer had redirected all power from the scientific instruments to overload the EMP system.  The EMP would occur, with or without the Captain's command authorization.

In an instant, all of mankind's carefully laid plans came to a horrifying end.  The invisible pulse ripped through the alien structure, its terrible consequences laid bare on the viewer.  The central structure ended its perpetual cytokinesis and, to the shock of the crew, dispersed into countless blobs of unmoving matter.  The forest of triangles began to slowly tumble away from the center, free of whatever force had held and organized them.

""Sir?"" came the frightened voice of the youngest crew member.  Her mouth hung open as her hand moved her console's display to the viewer.

The blood drained from the Captain's face.  From behind the nearby moon came a swarm of the very same vessel. 

The first officer screamed.

[WP] Humanity makes first contact with an advanced alien civilization. This is first contact for them as well.,LegendaryGoji,"Timothy Gregory remembered that day well.  He had been playing with friends and his little sister when they all ran to the town green where spaceship slowly made its way to the ground.  As the gathered townfolk silently watched, pressure released as a door slid open.  Four men stood in the archway, eyeing them.  Not men, really.  They were brightly colored like birds and they wore strips of black cloth.

Moments passed before one of the men stepped out of the ship, his feline movements suddenly growing wild and uncontrolled.  With jerk like movements, it crawled its way back to the safety of its Ship.   

The town folk erupted in laughter, most would die remembering this day as the day the magical circus came.  

A few, like Timothy, remembered how the middle three digits on its hand were elongated to delicately feathered wings.  The other two fingers held blades.

The four men talked amongst each other in a strange clicking manner.  They retreated into their capsule.

The next morning Timothy found the capsule by the river.  He pretended the capsule was a house and had a yard.  He stayed out of their yard.  As he dug out worms and played throughout the week, they would watch him, then retreat.  Sometimes they would try to exit the capsule, but would always move so silly, like they were running in water almost.  As he studied gravity years later, he would be struck with the thought that their world had more gravity than ours.  He never asked.

""Hey, whatcha doing?"" The bright blue one called one day. 

""Me? Im just making a well."" He said, trying to hide his surprise. 

""There is no water there.""

""Thats why im digging a well.""

""You will never find Water there.  Do you need assistance?""
Timothy shrugged.  As he dug the four men climbed trees and glided off with their fingertips.  

""You have such primitive tools."" The orange one sneered.  It wasnt as reserved as the others. 

""Its what I have. I just want to dig a well.""

""You will never find water there.""

""I know.  Hey, why did you come here?""
The orange one suddenly jumped to flight and for the first time he saw, flew by flapping its wings.  Gold threading reflected light throughout the wings.  The other three men joined him. He had never seen it before, but in the sunlight they looked like a kaleidescope, translucent. 

The red one landed next to him.  ""You will never find water there.  Do you need water?"" 

His hole was waist deep when the guys in uniform asked him how his hole was going.  His mom told them he was really into digging holes. Could they see it?  His mother smiled nervously.

""Im digging a well.  Its not done yet.""

""Can we see it?""

""Maybe when its done.""

""Can you put this good luck box next to your hole? It  helps boys dig better wells.  The vikings did it.""  They didnt, but he took it anyway.  

""I know you said theres no water here, but you can't tell unless you dig!"" He called when the four men opened their door to watch him.  They tilted their heads like birds.   Their walks weren't so silly anymore but they didn't fly again.  

""Do you need water?""
He sighed.  ""I just want to find it so I can put some fish in it.  Can you guys stop bothering me for one day, please?""

They left him alone.  Three days later they were gone with his good luck box.  He never forgot the weird men, and that pushed him to enter the sciences, and from there join the space program.  He was the head of his field for years and on his 90th birthday was allowed access to a special specimen gathered that few had knowledge of.  

There in a secret labyrinth, guarded by heavy military sat three large jars, within pickled the bodies of the red, purple, and yellow men.  The orange one was missing.  

""Your gaining their trust and planting the camera that allowed us to confirm their continued presence in the area was the key to our success, and yours."" Their feathers were dulled to varying shades of gray.  ""We got them quickly and decided that should you go into the space program, we would grant all scholarships open to you to further your career.  You've done us proud.  And to think, it all started when you were a little boy  in a smaller town.""

[WP] Humanity makes first contact with an advanced alien civilization. This is first contact for them as well.,LegendaryGoji,"The first utterance of alien speech baffled the world. Our question of whether or not we are alone was finally answered, but only more questions sprang forth. The government had known long before the media had gotten hold of the story, now radical citizens were clambering over each other to get up there and find out just what these ‘aliens’ were truly like.

Our world has seen empires rise and fall, 100 year battles, and evolutionary changes to our biological systems. We think our world is a harsh place to live, crushed down by the weight of the mysterious vacuum above us. We can’t breathe up there, too much of this, and too little of that element.  Yet now they tell us there has been another civilisation this entire time, or perhaps longer, creatures that have bodies and brains and tissue adapted perfectly for life up there in the void. 

The first international talks are being arranged between us, though neither of our species can survive for very long in the others environments. We will have to wait and see what these aliens are like, our world collectively holding their breath, over whether they are friends or foes.

They told us they come from above, from the void, that strange blue and green terrain.

They call them; Humans.

[WP] You're a grizzly bear who's infiltrated the highest levels of human society without being detected. You receive a report that polar bears are doing the same. A secret war is about to begin.,LordFirebeard,"""Jenkins, you ever play football?"" Asked Terrence, the regional manager of sales for Ace Picnic Supplies.

Terrence was an important fellow. He was, after all, a regional manager in charge of the Iowa-North sales district of Ace Picnic Supplies.

Terrence was also horribly self absorbed. The man he referred to as ""Jenkins"" was actually an eight foot tall grizzly bear. In a pair of khakis and an oversized blazer. Admittedly, this bear was leading the office in sales closed over the last eight months. 

""You're a big guy, I bet you played linebacked huh?"" Terrence continued. He had just gotten back from a company sponsored leadership retreat. There, he had learned the 8 critical strategies to motivate employees. And one of those strategies was to ""engage in conversation"" with his sales team. 

Meanwhile, Maggie from HR was fearfully huddled in the corner of the break room. How her boss hadn't realized that they were employing a grizzly bear was beyond her. She had lodged several complaints but nothing got done. 

Actually, that's not true. Maggie had been reprimanded for cultural insensitivity by Terrence. 

Terrence wasn't fully sure what culture Jenkins belonged to. But he knew Jenkins could sell. In fact, every time he sent Jenkins on a sales visit the client would call almost immediately to close the sale. 

""PLEASE JUST TAKE MY MONEY YOU PSYCHO. I'LL BUY WHATEVER YOU WANT!"" they would exclaim over the phone. Jenkins just had a way of getting customers excited. 

The huge growth in sales had led to Terrence getting a huge bonus. Also, several employees had been found mauled in the parking lot. It was sad, with all the cougars around the area. 

So Terrence decided to hire a security guard. In fact, he was about to have his first interview right after lunch. Terrence excused himself from the breakroom. Maggie crawled behind the water cooler in terror.

...

""So tell me Jack, why should we hire you?"" Terrence asked the applicant. 

The applicant was a large polar bear wearing a bloodstained security jacket. The name tag said ""Jack"". He simply growled at Terrence. 
""Aggressive! That's exactly what we need in a security guard. You're hired... Maggie can you get the paperwork ready?"" Terrence said enthusiastically. 
Maggie's fingers trembled as she passed several papers to the polar bear. 

""At least he's not a darkie."" She thought to herself, as Jack chewed up the paperwork while Terrence played with his smartphone.",HipHopTron

[WP] You're a grizzly bear who's infiltrated the highest levels of human society without being detected. You receive a report that polar bears are doing the same. A secret war is about to begin.,LordFirebeard,"It was a shivering, rainy night at the Grizzly Bear Headquarters. Stationed in northern Montana, the compound had just received devastating intel that the Polar Bears had been monitoring them for years. After intercepting a shocking Polar Bear radio message, the Grizzly Bears were informed of an upcoming Polar Bear plan to eradicate human life, and regain control of the planet.

""General! We're compromised! The entire compound is surrounded.."" exclaimed first lieutenant Donovan. ""Burn the documents, destroy everything"" responded General Sam.

The Grizzly Bear Headquarters was in turmoil as an elite squadron of Polar Bears was ready to infiltrate the station. The General and his Lieutenant address the situation within the office of the General.

""General, everyone has fled to the underground tunnels. We have to go, now."" roared the lieutenant.

""Go. They came here for me. Take this and leave.""

Sam put a small USB device into Donovan's paw.

""Initiate code beaver.""

Sam looked into Donovan's eyes sharply. After a short pause of what felt like hours, Sam looked over at a photo on his desk, and in the weakest voice Donovan had ever heard, Sam looks back at him, tears on his eyes and speaks..

""Please keep my wife and daughter safe.""

Donovan hurried to the tunnels to catch up with the rest of the pack. As he ran, the sound of gunfire from the complex echoed through the tunnels. He could only hope to see Sam, his general, and his father again.

[WP] You're a grizzly bear who's infiltrated the highest levels of human society without being detected. You receive a report that polar bears are doing the same. A secret war is about to begin.,LordFirebeard,"The mornings are always the worst. 

And not in a ""I Hate Mondays"" kind of bad, we're talking blood, sweat and tears coupled with the ever present threat of anxiety that comes with being in my position. 

The mattress was the first thing I had to get used to. From the sheer weight of my body to my claws getting stuck within the fabrics, I must've scared my landlady on more than one occasion. But she is always more turned off by the smell of fish, and thus, she's never around as long as my haul of salmon from the local fishery is kept freshly stocked.

The second problem I encountered was how fragile the humans were. When Orlask the Great tasked me with this mission, I was scared that I would not merit the luck of seeing another day alive. 

As it turns out, this is again but a bout of anxiety. Cars are easy to stop with my massive frame, scooters especially and what with people helping me try and navigate the concrete jungles they deem ""cities"", (as they believe I have some sort of rare birth defect attributed to chromosomes), their ignorance is played to my benefit.

Never have I seen an animal so intelligent yet so vapidly stupid. Metal machines racing by bodies by mere inches are sided by completely unaware people glued to their hands and crotches with some sort of device. This device must possess a nutrition of some sort as the people using them value them higher than life itself.

And as for the language barrier... ah fuck it work's boring I'm just trying my hand out at this shit.

"[RF] All your life, people praised you for your looks. No one has brought it up since the accident.",Luna_LoveWell,"I don't recommend getting T-boned by a dump truck.  It's not for everybody.  

The doctors told me that it would be hard, adjusting to my face after the accident.  A new nose, a reconfigured cheekbone, a small metal plate above my right eye where my temporal bone used to be.  They told me that it would be a bit of a shock, seeing myself.  

And it was, at first.  I would sit in the foyer of my parents' house, staring into a floor-to-ceiling mirror propped against the wall, watching a confused-looking young woman turn her head this way and that.  They told me to practice smiling and other expressions, to stretch the healing skin and to help my muscles relearn their new positions.  I would open my mouth wide, feeling the pins and screws in my cracked jaw bone.  I would do this for hours, making progressively weirder faces.  In the mirror, the young woman would do the same.   

I learned a lot about friendship, which I hadn't expected.  Boys, for instance, are a lot less talkative and friendly than I previously thought.  Luke had come to visit me a few times in the hospital, his backpack slung over his shoulder and his sunglasses tucked into his shirt pocket.  Conversation had been difficult.  I mumbled semi-coherently through my bandaged face.  He didn't say much, his eyes wandering around the room, looking at the flower vases and the get-well-soon cards.  He had left me a present, on his first visit: a cute little teddy bear.  It reminded me of our first date, when we went to one of those Build-a-Bear businesses where you custom-design a stuffed bear.  It was a sweet gesture, although he stopped coming after a few visits.  My other guy friends didn't even visit once.  

My girl friends had changed, too.  When I returned to school, I couldn't play on the softball team anymore because of my wheelchair.  I watched from the sidelines as my friends went on to win the semifinals of the season tournament.  We would get together after the games, like before, but the conversation wasn't the same.  I wasn't supposed to wear make-up until my face had healed properly, and my clothing needs were different because of my wheels.  Boys, always a perennial topic of conversation, were the last thing on my mind.  My girls tried to make up the difference but there was a new distance in place.   

People stopped looking directly at me and eye contact became rarer.  At first, I thought it was the height difference because of the wheelchair.  Then I realized that I was still sporting my hospital haircut—short, spikey, and bald where my surgery scars twisted across my scalp—and this, combined with my new face, unnerved people.  I thought about wearing a wig.  

It was almost a year after the accident when things began to shift.  I had quit the softball team (who wants to be the ""team manager"" anyway?) and instead joined the student writing group and the robotics club.  I was a shit writer, and an even worse robot engineer, but the other kids welcomed me without a second look.  Well, maybe a few second looks—the robotics club wanted to turn my wheelchair into an upright, mechanized battle chassis but our faculty advisor vetoed that.  Maybe next year.  

I learned a lot about myself as I built little robots and wrote silly stories about time-traveling assassins and people with numbers floating over their heads.  I learned that some boys are quite talkative and friendly if you want to talk about battlebots or horror stories or whatever.  I also learned that I don't really care about haircuts, or designer clothes, or dating gossip (although I don't begrudge any girl who does care about those things).  

I also learned that there is a certain freedom that can come from disaster.  Life can be shaken up, torn apart, shattered into so many pieces.  This can hurt—a lot—but it can also wake you up.

"[RF] All your life, people praised you for your looks. No one has brought it up since the accident.",Luna_LoveWell,"My mirror spans the wall of my room.

I used to cherish every part of my morning routine: carefully coordinating my outfit. Putting on my make-up. Turn my face to catch the light, correct the small mistakes. And start the day, knowing I was beautiful. 

""Mia? Would you like to try again, today?""

The home nurse's voice was careful, soothing. As if she spoke to a child. I turned from the mirror I couldn't see anymore, and stifled the impulse to scream at her, knowing she was doing her best. Not her fault I had to walk around with a cane now. Not her fault I was on a waiting list to receive a guide dog. Not her fault. But it would feel so good to blame anyone besides myself for what had happened.

""Tell me the truth,"" I whispered. They had been avoiding telling me, all of them. 

""Tell me, and I'll try again. I'm hideous now, aren't I? Don't lie to me, I can't take it.""

I have been afraid to find out for myself. Terrified. I'd avoided touching my face since the accident. They would have to tell me. I had to hear it from someone else first, just to prepare myself. After all, I used to be a model. It wasn't fair of them not to tell me. 

I heard the nurse - was her name Katy or Kathy? - inhale sharply. A pregnant pause, and then she spoke.

""Oh no, really. You were very lucky. Only small scratches on your face,"" she said. ""You're so beautiful, miss.""

Then why hadn't anyone said so since I'd woken up?

""Get out. Out!"" I screamed at her, taking a swipe at her with my cane. 

I brooded until Ben came home. It was time to face this. Time to force him to tell me. He began asking me questions about the nurse - she had called him as soon as I kicked her out. 

""Shut up,"" I said, fumbling until I found him. I shoved him, certain he couldn't possibly see how angry I was. ""Just shut the hell up and stop it, okay? Why won't anyone tell the truth? It's driving me mad. I'm ugly now, aren't I? I'm hideous. That bitch nurse *lied* to me about it. We'll have to hire a different one.""

He was silent, and then spoke, his voice low and even.

""Yes, you're ugly. I don't know why I'm only seeing it now.""

I could hear him leaving. He slammed the door behind him. Almost absent-mindedly, I touched my face. I traced the smooth planes of my cheeks. My fingers faltered on my useless eyes. 

I felt my way to the kitchen, to the knives. I traced the edge of the blade lightly, and pressed it against my cheek, my heart beating in my throat. I wondered what it would feel like to drag it down my face. Twisting it in to carve a few real scars into the face I couldn't see anymore, anyway. That way, I knew for *sure* people would be looking at me. How else would I know?

I tossed it back, appalled at myself. God. I was going nuts.

I lifted my fingers to touch the wet trickle of blood on my cheek. The relief of the sting was almost dizzying. Ben better come home soon. I needed someone to watch me - I could hardly watch out for myself. I giggled slightly at the thought. At least my sense of humour was still intact. ",inkfinger
"[RF] All your life, people praised you for your looks. No one has brought it up since the accident.",Luna_LoveWell,"""One more drink!"", I said to my friend. She hesitated but agreed with me. Paula was my best friend since we were in elementary. She was always at the top of the class and so was I but in different things. Paula was at the top of the class because of her grades and I was because of my beauty. A lot of people think I was her friend because I needed her to write my homework or help me on test and they were right about it. When I look back I realize that was mean but that's in the past. So it's time to go back to me and the moment we got out of the bar. Paula took my car keys and wanted to drive but I ran past her and took the keys. ""You shouldn't drive!"", she said. ""Relax. I know how to drive."", I said putting on my seat belt. Paula sat in the car.  ""Be careful!"", she said. I just looked at her and smiled. We were already out of the town and driving on a long road. There was nobody on the road so I sped up. ""Melissa, please slow down!"", Paula said panicking.  ""Come on,  Paula.  Live a little!"", I said looking at her. In that few seconds I looked at her I didn't notice  how I had driven out of road and into a tree. Paula was fine and just had a few bruises and cuts.  Me, on the other hand, had lots of bruises and deep cuts on my face and a concussion. Doctors say I will be fine. Family says I look good. But in reality I don't. I have scars and make up doesn't hide them. Plastic surgery could help but I will always remember how I looked and that's something no one can fix. For now I am staying indoors    because I do not want people seeing me or staring at me with pity. My only hope is plastic surgery helps so I can finally go outside and feel like I belong and not stand out.  Only good thing about this accident is that now I know what I would like to do in life.  Write.  And with this story I will begin. ",PossibleHumanBeing
"[RF] All your life, people praised you for your looks. No one has brought it up since the accident.",Luna_LoveWell,"The lake laid tired on the valley midst the overgrowth. Greyness hung over the sky and claps of thunder drummed. The path to the cabin had become a bed for which blankets of vines and moss covered messily. 

“I really missed this place,” John said, walking along the path. “I wish we never let it get the way that it did.”

Nick said nothing. 

The door to the lake house did not open without a struggle. When it finally did give way and the seized hinges shed a layer of rust the door groaned loudly. Inside revealed an eerie silence and carried with it a gloom that overtook both of them. The walls hung spotted with musty rot and rats had made nests in the corners of the room. Golden trophies topped with Adonis and Sandow were on their sides on the mantle, caked in dust and raccoon shit. 

“Oh, man.” John said, loudly so that his discontent would not go unnoticed. “I’m sorry Nicolas. I didn’t know it gotten so bad. It’s been, what, two years? I guess I should have known.” 

Nick shrugged and looked down. 

They entered the main living space of the lake house. John had his hands on his hips and continued to object loudly to the living space, ensuring that Nick that he would begin fixing everything as soon as possible. Nick knew, though, that John was only embarrassed. Embarrassed that he would bring his brother to a place of once great joy, where celebrations over past victories would yield drink and merriment, only to realize the place had now become a place of slow death. 

“I’ll go to town,” John said. “and I’ll get a few rat traps and maybe all new bed sheets. We might have to sleep in sleeping bags tonight. Is that okay?”

Nick nodded.

“Oh, and.” John flipped the lights and smiled. They all turned on and though it served to show the sad state of the room more vividly, it gave the two men hope. Hope of running water, of a warm bed, and possibly of a weekend of relaxed reminiscing. 

“Hey that’s good!” John said, delighted with himself. 

John, filled anew with enthusiasm, walked around Nick and grabbed the Sandow trophy, slicked his thumb with his tongue, wiped the brass nameplate at the base, and set it back down. He wiped at a picture frame beside the trophy with a broad stroke of his hand and pointed at it. Behind the dirt was a picture of two men shaking each other’s hands, smiling for the camera.

“Hey, is that you with Arnold?” John said.

Nick said nothing. It was a picture that he knew John had seen a million times. A year before the incident John had even told him he was tired of hearing the story because he heard it every time he came to the lake house. 

Silence engulfed room again and John began to fidget and play with the truck keys in his coat pocket. 

 “Okay, well, I’m going to go,” John said. “do you need anything. Maybe a smoothie?”

Nick nodded. He was hungry. He lifted up his bottle of water with the long straw hanging out of it and tapped it with a finger.

“Oh water?” John said. “Use the faucet.”

Simultaneously both men turned and looked at the rusted bucket that was the sink.

“Sorry, I’ll get us both a few bottles.” John chuckled.

As John began to go out the door, Nick called out him with a muffled call. 

“Yeah buddy?” John said, sticking his head out around the corner. 

Nick pointed at the pointed at the colostomy bag that sat underneath his shirt. 

“Oh, did we leave those in the truck?”

Nick said nothing.

“Sorry, I’ll get that before I head out. Be back in a minute.”

Nick watched through a hazy window as his brother walked briskly back on the dilapidated trail and disappear through the overgrowth. When he was alone Nick lifted the straw and inserted the hole where his mouth once was and sipped lightly. Most of water found its way into him, but after these two years he still couldn’t help but get a few drops on his shirt. He sighed lightly but said nothing.

I used to see her every day. We'd greet each other excitedly. We’d ask each other how we were doing and how much we missed each other; she’d tell me how handsome I was and I’d tell her how beautiful she was. We’d run and jump around like crazies and play tag. Smile. Laugh. Giggle. On special days, we’d do silly things like roll in the grass, follow animal tracks in the forest, watch clouds in the skies go by, and chase around the birds and squirrels. She would tell me about her day, and I would listen. On sad days, she would tell me what made her upset, and I would listen. She had a special way of talking with me, one that I never heard her use with another, and it was our secret. We were best friends.


She'd have to leave and be with other people, which was ok because I would sometimes have to do the same. We’d be separated for a few hours, but no matter what, we’d always meet again. Before we left, we’d always give each other a hug. She’d tell me to have a good day, to be good, and that she loved me--her “Echo.” I’d listen and repeat it back to her with all my heart.


But now it’s different. Besides not seeing Sally, the other people that I used to hang out with aren’t as friendly with me as before. They used to tell me how handsome and good I was; but lately, they just say “hello” and walk away. They look sadder. I’ve seen them cry together, hugging each other, and I’ve seen them cry alone, hugging themselves. Every time I see them upset, I walk over and ask them about what’s wrong. They never answer. Something must have happened to her. I’ve tried listening in on whenever they talk about Sally, but I’ve only picked up a few words: “accident,” “condolences,” “sorry.” Nothing that made any sense to me.


I miss Sally. I still go out and play, but I think of her often. When I roll in the grass, I remember how she used to get grass stains on her dress and upset her mother. When I chase the birds around, I remember her triumphant smile when they scattered. And when I investigate paw prints, I remember how wonderful she used to smell, of roses and the rain. 


She gave the best hugs. But I miss her voice the most: her compliments, her complaints, her laugh, and now, even her cries. 


So I keep listening for my Sally to come back to me. I don’t want to wait any longer to hear about her day, to play with her, and then, to tell her to have a good day, to be good, and that I love her, with all my heart.",656782
"[RF] All your life, people praised you for your looks. No one has brought it up since the accident.",Luna_LoveWell,"It took me exactly an hour, every day, to do it all.

Of course, before I understood what was happening, or how to do anything for myself, my mother did it for me. I remember being waken up much earlier than I would have liked, whisked away to my mother's bathroom, where I was quickly handed water to drink so that my skin would stay ""fresh"" and ""youthful"" (though at five, I couldn't understand the irony of being told to look ""youthful"").

It would take my mother what seemed like forever to tame the mane that was my hair (I'd long ago nicknamed my hair ""Mufasa""-as it was so wild that it required a near stampede of constant hair products to get under control). After a hundred run-throughs with her comb, she would spray me down with her patented hair-spray creation, an experience that thoroughly made me sympathize with those under attack of mustard gas. Finally, after fixing the wreck that was my hair, my darling mother would start on my face, her makeup kit full to bursting beside her. Powders and lip colors and shadows swam before my still-drowsy eyes every day, and I was always too tired to fight back or protest the process (something I'm sure my mother had planned from the very beginning). A billion makeup and hair styles later came the only part of this ordeal that I ever enjoyed-the clothes picking process. Investing in a walk-in closet for me at the tender age of four, my mother would allow me to choose one color for the day, and orchestrated the perfect outfit for the day. Regardless of what my mother picked, I loved it, and by the time the bus came to my house to pick me up, I would always look picture-perfect, every single day.

 In short, I was my mother's masterpiece.

I carried these self-care habits into my later years. The effects were more noticeable than I could have ever dreamed. When the usual hormonal impulses that controlled most of the decisions made by impulsive teenagers arrived, I was the one girl that every boy wanted. Rumors spread that my father (never seen again since he left my mother before my birth) was a famous actor, or model long since retired. I once heard that half the school thought I was a long-lost cousin of Emma Watson, or the forgotten granddaughter of some European monarch. Of course, these myths were far from the truth-I was simply good-looking, and I made it a point to never have a bad day.

No, no bad hair days ever occurred-a secret supply of brushes and detangling sprays in my locker prevented that. A stash of stylish outfits hidden among my car, school, and job (I worked at the local library, where a few accessories made their way behind older, less checked out books) guaranteed my elegance in any occasion. 

I spent every morning with the exact same routine that my mother drilled into me for my childhood years, and this was the cause of all of my success. Doors opened for me after college due to my charm, guys fawned over me to win my heart, and eventually my coworkers recommended me for upcoming promotions, and wished me the best as I rose into the ranks. Without my routine, I never would have made it as far as I did-and just as I reached my peak, I fell, like a Lucifer betrayed by the very process that made him an angel.

It was a morning like any other. Waking up at five on the dot, I got out of bed and stumbled into my adjacent bathroom. Smiling blearily at the bottles and brushes that I had long called friends, I brushed and squeezed and rubbed and dried and followed my normal routine to a T. Finishing with a final swab of lip gloss, I grinned into the mirror, ready to make this day even better than tomorrow. 

Stepping outside I found myself in what may possibly have been the sunniest, brightest day that I'd ever seen. Nothing could possibly have ruined this day-save for the drunk idiot that decided to drive by the pharmacy for another six-pack.

That drunk idiot just so happened to pass by my house, and in the process, got distracted by my beaming face and plowed into my home.

My hair had never been so mussed.

~~~

Weeks later, my friends and family still insisted on visiting, bringing unholy amounts of food and goodwill with them. For months, the only compliments I received were fake, shallow things like ""You'll get better, it'll all work out"" and ""You're strong, you can make it through this."" Not a single person ever even tried to comment on my face-I spent a good part of each morning in the hospital washing my face, spraying nice perfumes on my gown, trying my best to look good at my worst. All was for naught, though, I didn't hear a single word on my stunning complexion, or my tousled hair, or my gorgeous eyes-the worst thing about the accident was not the fact that I lost my right hand, or the fact that I might end up paralyzed from the waist down (the drunk idiot had crashed right into the front door where I was so happily standing). 

No, the worst thing about the accident was the shift in focus from my perfect appearance to my pitiful future- a change that I absolutely could not overcome.

I had to try though, I couldn't just watch my perfect life slip by the wayside.

I pressed the nurse intercom button on the side of my bed. ""Nurse?"" I asked, suddenly keenly aware of my surroundings.

""Yes, dear?"" A soft voice came on from the other side. 

""I'm going to need you- or someone else, quickly- to run to the store to grab me a few things-""

""Ma'am, we do not perform errands for our patients out of the hosp-""

""I can make you the most beautiful woman in the nurse's room, and the richest"" (my job had given me a paid leave of absence, due to the absolutely *stunning* loss that they must be feeling without me there to brighten their day). ""If you can get me want I need in the next hour, that is.""

The line went silent for a few seconds, until I heard a faint ""of course, miss"" and the click that signified that the call was over.

I leaned back, happy with myself. Soon, I would make that nurse the second prettiest girl in the entire hospital-and I wouldn't look half bad either.

"[RF] All your life, people praised you for your looks. No one has brought it up since the accident.",Luna_LoveWell,"Men started noticing me when I was 12 years old. I distinctly remember walking home from a friend's house on a cloudy, blustery day, my pleated skirt flailing in the wind and coming dangerously close to revealing more than I had intended, when a man drove by in a truck. He stuck his tanned face out the window and whistled. I was appalled-I was a child and didn't know how to feel about the encounter. Still, I recognized one of my conflicting emotions as *pleasure.*

Over the course of my teenage years, compliments rained down on me from men who were friends of my family (*What a beautiful daughter you have!*), various girlfriends (*Ugh, I'd kill for your looks-you could be a model. Bitch.*), and even strangers (*You don't have a boyfriend? You've got to be lying.*).

Despite all of the positive attention inflating my ego, I failed to have my first boyfriend until I was seventeen. His name was Eric, and he was my first and last love. 

Eric was smart, funny, and charismatic. You know that stupid cliche, ""When he/she walks into a room, all eyes are on them""? That was the real deal with him. There was something so alive and genuine about him; he was a human magnet, always attracting people to him. 

He was perfect, except for one detail-he had a problem with drugs. When we first became romantically involved, I knew he smoked a lot of pot, but that wasn't a big deal to me. When I found the baggy full of pills stuffed into the side pocket of his backpack, my heart sunk. He was doing more than weed.

I confronted him, and that was the source of our very first fight. He swore he'd stop, but, you know about junkies-they lie. A lot. Faster than I could make sense of, he graduated to using heroin. Because I couldn't stop loving him, I was swept into a hurricane of destruction that still moves, even to this day.

I followed him to his friend's house one night. I knew he was buying drugs, and I wanted to catch him. An hour later, I concluded that he wasn't going to come back out any time soon, so I waltzed up to the front door and banged on it. His friend answered a few minutes later, stoned out of his skull and appearing as if he saw a ghost.

*God damn it, Jane-I thought you were the police!*

I shoved past him and there was Eric, seated at the kitchen table, high as a kite. I yelled and he yelled, and it snowballed into a screaming match. I wish I could remember exactly what I said to him in those moments of fury, but I can only recall stomping out, slamming the front door behind me.

Eric followed and instructed me to get into his car, so he could drive me home. I wasn't going to-I really wasn't. My car was parked there in the street, and he was high. But he convinced me with one sentence.

*It's just a couple minutes away.*

In his car, I sulked, marinating in my anger. I didn't notice that he'd nodded off at the wheel until his car crossed the median, and we collided head on with a truck. Blackness.

When I awoke in the hospital, I was told that Eric had died instantly in the car accident. My heart splintered into a million tiny pieces. 

That wasn't all of it, though. The car had ignited while the rescue crew was in the process of saving me. My face and body had sustained third degree burns. No one had wanted to tell me of the nightmare that was wrapped securely underneath the bandages, but I coerced my little sister into explaining just how bad it was.

When I'd finally healed up, I saw for myself. I gripped the hand mirror in a shaking hand, drew a breath, and lifted it up to my face. I gasped and, instantaneously, tears stung my eyes and spilled down my ravaged cheeks.

My face was scarred so extensively that I could no longer recognize myself. No wonder my mom averted her eyes when speaking with me. No wonder my dad avoided me by retreating into the next room upon my entrance. No wonder I heard my sister weeping one night, after having a conversation that lasted only ten minutes with me.

I'm not a pretty little thing anymore. I no longer sparkle and shine, soaking up attention from every male at the party. Instead, I'm that dark and ugly thing that everybody pretends doesn't exist. I'm that deformed spot on your arm that you think may be malignant, yet you ignore. I'm that recurring nightmare that gives you the sweats and leaves you nauseated and disoriented in your waking moments. I'm that truth you've known all your life, but refuse to acknowledge, lest it destroy you.

I'm hideous. 

What's more, though, is that I've become a monster in more ways than one. My insides have begun to match my outsides. I wish harm to others. I go out of my way to cause discomfort to strangers and...and even my loved ones. Once, I sat inches away from my father as he watched the game and enjoyed seeing the resulting squirming that he couldn't help but do. I go up to my mother at random times and hug and kiss her. I can see her screams of disgust, even if I can't hear them. 

I've even taken to torturing my sister. Sometimes I go to her and ask her to do my make-up and hair, just to get the pleasure of hearing her sob behind her closed bedroom door afterward.

"[RF] All your life, people praised you for your looks. No one has brought it up since the accident.",Luna_LoveWell,"When you woke up, nobody would meet your eyes anymore.  Initially you figured it was just you, because you were drugged and tired.  You worried aloud whether you were going to be able to walk again, and you noticed that everyone seemed relieved to be able to talk about it.  Your legs were in good shape.  Your back was in good shape.  You shouldn’t worry about that, dearest.  Just take it easy getting out of bed, and make sure you call the nurse to go to the bathroom.  

In bed alone, at night, after everyone had gone home, you catalogued the bandages.  Left hand, left arm, left shoulder, left side of neck, left side of head.  You weren’t hugely surprised; you remembered an explosion.  You distinctly remembered the overwhelming smell of gasoline coming from the third car in the tangle, the one that had spun around, rode up over the end of the guard rail, and then slammed into your car door.  Your best friend was pulling on your right hand but hadn’t unbuckled the seat belt and you were fumbling at it with your left hand, trying to make sense of the spinning world, the pain in your legs, the sound of horns, and the overwhelming need to get out.  Then there was an explosion, and then there was nothing.

They told you about the burns. Once per day, they gave you fentanyl and you’d fall into a pleasant reverie for about fifteen minutes until they came to take down the bandages.  You could see the blistered, angry skin on your left hand and forearm; the pain when removing those bandages was bad, but nothing like when they took away the gauze on your face and your neck.  Your wife sat next to your bed, holding your right hand, weeping while you clenched your teeth and told the nurses it was okay.  A very serious looking doctor came in and talked about skin grafts, debridement under sedation, and healing times.  He talked about risk of infection, and about scars.  Then he jotted something on a clipboard and left.

For two days they had you using a bedside commode; they were still nervous about your balance, and this way someone could help you.  The nurses clucked when you protested.  You were embarrassed, but touched that everyone was working so hard to take care of you.  You didn’t want to make life more difficult for anyone.   On the third day you finally got to the bathroom on your own.  After that, you didn’t try anymore; there was no mirror in front of the commode.

You went home when the serious looking doctor said that the risk of infection was past and that the grafts were taking well.  You went to all the follow-up appointments, listened to the second opinion, the third opinion.  They told you plastic surgery would cover the worst of it.  You listened to your wife telling you she’d always love you, and to your parents thanking God that you were alive, and to your friends reassuring you that they’d have you over for a few beers as soon as you were up and about again.  

But still, nobody would meet your eyes.

"[RF] All your life, people praised you for your looks. No one has brought it up since the accident.",Luna_LoveWell,"Her awkward, lumpy fingers traced the jagged, purple scars that dotted her forehead. Each one felt larger than life, and her wretched nightmares of them somehow spreading still horrified her, even after all of the months that had passed by. There was no amount of makeup that could cover them, no matter how much time flew by.

She sighed heavily and reached for her makeup bag, defeated. If she couldn't hide them completely, then she would just have to do what she could and hope that she didn't have any unexpected visitors.

The cold feeling of the slimy, wet cream on her face made shivers run down her spine and the hair on her arms stand up, something that had never happened before everything had happened.

Her hands shaking, she outlined her eyebrows carefully with a brown pencil, knowing that the line would be slightly off-kilter, but still regarding herself critically in the small mirror hanging above her bedside table. Officially the mirror wasn't supposed to be allowed, since it could also be used as a weapon, but the staff were understanding of her situation and had allowed her to keep it there.

The organized line of lipsticks, ranging from a sweet pink to a deep crimson, left a bitter taste in her mouth when she looked at them. The nurse aide had come in and helpfully arranged them for her by the serial number at the bottom, which was only a reminder to her of how things had been before.

She had followed the collection religiously when it had first been released, ordering each one as soon as it was announced on the cosmetic website. She remembered the evening of that day so well, almost as if it were yesterday.

It might as well have been. To her, Monday was Tuesday, and there was no difference between Wednesday and Thursday. For all she knew or cared, Friday and Saturday was identical, and for the life of her, she couldn't identify a Sunday.

Before things had been different. Before, she had had a set order to her life. Monday was working out with Bri at the gym. Tuesday was date night. Wednesday was shopping. Thursday was cleaning. Friday was all about reading and sketching. Saturday was her Random Day. And Sunday was relaxation.

Things weren't always perfect. It was true that sometimes she'd put off cleaning until Friday, and then that meant that she only got to read for a few hours. Occasionally things came up on workout days, and she'd have to make up the hours later on, maybe on Random Day.

It had been chaos, but it had been an organized chaos, because even though nobody else understood her lifestyle, she did, and that was what mattered.

Except for in that moment on a late night Wednesday, that moment where she wasn't in control anymore. That moment when she'd had to put her life in the hands of fate, and fate had dropped it and shattered it into a million pieces without any qualms or warnings.

She had been going out to buy the new lipstick from her nearest department store. She knew that it had been shipped the morning before, and was waiting behind the glass counters for her, surrounded by old styles.

It wasn't supposed to happen. That was what everybody told her. She was unlucky - none of it had been her fault. Constantly she was reminded of that - by her parents, by the store owners, by the CEO of the lip gloss company, by her classmates and her teachers, even.

Who would have known that the red-headed man dressed to the nines in a suit and loafers would have been mentally unstable, and who would have known that he'd have done what he did?

She shut her eyes, and the tears began to trickle out, etching lines in her carefully-done contouring and highlighting. If she wiped them off, then she'd also smear the makeup even further, and that would set her back perhaps an hour.

Jerkily, she grabbed the facial towel from the bedside drawers and started to scrape off the creams and powders messily.

When she looked in the mirror, it wasn't her who looked back. Eyeliner was smeared underneath her eyes, and the uneven foundation tracks that the towel had left in the wake of its destruction didn't make her look any better than she had started.

In fact, in her opinion, she looked worse, despite all of her primping.

Shutting her eyes again, she started to cry, but this time she didn't stifle the tears anymore.

She would never let herself be beautiful again.

Alone she sat, with nobody there to see her except for herself, which, to her, was worse than anything else.",cons_pick_u_us
"[RF] All your life, people praised you for your looks. No one has brought it up since the accident.",Luna_LoveWell,"I don't go out much anymore. I mean, there's not much point, is there? Everything's changed. I used to walk down the street and get smiles, I just had that kind of face, you know? I'd go shopping and guys would ask me on dates, it was kinda annoying, at the time. But I haven't been to the supermarket in at least a month now. Last time I went it was a disaster.

I suppose I sound vain. Maybe I am. I just know, that night something was taken from me that I'd just never thought twice about. I was the best looking person in my city, maybe even in my state. God, I do sound vain, don't I? But it's true. I did modelling. I was in commercials. The whole deal. Now, just... nothing. No one even calls. I just lay in bed all day, or sit in the dark, thinking.

It's like a different world now. I wish I could go back in time, back before the accident. Maybe I'd appreciate my gift more. My luck. Now I'm the only person who still seems to notice my beauty. In the mirror or in the reflection of the window. I spend a lot of time looking out the  window. The world just seems so unfriendly now. Before everyone wanted to know me. Now they just don't see me at all.

There's an old man outside. He's wandering, bumping into my front fence. Stupid old idiot. Why do people even go out since the accident? It's a death sentence if you ask me. He's staring towards the sky, head swinging around. What a fool.

Maybe this is all punishment for my vanity. The whole world went blind that night, far as I can tell. All but me. At least I can still appreciate my looks.

"[RF] All your life, people praised you for your looks. No one has brought it up since the accident.",Luna_LoveWell,"I was often told that *someday* my looks would fade and I would have nothing but a bed of shallowness left to fall into. And that I should *do something with my life*, outside of modelling. I didn't take them seriously and suspected they were plain jealous of me. Who wouldn't have been?

It was an acid attack in the streets that changed me. That *deformed* me. He wore a balaclava so I don't know who the man was. Perhaps a jilted ex boyfriend. Perhaps a rival of mine hired someone to do this to me. I don't think I will ever know.

I was rushed to hospital and had major skin graft operations. I know they did their best but I still wanted to kill myself when I came home three weeks later. My life was over. My old 'friends' from the modelling world were quick with their *sorry's* but just as quick to forget about me completely.

My face looked like melted cheese and my perfect features were lopsided. I didn't want to leave the house, but when I eventually did, when my mom encouraged me to come shopping with her, no one could look me in the eye. 

When I got home from the shops I broke every mirror in the house and I smashed my phone with a brick. I swore I would never leave the house again.

I tied a rope to an attic rafter and made a noose. My neck was meant to snap and that would be that. *Goodbye cruel word!* - I know, it's a bit cliché. Anyway, that's not what happened. I tucked my neck into the small circle of rope and... I wept. I cried for my face, I cried for what I had lost and most of all I wept for my cowardice.

The support group helped me. People from different walks of life who had problems as bad as, and worse than my own. If they could do it - if the guy stuck in a wheel chair unable to move a single muscle could do it - then I could do it too. I wasn't going to give up.

I had many further skin graphs. I barely had enough skin on my tiny butt to take, so they cut skin off my thighs too. For five years I went back to hospital regularly to treat infections and to remove skin that didn't take. For five years I wore an oxygen mask for 19 hours of the day, to help the skin heal.

Eventually it did, at least it did a little. I still look weird and I still get stares, but it improved. I can look in a mirror again now, and even though I don't love what I see, I'm starting to like what's beneath.

I trained to become a mental health nurse.

"[RF] All your life, people praised you for your looks. No one has brought it up since the accident.",Luna_LoveWell,"It had been a while since the accident and it felt as though the colour of my face was just returning to normal and the burning sensation in my face had finally dissipated. I looked in the bathroom mirror, readjusted my hair and prepared myself to once again face the outside world. I figure most will have forgotten the incident by now. Or at least I hoped they had forgotten. 

As I turned the handle of the bathroom door and left I realised it had been quite some time since I'd received a compliment or had someone flirt with me. This was rather unusual for me (I'm not too bad looking) but I figured it was only a matter of time before things picked up. I'll hopefully sort that out now.

I rejoined my friends at the bar where they had been joined by a group of rather attractive women. During the introductions I was still aware of the slightly damp patch of my jeans, unfortunately in the crotch region. Most of the humiliation had passed and I was able to converse with ease. Thankfully the girls had arrived whilst I had been in the toilet so had missed the earlier incident and my jeans had dried enough to appear dry at least visually.

As the night progressed I was drawn to one girl in particular and the attraction seemed to be mutual as compliments were exchanged and subtle hints were given. I'll leave out the details but a particular comment of hers I quite liked; 'you know you kind of look like that Jack Gylenhaal guy'. I mean he's a pretty good looking guy, I'll certainly take that as a compliment.

Well things escalated and we ended up leaving together. I had all but forgotten the earlier accident as we got up and started walking to the exit. On the short walk back to my apartment I became aware of a slight click, or clink maybe a better description, with every other step I took. I lifted my right foot and sure enough there was a small piece of glass embedded within the tread of the shoe. I flicked it out remembering the pint of beer I had managed to knock to the ground earlier in the night and the thorough soaking of my crotch as a result. How my friends had laughed!

"[RF] All your life, people praised you for your looks. No one has brought it up since the accident.",Luna_LoveWell,"In the beginning, everyone loved me. 

Of course they did. I was perfect. I was beautiful. I deserved to be admired. 

When I was a kid, my surroundings made it clear to me that I was a cut higher than the rest of the crop. My classmates all adored me; during parent-teacher conferences, my parents would hear every year from the teachers that I should be a model. When I walked down the street, someone would always be looking at me in delighted awe. I got used to it. 

So, knowing that the Internet, too, would love me, I started a blog. At first, there were few viewers; my parents, teachers, and classmates would look at my posts (which mainly consisted of pictures of me and occasionally heralded some useless beauty tips as the cause of my beauty), and they yielded little other attention. After about a year, however, one of my photos was posted on another website, and, seemingly overnight, it garnered so much attention that I was called ""viral"". All of a sudden, I had a huge, dedicated fan base, which was, in my opinion, exactly what I deserved, and exactly what I had been looking for. 

I could have had anything. As I grew up, I watched my peers work hard and chase their dreams, but I was above all of that. Without even lifting my finger, I would find modeling agencies and famous photographers waiting at my doorstep. I had suitors coming from farthest reaches of the country, just to catch a glimpse of my face. Each person that saw me found me more desirable than the next. TIME magazine called me ""the most beautiful girl in the world"". 

I began to find my picture on the front cover of the tabloids in the supermarket, and my name a common topic on hate forums around the web. People called me vain, people called me egotistical, and people called me a bitch. Just as frequently as fans would come up on the streets and ask for pictures with me, others would deliver death threats online. I took them lightly. Anyone who had any sort of fame was certain to also receive hate. Instead of dwelling on negatives, I basked in the glory of being constantly complimented. 

Yet, as I had grown famous, my fear of being hidden from the spotlight again grew equally. I began working harder to preserve my appearance. I would eat as little as possible. I had a myriad of creams sitting at my bedside table which claimed to slow aging and prevent me from becoming what I most feared: ugly and unwanted. 

And, the day that divided my life made me just that. It made a ""before"", when I was beautiful and wanted and perfect, and an ""after"", when I was not. 

To this day, I can't think of it without wanting to withdraw emotionally, just turn into stone like I had for months after the incident. The way he pulled me into the alley, even though he seemed to just be a normal fan, at first. The way he grabbed me and touched me everywhere like I was nothing special. The way he treated me like trash, just something to deposit himself in and discard. The way he carved me up with his switchblade so that no one else could have me in the prime of my beauty(or so he said as he was doing it and I was screaming and my own blood was dripping down my face). The way he left me there and probably went about his day like normal, even though I would never forget. 

I was a shell of my former self. Without my beauty and my dignity, I was nothing. I refused to be seen by anyone with a camera or a notepad. Desperately, I scrolled through articles that mentioned my name. People said they were sad for me and felt bad for me, but none of it mattered. I didn't want sympathy. 

I turned to doctors. They could fix me. I knew they could. I told them I wanted to look as I did before, I wanted to be beautiful again. I went under the knife countless times, just trying to be called beautiful again. Just once. 

People online didn't care. I was now a plastic monster. They said I looked horrifying, that I would never be as beautiful as I was before. I should have just stayed as I was, they said, rather than resort to plastic surgery as I had, and become both completely unrecognizable and ugly. A plastic monster, they repeated, and that's who I became. 

I've resorted to anything and everything to become once again just a shadow of my former self. I've continued to get plastic surgery as frequently as the doctors will allow. I've started to take drugs just to take away the constant pain I feel in my heart because I've become the thing I was always most afraid of. 

Nothing else matters. All I want is to be loved again. ",OnyxIndoors

""These pineapples are going to have to be lubricated,"" I said, looking up from my clipboard, ""And about half a pound lighter.""

""WHAT?"" Rorik shouted.  He was a fat, decaying bastard with his entrails hanging out.  He thought a lot of himself, and clearly wasn't happy about having a soul telling him what to do.

""Look man, there's a fine line between torturing a soul, and breaking a soul.  Once you break the soul it can no longer suffer.""

Rorik stared back at me.  He knew I was right.  His face showed it with a beautiful cocktail of hatred and frustration.  In hell, that was probably the best wanking material I would see for a good while.  ""It's article one.  If you don't like it, take it up with the man,"" I looked back down to my clipboard to fill in a few boxes, ""You know he's got a real reservoir of patience.""

""Everybody here hates you Howard.""

""Yeah, that's kind of the point of hell ass hole.""  I adjusted my hardhat and walked away.  I heard some of his organs hit the floor, triggering his usual slur of profanity as he stuffed them back in.  Demon's were obviously less than understanding.  Luckily I had the full backing of lucifer, and at the end of the day there was really nothing they could do.  

After thousands of years, it had come to his attention that a hefty portion of his souls simply stopped giving a shit about torture.  They were broken.  In effect, their eternal damnation had ended.  So something had to change.  Que me, Howard, the dead as fuck safety inspector. Ooohhhhh the irony.

Next was Kesh.  While being less hostile, he was still a pain in the ass.  Though I have to give him credit, he was original.  Really original.  Not all of the demons in this cesspit had creative ability.  ""Okay Kesh,"" I started as I approached his work station, ""I see you have something new for me today.""

Kesh ticked the claws of his four arms together, genuinely excited to explain.  ""As you see, my friend.  Here we have my wonderful, beautiful, Amphitheater of Macabre Marionettes.""  He waved to of his arms back to a small back opening in a rock wall.  

I followed him through the passage, and it opened up into a large cavern with coral seats leading all the way up to a stage.  ""This is interesting."" I complimented.

""Indeed. The seats are made of fire coral.  The plays themselves are performed completely by *me*,"" A third pair of arms tore their way out of his sides, ""And my puppets.""

To summarize the ordeal, Kesh was bringing in audiences to watch his marionette shows.  His dolls were souls hung up on multiple meathooks, and were manipulated by Kesh who clung to the top of the chasm with his clawed feet.  Said puppets were gagged.  Kesh was very proud of his voice acting.  ""I have to ask, what are you performing in here?""

""Oh, only the *finest* of Shakespeare,"" He extended two sets of arms in a gesture of pride, ""Only last night I put on my own iteration of Romeo and Juliette, in which Romeo spits out the poison at the *last* second.""

I began to question, ""That sounds...kind of sof-""

""Only to realize he has married a man with a penchant for *butt play*.""  His familiar wide grin appeared.  Those teeth...Had you told me Hiroshima occurred inside his mouth instead of in Japan, I would have believed you.    

""You never let me down. I think you've got a good thing going here, but there's a couple violations you're going to have to address,""  I watched Kesh's smile turn into a scowl, ""Shakespeare's stuff is long.  You can't be yanking these folks around for that entire time.  I mean this is some pretty savage shit.  I'm not going to ask you to shorten the plays, I'm just going to request that you swap out the cast halfway.""

""You are a ruthlessly metastasizing cancer, Howard.""  Kesh's black slime started leaking out of his mouth again.  It was an anger thing.

""That might be the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me down here.  Thank you Kesh.""

""What gives you the right?!"" He shouted and swung his arms around, ""Why are you even **here?!**""

I sighed, and lowered my clipboard to my side, ""Have you ever had one of those days when you go to work, notice a broken mechanism, and just not really care?  Then that roller coaster the mechanism belongs to sends an entire ride full of developmentally disabled children rocketing through the air straight into a bus full of low income kids on a field trip?  Not to mention simultaneously crushing one *very* lucky safety inspector with the 'Fun Town' sign that it knocked over?.""

I watched Kesh's face go slack, ""...No?""

""Oh."" I smiled cordially, jotted down some notes on the safety sheet, and walked away.

For all his preaching about the glories of this so-called ""heavenly kingdom,"" Jesus had been surprisingly willing to keep his buddy bound to the mortal realm. They say it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. People think this adage refers to being tied to earth by your possessions, but the truth is, you're being kept here by a demonic lunatic scrounging for your souls before they can ever reach the pearly gates.

The others hadn't caught on. Peter and James and John and the rest of those blind fools had dismissed my pleas entirely; all of them had been content to ooh and aah over the latest miracle and continue to follow Jesus around like little lambs. That night, I had confronted Jesus of his misdeeds by myself.

""Why you gotta be such a killjoy, Judas?"" Jesus had said, ""Let me build my undead army, will you?""

""What about the Kingdom of Heaven? Don't all souls deserve peace in the afterlife?""

That had caused him to double over with laughter. ""Pure fiction. Nothing happens after you die. All that stuff was to ensure everyone was on their best behavior. Necromancy 101: impure souls result in quicker-decaying wights.""

The Sanhedrin hadn't believed me, but they had been willing to ally with me to take down Jesus regardless. It had sucked that I was branded a traitor afterwards, but it had all been for the greater good. If that had been all there was to endure, I could have lived with that, but to witness the disintegration of the glorious afterlife Jesus had spent years building up—the one I had blindly and wholeheartedly bought into—that had been too much for me. 

At least now, I can rest easy knowing that my soul will never fall into the black hands of that necromancer. This little fact gives me a modicum of comfort as I wait, dangling from this tree, for my spine to break and for oblivion to come.",hideouts
[WP]Jesus was actually the world's first necromancer and Judas tried to stop him. Write Judas story,TheWizardSROE,"I won't pretend I'm completely the good guy here.

I have my vices. Lots of them, really. I love to dress nice. I like the clinking of coins in my pocket. And I can be a really fucking terrible friend.

But still. Something wasn't right, and it seemed like so few people actually noticed it. I was lucky that most of the people who did were rich and powerful. Then again, ""lucky"" probably isn't the right word.

I should probably start from the beginning. 

Back in the day, the children of Israel were waiting for a savior. We'd been in bondage, passed from empire to shitty empire for so long. And at some point, we started looking to any halfway articulate farm-boy with a loud voice for hope. It was bad times. And the Romans were the worst of it. So I hope you don't think I'm naive for having put my faith in this hippie-looking hick named Joshua. He said things that were kind. Things that made sense. And for a while, the miracles that happened were practical.

But then things started to get....weird. 

Joshy had never really had much of a temper. He was always more of a ""peace and love"" kinda guy. So it didn't really seem like ""him"" when he started having regular freak-outs. His breakdown in the temple was the most public one, but it was also the one that made the most sense. I mean, what some of those assholes were doing there wasn't just desecration, it was straight up highway robbery. Sure, Josh went too far, but he had a point.

But the other things...that shit with the fig tree was just weird. And I got even more sure that something was wrong when I found him teetering on the edge of a building, talking to someone who wasn't there about whether or not he should just jump off. When we pulled him down, I found out he hadn't eaten in more than a month. 

His miracles started getting stranger too. Less loaves and fishes, and water to wine, more driving out demons. In fairness, he started out doing things that were still genuinely helpful, just flashier. Healing cripples, bringing the sick back from the brink, those sorts of things. And sure, it was weird that he could do that, but you figure that God is on his side, you know? But then there was the kid with the seizures.

It was a real tragic thing, what we found that day. I knew this kid, I was an acquaintance with his parents. He understood a lot of things, and he was smart as a whip when his body wasn't trying to chuck him into the fireplace. We all figured, after healing cripples and lepers, a kid with epilepsy shouldn't be a problem, right? So Josh reaches out towards the kid, and I can see his eyes go wide.

I've known this kid a while now. Held him once or twice to keep him from hurting himself when he's seizing. I can tell when it's him and when it's not.

And when this kid starts screaming bloody murder and talking about legions before Joshua even touches him, I can see that it's the kid. 

Josh stopped his seizures, and the kid and his family were happy, but he was never quite the same after that. A little slower. A little less creative.

But...he genuinely didn't regret it. His life really was better. So if it was just that, I might have let it be. But then Lazarus happened.

Lazarus...god, I can't think about it without feeling sick to my fucking stomach. I saw him when he came out of that cave. Before Joshua had the chance to fix him up. His skin was pressed up into his bones. His eyes were all sunken in and hollow, and there was no light behind them. There wasn't a mind behind those eyes. He was moving. He was breathing. But he still reeked of death.

I ran away. I came back, but I couldn't look at Lazarus. I couldn't. I just...couldn't.

It wasn't right. It wasn't fucking right.

I won't pretend like I was a saint. I made some money off the deal. I betrayed the rest of the apostles. And as soon as I made the choice, I regretted it. It hurt. It hurt so much. I'd sold a man who I called brother into torture and death, for what? To sate some stupid paranoia? The Joshua I knew...the Joshua I loved would forgive me. He was a pushover that way.

But I could never forgive myself. And I couldn't live with the hate.

I wasn't disappointed or surprised when I ended up in hell. And it wasn't shocking to me that a part of the torment was just to watch the people you loved living on without you. But the moment I knew the pain wouldn't stop was when I was looking through the portal and I saw Joshua's tomb.

I felt sick, but the feeling redoubled as the rock slowly rolled aside, crunching and grinding into the gravel as the cavern opened. 

Joshua walked out.

His face was pale and sunken, like Lazarus, but it slowly filled back up with blood, his whole body shuddering as he took in a breath.

I knew that I was dead. Logically I knew that. 

But I still swear that my heart stopped when I saw him turn and, through the portal, smile directly at me.",Elacular

[WP]Jesus was actually the world's first necromancer and Judas tried to stop him. Write Judas story,TheWizardSROE,"How is no one seeing this?

As I continue to follow this Jesus... thing, whatever it might be, it amazing how no one is questioning this. 

One day, he literally went up to a blind man and violent grabbed his head. He then placed his hand over his face and violently pushed this man's head back. The old man began to have a seizure and then was cured! Now everyone actually believes he's the messiah, no questions asked. I'm not buying it. 

I mean his first magic spell thing was turning water into wine at one of our parties, don't get me wrong I thought it was great at the time, but something is not right. That's why I told the romans, I mean come on, anyone who rambles on about a spirit thing and having your father inside you self is not sane. 

Then the other night, we were waiting for him while he was pray and these romans came looking for Jesus. Peter, the crazy rebel he is, cut the guys ear off and get this Jesus shows up and slaps that thing right back on. Craziness! 

The romans made this whole big deal amount it, but they end up kill Jesus. I know, I know, I was he friend and Jesus even did that little speech while we were eating a couple days ago but get this. They looked into his tomb and he wasn't even there! Not only that but all of a sudden he comes back and start hanging out with the guys and me like nothing happen. Then everyone's loved ones started coming back. Now I don't want to say I told you so, but...

"[WP] You've always been a lucid dreamer. For as long as you can remember, your dreams have felt real and had purpose. Lately they've become more violent. Today, you received a text from an an unknown number that says ""Your training is complete. See you soon""",aawwwwwweshit,"History class was just as bland and boring as Mrs. Kinley seemingly enjoyed making it, but my heart was pounding so hard in my chest I almost started worrying about my physical well-being. I was torn between nervously glancing at my classmates and nervously glancing at my phone all day, but no matter how many times I checked, the abrupt text message on the screen refused to change. My classmates didn't look any more suspicious than on an average day, either. But if it's not some sort of stupid prank, what could it mean? 

I decided to do another *reality check*, just like a dozen times before since I got that text. I pinched my nose between my fingers, and tried to take a deep breath. Same result - it didn't work. If I were in a dream, which honestly wouldn't surprise me as much as the mysterious message itself, I could breath in and out with my airways blocked. Or I could push my fingers through the palm of my hand. That's just how dreams worked, and trust me, I knew hell of a lot about dreaming.

When I turned eight, my dreams started to change. Every single night, after going to bed, I helplessly slipped into a dream world that felt just as real as *this one*. I knew I was asleep in my bed, I was in control of my actions, and when I woke up, instead of the hazy, patchy memories of regular dreams, I vividly remembered every miniscule detail. First, my new ability terrified me (and mystified my mother and my friends), but after months and months of nights spent in the dream world, I grew not only to accept it, but also to enjoy it. A lot.

I called them my *game dreams*, because it was like an improved version of a video game - I just go to bed, and an endless world of excitement and adventure awaits, shaped and formed by my very own taste. I could fly if I wanted to, I could walk through walls and stop time, and as I grew older and my creativity started to blossom, the dreams became even more exciting. I could conjure up elaborate storylines, epic battles, and I even had my first kiss with a girl I met in one of my dreams.

But the more I engulfed myself in my game dreams, or *lucid dreams* as other people called them (I learned the term as soon as I learned how to google stuff), the more I started to fade away from the real, physical world. No matter how much I tried, I couldn't find anything interesting about my friends, school, and my old hobbies. My relationship with my mother started to go gradually downhill, and my grades were horrible to say the least. I only cared about my dreams, and this made a heavy mark on my waken life. 

When I started high school, I was already the same scrawny, gloomy, weird kid who now was sitting in Mrs. Kinleys history class, sweating bullets, cluiching his phone, desperately trying to breathe through his pinched nostrils. And then my phone buzzed again. ""Meet me at the schoolyard"" the text said. Sent by the same unidentified number. I almost jumped up in surprise.

She must have noticed my stranger than usual behaviour, because Mrs. Kinley stabbed me in the face with an ice-cold stare, accompanied by a blood-curdling pitch shift in her monotone voice. 

""Mr. Thompson, you know very well I'm not comfortable with my students playing on their phones in my class"" she said to me, and took a deep breath, probably to give me one of her trademark lectures. I didn't even let her start it.

""I'm sorry, Mrs. Kinley, but I'm not feeling very well"" I muttered. ""Can I go to the bathroom please?"" My voice probably sounded way more weak and worried than I planned, as her stern gaze seemed to soften. She just sighed, and made a hand gesture towards the classroom door. 

As I gathered myself up and started to stroll towards the door, she continued her speech on the Roman Empire or something. Her words registered only as white noise in my head. My thoughs were racing but none of them reached a logical conclusion. As soon as the door closed behind me, I switched to a nervous jog and hurried towards the schoolyard. 

A few years ago, *he* appeared. I never learned his name, and I never saw his face, but he visited most of my lucid dreams. I recognized his voice as mine, but deeper and calmer, and sometimes I could catch a glipse him from the corner of my eye, but he refused to show himself properly. He knew a lot about lucid dreaming, and taught me more about the topic than any book I've ever read about it. He also appeared to know a lot about me - which made me worry first, because he was the only element in my lucid dreams I could not control. He never interrupted, though - he was watching, making comments, giving advice. Later, I learned to accept his presence. I wrote him off as just my wacky teenage hormones messing with my dreams. 

Sometimes, he talked about my dreams as *training* or even *missions*, and every time he visited, my dreams turned action-packed, violent and both physically and mentally taxing. He gave me vague orders, and I tried to execute them. I probably should've felt weirded out by this procedure, but my dreams were pretty damn weird to begin with, so I just learned to deal with the situation. But when I got that text about my *training* this morning, I freaked out. I never once talked about him or my dream training sessions to anyone, and I never considered him to be *real*. That's just plain impossible... right?

This must be a misunderstanding. Wrong message sent to the wrong number, nothing more. While I was hurrying towards the schoolyard on the empty corridors, I tried to calm myself with rational thoughs like these. And my rational side came up with the brilliant idea of replying to the text, with all the tact and politeness of a sixteen year old weirdo.

""Who the fuck is this? Stop messing with me man"" I typed out, and just as I reached the double door that lead to the yard, I sent the message. I stared at the door, going through my reality check routine religiously. Breathe through pinched nose. Finger through palm. Repeat. None of them worked. 

This shit is reall ife. 

Fuck.

My phone buzzed as I recieved another text and I almost let it slip from the sweaty embrace of my shaking fingers. I unlocked the screen. Same number. ""I will explain everything later, hurry up""

I pushed the doors open, and the moment I took a step outside, I felt a stinging sensation on my neck. I reached for it, trying to swat away whatever bug decided to bite me in the neck in a stressful situation like this. I knocked something over with my hand, and it rolled down my shoulder, and landed in front of my feet. 

""What a strange bug."" I thought ""A pointy end in the front, a fuzzy end in the back. No legs, no wings... it kinda looks like a syringe or something."" My thoughts started to wander, and right at the moment I realized I'm looking at a tranqulizer shot, my vision went blurry and I fell face-first on the schoolyards pavement. It didn't even hurt. I felt a pair of gloved hands grip my arms, and then everything went pitch black.

This one was a dreamless sleep.

Today, you received a text from an an unknown number that says ""Your training is complete. See you soon""",aawwwwwweshit,"Dove had never been the best at school, life, or work. She always was smart though, and she applied those thoughts through her imagination. If you knew Dove, you would say that ""Having your head in the clouds"" is a severely misplaced understatement made by the ignorant. Dove would slip into these dreams, you see, and they would be fascinating stories, full of dragons, princesses, and Mickey Mouse when you were kids, and now they were entertaining sitcoms full of drama, romance, bloodshed (if she was in the mood), and more. You were lucky to hear them. But for the record, bloodshed was accompanied by a Prince Charming fighting for Dove's life. Sometimes he lived, other times he died. It depended on Dove's ""lucid dream"". 

But recently, something had seemed off about Dove's dreams. The protagonist quit their adventure. The news about terrorists had been re-broadcast with gruesome detail and accuracy. Birds began to show up everywhere in these dreams, Dove said. Ironically, all these birds were not your friendly neighborhood robin, or chickadee or pigeon. These were vultures, hawks, crows, namely scavengers and thieves. Then one day these birds vanished. This left both you, Dove's best friend, and Dove herself utterly confused. But as it always did, Dove's magically alluring world shifted, as did the events in the imaginary alternate dimension. 

People began to appear again. It seemed, from what you heard, mostly from texts now, that Dove's dreams were a pile of twisted comedies, and they all ended in violent, bloody plot twists that seemed ""Perfectly acceptable, but rather surprising,"" in Dove's words. You shook your head when Dove had told you this, dismissing your pacifist embracing friend when she neutrally reported this sudden change. 

Now you hadn't heard from your best friend for some time now, and the next time you heard from her was rather disturbing. She came knocking, sending you a text that stated ""OMG!!! (Y/N), we totally have to get together!!! Hope you're free, because I'm coming over!!"" Now, this wasn't like Dove at all. She was rather laid back and logical, letting you be the hyper friend in the relationship. Despite this, you had been through thick and thin together, so you didn't question this extensively. 

A short while later, a knock sounded at your door, a harsh contrast to the impulsive text sent a short while ago, leaving absolutely no room for discussion. You answer the door, greeting your best friend with a hug that only best friends can share, and you only watched as your best friend made yourself at home, literally. She vanished into your home, which she had never been into, and seemed to be rummaging through your well tucked away kitchen. A short while later, she reappeared to where you were casually lounging on your comfy couch in your living room, knife in hand. Not a butter knife and a plate of toast, mind you, but the knife that you kept hidden away to use as a WEAPON in THREATENING SITUATIONS LIKE THIS ONE. 

The look on Dove's face was both manic and apathetic, at the same time, a wildly unbecoming look on her face and body. Her position was feral, and wasting no time like she did when she was down to earth, she sprung. Through a flurry of knife strokes, you were driven out of house and home, the self defense lessons you took as a child steeling your nerves and your body as you dodged. The little creepy, non human voice repeating ""Left... Right... And LEFT AGAIN..."" unsettled you, scaring you even. By now, any ordinary citizen would have shit themselves. Luckily, for some strange reason, (Y/N) was an exception. She knew only to dodge and run. And she did. 

A short while later, you were at your local park, playing with your neighbor's little Border Collie puppy, having just finished a exciting game of fetch. As customary routine dictated, you felt a wet nose nudge your phone pocket, where a text had come in from your friend, Dove. 

Opening it, you read ""Your training is complete. See you soon."" It all made sense now.

The transition was beautiful, if not entirely understood. What followed after was what I can only describe as horror. It was over in a heartbeat, a synaptic flash's worth of time where each of us in the room experienced confusion and pain. And then he cried.  
  
Our mother was the first to his side, smothering him with hugs and kisses, telling him it would be ok. The doctor was droning on about how it was most likely disorienting for him and urging us to take it slow. I couldn't scrub the look of anguish from my mind. He cried himself to sleep eventually, surrounded by people who loved him, but anyone paying attention could tell it wasn't enough.  
  
He was never the same after. No brain damage, therapists couldn't point to anything beyond some sort of PTSD, but he was never really... there. We got used to it eventually, I guess, but sometimes he'd space out in the middle of a conversation and it was just unsettling.  
  
He was 17 when I found him in our garage, nodding off in the carbon monoxide smog. I wasn't surprised. I dragged him out of the car, laid him on the couch, and cracked a beer for both of us. His first. He told me it wasn't. Then he told me everything. I listened in silence, the only noise made was when I opened another beer, then another. It was a long story, about a long life. 20 years of time we'd known nothing about. He'd learned his lesson after the first therapist.  
  
When he'd finished we sat in silence for a bit longer, no knowing what to say. Finally I had to ask. Why had he done it? His eyes got that same look they did when he zoned out and I was afraid I'd lost him. When he spoke I nearly jumped out of my skin. His voice was trembling and I felt myself choking up.

All my friends from Ms Colworth's fourth grade class come to visit me, and they're all young again, or rather, they were never adults to begin with. Neither was I.

You might think I'd find the whole thing upsetting. Like the prospect of being 'back' in elementary school, having to sit through lessons on long multiplication or whatever fifth-graders learn.  Being preadolescent again, to the detail of being a foot shorter, half my proper weight and of course, talked down to by the friendly nurses and pediatricians who come to check on how I'm doing. Looking ahead to puberty again. Knowing I'm gonna have to sit through Sunday School as well. Better hope my head doesn't start spinning and projectile vomitting all over the hip teen running the class.

But no. I don't care about any of that. I'm not in a mood to miss anything about my shitty adult life, least of all the fact that the whole world started turning into a nightmare right around the time I fell into a coma.

I get used to being young. Nothing even feels out of place about my body and its size, I actually feel quite light and free, and it's everything else that seems too big. It isn't too long before I notice I've forgotten how my voice sounds as a man. None of these things are a problem. In my dreams, I died, we all died, and it seemed so real. But I got given a second chance.

Nonetheless, there is something that nags at me as time goes on.

See, being ten is fine. But what's the deal with my thought patterns? They seem way too... grown up. If the last twenty years really were just a horrific phantasm, well, how come I seem to have retained all the things I learned in the dream? The vocabulary, the general knowledge about the world, the degree in climate science that turned out to be a worthless piece of paper once Trump took office. It's all still there, and weirder still, it matches up perfectly with the outside world. I surprise several of the nurses with my apparent precociousness.

I mean, I notice I'm distractible. It's a bit like having ADD. As the energy slowly returns to my body, I even feel like a kid again. Inquisitive about things, open, unguarded. But that's about it. It's like being on a mild dose of ecstasy, not like I've just found out two decades of knowledge were all gibberish.

But I shrug it off. I'm just too happy to be out of that horrible timeline, that dark dream of the future.

And then I see the story. The one about Tropical Storm Allison.

It's getting close to lights-out and the nurse, Jackie, has come to collect my dinner plate. She's very young for a nurse, can't be much older than twenty, and she has a contagiously cheerful energy that apparently has yet to be beaten down by the healthcare system. (Or maybe the hospitals aren't as bad as I dreamed they were.)

""Hey,"" I ask her, ""can you turn that up please?""

""Hm? The TV?"" she asks. She obliges me, but gives me a look. ""You're funny, Damien. All the other boys just want to watch Nickelodeon.""

I ignore her. I'm too busy listening to the report.

The hurricane has raged for three days so far in Houston and it's killed at least a dozen people, but more are unaccounted for. It's a natural disaster. It's terrible news.

And I've already seen it happen before.

In my coma. My 'dream.' You know. The one that never really happened?

My voice squeaks in panic as I ask, ""Jackie? How long did the doctor say it'll take before I can walk again?""

""Oh, about five, six months,"" she says, glancing down at me curiously.

""Can we do it any faster?"" I ask. ""I mean, is that - can we do that?""

She considers it. ""I don't think so. No, not really. It isn't the sort of thing you can rush, you've been lying down for months and your muscles need time to recover. In a hurry, are you?... Damien? What's wrong?""

All 20 years of it.,aawwwwwweshit,"One day I woke up, and everything I'd ever known was a haze- a blur of twisting memories nipping at my brain, fading into nothingness. It felt like I was dying, slowly losing hold of everything I'd ever been and known. I'd be sitting on the couch with my girlfriend, and she'd bring me a plate of delicious, fresh kebabs, but suddenly I would feel sick and lose my appetite, guilt rushing through me. I'd be petting my cat, Louie, and he'd look up at me with big green eyes that were strange to me, entirely strange. 

Everything in my life felt like a lie.

It's hard to explain, but when you feel like your world has been altered, the entire world crashes down on you at once. Once something that felt so real becomes distant and lost, you no longer trust anything. Life is hard enough, but when you can't even believe that the people around you are real? I'd forgotten about everything in that life I'd ""lived"" for ten years. Ten fucking years just slipped through my fingers, and I woke up to a new reality. 

It's slow. It's painful. It's... it's scary, adjusting to a new world. To be told your old one was nothing but a dream. Truly, it's terrifying beyond all comprehension, but after several years I'd gotten used to it. I'd adjusted fairly well and life became simple again as those memories of my false life entirely disappeared, giving way to reality. I had beautiful people around me, helping me through it.

----

I kissed my sleeping girlfriend, stroking her shimmering brown hair. She smelled wonderful, and I let the aroma linger in my nostrils a while before turning back to my side and flipping the lights off. Sleeping still felt terrifying and strange, but I never dreamt anymore; sleep was nothing but an abyss to me, which in a way, I was thankful for.

I opened my eyes one more time to look at her, so I could fall asleep to the thought of her face. The release of sleep took hold of me.

I awoke to bright, natural light piercing my eyelids, refusing to let me stay asleep. My girlfriend was already up, probably making breakfast, and I wanted to sleep a little longer so I went to close the blinds. I couldn't move. My mind willed it, but my body refused on all counts and when I looked down I saw a sickly body. My arms were thin and gaunt, my skin practically see through, and life itself felt heavy on me.

People rushed in, smiling and crying, telling me how happy they were to have me back. It was all a blur of unfamiliar faces, strange people and strange smells.

A doctor came in and smiled, placing a hand on mine. ""Welcome back, son,"" he said calmly. ""You've been in a coma for about two years. It's a miracle you're back with us.""

I stared out into a crowd of smiling strangers, and began to sob uncontrollably. 

*Not again. Please, God, not again.*

The doctor gently replied: ""You've been asleep for over a year, young man. We just finally managed to wake you up from a long sleep that is called a co-""

""A coma. I know what a coma is, Doctor. Why are you talking to me in that tone of voice?

""In what tone of voice?"" He asked.

""The tone of voice you would give to a child, Doctor."" I could see the two nurses give each other an estranged look, the doctor himself appeared quite puzzled.

""You are a child, Billy. You've been asleep for over a year and your 8th birthday just passed. Nurse, check his previous MRI and CAT scans and just ensure there are no other abnormalities besides the skull fissure.""

I stared at him wide-eyed, my jaw was drooping as I was trying to comprehend what in the hell had just happened. I have to be dreaming. I am having some tripped out dream like I do every so often, and I probably won't remember this when I wake up. Everything is fine. Everything is okay. This is just my imagination running rampant again...

""Oh my god, Billy! Billy! I can't believe you are finally awake!!!""

I sat down on my hospital bed, in complete shock and disarray. My mother was hugging me. My father was shedding a tear. My brother was smiling. And there I was, crying. Crying beyond what one would expect for an 8-year old boy who just woke up from a coma. Crying more than a little child who lost his grandparents, or his pet. No, this was far beyond.  

""D..Doctor! What's a matter with my son?"" My mother asked.

""I..I don't know Mrs. Smith. Your son has been acting very strange shortly before you arrived here.""

And while they were talking, I felt like I was ready to throw up. I felt like the world was spinning before my very eyes. I felt disembodied. ""How?"" I thought. ""How is this possible?""

Mom's been dead for over two years. Adam, 4 and Dad, 20.

I saw mom die before me from cancer. Adam's friend called me on the phone to tell me he passed away in his sleep, and I still remember being 9 when mom came home to tell me that dad had died at work. When I last went to sleep, I was 28 years old.

Have I been given a second chance to save my family?

What about my sisters that have not been born..? What will this do to them if I change history?

What is happening to me?!

All 20 years of it.,aawwwwwweshit,"Strangely, when the bomb goes off, even as the heat sears the flesh from my bones, there is no pain. There's screaming, I assume, because people are running around in panic. But all I can hear is the roar on all sides, pounding through the pavement, through the office towers, through my entire body. The ten megaton nuclear blast splits the New York skyline open and wipes away a hundred thousand lives in an instant. It looms over the city like a phosphorescent angel of death, raining ash and radiation. I just stand there on the sidewalk, looking up at it. I'm the only one, everyone else is running, the conflagration is catching each in their steps.

In my final moments, the light engulfs everything and blinds me completely. I can only see white, and all I know is the apocalyptic thunder of that explosion. It's blinding me and that's the only pain, and the weirdest thing is, all I can think about is something a shaman once told me about death. He said that death in this world is simply birth in the other world. We think it's the end, but on the other side, in hyperdimensional space, there are beings waiting to welcome us with open arms into the new realm.

How nice.

I blink. At some point, I'm not sure when, the noise stopped, or perhaps I simply went deaf. But the light is still there. It's glaring, and it's flickering, as though somebody's shining it directly into my eyeball.

I groan and try to look away, but everything's numb. My whole body feels as though it was hit by, well, a nuke. I can't even tell if I'm standing up or on my back. My mind has been blasted to pieces. But it seems it's slowly mending itself. The light shines from one eye to the other, making me squint and recoil. Behind it, I can see a face. A man, with a flashlight. Someone is crying somewhere.

I'm... on a hospital bed. The curtains are blowing in the wind. I can see New York, bustling, the city that never sleeps is untouched by nuclear fire.

Strangely, I can even see the Twin Towers.

So is this a dream, or am I dead?

""Damien,"" says a woman's voice - my mother - and then I can feel her holding my hand. ""Oh thank the good Lord. Oh thank merciful Jesus, my sweet baby.""

Eyes not quite open, jaw slack like a broken puppet, I gaze around. Yep, it's a sterile medical room and... if I'm not mistaken, this is pediatrics. Because through the curtains to my left and right there are girls and boys of all ages, eyes closed, serenaded in slumber by the beeping of their heartrate monitors, IV drips in their arms. A few are attached to respirators. There's also a balloon motif on the far wall, but the cheer of the red, blue and green colours feels forced through the dim lighting, and the sad sound of unconscious children taking hollow breaths through machinery.

My tongue feels like sandpaper, but I manage to get it out. ""... Mom?""

At my side, she sniffles and leans in to hug me. She wraps me up tight in one of her bear hugs, and for an instant I have time to think there's something not right about this, she seems too big. But then the man who shone a light in my eyes - the doctor - is urging her away. He's a gruff figure, with tufts of white hair and a wrinkly double chin. ""Ma'am,"" he says. ""The boy has just woken up. It's important you be gentle with him.""

""Oh - of course,"" Mom says, her eyes still fixed on me. She kisses the golden cross chained around her neck and she whimpers. Yes, there is something different about her. Her hair is too black. Her skin is too smooth. She's not fat enough.

""Mom... you're too young,"" I tell her.

My voice is cracked and I can barely speak in more than a whisper, but still I'm surprised when it comes out in a kind of timbre. I'm still trying to piece things together. The echo of the nuclear blast seems to ring through the relative quiet of the ward.

She nods as though what I said made perfect sense, and wipes her nose with a handkerchief. I roll my head slowly on the pillow, it's all I can manage. I look down at myself. The space to the end of the bed is off, it's clearly too small, yet my feet fit comfortably short of the end. Even the room feels too big, as though someone's turned the Liliputian setting in my brain up a notch. Someone dropped the bomb, who knows who, maybe it was the Russians or the Chinese or the Koreans. How did I survive? Or maybe I didn't? Nothing's making sense right now.

And that's when I realise I'm a kid.

I don't have the energy to cry out, so I just gaze at my skinny hairless arms in shock. My brain scrambles to decipher this absurd situation with an even more absurd answer. Maybe I survived the nuke, but I was so messed up they had to transplant my brain into the body of a kid who the blast rendered braindead. But no, that doesn't work. Because I can see my birthmark scorched into the small unweathered palm of my open hand, the only apparent burn left over from an explosion that melted me to the bone.

You know how when you wake up out of a coma, the doctor asks you some questions to check how your mind's holding up? Things anyone would know, like, what year is it. Or, who's the president.

""Damien,"" the doctor explains slowly, ""you've been in a coma for nearly a year. You choked on a piece of meat and suffocated before the ambulence could arrive. We had to put you in an induced coma or otherwise you might have died. Can you tell me what year it is?""

""2020,"" I say.

He notes that on a pad. ""The year is 2001,"" he tells me.

I mustn't have heard him right, I must still be out of it. Same goes for the hallucination about being a preteen.

Then he asks, ""Can you tell me who the President is?""

""It's... Donald Trump,"" I say, remembering the name bitterly. That bastard. The nuclear holocaust, it was all his fault, he must have finally pushed either Russia or China beyond the brink.

""It's George Bush,"" he says, and makes another note.

My mother looks at the doctor in confusion. ""Who's Donald Trump?"" she asks, voice tinged with worry the way it always does at the slightest hitch.

""Damien is still regaining full consciousness, it's nothing to be worried about yet,"" the doctor assured her. ""He may be delirious for some time still.""

I barely hear him. My mind is reeling.

Who's Donald Trump? *Who's Donald Trump?*

It suddenly hits me what's happened.

I slump against the pillow. ""Ooh,"" I say, not even minding the boyish pitch of my own voice, and then I laugh. My mother, blinking in surprise, laughs along with me. ""Ooh, thank... thank *fuck*,"" I say.

My mom stops laughing. ""Damien,"" she says, sounding surprised.

I can barely move my arm, but I reach out and try to grab the cuff of the doctor's sleeve. I look up into his eyes imploringly. ""The Crash of 2016,"" I say, ""it didn't happen? The Depression didn't swing the vote to Trump?""

Ignoring me, he glances at my mother. ""He may have had some vivid dreams while unconscious. I expect it will take him time to readjust to reality.""

""The - the Ukraine Crisis,"" I go on, getting frantic, ""that was all a dream? The South China Sea? What about the Iraq War?""

My mom finally has a grip, sort of, but tears are still drying on her face. ""That's right, darling. All dreams.""

*Oh thank the sweet fucking Lord.* And I'm not even Christian anymore.

Well, except, I was when I was ten. Only I *am* ten. Not thirty. I was never thirty. It was all in my head.

I give Mom a smile. And then I start crying too.

Was there a party outside, Tjörven thought - but he knew it couldn't be. The sound seemed too close, yet in a way ethereal. He sat up in bed, looking around him bewildered. ""Emma"" he whispered urgently ""Emma wake up"" he said louder now. But she didn't move. Her beautiful face was peaceful and calm as ever, but no matter how he shook her, she wouldn't wake up. ""Emma I'm freaking out"" Tjörven said. Suddenly he felt light headed, dizzy, as if his world was twirling. He rose out of bed, leaning on the nightstand, staring at the ocean his bedroom looked out on, and his heart was racing. Colours were fading, the sound got less ethereal and louder every second.

Did someone spike his drink last night at the party? Was he going insane?

Suddenly he felt warm drops on his hand. He raised his hand and saw them running slowly down his hand. His hand felt warm, as if someone was holding it. He looked back at Emma, still as serene, his angel. He couldn't go mad. She needed him. Her wheelchair stood by the bed, her clothes still hanging over it from last night.

But suddenly he was laying down again. What? 

Thank God, he thought, I was just dreaming.

He opened his eyes, and two brown eyes stared back at him with tears in her eyes. Mom? ""Hi sweety"" she said, her soft voice trembling. Around his bed, a whole crowd of people stood smiling, hugging each other and wiping tears out of their eyes. He didn't recognise anyone.

""What's happening"" Tjörven said, his eyes wide and his heart racing even faster. The heartmonitor went crazy beeping. ""You're back with us"" his mom said, and she just started crying even more. He sat up, and noticed he couldn't move his legs. He couldn't move his legs. ""I'm paralysed?"" He screamed. The smiles vanished at once, making way for pitied glances. ""Honey, you we-""

""Where is Emma?"" Tjörven yelled ""What the fuck is happening"" he only now noticed how young and shrieking his voice sounded. The pitying faces grew concerned. His mother seemed confused. ""Emma?"" She asked. ""Emma, my wife!"" He said ""Jesus fuck, this can't be, I've gotta be dreaming...""

His mother looked back at who Tjörven presumed to be the doctor, scribbling down furiously. 

He janked his hand out of hers, and buried his face in the sheets he pulled to his face.

His mom stood up and walked to the doctor, and whispering rose louder than Tjörven's sobs. Slowly he started realising his world had vanished, and so had Emma with it. Gone forever. the love they had had only imagined. She was gone. And he was stuck here. A whole life he'd have to live all over. 

He wished he could've suffocated himself in the sheets, but no matter how he tried, all he could feel was the cloth grow warm and damp from the tears staining it.",SetFireToTheRane

“Is that fuckin' Mad World?”

For reply, I received a shriek, followed almost simultaneously by shattering glass. That brought me fully awake pretty quickly, and I sat straight up... or tried to. I mostly managed to sort of flop a little. Blinking the sleep out of my eyes, I took in what was very definitely a hospital room, which meant I was in the seat of honor, so to speak.

“Sorry, Mom, didn't mean to scare you. Wait, Mom?! Ah hell, I must be blacked out again. Goddamnit.”

No further reply came, other than an incredulous, open-maw stare from the dream-spirit of my dead mother. Good god, she hadn't looked like that since, what, thirty years before she died? I don't think I could have *drawn* her that perfectly, but I guess the memory was stashed away somewhere. 

*Going nowhere, going nowhere...*

“Okay, but seriously, who plays fuckin' Mad World in a fuckin' hospital? As if this place weren't depressing enough? Also, why a hospital? Don't think I've ever been in one. Why not, I dunno, a strip club? Home? Somewhere I actually fuckin' WANT to be? Wait, if this is one of those... lucid... dream... things, I should be able to control that, right? Let's get ghost-mom right out of here and get something a little... younger..” I said all of this aloud, mostly because I could. I stared hard at ghost-mom and tried to will her into something else, but all this seemed to be achieving was her sliding to the ground, leaning against the counter she'd been next to. 

“Damnit. Well, fine, then, let's at least try to make some lemona---”

“Ch... Ch... **CHARLES! CHARLES OH GOD CHARLES COME HERE NOW HE'S AWAKE!”**

The sudden screaming aside, things suddenly got really loud. I heard yelling, things getting knocked over, people running, the whole shebang. This was a WEIRD dream.

*Their tears are filling up their glasses...*

“Dad, too, eh? Wait, was this the anniversary? I thought it was still a month away, but if I'm dreaming about both of you...”

My “mother” hadn't gotten off the floor quite yet. Or even tried to. She was just sitting there, eyes wide, hands over her mouth now, somehow whiter than the bleached-bone stucco behind her. This was the least “dreamlike” dream I'd ever had, bar none. Even my alcohol-fueled one-night-stands were less vivid than this, and they were, allegedly, real! I wondered idly if their ghosts were punishing me for forgetting the day they died... and then further wondered how much I'd drank if THAT was the most logical explanation I could come up with.

“Alright, I think I want to wake up from this one, please. This is too fuckin' much, and I have the grandkids in the morning. Wait...”

This was all getting very confusing. I'd just remembered that I was... eighty-six? Eighty-seven. Kids, grandkids, the lot. Last I recalled, I was the phone with Cynthia, hammering out the details for the grandkids' visit in the morning. 

*No tomorrow, no tomorrow...*

Right, grandkids. Needed sleep, good sleep. Which meant this weird dream needed to get over with. I started to say something, but the commotion outside the door had made it inside, now. I thought you were supposed to have more control when dreams were this clear?

“Josh? Oh my god, his eyes are open.”

“Sir, ma'am, I need you outside, now. Jackie, get them outside, please. You, nurse, new girl, redhead, get me the...”

“Mom? Dad? What's going--- oh shit!”

“He's awake he's awake he's awake he's awake he's awakehesawakehesawakehesawake...”

“HEY. THIS IS MY DREAM. SHUT THE FUCK UP.”

*When people run in circles...*

The room stopped dead, every bit like a scene from a movie. There, that was better. Maybe getting the hang of this, now.

And then my “mother” fainted, my “dad” started crying, a young girl that looked **exactly** like my granddaughter started screaming while the doctors and nurses just stared at me, slack-jawed.

Well, okay, maybe I still needed some practice.

I dreamt I was- or, I am someone else. I had gotten away from 'em, finally. No more tears, no more shoutin', no more hurt. No more waiting outside in the street after school, checking to see if my parents were in a bad mood or not. If they were, I'd walk the streets a few times, then check again.

No-one plays- or, no-one played with me, no-one cared. The kids just teased me. 

They'd say, “Hey, I heard your mom smacks you around with an ironing board. Is that true, Jamie, does your mom smack you around? I'd drop kick that bitch, but I guess you ain't me.”

They always said it like that, makin' it all a question, but they never wanted it answered, so I never answered 'em.

When I was someone else, I was me. I was strong. I had gotten away from 'em. I'd bested my bullies, I'd overcome them. I found a family I loved and who loved me back. I grew up happy, I went on to college as I'd always wanted. I got a degree, I helped animals, I went to work on Safari, just like the guys I saw on TV. 

I met Lions and Zebras, Giraffes, all the animals. They all loved me as well. You know where you stand with animals. If you give them food, keep 'em warm, give 'em love and stop 'em from hurtin', then they give you love and stop you from hurtin' as well. 

With humans, you never know. You try and help them, like I tried helpin' my old mom when she collapsed. I tried phonin' an ambulance like we learnt in school, but my old dad ripped the phone off me and shouted, “What you doin', you little prick? They're gonna find out, they're gonna throw us in jail!”

I- well, the old me was only worried about her. He didn't know why they did that thing, they never seemed to enjoy it. They just got droopy and stupid. The old me still loved 'em, but didn't like 'em.

That's another thing they'd tease him about. “What, your dad shouts at you? Is that right, your old man shouts you? Calls you names? Is that right Jamie? Man, I'd punch that bastard in the throat, but I guess you ain't me.”

I need to go back to the Safari. I need to go back to being alone with my animals all around me; keep them all safe and cuddle up them at night. I need to see my family.

Not here, in this bed, in this hospital. Not with my old mom and dad pretending they care about me. All the doctors glad it up, and they look so happy for me. But I ain't happy. I can't tell anyone that I ain't happy. I don't know who to tell. 

The only people I talked to weren't people. They were my stuffed animals at home. I talked to my Lion the most. I love my Lion. My old parents didn't like me tellin' him secrets, or makin' any noise, so I just sat and stared and we talked through our eyes.

They're pickin' me up today. I don't believe I'm here. I'm scared. I keep trying to close my eyes real tight to see if I can get back, but it just hurts the dent in my head. I dunno where I got that from.

The doctors and nurses keep coming in, fussin' over me and bringin' me food, and the more they do the more I get sad. The animals never existed. I never existed, and I'm starting to realise that I am a 10 year-old boy again. I do live in that house with those people. They are my parents, and I guess I am scared of the world again. 

But, really, I guess I ain't me.",Tobitronicus

""You're in the hospital, sweetie.""

I open my eyes slowly, one at a time. Silhouettes surround my bed, unrecognizable figures. I strain to see their faces: there's an old man, in a long white lab coat. Next to him, a young man with brownish hair and a long sleeve blue shirt. And lastly a woman, with a medium length ponytail and brown eyes.

As I look over their faces, grogginess seeps into my mind and muddles my senses. I quickly ball my hands to fists and rub my eyes, while stifling a yawn. I ready myself to stand.

""Hey, be more careful!. You're still in a... tentative state, to say the least. You've been asleep for a few days.""

The voice comes from the doorframe. Everyone turns to look, including myself: another woman, with rather bright pink hair and a brilliant white nurse's hat (save for the red cross, of course). She's dressed in a pink undershirt with a white apron, and she's holding a clipboard.

""A few days?"" My voice crackles from dryness, and lack of use. ""What... what are you talking about?""

""The accident, in the forest. Knocked you out cold. Ah, but of course you don't remember, not yet at least. As I said, amnesia was to be expected."" She addresses the last part to the others in the room, and they nod in agreement.

""D-don't remember? What are you saying?"" I blink once or twice, and my sleepiness surprisingly whisks away; with newfound attention, I look her dead in the eyes. ""Of course I remember my *life.* I'm a retired champion. I have a beautiful wife and three children, and--""

""I'm terrbly sorry to interrupt your... 'fantasy,' but I'm afraid none of that's true. You must have had a vivid dream.""

""None of it's true? But I'm--""

""Ten years old. It seems your memory loss is rather extensive.""

""Ten years old?! Quit playing games with me!""

""But it's true, honey."" The woman with the ponytail reaches into her purse, and fumbles for a moment before coming up with something in her hand. ""See for yourself.""

I take the object from her. There's a button on the side, and I press it; the top cover swings open. A mirror.

I take a long look at my face. It's unrecognizable. No beard, no deep brown eyes, no handsome (at least, according to my... wife) smile, nothing. 

Nothing.

""WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!""

I rip the bedsheets from myself and sit up straight. The nurse runs over and grabs my shoulders tight to force me back down, but I squirm in her grasp.

""LET ME UP! LET ME UP!""

""NO, MR. KETCHUM! YOU MUST REST!""",_GlassHawk_

All 20 years of it.,aawwwwwweshit,"It was always dance.  That's all that ever mattered to me, and that was for a damned good reason.  Not only was I naturally talented, but I was also a fast learner and I had more of a drive than any other student at the Paris Opéra Ballet School.  Those three things combined made for a successful performer.  

Unfortunately I was thoughtless enough to assume everything would be the same when I moved half way across the world in order to 'expand my horizons' while attending Juilliard in New York.  I was still the best of the best, there's no doubting that, but suddenly things became a lot more complicated.  

I met the woman while trying to hail a taxi, which for some reason was a very difficult task.  Even before she spoke to me, I noticed her.   How could I not?  She was clearly over six feet tall and that was without a massive afro adding a good five inches. 

 I tried not to stare, but it's as if I couldn't help myself.  She was stunning in every way.  

Eventually my attention was stolen by an approaching taxi.  Said taxi, however, did not stop in front of me.  Rather, it came to a halt in front of the giant woman.  I was about to fume over what felt like a massive betrayal, but the stranger held open the yellow door and smiled at me, ""You look like you're in a hurry,"" She inquired, ""Why don't you go ahead?""

Suddenly my thoughts turned to mush, ""O-oh, I suppose-- I mean,  it rightfully came to you."" What was I saying?  I needed to get to the other side of the city for an audition!  'Prendre l'offre', my mind shouted at me.  

""There's no need to feel guilty if you take this taxi.  I have time before I have to be at work."" She paused, ""But if you really felt bad about it, you can make it up to me by giving me your number.""

My entire body had stiffened at the request, but my pounding heart was demanding I follow through.  I shakily removed a black pen from my purse and gently took her hand in my own, ""Um,"" I, for some reason, wanted to apologize for the sudden contact, only she didn't seem to mind.  I scribbled ten numbers onto the back of her dark hand before capping the writing tool and sticking it back in my purse, ""What's your name?""

""Eva Johnson."" She examined the back of her hand and smiled, ""Yours?""

""A-Adele Leclair."" 

""Well, it's a pleasure to meet you Ms. Leclair."" 'Adele' winked at me and motioned inside the taxi.  

I tried to ignore the pang of guilt in my chest as I climbed onto the worn down leather seats of the car.  I waved shyly at the beautiful woman as the car began to move.  She returned the gesture before another taxi stopped in front of her.

I closed my eyes and put my hand over my still pounding heart.  

And then I open them.


And I am in a hospital room.  

I sit up and whip my head left and right until a wave of nausea comes over me, ""Oh god!"" I hear someone exclaim.

I fix my vision on a woman that sat on the edge of my bed.  Her pale blue eyes are glassed over with the promise of tears as her hands press tightly against her mouth.

""Zachary!"" She flings herself over the bed and wraps her arms around me, ""Oh, Zachary, you're alright!""

Zachary?  Who the hell is-- 

My fuzzy mind begins to clear some, and the realization hits harder than a ton of bricks.  I am Zachary.  But... am I also Adele?

I remember the way mère called me 'Addie' and smiled at me with crinkles under her eyes.  The way père let me stand on his toes as we waltzed across our massive dining room floor.  I would wear a dress every day because I liked things that were feminine and girly... At least... I think I did.  The more and more I think about me- about Adele- the more and more I don't know.  

Suddenly all I remember is countless episodes of 'Pokemon' and how badly I want to (but am not allowed to) watch 'Deadpool'.  I think about how I am a green belt in Karate, not a powerful performer and how I have never danced a day in my life because boys don't dance.

""Zach, there's something I need to tell you..."" The woman who I began to recognize as Aunt Jenny put her hands over my sweaty ones and looks down in shame, ""Your parents died in the car crash, Zach.  I'm sorry.""

And now Adele is gone, ""What?"" I cry.  I jump from my bed and began trying to yank an IV out of my arm.  I only stop when I see her enter the room.

""Eva?"" I didn't know I was crying until the tall woman leans down to my eye level and wipes my tears away with strong hands.

""It's good to see you up, but you should take it slow."" Eva picks me up with ease and places me back on the uncomfortable hospital bed, ""You've been in a coma for almost a year now.  How are you feeling?""

I'm not sure, because now I do remember being Adele and I remember how fast my heart sped when I met the doctor, ""Um,"" I swallow down hard and look towards the window before I ask my question, ""Do you know someone named Adele?""

""Adele?"" Eva takes a seat on a stool besides me and hums, ""Yeah, I'd say I know her.  Know her pretty well actually.""

""Really?"" I feel my heart leap into my throat in excitement.

""That's actually the name of my fiancée."" Eva explained.

Fiancée? My cheeks burned, ""Well... congratulations!""

""Thank you, young man."" 






Jenny would stop Dr. Johnson out in the hallway, ""Is he going to be alright?  Should I... I don't know... get a psychiatrist or something?""

Dr. Johnson will hum and eventually folded her arms over her chest, ""That's probably a good idea.  He's been through a lot.  He'll need as much support as possible.""

""Okay..."" Jenny will released a long held breath, ""I've been meaning to apologize to you, by the way.  I know I freaked out when I learned that Adele had been spending time with Zachary, but I think it was good to have someone talking to him.""

Jenny won't know it, but Dr. Johnson will have turned her back to her patient's guardian because she will be blushing, ""I know you're views are very different than mine, and I respect that.   I may still have a hard time accepting your apology after the way you yelled at her.  I hope you understand."" 

""I..."" Jenny will be ashamed and will look down at her feet to hide the tears in her eyes, ""I know.  If it means anything, I was wrong about you two.  I hope she'll come back and tell Zach stories while he's awake.""

Dr. Johnson will sort of laugh, but not really, and say, ""Me too."" even though she wants to say, 'If she ever comes back at all'

All 20 years of it.,aawwwwwweshit,"This has been one of my longest running fantasies.  For me it'd be about 19 years.  Let's begin.

I heard voices around me, ""He's waking up."" I heard my mother say ""oh thank god.""  Some of my oldest friends and family were all around me, but they all looked a little off.  As I started to gain my bearings I saw my hands and arms.  It didn't make sense.  I was fat again.  My arms had only light fuzz on them, my hands had almost no definition and my knuckles were completely bare.  I didn't remember how I got there.

Before I could really think about it too much one of the doctors started shining a light in my eyes and asking me questions, ""Do you know what day it is?""  I replied, ""No, but that really doesn't say much if you knew me...""  My friends and family laughed, reassured.  ""Where am I?  What happened?""  The doctor explained, ""Nobody is exactly sure.  You were playing by yourself and you must have fallen and hit your head.  They found you lying behind the lodge.""

Was it really happening?  I had fantasized about this moment since I failed out of college.  Do I really get a second chance?  I still remember it vividly.  It was the hardest I ever hit my head.  I was playing by myself in the snow behind the lodge where my family vacationed every winter, and I thought I could jump down the big snow embankment onto the groomed trail.  The way I remembered it, I hit my head, was totally dazed, counted off all the digits of pi I could remember to make sure I was ""still there"" and proceeded with my day.  Could it be true?  Did I actually knock myself completely out and have to be hospitalized?  Would it happen the same way again?

I knew I needed to keep cool.  I said whatever I could remember, but it was so long ago.  ""I was playing by myself at [camp] behind the lodge.  I thought I could just jump down onto the trail, but I must have slipped and hit my head.  It's spring break, 1997.  I'm 11.""  These recollections seemed to set everyone at ease.  The doctor kept asking me questions, but I felt totally fine.  I was elated.  I didn't know where to start.

I asked for some paper.  I started writing pi.  I remembered all the digits I thought I should which was about 40 more than I recall knowing in 1997.  I handed the paper to my dad to verify later in case I was just making up the ""extra"" 40 digits.  ...or if I was making up all of them for that matter.

My friends D&amp;F were there.  D had always been super interested in how many digits of pi I knew and was amazed that I now knew about 40 more.  I tried to just gas light him and tell him he just didn't realize how many I knew.  He didn't fight me on it.  Nostalgia washed over me.  I think I would only see these two together a couple more times.  As I finally convinced everyone I was OK, I realized I had a tough decision to make.  Do I tell anyone?  Do I try to lay low and minimize my butterfly-effect?  Will it even all happen the same?  Should I try to ""fix"" things?  Can I fix things?

I tried to think of something that would convince me it was real.  I thought to myself ""nihongo-o wakarimasu.""  My Japanese was terrible, but I shouldn't know a word yet.  I spoke aloud, ""Dad, the derivative of e^x is e^x, correct?""  My dad was impressed, ""When did you learn that?""  ""School,"" I replied, and he didn't question it.  I was convinced.

I asked if we could go back to [camp], and the doctors said that as long as I felt alright it should be fine.  When we got to the car my reflexes took over.  I walked to the driver's door and said ""don't worry, I'm fine to drive.""  My parents looked at my extremely confused and then laughed.  They must have thought I was joking.  Suddenly it set in.  I wouldn't drive again for at least 4 more year, and I wouldn't be regularly driving my parents for almost 15.  I decided that was convenient, and hopped in my ""regular"" seat behind the passenger seat in the back.

When we got back to [camp] everyone was excited.  I got to see Y again.  I forgot about Y.  He was the best camp leader ever.  We told some jokes and everyone was happy I was OK.  That night I confused everyone when I only put meat and vegetables on my plate.  People asked both mocking and generally confused, ""No pasta tonight?""  I went to bed early.

The next day I wanted to test the limits of my new ""powers"".  How much could I remember?  Was it just facts?  I don't remember exactly what it felt like to be 11, but I think I was clumsy.  I knew what I needed to do.  ""Mom, Dad, can I rent some skis?""  ""Skiing is dangerous, and you just fell.  Are you sure you should do that?""  ""C'mon Mom.  We're here in the snow.  Let me ski.  I'll stay off the steep slopes.""  After convincing them, I got my skis and skied perfect parallel down the hill.  Apparently I got to keep my coordination too.  I spent the rest of the day tearing up the bunny slopes, and eventually went to the ""hard"" hills.

When I got back home and school started again the feelings were totally overwhelming.  Besides realizing what a cringe-worthy disaster I was, I was not prepared for how harsh middle school had been.  The kids teased me relentlessly, and my comebacks that would have been legendary in 2008 made absolutely no sense in 1997.  It was fine to me, though, because I knew who would become my best friends, and I didn't have much trouble connecting with them.  It really helped that I knew everything about every important video game that was just released.

My classes were a breeze.  Not only had I already read all the books and learned the material, but the homework that devastated me when I was actually 11 was so simple now.  I realized that I could do it all differently.  Not just perfect, but better than perfect.  I got home and started to research.  Amazon hadn't even gone public yet.  I was going to be rich.",prolways

They lived nearby, but, I still had to walk a little way and I thought it best that I had head off now, lest my mother get worried about where I was. One of them kicked the ball at me and being lost in thought, my timing was off-par. I dodge to the left, the ball going to the right, and instead of catching it, I miss it.

I sigh, getting back to my feet and rubbing my knees clean from the plate of dried dirt that had seemed to gather. I looked up, a select few of my friends coming closer, a look of disappointment being commonplace amongst their faces. ""That's a good time to head off,"" I say aloud, ""I gotta get back before mum's out here looking for me."". Without waiting for their response, I dart backwards off of the small field of grass that we played in, in lieu of calling it a ""pitch"", and they nodded to me in acknowledgement. 

I navigate my way through a handful of narrow passages, alleyways, side streets, the lack of light scares me and my own thoughts of ""what if"" will me to sprint forwards, faster and faster, before the street suddenly stops and I find myself in the middle of a road, rather confused. I hear something in the distance, but, in my discombobulated state, I more worried with where I am and where to go than the noise, before I realize, the noise, it's definitely a car. The ground around my lights up with the headlights of an incoming vehicle. 

My brain jolts into action and I leap forward, into the safety of the pavement, I look back the driver of the vehicle, who is by now beeping his horn loudly, shouting angrily at me in the privacy of his own vehicle. I don't tell mother.

The days fly by, I get taller, I leave primary school and attend secondary, the normal mishmash of characters that were standard in my old school being replaced by a wider spread, girls, boys, some were geeky, some were sporty, some were assholes, some were quiet, although the assholes usually were my focus since they had the little habit of making my stay there hell. It feels suffocating, like everyone's out to get me, and they never relent. It feels like my friends tolerate me rather than respect me, it feels like I'm being avoided by everyone.

I become reclusive, interacting with other people less and less until I reach the point where it's minimal. My friends soon forget about me - my parents occasionally ask why I'm behaving as I do, but take no real interest. My teachers are clueless. The colour of the world begins to fade and I perceive my life as less of an experience and more of an onslaught. My rage, my tears, my wondering, my interests, my friends... all seem to belong to a person in a former life. All there is now to keep trudging forward in the vain hope that something ends it, or I collapse.

I march on, into my late teens. I go to college, doing some IT course. The people there are distant at first, but we're soon proven to be a good match. My old habits that I picked up die hard - I hear people talking about me when they're silent, I anticipate betrayal, I immediately get defensive, but nothing I fear comes to pass from these people. I dare say, I actually enjoyed them. I open up. I begin to feel for people again - a trickle at first, but, then, a floodgate is opened. Things I never remembered are here. I get crushes on people, I enjoy the company of people. Is this what it means to be alive?

There's something, holding me back, some element in the back of my head screaming at me that I'm making a mistake, that these people are waiting for you to let your guard down, that they'll reject you, that they're going to fill the role that I've mentally given them. I don't want to destroy this. This is tolerable. I stay closed, in my comfort zone.

The second year and the rosters of pupils change, although, the characters stay very much the same, different faces, but they're still likable, but in the sea of faces, there is one that demands my attention and I am powerless to resist. He's strange - strange enough for my assumptions for what people are like, to fall out of order. I've never met anything or anyone like him. Things about me that I felt that I felt confident about are now in question. Am I straight, or gay? What does he mean to me? Why do I feel like this? I know what a crush feels like, but this is something different. Out of his company it feels like I'm missing a component, in it, it feels like the sun is shining on me. How can this be correct? Everything I've known should be screaming at me to correct this - but it's silent. Just him and I.

Another year comes, but we stay in contact. Another sea of faces enter, but without that one shining star, it feels as empty as the void. Everything else seems lifeless and drab in comparison to when I'm with my love. My love? Is that what this is? Love? I have this one small spot of humanity that I can cling to. If he was able to make me feel like this, what else can I do?

The years blur together. I get a job in the local city as an IT Consultant, the only good outcome of 3 years forcing myself to get up in the morning.  We become closer, eventually moving in together. He's somewhat like I am, seeing the world as a lifeless march into the abyss, but comes to life when he's in my company. We have sex, the recoils and shivers of each other's bodies taking on a completely new meaning and delivering each other into new worlds of understanding. 

I understand, now. I am a man. The end result of a journey, tread barefoot on broken glass. I never knew the destination whilst I was on my march through hell, but, this is it. This might not be the summit of my achievements, but, the old pieces of myself are fitting together into a more complete whole and when I am ready, I can scale the mountain of achievements and stake my claim on the world.

I awake. The regular beeping of a heart rate monitor hammers into my head, my skull feeling like it's been broken into a thousand pieces - which, to be fair, might have been the case. A woman is sitting in a chair next to my bed, looking down at a magazine, dressed in a woolen jumper. The room is fairly small, dull and painted white with the only light being from the window somewhere above me. I dare not move my neck to see. 

I whisper aloud so that the woman might hear me, ""W-who ar.."", but I end my sentence prematurely. This voice isn't mine. It's far too.. young. My body sends waves of pain, pulsating with the beeping of the monitor. This isn't my body, it all feels.. incorrect. Like I've invaded someone's life. I would say this is a dream, but, I know that it's not.

She does a double take and brings her hands to her face, barely containing her gasp. ""H-honey!"" she's able to whisper through her shock, tears welling in her eyes, ""You're awake!""

I never dodged the car that night. It had hit me as I tried to dodge it, my skull impacting with the bonnet and then resting on the pavement for a distraught father of three to discover as he was coming home from a late shift, but what seems like a lifetime ago was only a week and a half. People surround me, relatives, I'm told, mother, father, uncle, auntie, grandparents, etcetera. Their faces blur together, none of them standing out to me. My world darkened, the light that shone on the world that my lover had brought me had proven itself to be false.

How amusing it would be, if I were an onlooker, to hear of a man who awoke from a dream to find himself in a nightmare? ",GrayCS

Unfortunately, the rest of my body refused to cooperate.

""C'mon, we've got a test this morning, we'll get it done and come back for long nap after""

I knew that I'd never have a long nap mid day, I'd probably be celebrating another successful test with Joram, but I've found lying to my body helpful in waking up.

""Let's go body, it's time to wake up"", I said outloud.

""��✋��☜✡?!""

huh? What the hell is that noise?

""��♓&amp;♏⍓�� ♓⧫��⬧ ⍓□◆❒ ❍□⧫♒♏❒�� ✋��❍ ❒♓♑♒⧫ ♒♏❒♏""

This time the strange voice activated my adrenal glands, and I sprung out of bed..

Except... I couldn't.. My muscles couldn't move and inch. I couldn't even move my eyelids.

""What the hell is going on here?""

I quickly realised this was not my bed, I had no idea where I was, fear and panic sunk in, and I forced my eyes open.

""AHHH!""

The pain from the brightness was almost unbearable.

""��♋■ ⬧□❍♏□■♏ p●♏♋⬧♏ ♑♏⧫ ♋ ♎□♍⧫□❒�� ❍⍓ ⬧□■ ♓⬧ ❍♋&amp;♓■♑ ■□♓⬧♏⬧ ♋■♎ ⧫⬥♓⧫♍♒♓■♑ ♒♓⬧ ♏⍓♏⬧✏""

There it was again, that strange noise.

Finally, my eyes begin to adjust to the brightness.

I was lying in what looks like a hospital bed, but so many things were wrong. The material under me felt like glass, but they moved around like silk sheets. I'd never touched something so incredible, so cool and smooth, yet so durable and light.

Finally, I noticed the frantic looking woman hovering over my bed.

""��□♍⧫□❒�� ♎□♍⧫□❒�� ♍□❍♏ ❑◆♓♍&amp;✏""

The noise was coming from her mouth... It was a language like I'd never heard before. Had I been abducted by aliens? This is just too weird!

""Who are you? What am I doing here?""

A man wearing a uniform walked in. Was he the alien leader?

He started shining what looked like lasers into my eyes. I prepared for overwhelming brightness, but to my surprise the experience was quite benign.

""��□■�� ♎□ ⍓□◆ &amp;■□⬥ ⬥♒♏❒♏ ⍓□◆ ♋❒♏✍""

The man in uniform started yelling at me. I could barely move, I was in such a paniced state, I threw up and then passed out.

----------------------------------------------------------------

I jumped out of bed, it was my house again, I was sweating profusely. I could still kind of hear that strange alien language in my ear. I went to the bathroom and splashed water onto my face.

""You up already?""

It was Joram.

I was about to tell him the insane dream I just had, but I hesitated. It was only a dream.

""Yeah, I didn't sleep well""

Joram nodded

""Me either, you want to head down to Hall B together?"" 

""Hall B?""

""Did you forget? We have a test this morning""

That's right, I had forgotten.

""psych, I'm just kidding. Yeah let's do it, we can quiz each other on the way."" 

""Word, I'll be ready in 10""

Life was progressing, I could put that strange dream behind me.

His vernacular and expression certainly showed evidence of maturity, but we knew that he could not possibly be 30. His physical examinations show him to be very clearly pre-pubescent, and the MRI scans will come back soon, verifying his age. Must just be well spoken.

[WP] You open your eyes to a hospital room full of people you don't recognize. You've just been informed that you're 10 years old and you've been in a coma. The life you lived was a dream. All 20 years of it.,aawwwwwweshit,"""I assure you doctor, it was not a dream,"" said the kid before me. He was a child of 10 years, suffered a coma last year and had just woken up. The first thing he did in his wake was ask where he was, what time it was, and so forth. We told him and he listened calmly. I find that interesting, his calm. For a ten year old boy in his situation you'd expect a variety of emotions, but never calm.

He then told us an amusing story. It was a story of his life, he claimed, his life before he woke up in his bed here. He said he was a soldier in his youth and turned scholar in his adulthood. It was a funny little story, the nurse who monitored him couldn't keep her chuckle from coming out. His mother just looked confused, her relief earlier had taken full control of her comprehension, so when her child started telling his story, she couldn't help but worry. His little sister was listening to him intently, absorbed at her brother's story once he told her she grew up piloting a plane. The father just arrived and was glad at his son's awakening, obviously lost at the conversation when I told his son that his story was just a product of his mind.

""Tell more, tell more!"" the little sister said excitedly. She's an energetic little girl, two years younger than his brother, raven-haired inherited from her mother who told her to behave.

""Doctor, is something wrong with my child?"" the mother said, the bags under her eyes darkened at the prospect. She was a caring mother, always by her child's side when he was asleep.

""I'm doing fine, mom,"" the kid said with a tinge of jest. ""In fact, I'm great. I missed you and father, very much so,"" he said with a saddened smile.

""Oh baby,"" she clasped at him and the kid welcomed her caring smother. ""I missed you too.""

""Me too!"" joined the baby sister, and the father a second later. It was a happy family reunion, the entirety of the room warmed at the scene.

When the embracing ended, I approached him and gave him a comforting smile. I decided it would be for the best to make him see it was all a dream. He sighed when I did. It was odd, it felt like I saw an old man when he looked down tiredly.

""If that was a dream, it was not a very good dream,"" he said.  

""Did you have a nightmare?"" asked the father. He has brown hair, the same as his son.

""Yes dad, I just hope it's over,"" he told his father with the same saddened smile he gave her mother.

""I'll lend you my teddy bear later, he keeps the bad dreams away!"" exclaimed the little sister.

""That would be nice,"" the kid smiled and patted the little girl's head.

""Ma'am, I think it would be good for your child to talk to a therapist. I know of an expert in child psychology, maybe he could help,"" I said to the mother. 

I was starting to get worried at the child's unusual behavior. He was mature for his age, and that wasn't a bad thing, but her mother once described her son to be brash and wild. Could a coma cause this much change in his personality? And there's his dream to think about. If he persists it to be true, then he could be displaying some sort of mental illness.

""Doctor, I heard China is a good place to go this year,"" said the kid suddenly.

""Huh? Uh yes, I'm going on a trip there... where did you hear that?"" I asked incredulously.

""I didn't, I just woke up, remember?"" he flashed a grin, but it faded as quick. ""Say hi for me when you meet a girl named Lisa. Don't if you won't, I'm not sure how all of this works anyway. Is it straight or constantly in flux, I wonder,"" he then got out of his bed. He had a little trouble, but he made sure to absolve the worries of his family by planting his foot firmly on the ground. ""Bathroom,"" he whistled as he went.

He was out of the hospital a week later, and so came my trip. I was staring off into space until a girl who looks completely out of place appeared in my line of vision. She has long curly hair dyed in red. An outsider in this country just like me, and she was attractive in every sense of the word so I couldn't stop my legs from approaching her.

""Hi my name's John, I'm a doctor,"" I said quite stupidly. I then hope that I said that awkwardly enough that she didn't find it condescending.

""Oh, hello John... the doctor,"" she said in an amused tone. ""Should I call you Dr. John."" 

""Please, no, just John would be nice,"" I chuckled. Guess it works.

""Well, nice to meet you John. I'm Lisa the unemployed, though I prefer the term adventurer.""

""Should I call you Lisa the explorer?"" I asked in a jest before a realization dawned on me.

""Yes please,"" she laughed.

""I know this is out of there, but do you know a ten-year old who just woke up from a coma, he's mature for his age but kind of a smartass,"" I said in haste. Is this all a trick?

""Huh no, s-should I?""

""No, no,"" I shook my head. Ugh whatever, that brat and his ominous sayings, there's plenty of time to think later. ""He's a patient of mine, he told me to say hi to someone named Lisa.""

""If that's a pick-up line, I must say I'm impressed at your creativity, Dr. John,"" she smiled and I notice the freckles around her nose, complementing her beauty.

""What can I say?"" I guess the kid's a wingman.

All 20 years of it.,aawwwwwweshit,"Ah fuck. I guess you kind of always know it though, right? There is always this sneaking suspicion that it has all been made up. I mean, was I really to expect that all of that was ""real""?

To say it was illogical would be an understatement. None of it made any sense, at least I can understand this. Now that I'm living in this world for a few moments it's actually all starting to make a little bit of sense.

You won't even believe what that other world is like. It's preposterous, absolutely ridiculous.

I can't explain how happy I am to wake up. You don't even know what it's like to live that long in a universe entirely created by your mind. Crazy. What is everything like here though? I'll go into my dreams later but now I want to figure out what is going on here. I see that my dreams had the colors a bit off but now I'm interested in the dynamics of what's going on?

Is everyone happy? Are their poor people? What is the disease like? Is there any honesty? I guess I better calm down but there are just so many things to know.

To answer your question, I guess the craziest thing about my world is the sense of mystery that comes with knowing, at least at the deepest most subconscious level, that everything is really you. When I'm here I can see the difference, but back their I really knew, really knew, that everything all along was just me talking to me. ",Averybradleyy

All 20 years of it.,aawwwwwweshit,"My name is Travis Bigsby, and I am in the fourth grade. My teacher’s name is Mrs. Hayworth, and she is very nice. My two best friends in the whole world are Sheldon Gordon and Robbie Clay, and the name of our secret club is STaR (that’s because our first names start with S, T, and R, duh!). My mom’s name is Mary and my dad’s name is Bill, my dog’s name is Rocket, and tomorrow will be my thirtieth birthday.

Thirtieth birthday, that’s crazy! You might think. Impossible! But it’s true! I know you want to ask, how?! Well...

My mom’s name is Mary (I wrote that already, duh!). She plays the violin, and she’s really good. She plays for the Chicago Simply Orchestra (I told you she’s really good!). Anyway, when I was little, she would play the violin every night before I went to sleep. Me and my dad would go to her concerts, and she was really great. Sometimes I would even see people crying when my mom would play, and even sometimes I would feel like crying (I didn’t though, I’m not a baby, ha!).

Then when I was eight, my mom got really sick. I mean, really, really sick. She lost her hair and she couldn’t even play the violin anymore. That made me really sad. By the time I was nine years old, she was living in the hospital. She didn’t even live with us anymore! Dad said it was because she needed to be with the doctors, who were going to make her all better again. But if I have to be honest, I was really scared because Robbie’s mom got really sick when he was seven, and then she… died! I didn’t want that to happen to my mom!

I started getting really scared, and one time I even cried in the classroom (it was an accident, and honestly I didn’t even cry that much!). I was really embarrassed, but Mrs. Hayworth took me by the hand into the hallway and told me that even when it seems like things are really bad, things always work out for the best in the end, and that miracles really do happen. She was really nice about it. After that, she would always give me treats or let me play games when I got sad, and it did make me feel better. I even started feeling good again sometimes. Maybe things would work out for the best after all!

But then something even scarier happened. I get goosebumps even thinking about it, even though it was so long ago! You see, the day before my tenth birthday, Principal O’Connor and my dad showed up in the classroom without any warning. They both looked white as ghosts, and I knew this was going to be bad! I started crying (I couldn’t help it!), and some of the other kids started crying too, and my dad took my hand and we ran to his car.

He was shaking! And crying! And I was crying too, and I started thinking about Robbie’s mom and how things were always supposed to work out for the best in the end but if they did then why God would let Robbie’s mom die and then I thought about my mom playing for the orchestra, and how she made people cry because she played such beautiful music, and I just wanted to be a little kid again, and I thought about falling asleep at night as she played all those lovely songs, and then all I could hear was her playing the violin, and this must have made me fall asleep because everything went black.

Then…

I woke up in the hospital and… it was my mom! And she was OK! And she had her hair back! I couldn’t believe it!!!!! I was so happy I might have cried a little bit and she started hugging me, and then I saw that my dad was there, and Mrs. Hayworth, and Sheldon and Gordon of course. I was embarrassed but I was so happy I didn’t even care!

But... and this is the hardest part to believe, but... that’s not even the biggest miracle. You see, I told you it was the day before my tenth birthday. Well, I turned ten alright… and then… and then…

Yikes! I don’t even know how to explain it! Well here goes, whether you believe it or not! You see, I was ten, right? And then the next year... I was ten! And the year after that, I was still ten!!! And my mom never got sick again, and every day me and Sheldon and Robbie would play outside, and it never rained, unless we wanted it to, and it even snowed, when we wanted it to, and dad even got me a dog (FINALLY!), and, if you would believe it, each day was even better than the last! It was a true MIRACLE!

So that’s it! Tomorrow’s going to be my thirtieth birthday, and I really, really, really can’t wait. Mom says she’s planned a birthday party with all my friends (and of course Sheldon and Robbie, duh!), and that she even has a big surprise in store but she won’t tell me about it until tomorrow. Agh! It’s so frustrating not knowing what it is! But I can’t wait to wake up tomorrow! Because whatever the surprise is, I know that tomorrow is going to be another wonderful, beautiful, spectacular, splendiferous, magnificent, miraculous day!",slimpotatoes

You know when you wake up from a dream and it fades away. In like five minutes. All that remains are figments, an afterimage, a mirage. You enjoy it while you can but it's no big deal, right guys. Well, I was in coma when I was young. I don't really remembered all the stuff that I did. I did not fret over it. I mean I was just another carefree child with just this *accident* and some dream which I couldn't remember and did not give a shit about. Besides my parents were rich and I was an only child. I was king of the world, my world. I built a life, a peaceful and content life, with a beautiful wife and two beautiful kids. Jemma and Will. I have my own practice.

It happened six months ago. The dreams. See I had this person ... um, inside me. He is a middle-aged pscychopath and a serial killer. He was born in my dreams a long time ago but recently he has awoken again. Because of my absolute, terrible love for my family, especially my kids. He senses it- my love for my family. He enjoys it. You see he has never been inside a person's mind. All the people he had killed had been ... well just people. But me, I am different. He enjoys making me dream these absolutely horrible dreams, dreams I don't wanna think about, dreams I can't escape from. When I squirm, he laughs. In my head. He  has become too strong for me. I can see it. He is just toying with me, enjoying his food. I can't take it anymore. There are a young mother and her six months old daughter in the lobby. Whenever I tried to tell others or get help or kill myself, he comes over me and that's it. He can sense it. Threat to his existence.

But maybe I could lure him with his obsession for hurt, his lust for the blood. I have to try it. I have to to, I have to, I have  ..to

Ever since she was six she didn't like them. The first time she'd gone there was after Grandpa had had a stroke, and even at six years old she had felt the utter terror of what was possibly going to happen. Now, her eyes adjusting to the light, blinding light, and the sight of doctors around her, she was already terrified. And confused. One moment...one moment she'd been in that basement, a basement that looked vastly different from the basement she'd had now, where the cats stayed. There had been a dog -- a very sweet, gentle dog for other-Lissa, a dog that kept her company as she continued typing on that strange, compact device. As she looked sad, and so burdened, and Lissa knew it had something to do with Memory and Understanding.

""Lissa!"" Her mother's voice. ""Lissa, thank God; you scared the life out of me!""

Other-Lissa had been scared of Mommy for some reason. Even the idea of Lissa being scared of Mommy was strange. Mommy had always looked out for her, always been there for her when she needed her. She encouraged her skill in writing, she took her seriously and defended her to the teachers, even if Lissa knew she Deserved the various bits of yelling she got from them. She was Bad, always had been Bad, actually. Different. Mommy didn't care, however. Mommy treated her like she was gifted, all but perfect, and though Lissa doubted she could entirely believe it herself, she felt reassured just a moment for it. 

Mommy wouldn't do anything to hurt her, would she? Lissa couldn't picture it. Other-Lissa hadn't heard her. She'd been afraid, confused. Worried. And it hurt to watch. She had never found the Harry Potter books an easy read -- even reading about Harry's relatives hurting him had always, always been too hard to read. Other-Lissa had been writing stories about that, hadn't she? About something called Star Wars too. Lissa couldn't see how that could possibly be her, actually. Star Wars? Even watching it with Billy, she had been scared by the aliens and the moments of people losing limbs. And Vader -- Billy had once said that his breathing sounded like a Dementor. There'd been another bad guy like Vader, but he'd been lonely. Vader had apparently been lonely too. They were Bad, but it wasn't right to be lonely. 

""What happened to me?""

Mommy was quiet for a moment. Then, ""Well...you fell off the jungle gym.""

""I did? Oh..."" The last thing she remembered was being at the top of the jungle gym, arms extended, doing an imitation of that part in one of the Anastasia Krupnik books where Anastasia did the same thing. ""I wasn't badly hurt, was I?""

""You were lucky,"" said one of the doctors. ""A teacher found you and called an ambulance. The fall knocked you out, but you're all right."" A smile from him, a smile that Lissa liked in spite of herself. ""You've got a tough head, kiddo.""

Lissa giggled in spite of herself. Then, ""Mommy...you aren't mad at me, are you?""

""Lissa. Honestly, you scared the life out of me. Going up there -- it's a miracle that you're still here, actually.""

""I'm sorry, Mommy -- ''

""It's all right. We'll...we'll talk about this when we get home. I'm just glad you're all right. That's what matters, sweetheart."" A warm, broad smile that comforted Lissa, reminded her that Mommy...Mommy would never do anything to hurt her. Never, never. 

Should she tell Mommy? About what she saw, everything that seemed so real? Things like the pink butterfly girl and the strange new pieces of technology, and plenty more. 

But then again, it was all just a bad dream, wasn't it? Like the ones about the dinosaurs, and other stuff that came from what Lissa read (but she hadn't read about any of this, had she?), and what she wrote about. Maybe in time she could go home after this and everything would be normal. And perhaps she could write about that other Lissa. A girl named Alison. Perhaps instead of a house in 2016 she could live in a castle, a beautiful castle where she could see the sky. She'd be fighting dragons and saving others, and getting the happy ending that she deserved. Lissa had always been good at writing. At coming up with tales. And this...this was no exception. She could write about Alison, and what she went through, because you could make a story out of anything. 

She could. She could...",ladyrevan21

All 20 years of it.,aawwwwwweshit,"you look around, realizing you are 10, in a hospital, surrounded by family, and still retaining all the memories of your dreams.  On your drive home, you realize the ability of future experiences gives you a major life advantage, so your 10 year old body shakes with excitement.  However, things are different.  Due to this coma, your family didnt move to the other town as your remember.  Due to this coma, you didnt go to the other school, and your parents didnt change jobs.  'No matter' you think, you'll make it right.

When you are being tucked onto the couch at home, you're surrounded by familiar objects of your childhood.  Everyone is happy to see you out and awake, but then you take a glance at the tv and see 'you' walking into that new school, the same school you remember in your dreams.  In a panic, you go to the washroom, and face yourself in the mirror, seeing an ever so slightly different person.  Something is off, but in your 10 year old confusion, you decide to figure it out later.

The next morning, you wake up, your dreams being like old memories.  You remember the family you had, your SO, your kids.  As it turns out, your family goes to the school grounds to attend the opening ceremony, that your relatives invited you to attend, out of town.  Then another startling scene happens.  That other 'you' is sitting beside your SO, your childhood sweetheart that is part of your happy family in your dreams.  Both are sitting a few rows down, oblivious to their surroundings.

You begin to cry uncontrollably.  The ride back home is nothing but crying.  You curse the coma, as it was responsible for altering the future in an unusual way.  You run to your bed and cry yourself to sleep.

The next morning, the dreams are but a hazy distant memory.  You forgot why you were crying, and begin to go about your 10year old ways.",MeatCurtainRod

All 20 years of it.,aawwwwwweshit,"We were always meant to be together, Jon's mother said so before the fever took her work worn body to heaven. Our lives started together, his black hair, the fierce gaze with a lopsided grin when we were five, the awkward way he walked when we were thirteen. Jon was my whole life. He did not ask my father for my hand, he said he needed to find his fortune first.  I looked at the ocean long and hard. He promised, my mind said over and over again. He will come back. The memories so sharp and real I could smell him, a warm earthy, like the air after the rain. I eyes close my eyes and feel the texture of his leather jerkin, the smoothness of his skin as he lay next to my naked body. I still felt him fill my body. I feel the tears slowly slide down my face while my eyes are closed in remembrance. The helpless memories faded and I gather my woolen cape tighter around my shoulders. The wool my mother spun and dyed a beautiful indigo blue just so I could feel somehow pretty. Living in the new world is hard and only the toughest survive, but, we are learning how to live more, and survive less. There is to be a barn raising in a fortnight, maybe even a dance afterwards. Quickly, my heart dives to my stomach, Jon will not be attending. His ship has left port not an hour past. I will be quite alone. I hurry home. I know the large amount of work to be done. Father asked where I was gone to, walking seemed the best answer. Father does not approve of Jon, seaman are not respectable. The next few weeks go by in slow motion, work, day and night. One day, I cannot eat the porridge mother sets in front of me, I dash outside and relieve my stomach of its contents in the yard. Feeling weak and tired, I slowly go back inside. Suddenly, I realize, its been a full month since Jon's ship has sailed. Three months, four. Mother knows. I have a beautiful baby boy. He has Jon's strong jaw and his fierce gaze, but fathers brown eyes. Its been three years. William has grown. Five years past. I strain my eyes, I know Jon is coming, I can feel it. Bending over William, watching him draw a picture in the dirt, I suddenly feel someone staring. I turn, Jon is staring at William, my heart is in my eyes the desperate searing love cannot stop itself. I then focus on where he has his arm draped around the most beautiful woman I had ever laid eyes on. Anna, I would like to introduce you to my wife, Josaphine. My world spun out of control. Everything went white. I hear the beeping before I fully come awake. It is a strange sound. The smells are sharp, it burns my nose. I slowly ease my eyes open, mother is right there, holding my hand. She's always there. Her kind blue eyes are younger, not so tired. I can tell she's worried. I quietly beg her to tell me if William is OK and please, did she tell Jon who he was? Her confusion unsettles me, she says she needs to go get father. Then, I start looking around me. Shiny cold metel bed, white cloth that is so soft on it, blinking lights that don't burn. I jump out of bed to find my legs do not want to obey me. I collapse to the floor, a silent scream is strangled in my throat. William! Where is William! I frantically pull myself off the floor and find a smaller room with strange bowl of water filling it. I turn, and in the smoothest glass I had ever seen, I see a white faced little girl with flaming red hair, she looks terrified. I put my hand to my mouth so does she. I look down at my hand, its small like the girl in the glass. I slowly sink to the white shiny floor. I don't understand. Where am I? What is happening, that girl looks like me a very long time ago. I can't breath. My mother finds me mumbling about William. My heart rips inside me. The doctor comes in and asks me questions I do not know how to answer. I keep my words. They would think that m bewitched if I told them. I cannot keep track of time, mother tells me, she talks to me even though I cannot answer her. Father hugs me and calls me ""little bit"" as he has always done. Finally, mother says its time to go home. I do not  think we are truly going home. I'm put into a metel chair with wheels, and a cheerful lady pushes me to a box that opens without anyone touching it. We get out of the box, mother is waiting with father next to a carriage without a horse. By now, I've learned only to obey and not try and ask questions no one can answer anyways. Things are going by to fast, I can't see anything. The carriage slows down, I'm dizzy and tired. Father opens the door and picks me up, takes me into the house. There is a banner that reads ""welcome home Anna!"" And right beneath it is standing Jon, grinning his lopsided grin welcoming me home.",Ceruleanqueen

All 20 years of it.,aawwwwwweshit,"When my vision went from black to colors, I finally saw the people around me. 
	Tall and short, fat and skinny, black and white and red and yellow- it was as if every possible variety of human had been thrown into one room and given the same clothes, the same uniform, white and sterile and unfriendly. They were arrayed in a semi-circle, clutching sharp tools and needles, bloodied doctor’s masks wrapped about their faces. They were still, silent, as unmoving as the stones and as expressionless as the trees. 
“Hello?” I asked, a realized that I was unarmed, half naked, and in someone else’s bed. 
So I decided to forgo any more pleasantries. 
“What the fuck?”
“This may be a little hard to take, Mr. Device,” said one of them, and her voice was a nurse’s voice: smooth and soft and pacifying. “But your memory is a lie.”
I tried to sit up, but pain frayed the edges of my vision, and I collapsed weak and sweating back onto the white sheets. 
“The decision was made not to restrain you physically,” another doctor said, “as a result of your past… experiences.”
“Experiences- what do you mean, my memory is a lie?” They had worked my temper up a bit, or rather, I had... because confusion was the enemy of progress, and progress was my best friend.
	A white light flared into life, crisp and clean, throwing little waves of luminescence off the bed sheets. 
“Look. I may not have much money, but I have friends. Friends who don’t bother with little things like ‘rules’ or ‘laws’ or morality. So someone here had better tell me what’s going on, or said friends will take offence: I call them mister fist and mister foot, and they get all funny when they’re introduced to mister bone.”
One of the doctors raised an eyebrow. “Elaborate. But, Mister Device, we are your friends. And we very much doubt that someone in your physical condition could pose much of a threat to your comrades. Physically speaking, that is.”
“Have you seen me?” I managed a weak chuckle. “I spent years training with people who make Bruce Lee look like Barbie.”
“See yourself, Mister Device. We very much doubt you did.”
	I looked down at myself, past a scrawny chest and belly, past a set of thighs that look like they had never supported any weight in their life. My feet were small and skinny, not the reassuring broadness I was used to. Also, I was white. 
Wait a second. 
I was white?
“What the hell did you do to me?”
They glanced at one another. Then nurse-voice stepped up again and began to speak, and for lack of a better option I began to listen. 
“You volunteered, Mister Device.”
“That’s not my name.”
“Doctor Anthony Device, PhD in Advanced Cognitive Transference. You were a subject in your own experiment. Engineered to send you to the past by swapping your mind with the mind of another.”
	New memories began to form, or perhaps they were old, memories of skyscrapers that towered impossibly high, cars that didn’t need wheels or a road. A family, lost by time, eroded by memory, a handful of friends. A girlfriend. All coming back to me, like birds returning to their summer home after a long and biting winter. 
“You switched places with a man who fought in a war two hundred years ago. The mind that inhabited your body gained your memories, your impulses, your sense of self-identity, and your way of thinking: and then we put that mind into a comma, until your original one could come back.”
	War. Yes, I remembered that. But it was like memories of a movie, a film, an external happening, not something personal. Blood, screams, bullets, gunfire. The harsh roar of planes and the hissing as metal cut through the jungle, the wet and the heat and the misery. 
The death. 
“I died. The person I inhabited,” I said, and realized how hard it was to say it, “died.”
“Exactly. And that is why you woke up. Back in your body. Your real body, with your real memories. Twenty years of memories are all a lie, I am afraid. But the rest, you will find, are utterly true.”
I was silent for a moment. “Why should I believe you?”
“Because we don’t have to explain all of this. Gradually, you would have come to the same conclusion. We just sped up the process.”
“Oh. So, assuming I do believe you… now what happens?”
Again, they glanced at one another, as if uncertain as to how to proceed. 
“Up to you, Doctor. Though we are obligated to tell you something.”
“Yes?”
One of them stepped a few paces until she was standing over me, hair dangling down to tickle at my face.
“The war you fought in was called the Vietnam War, and it ended in the loss of countless lives. In five minutes, that war will have never existed. Neither will you.”
“What?”
“You died trying to protect a child, gunned down by a friend who thought you were an enemy. The way you fell was broadcasted internationally over thousands upon thousands of screens. The backlash against the warring forces was enough to end the war prematurely- a full six months before it would have.
“Temporal Theorists predict that this resulted in an alternate timeline being formed, the one that we currently inhabit- a one where your work, your existence, is unnecessary. We are not real, Doctor, just messages sent from the future. Cognitive beings who nonetheless have no ability to influence the world around them by physical action.”
As she said that, I realized I could no longer feel her hair against my face. An echo of it, like a memory, was the only thing that remained.
“You have five minutes in which your existence is protected by ours- as long as there are some who know of you, who know of your presence, you will continue to exist. If no one knows you are there, you will simply wink out of existence. Time will no longer have to account for your existence.
“So it’s up to you, Doctor. What do you want to do with the last five minutes of your life?”
I took a deep breath, and thought for a little bit.
“Do you have e-mail?”
She blinked.
“No. We have no need for one.”
“Well, get me some form of pseudo-instant messaging that I can access. Preferably video. We have work to do.”
“And that work, Doctor?”
“Making sure the world knows I exist.”

Throughout my life, I had always looked on the darkest side of things, worst yet, always treating others badly, day in, day out, I spent my evenings at the coffee shop near my house, chatting away rudely at passergoers, giving a glazed look at anyone I see. Everyone there told me how pessimistic I was, saying I was a downer, saying I wasn't a happy person, the unfortunate part was that they were right. But, the only one who defended me was the nice lady, the cashier, who always sat down and took the burden of talking to me, her hair complimented the sun, and a smile that showed her patience, as years past we grew close together, and soon, we were both ready for engagement.

I stood on one knee, about to propose to my beloved, the perfect one that had turned my life around, the one that taught me that cruelty and grief was not the only things in life, the one that I could express my feelings to the most in my endeavors.


I look and gaze upon her, her nice brown hair, and her adventurous smile showed to me that she was ready for anything, this was it...


""Will you marry--""

My vision whitened...

I looked upon the hospital bed, at a loss of words for this sudden transition, looking below me, I inspect my hands. They were like a child's hands, I looked at the doctor before me and asked who I was, he replied with my exact name, I asked him of my gender, he replied, expectedly, to my gender. I asked him my age...


""10"", he said aloud, saying it as if it was completely normal.


""10?"" I said, shocked, then, I jumped, realizing my voice had been altered. The doctor stood before me in confusion, and confirmed. I was baffled, I looked at my reflection in the window, and lo and behold, there I was, 10 years old.

I realized, my bitterness had started at this age, what was this? I asked the doctor how I got here, and the doctor replied:  ""You had fallen into a coma, it has been 16 weeks, you'll be fine to leave here in a week"".

I sat there, frozen, I didn't recognize a single person in this room, they weren't my family... they couldn't have been, I asked them their names, ages, everything, all of them I couldn't recognize, sparing my last name.

as I spent my week in this hospital, I realized that I simply couldn't get an explanation, maybe it was really all a dream, what could have been my future.

I realized then, what I must do. this is a sign, that maybe I should have done things better, maybe have looked..brighter on situations, and possibly have given more respect, then to have burdened someone else, I then settled it, I began my mission in life, setting out to look on the brighter side of things, giving respect to even the rudest.

In the end, this life was better, except for one thing.

16 years later, age 26.

This would have been 5 years prior I would have met my beloved, I watched outside my window at the horizon, thinking about where she had been all this time. Was she wiped from existence like my old family, having replaced by a new family? I looked onward, and decided to pay the coffee shop one last visit.

Alas, as I entered, she wasn't present, completely new people occupied spaces in which I expected old returning peers to be. I stood there in a state of fsadness, maybe it wasn't meant to be?

I got in my car, and drove off... Was my mission worth it..?",sirmentio

All 20 years of it.,aawwwwwweshit,"The last thing I remember, I was house sitting for a friend in Pasadena. I'd invited an old girlfriend over. She'd lost her last job and was (with the kind of frustration only a 29 year old can feel) back at her parent's for a spell. Me? I was kind of glad to not be with a roommate for a weekend. We hadn't seen each other in about two or three years and it was a lucky match on Tinder that we found each other and spent a lazy Saturday having 'let's feel good and pay for it later' sex in a house neither of us owned. We had fallen asleep. Deeply satisfied.

I awoke to a strange stiffness in my body. Like it was some kind of bizarre rigor mortis. There was a beeping and the light and doctor hovering over me.

""Billy?"" he said, ""can you hear me.

I turned over to a nurse. He looked straight at me, then opened up this brick of a cell phone and made a call.

""What?"" my voice felt rusty. It felt rusty and it felt high.

""Billy,"" he said, ""My name is Doctor Zeiber. You've been a sleep for a long time.""

""No one calls me 'Billy',"" I said. I'd gone by my middle name, Duke, since I was nineteen. Not even my mom Called me Billy. She called me William.

""Billy,"" he said, ""do you know where you are right now? What's the last thing your remember? The accident?""

""Accident?!"" I said struggling to sit up, finding my muscles week, ""I was at Ray's house in Pasadena with Sonya.""

""Who's Sonya?"" he said.

""Sonya Mac Stone,"" I said, ""From USC. We met that first year I tried law school.""

The nurse looked at me confused. As did the Doctor.

""Billy,"" he said with patience, ""What year is it?""

""2016,"" I gulped. I looked at my small, hairless arms. Where was my tattoo? Why do I look like I kid? Why is the nurse talking on an ancient brick cell phone?

****

It is 1996 and I am ten years old. I am awash with a sudden feelings of nostalgia as I watch the old tube TV and see Soundgarden interviewed on TV. I flip to a rerun of legends of the HIdden Temple and try to remember what the last thing I remember in the real world. In the last two days, I have learned a lot. There is no Obama. There is no Tea Party. The is no such thing as social networking and there is no internet. There is no war on terror, no brexit, no debt crisis, no homeless people in the ruins of Chicago.

Granted there is also no Sonja. There isn't an old group of college buddies for me to call up. There is also no work for me at an Apple Store in a place called the Glendale Galleria. I mean, there isn't even any pubic hair just yet.

So what's going on?

I can't remember a single thing before the comma. Not a single thing in this so called real world right now. But What I can remember is growing up in Rancho Cucamonga, getting decent enough grades, and getting into UC Riverside. Why the hell did I go to UC Riverside? I remember getting through high school and college in the worst damn decade the United States had ever seen. I remember cringing every time I had to pay back my loans for it.

But that's not quite real. It's like it disappeared. I'd imagined all my friends and romances and all that. I cried a bit. I don't mind admitting that I cried. Except now somethings different. You see, I realized I'm a ten year old kid with all the mental ability, knowledge, experience, and maturity of a thirty year old. I also remember how much that thirty year old regretting things.

When I was twelve years old, I remember Donnie Nubucker said he could help make him some money. All I had to do was take little brown bag to an apartment on my bike and say ""East Los sends its regards"" and they'd give me money.

If I see Donnie Nubucker again in this life? I'm going to him to fuck himself.",Jin-roh

I must be dreaming. I have to be dreaming. Shit, how many drinks had I had last night at Julie and Ben’s party? I remember two glasses of wine, that ungodly sweet red that they were serving, and…oh yeah. The tequila came out after most of the other guests had left and it was just the old gang standing around in the kitchen.  Why did I always do this to myself on a weeknight? 

“OLIVIA!” What the hell? I start to blink my eyes open, just as I realize that my chest feels like it has about a hundred pounds of Dexter on it. 

We’re staring at each other. I wait a moment, listening to the quiet house to make sure no one really is calling my name. 

“Hi buddy, you need to go outside?” I reach up to give his head a pat, but he’s staring so intently at me, it’s a little alarming.

“No, but we need to talk” he replies.

I start to laugh. That settles it, I’m dreaming. Tequila always did give me weird-

“Olivia, come on. I’m sorry to freak you out, but you’ve got to be an adult right now and listen to me.”

“Dexter…what the hell is going on, Dexter? You’re talking. Dog’s don’t talk.”

As I begin sit up on the bed, he removes his big furry black paws from my chest and sits down next to me. I am looking at my six year old black lab, sweet dumb Dexter, who I have had since he was a puppy, and I have no idea what to make of this new oddity. He’s staring back at me with those giant brown eyes, and I can just tell that he’s patiently waiting for me to grasp the situation.

“I’m sorry, Olivia. We’re not allowed to talk to people.  I really don’t have any time to explain, but I have to go, Olivia. I just wanted to say thank you for everything. I’m really going to miss you, but I have to go now.”

My head is beginning to throb. It’s a slow rhythm, womp, womp, womp. Like when you have a flat tire, but you keep driving on it until you can find a safe spot on the road to pull over. What the hell is even going on here? 

“Dexter, what are you talking about? What do you mean you have to leave? What do you mean you’re not allowed to talk to people?” 

“It’s a long story, O, but I have to get going. They’re coming soon.” He’s looking at me like I’m pathetic. Can dogs even make that face? This is the strangest thing. Does he…pity me?

He starts out of the room, and I get up in a hurry, slipping into my house shoes and throwing on my robe, as I’m running to catch up to him. I rush down the stairs, and into the kitchen just in time to see his tail disappear through the dog door into the back yard. I throw the door open and he pauses and looks back at me.  “Take care, Olivia, and thank you for everything.”

I look skyward and see what seems like a million silver spaceships hovering in the sky above town. There’s so many of them, where did they come from? I start to back into the house slowly. I almost trip on the threshold as I step up into the kitchen in a panic. I close the door and peek through the blinds, just as it seems to get a thousand times brighter outside. 

Just as the light fades back to normal, I see that the spot on the grass where Dexter had been sitting was now empty.  I hear a little voice behind me. “Is it the end of the world?” 

I turn around to see who had spoken, but all I see is my tabby cat, Jericho, standing a few feet behind me on the kitchen counter.

That settles it, I must be dreaming.

With a grunt, I manage to topple him off my chest, and he flops down next to me on the bed.

""Well?"" I raise an eyebrow.

For a moment, he thinks in silence. You can tell when he's thinking hard about what to say - he does that funny thing with his muzzle that's halfway between a frown and a pant.

""It's about Coco."" He finally blurts out.

""What?""

""Y'know, Coco, she lives next door and-""

""Yeah, I know who Coco is."" I interrupt. ""But what does she have to do with anything?""

It takes him another long while to come up with an answer, lying there on the pillow.

""Well..."" He began uncertainly. ""It's been a long time since Jessie moved away - like almost a year now, yeah? And, well, Jessie was a pretty big part of my life, but you know what? I figured it's past time that I moved on. As for Coco - well I guess I never really talked much with her, but we've always been friends. And recently, I... I guess I-""

""Woah boy, hold up there a sec."" I cut in, suddenly alert. ""Are you trying to tell me that... that you have *feelings* for Coco?""

""Well..."" He looked away in embarrassment. ""Yeah, I guess.""

There was a second of silence as my sleepy brain registered this information, then suddenly - I broke out in uproarious laughter.

""Oh- Oh boy, Chief."" I giggled, trying and failing to contain myself. ""Really? You- She-""

And then I dissolved into another laughing fit.

""Well you didn't have to respond like that."" Chief groused, hurt by my sudden outburst.

""I- I'm sorry."" I chuckled, wiping the tears from my eyes as my laughter subsided. ""I'm not t-trying to be mean, it's just... she's a cat! She's a cat, Chief!""

""I know."" He sighed sadly, as he stood up and began to pace the bed. ""She's a cat. She's a *beautiful* cat too - her fur! It's so soft and shiny, and the way she curls her tail when she sits... Just the whole way she carries herself, she's absolutely... absolutely *stunning*.""

Chief sighed again, gazing dreamily out the window.

""And I'm- I'm a dog."" With that, his voice broke, just the tiniest bit, and for a moment he sounded so, hopelessly sad. ""I'm a dog, and I'm not even any special dog. I'm your garden-variety golden retriever. Heck, I could be replaced tomorrow by a stray from off the streets and nobody would even notice!""

""Hey now, don't say that."" I comforted, leaning forward to hug him. ""You know that's not true. You're not 'garden-variety'. You're special, and you're *my* friend. No matter how many other dogs there are in the entire world, not one of them could ever replace you.""

He lifted his head and looked at me, pondering my words, then, with a smile, gave my face a long, slobbery lick. 

""You always know what to say to cheer me up."" He panted, as his tail began thumping against my thigh in its wagging.

""As for Coco - have you asked her out yet?""

Chief looked down at his paws shyly.

""No...""

""Well then, you know what to do."" I yawned, satisfied, as I threw back the covers and rolled out of bed. ""For the moment though...""

Fumbling around on the floor, I managed to grab hold of his leash and held it up in my hand.

"[wp] Half of earth's population can read the rest of the population's thoughts, however, you've decided to keep your ability hidden from everyone.",flow_like_poe,"I did what everyone does in a waiting room: At first I read the news on my phone, then I checked to see that I still didn't have any new text messages, and then I began to wander my eyes around the area. ""The Reader Room is soundproof,"" an old red-lettered sign read next to a big metal door. A silent chuckle cracked in my head, *Soundproofing that room isn't going to change those screams of a madman when the gift kicks in.* It was a vain attempt at making it better. I guess I should give them credit for that. At least they tried. But, no matter what, one of the two things happened in the Reader Room when you turned twenty right on the clock:

Scenario one: Nothing. Nothing would happen. They would take the straps off your arms and legs, and send you on your merry way. It meant you weren't a Reader. It meant you were fine. It meant you got to live a normal, happy life. 

Or scenario two: Everything. And by ""everything,"" I mean *everything* would happen. All at once. The thoughts of four billion people shot up into your head within a split second. The thought of a child's birthday party, the thought of making love, the thought of taking a man's life. It meant you were a Reader.

Do you know how sometimes you want to scream out loud with just your own fucked up thoughts in your head? Yeah, imagine the thoughts of four billion people. My old man used to say that it got better over the years. He always told me how he had learned to live with it. Supposedly, he had learned how to isolate voices, how to tell them apart, how to silence the others. But I guess that never happened with my sister. She was what we called a Lost Reader, someone who couldn't find a way to live with it. So she didn't. She took her own life. Many did. 

""Gabriel Grayson?"" the woman asked as she shuffled into the waiting room in her oversized dress. 

""Yes?"" 

""Your time is in two minutes. Please proceed to the Reader Room and put on the equipment as described in the manual on the screen.""

*Equipment. Yes, you mean the restraints. The straps on my arms and legs. So that I don't accidentally hurt myself while screaming at the initial pain if I'm a Reader. ""Equipment.""*

""Yes, Ma'am.""

The metal door opened. I proceeded into the Reader Room. I sat down in the chair. The instructions were on the screen to the left of me. Right in front of me was one-way glass. I knew they were watching me. They had to know. They logged all the Readers for government regulations. It made sense, right? I leaned down to put the leather straps around my ankles. I noticed that my right foot began to shake involuntarily. *It's going to be fine. Your father had it. Your sister had it. And it's 50/50. Your mother didn't have it. So you shouldn't have it, Gabe. You'll be okay.* I then had to simply rest my arms on the armrest on the chair and press the button under my right-hand palm to activate automatic straps for my wrists and my chest. 

""30 seconds,"" the woman's distorted voice said through the speaker.

*This is it. It's almost my birthday. I'm almost twenty. At least I will now know for sure. I won't be a Reader. It won't hurt. I won't have to go through this. And if not... well, I'll have to find a way to live with it like my father.*

""Ten... nine...""

*I'll be okay. I'll be fine.*

""Two... one...""

I heard a voice. Then two. Then ten hundred. A million. I heard a man holding his son for the first time. I heard a woman crying as she was being raped. I heard condolences as people died and words of celebration at the weddings. I heard the blood splatter of the innocent and the blood splatter of those who had deserved it. I heard the rage of those who killed. I heard the grief of those who lost. I heard the absolute best and the absolute worst of the world all at once. 

I heard them all. *And I felt nothing.*

I was supposed to be convulsing in pain and screaming from it all. Instead, I sat still. I didn't even twitch. I felt absolutely nothing. ""Congratulations, Mr. Grayson. You are a Non-Reader. Pick up your Non-Reader card at the front desk. Good luck, Mr. Grayson."" The straps fell to the sides. I got up and proceeded to the front desk.

"[WP] In a world where 99% of the population is infertile, you are one of the 1% fertile. Now the government wants to force you into their breeding program for the sake of the entire human race.",missjmelville,"Yesterday was the physical check up at my highschool. It was routine, everyone had done the tests since kindergarten. You step into the walk-in van and have your 'regions' checked. It seems awkward but we had the tests ever since we could remember.

Today the results were being given out at the front of school. The sliding door of the white van was a make-shift station to hand out results to the crowd of students.

I assumed nothing would be different. Infertile, infertile, infertile. Those researchers handed out those paper slips like pieces of candy. Those weren't handed out anymore, since research proves high sugar intake reduces chances of fertility.

I wanted to quickly grab mine and head inside. The annual science fair was coming up and I had a fantastic project that I had invested my weekends since freshman year on. Global warming could kiss my ass and die, given that I had the proper research grants.

I made my way to the table. A masked researcher with neat black hair pointed me out to another one. They whispered excitedly, then eagerly stepped off the van to meet me.

I was greeted by the pair with flustered smiles and sweaty handshakes. 

""Hi 142241! You're Avery Lee, right? We have some important results! The data from yesterday, we were scanning it over, and...""

They babbled on about the lab tests and 'shocking' findings. Excitement made the black haired guy gesticulate like a hyperactive squirrel.

""It seems you've been found fertile! Congratulations! We've already notified your current guardian, so we are legally allowed to whisk you off to our new project!"" 

Oh dear lord, no. What squirrel shit was he spewing. I opened my mouth to protest.

""Oh, you're such a dear. All expenses paid for the rest of your life! Of course, the lab will treat you the utmost care and a private suite included.""

I held up a hand, ""Excuse me, but you have to understand, this junior year is very important for me. I have projects to work on-""

""You don't have to worry about schooling and whatnot, only the shining future of being the branch to support the next generation!""

What was my global warming project going to do? Where was my life going?

He grabbed me by the shoulder and pull-pushed me over to the van. A couple of students threw quick glances at me. He threw me in with surprising force into the darkness of the van and leaned forwards.

He stabbed me in expertly on the arm with some sedative and hissed into my ear, ""Now take a nap and enjoy the ride.""


When I woke up I was strapped to an uncomfortable table. I couldn't move my head much, as it was also restrained with some leather-like band. I scanned with my eyes the surrounding equipment.

I felt slightly numb. I couldn't feel or move anything lower than my waist. I flexed hand gingerly. Footsteps approached from my left.

A blinding white lamp swiveled overhead and the smell of disinfectant reeked from the person besides me. I could see a white lab coat and white gloves.

""Morning Avery, we're going to begin the removal now. I see the anesthesia is kicking into your lower half. I forgot to increase the dosage for the knockout though. Whoops, well, no time to get it now.""

The cheery voice sounded like the squirrelly black-haired researcher.

""The facility is sure nice. Clean and soundproofed. You're my first specimen of the day so I'll be sure to do it nice and carefully. Do you know that the removal gives you a pretty penny?""

A painful throbbing pulsed in the back of my skull. I felt like I was going to puke, all over myself, and hopefully on Squirrel too. His patronizing tone was sickening me. The atmosphere was taking a plummet to creepy horrorshow regions.

Feeling was returning to my legs. 

""Oh dear, system says you've run out of anesthesia! How could that have happened!"" He giggled disgustingly. ""Whoops!""

I squirmed in my restraints, the throbbing in my head wasn't stopping. I strained to pull my eyes to focus to no avail. A scalpel came into view and I saw him closing in.

""Be a dear and scream for me, Avery. I like it when they scream.""

I opened my mouth. His mouth split into ecstasy.

[WP] Nicolas Cage runs for president and gets elected. His hidden agenda was to finally get the declaration of Independence,thatdudeman52,"“Now, what are we gonna do?!” Nicolas Cage screamed out to the mass of supporters at his inauguration, from his podium on Capitol Hill.

“LESS SECURITY GUARDS AND REGULATION AT MUSEUMS AND HISTORICAL SIGHTS!” the masses chanted back fervently, an uncoordinated cacophony of voices ending at different times. It had been the rallying cry of the Cage for President movement, and now, before hundreds of thousands, the dream was finally becoming realized. They had said he would never make it to the White House, but he had proven them all wrong, taking down practiced politicians and savvy opponents like a tidal wave sweeping through houses made of plywood and duct tape. The Cage Movement was unstoppable.

“That's right!” Nicolas yelled back emphatically. “For too long, these dredges on society have drained us of our taxes. They told us that we couldn't touch the glass in front of the ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs. They asked us not to step across the guard rail to get a better look at Plymouth Rock. They firmly escorted us to the back room for questioning when we stuck our tongues on one of John Hancock's lesser known silver spoons. Now, we tell them forcefully to get the hell out of our National Exhibits and stop wasting our money!”

The crowd roared. “History should be felt, not observed behind three feet of solid plexiglass and motion sensors!"" he continued. ""We need to experience the past....With our hands!” He held out his right and wiggled his fingers around hypnotically. 

Towards the back of the crowd, an old lady dabbed a tear from her cheek. Finally, she had found her champion; a president that would bring real change. She had never known the dangers of security guards until Nicolas had shown her their detriment on this country, but now that she was aware, she would no longer be played for a god-damned fool. Today marked the day that she would finally stop being an oppressed, museum-visiting woman.

Nicolas Cage looked out over the roaring crowd, now working itself into a frenzy. He paused, beaming, waiting patiently for the noise to subside. ""Today, to demonstrate my commitment to my cause, I will visit the National Archives, with no Security Guards allowed!"" His voice echoed across the lawn, to gasps from the crowd. ""Then, as soon as I am finished, I will open it up to the public, under the same pretenses!” 

People were going ballistic. Today, history had been made. The people loved this new America.

Nicolas flashed his famous smile that had become so renowned over the course of his storied, 5,321 movie career. *And to think we made it look so difficult in National Treasure,* he thought smugly.

""Why? I told you, I don't want to be in Slytherin. Can't you change your mind?"" Harry said, aghast.

""Young man, I don't have a mind, and I would never change it. Not wanting to be in Slytherin is the hallmark of a good Slytherin. Only a Gryffindor actually wants to be in Slytherin.

""Slytherin is for cunning people. I mean, really, what kind of cunning person wants to advertise that?

""Well, there is one way. Since you *are* the true heir of Gryffindor I could allow you his private suite. Although, you could also claim the title of heir of Slytherin by right of conquest and claim his suite. It would be closer to the Slytherin dorms, that way you could still hang out with your friends while avoiding Mr. Malfoy.""

Harry reflected for a moment and responded, ""Err, how do I claim the title of heir of Slytherin?""

""Simply state out loud 'I hereby claim the title of heir of Slytherin by right of conquest, so mote it be.' and magic will bestow it to you.""

""Thanks."" Harry reached up to remove the tattered headwear, then something occurred to him. ""Sorting hat, do you have a name?""

""It's Henry Highhat, thanks for asking. You know, you're the first one who's asked me that in over one hundred and forty years.

""Now take me off, people are starting to stare and I have children to sort.""

""Okay, sorry. Thanks again Mr Highhat.""

Henry felt the boy remove him from his head and place him on the stool.

""It's no trouble, Mr. Potter,"" he whispered, ""no trouble at all.""

They watched their Savior in wary shock, some with their hands still posed to clap. Harry risked a glance to his newly made friend and felt as if a stone dropped into the pit of his stomach when he took in the young Weasley's betrayed expression. 

He passed the Hat to the shell-shocked McGonagall, who jolted out of her surprise and took it with a slight tremor wracking her hands. Her eyes flickered to him with an unreadable, almost saddened expression before she called the next name. 

Harry walked to the Slytherin table as if it were his doom, and he wasn't that far off with his thoughts, judging by the icy glares his housemates were sending him. Green eyes met Draco's silvery blue, who merely turned up his nose at the Potter boy and began talking to a dark-skinned boy to his left. 

'This is going to be a long seven years,' the Boy-Who-Lived bemoaned mentally, eyes scanning the Head Table. Snape's glare was probably the most terrifying thing he'd ever seen in his life, topping even the Harry Hunting days.

His eyes bore into mine, shuddering violently as he gasped for breath.

""I'm dying, and I can't keep him at bay any longer. I'm so sorry."" His words were quiet, and I had no time to process them before his machines starting beeping chaotically, summoning a horde of medical staff to his side, but I knew it was too late. It was his time.

Just as my grandfather released his final breath, my phone began to ring. I was surprised at the interruption, and almost ignored it when I saw it was a number I didn't recognize. Just before the last ring, however, I pressed answer. It could be family, after all. ""Sorry about your loss,' the man on the line stated briskly, voice thick with boredom. ""Your grandfather owed $100,000 to the IRS. Now you do.""",TireaWrites
"[WP] At your grandfather's side, he whispers to you, ""I'm dying, and I can't keep him at bay any longer. I'm so sorry.""",BraveLittleAnt,"I've always hated hospitals, their meticulous sterility, as if Death would shy around clean white rooms in big geometric buildings. Over the past three months I'd developed an acute hatred for this hospital, since we'd moved Grandpa John into the hospice ward. He'd lived with us for the past two years, stinking up the house like a huge cat until he became so debilitated that Father decided it would be better to have him die somewhere else. I knew nothing about him, except that he was from Louisville and that he'd served in the war as a young man.

We could have eaten in the hospital's lunch room, but we all hurried out in relief with every chance we got. Right now it was my time to sit with him. For the thousandth time, I took him in. He was set into a hospital bed with an electrode hooked to his finger. His head was tilted back, his eyes were closed, his mouth was open to reveal two gnarled rows of yellow teeth. We had a blanket over him, but underneath that his body's outline was so faint that you might pull back the sheets and find nothing. It occurred to me that I hadn't seen Grandpa John away, out from, independent of this hospital bed since the day we moved him in. Maybe the hospital would let us bury it with him. Finding myself without stimulation, I dozed off to the pitched drone of the hospital lights.

A crash startled me awake. John had knocked over a flower vase that Mother had brought with her. I watched him flail abjectly for a breath's time, before getting up to help him. His eyes were wild and unseeing as his body racked with spasms and invisible currents. I bent over and replaced the blessfully uncracked vase and was about to return to my outpost when John fixed me with a vice grip. 

""Grandpa John let go, it's me"". 

He pulled me closer as his fingers closed tighter on my wrist, driving my eyes to water. I couldn't muster the strength to free myself. He pulled me closer to his face, enough to smell his fetid breath. He whispered.

""I'm dying, and I can't keep him at bay any longer. I'm so sorry."" 

He fell limp as the machine showed a flat line, just like on TV. Unlike on TV, nobody came rushing in. I stood there in the hospital room with my dead or dying grandfather. I stood there transfigured. The wind outside picked up to an audible howl, enveloping the room. I would have stood there for longer, if the wall hadn't burst open. 

My rationality crumbled along with the hospital wall. We were on the third floor. I thought it was a terrorist attack, here in rural Oklahoma, until I saw a blood red arm in the space between our room and the cavernous night. A figure pulled itself into the room, effortless and languid. It was entirely red and horrific to look upon. The part of my brain that was still working registered John's cryptic last words. As I stood there rooted, its gaping maw opened and it inhaled as it threw back its head. All the air in the room disappeared. 

""OHHHHHH YEAHHHHH""

[WP] A man posts a joke listing for a $5 bill on Ebay. He wakes up the following day to see the bidding has reached $300. It's then that he notices a small but important detail on the listing picture...and that he can't find the $5 bill.,FortyFourForty,"""Damnit!"" screamed David as he scrambled about his messy bedroom floor. Or rather, one could call his ""floor"" an amalgam of Doritos bags and dirty laundry. This being the case, it was no wonder it was proving particularly difficult to find a single five-dollar bill he had dropped the other day and all but forgot about. 

It started as an asinine joke that quickly turned into a grand opportunity for David when he posted that five-dollar bill on e-Bay. He only expected to get another five-dollar bill in return, or perhaps five hundred pennies shipped in multiple envelopes. He never expected people to bid upwards of $300.00 for the damn thing. 

Then, looking at his listing, David noticed a peculiar difference with the bill that not many people would recognize at first glance. The picture of President Lincoln's head was changing slightly on every different picture David had taken of the bill. The first picture had Lincoln winking with his right eye. The next picture caught Lincoln with his tongue slightly poking out of his lips, as if he was licking them seductively. Then, the last picture featured Lincoln with his top hat. All of the pictures featured the same codes on the bill, with all the same folds and wrinkles. They weren't different bills, like some people may think.

This prompted David to scramble to the floor almost immediately to find his discarded five dollars. He searched everywhere for it in a frenzy, but the bill never came up after five straight hours of searching. 

""Damnit!"" David screamed again, slamming his fists on the ground.

""Damnit! Damnit, Damnit, Damnit,"" David continually slammed his fists into the ground. His hands became more and more severely bruised with each impact, but he didn't care. He was too focused on the opportunity he had missed out on. After all, how often is it that someone can say they got frisky with a sentient five-dollar bill depicting one of America's greatest Presidents? 

David slipped another five-dollar bill from his wallet and took a picture of it with his Iphone. He looked at the picture longingly, grimaced and threw the phone to the ground. The picture was of a normal five-dollar bill. It was a silent reminder that David would never be able to find another bill like the first, ever again.",Amicus-Regis
"[WP] You've acquired the Sword of the Damned. Pros: infused with the souls of the damned, it can kill anything, even immortals, and will teleport back to you if misplaced. Cons: infused with the souls of the damned, it tends to scream and wail CONSTANTLY.",Gentlemanchaos,"Two men sat around a campfire in the night. One was reasonably young, with dark hair and bright eyes, a boyish sort of charm, and armor as yet unscuffed by years of hard fighting. The other wore a tattered cloak over clothes that were simple, hard-wearing, hard-worn, and incredibly dusty. His hair, what little was visible under his hat, was similarly covered in grit, and his face seemed more scars-and-stubble than skin. Both were silent, and the fire shed light enough to show the wilderness around them was completely abandoned. The wind was still, but the wailing battled with the crackling flames for dominion of the soundscape, though it was too faint to be anything other than wordless.

""...Just go on, would ya.""

The young man perked up. ""Hm?"" 

The older man sighed. ""You've been sittin' on that question o' yers ever since we started walkin' outta town, boy. Ya gonna ask, or d'ya plan on chokin' on it 'til we finish the job?""

The young man grinned sheepishly and rubbed the back of his neck. ""Can I... can I see it?""

*Jus' like always, innit.* The older man sighed again. ""You know whatcher askin', boy. T'aint a thing for gawkin' at.""

""Oh no, sir! Of course not! I just,"" he paused for a moment, ""I just want to see it once. To truly see a legend.""

""Hah,"" the older man smirked. ""I know what yer sayin'. Can't much blame you, wasn't too differnt once, m'self."" Slowly, from within the confines of the tattered cloak, a hand emerged, carrying with it a long bundle of pitch-black cloths wrapped tightly with an almost iridescent white cord.  
As it came into view, the older man unconsciously straightened his back. ""You take a good look, youngster. This here is not just a legend. This isn't merely the realm of mythology.  
""This is reality. This is truth. This is not just greatness, this is undeniable.  
""This is *it.*""

The young man stared. Almost without thinking, he whispered, ""The sword that slew the Twelve Apostate...""

The older man smiled again, straightened a little more. ""The sword that cut the hand off the great wyrm Hanjrak. The blade that devoured the Incarnate Void."" He slowly began to untie its binding.

The young man was transfixed. ""...forged from the bones of the primordial spirits, tempered in the blood of the ocean...""

The wailing grew louder, more insistent.

The old man nodded. ""Taking in the souls of the ungodly who die anywhere near it. Twisting their evils into power and their crimes into the justice of the one who wields it.""

""...the nameless blade that even gods fear...""

The old man started, his hand freezing right before beginning to unravel the cloths around it. ""Hold on, nameless? Where'dja hear a thing like that? *feh* Nameless, 'course this's got a name!""

A look of puzzlement crossed the young man's face. ""It... does?""

""Yeah. Call it 'Bitchin' Betsy.' Have for years.""

The wailing increased as the old man spoke, though nothing else moved.

""...I beg your pardon?"" 

The old man sighed. ""I call it Bitchin' Betsy, boy. I didn't stutter.""

""What?! But you can't- it's not- how could-""

""Hush yer horses, boy, just listen."" The wailing increased again. ""It holds the souls of the damned and ungodly, especially those it kills, but all sorts filter in. Not just the ones who'd end the world, but also the petty folks what'd ruin your day by breathin' in it. All of 'em."" The old man sighed again, and took a hold of one end of cloth. ""And there's a lot more of them small folk than there are of the great ones, let me tell you. Just listen.""

So saying, he pulled the cloth, and ""OH GOD OH GOD WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST LISTEN TO ME I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT NO GOD WHY **WHYYY DIDN'T I TRY A LITTLE HARDER I COULD HAVE MADE IT PERFECT NO COME BACK I DIDN'T MEAN IT KILL YOU ALL EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU NOOOOO YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND I JUST WANTED A TASTE OF IT IT WASN'T VERY MUCH AND YOU MADE EXTRA COME BACK YOU OWE ME FIVE GUILDER YOU LAZY SON OF A BULL WON'T FUCKIN' PULL A DAMN THING GOTTA BE RUTTIN' AROUND CONSTANTLY WON'T YOU LISTEN LOVE ME LOVE ME WHY DIDN'T YOU DO LIKE I ASKED FOR ONCE IN YOUR**-""

When the young man's ears stopped ringing, he saw that his partner had wrapped the sword in the black cloth again, and was just finishing the knot in the white cord. Slowly, cautiously, he found his voice. ""...what... was...?""

""That?"" The old man coughed out a laugh. ""That was Bitchin' Betsy, son. Greatest blade in the world, kills gods, demons, and conversation. Can't use it for more'n a minute, myself, without that I lose hearing for an hour. Half the reason I killed most o' what I done was 'cause they couldn't focus for the screamin', and most the rest would rather die than let me leave it unwrapped."" He smiled again. ""So yeah, that's that, innit. Welcome to heroin', son. Glad to have you along.""",EEverest

Some people say I killed a god, but they're wrong. I've killed three.

The first one was just a minor Slavic god - not much interesting happened. He tried to bite my neck, so that was weird. I would've had a hell of a time explaining that hickey to my girl.

Anyways, this sword. Great friggin' sword, really. Got it from my Uncle Beatrice (don't ask about his name). Bea said he got it from a sketchy guy in a hood at some tavern. That's where all the best magical artifacts come from, if you know what I mean. But I found his journal, and it said he really bought it from a homeless guy, so, you know, there's that.

I guess it doesn't matter much how we came across the Sword of the Damned. I'm a regular kinda guy - I take my coffee with cream, I like to hike, I kill demons on the side. You know. But see, I don't make money doing this demon-killing gig. Maybe sometimes I get contracted to take out some old bag's ghost at her haunted mansion, and other times, I have to kill the vamps when they get a little bold. But most of the time, I do it for my own good fun - my family name. That kind of honorable shit.

Since I have to be prepared for anything like a goddamn boy scout, I keep the Sword on me at all times. Now, you may be thinking - how the hell does this guy carry a sword on him when he works in IT? They fired Jeremy Jeffers last week for bringing in a pocketknife, so there's no way I'd get a sword past security.

Fortunately, the Sword comes with this great feature. People who don't have that magical lineage just see a boring old Nokia. You'd think a magical object would have the ability to disguise its own sound as well as appearance, right? Well, you'd be wrong. 

The one fucking terrible thing about the Sword? It screams. I get that it's made of dead people, but honestly, guys, could you keep it down? I'm trying to tell Sally in Indiana that she needs to unplug the modem first and see if that works, and the fact that a metric fuckton of dead people are screaming in my ear doesn't exactly help my patience.",splendid_giraffes

Two samurai fought for their lives and the sounds of their struggle filled the air. Takeshi's mouth was wide open and he leaned closer to the television. One of the samurai disarmed the other with a quick flick of the wrist. He raised his sword, ready to deliver the final blow. Just as the warrior was about to bring his katana down, the television turned off.


""WHAT!"" Takeshi yelled and rushed to turn the TV back on. Right after the TV turned on, it immediately turned off again. Takeshi turned around to see his mother holding the remote in her hand.


""Okaa-san!"" Takeshi pouted.


""It's time for bed Take-chan. You've watched enough TV for today. You have school tomorrow."" Rinko replied, a stern look on her face.


""But...""


""No buts! Go to sleep or you're grounded. No TV for the rest of the week."" Rinko glared at her son. 


Takeshi sighed. ""Ok. Will you at least tell me a bedtime story okaa-san?"" 


Rinko smiled. ""I'd be happy to. What kind of story would you like to hear?""


""A horror story! About samurai and katanas!""


""A horror story? Hmmm. Ok. Well, have you ever heard of the swordmaker Muramasa?"" Rinko sat down and put her son on her lap.


Takeshi shook his head no.


""Well Take-chan, historically Muramasa is one of Japan's finest swordmakers, second only to Masamune. According to legend, his swords were bloodthirsty and violent. If you drew the katana you would not be able to sheath it until you had shed blood.""


""How horrible!"" Takeshi shuddered at the thought.


Rinko laughed. ""It's just a tall tale. One of Muramasa's blades is on display at the national museum. It's a masterpiece. But some people say that it's not his finest work. Supposedly Muramasa eventually created a sword that could even consume the souls of those it slew.""


""Where is that sword now okaa-san?""


""No one knows. This Sword of the Damned has been lost to time. If it even really exists at all."" Rinko played with her son's hair.


""I'm going to find that sword someday, and everyone will praise me for my accomplishment!"" Takeshi proclaimed proudly.


Rinko laughed and patted her son's shoulder. ""Ok Take-chan. But you can't do that if you do poorly in school. And to do well in school you need a good night's sleep. So bed time now ok?""


""Alright okaa-san. Good night."" Takeshi kissed his mother's cheek and went to bed.


That particular memory would stick with Takeshi for the next twenty six years. Takeshi grew older and eventually became an accomplished archaeologist and historian. He never gave up the search for Muramasa's masterpiece. Finally, at the age of thirty two, Takeshi discovered a hidden cave while on vacation.


Takeshi's curiosity and adventurous spirit had only grown stronger since his youth. He wandered into the heart of the cave, deep underground. To his great surprise there was a pedestal at the end of the cave. An ancient katana was on the stand. Although the wood of the stand had practically rotted away, the sword was in pristine condition. There was no rust or deterioration and the katana gleamed brightly in the dark cave.


Takeshi could just barely make out some words carved into the base of the pedestal. ""Here rests my masterpiece, the Sword of the Damned. No mortal man should wield it. Muramasa.""


Takeshi couldn't believe his eyes. After searching for years, he had finally fulfilled his life's ambition. He reached for the sword, stopping short of picking it up. *An amateur mistake, I should return with a team so that this can be recovered carefully. Wouldn't want to damage it.*


And yet, it was so close. The way the sword glimmered and gleamed, it was as if it was... calling to him. What was that? Whispering? *I must be losing my mind. It's just air currents.*


Takeshi reached out and lifted the sword from the pedestal. The wood violently splintered and the pieces evaporated into dust. *What? I didn't mean to do that.*


Takeshi immediately regretted picking up the katana. As soon as he had lifted the sword, he became aware of an immense shrieking. Hundreds of voices screaming in a symphony of agony. 


Takeshi dropped the sword and covered his ears. Something was wet. He was bleeding from his ears. *I need to get out of here!* He left the katana on the ground and fled from the cave.


Once outside, the screaming ceased. The archaeologist breathed a quiet sigh of relief. *I must be going crazy. Must be the stress of my job.* Takeshi sat down on a nearby rock to collect his thoughts. His entire body felt heavy. Especially his right hand. He looked down and saw the Sword of the Damned in his hand.


The infernal voices filled the air once more. Takeshi threw the katana away and ran. No matter how far he fled, the katana always came back. In desperation, Takeshi threw the katana into a nearby river. The blade cleaved the floating leaves as it drifted down the water, only to reappear in his hand.


*A Muramasa sword can only be sheathed after spilling blood.* Takeshi remembered in horror. *I can't.... I can't live like this anymore. This goddamned screaming... stop... stop stop stop!* As the tempest of pain overwhelmed him, he looked down at the weapon in his hand and realized what he had to do. 


Takeshi plunged the sword into his body, driving the blade through his heart. He slumped to the ground. *Forgive me okaa-san.* 


Muramasa's sword sang sanguine scarlet as another voice joined its bloody chorus.

Thaumaturgist of Unholy Rites! I—""
 
""**HHHHRRAAAAAAAAAGGHHHH!**"" I sighed, groaning. The first time had been creepy. After the fiftieth time, though...

The frail cloaked man across the road stared at me with a quizzical look. He scratched his balding head with skeletal fingers. What was I saying?

""Harbinger of Darkness! I seek battle against ye, to bring surcease to your evil deeds. Nevermore shall your corruption spread amongst...""

The damned thing screeched again in my ear, a bleating wail. I took it out of the scabbard, making to throw it onto the ground. Better sense caught me, and I slowly, teeth gritted, placed it back.

The Lich of Stoneforge glanced at me with an amused smile. ""Troubles with a noisy enchantery I presume?""

I shrugged. ""It's just, you know—I'm used to it,"" I waved a hand. ""Whatever."" Clearing my throat, I began the formal Battle Litany: ""Lich! Today, you meet your end in battle! Dost—"" I waited, looked down at my scabbard, only hearing the buzzing of cicadas in the nearby forest. The sword hummed quietly. ""Dost thou—""

""**HHHREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!**""

""Oh, gods damn you!"" I flung the sword onto the ground, stomping and kicking dirt on it. It just whined and screeched in a semi-haunting chorus. Like a family of goats.

The Lich was beside me now, leaning over and touching the sword curiously. ""You see, what you want are Runes of Quiescence around the hilt. Or honestly, since that only dampens the sound, you might just want a Binding. Keep it in the form of a regular sword until you're ready to use it.""

I shook my head weakly. ""I've already tried those. The enchantments are too powerful and override lower-level spells. I've even been to Ilsenvale, they said they couldn't do anything."" I sighed. ""The damned necromancer who enchanted the sword is dead! *Dead!* Can you believe it? His phylactery nowhere to be found. Shoddy job, honestly.""

The sword cried with the misery of a thousand lost souls. ""Shut up."" I picked it up and started walking away.

""I'll buy it off of you for 20 silver ferthings."" said the Lich.

I stared at him with arched brows. ""Oh, please. This is a Sword of Prophecy. I can't just sell it."" The hilt vibrated, humming quietly, then broke into a shrill caterwaul. ""Okay, 50 ferthings.""

""25 and a lesson on quick-casting spells.""

""I know how to do that already. 45.""

""30 and I'll throw in a sweet jet-black robe.""

I hesitated. ""Okay, how about 30 and the robe. And you leave Stoneforge alone.""

""Deal."" He handed me the money, conjured a dark velvet robe, and I handed him the sword. As he walked away, a satisfied smile on his face, I could hear the sword humming quietly. A ways down the road, I heard the telltale hum close to me. I checked my scabbard, felt the weight sag upon my hip. Gods damn it all. I might quit this knighthood thing honestly.

[WP] You commit suicide only to figure out that your life has just went to the last saved checkpoint,Helleryoudoing,"Sometimes, Christopher thought as he climbed the second to last flight of stairs, there’s nothing left to do but jump.

He didn’t want to jump, not really. But he also had basically no other option, and there wasn’t exactly a way he could just go back to when things were better. Life isn’t a video game; there are no save files.

Hmph, save files. Christopher smiled. When he was a kid, he and his brother would play Mario, and he would regularly be accused of cheating. He’d save his game every time he cleared an obstacle, and whenever he died he would just go back. This way he could go through the whole game without ever losing a life. Somehow, Matt seemed to consider this unfair. Even two years ago, when they’d seen each other last at a family reunion, Christopher somehow found himself playing video games with his brother on their grandmother’s ancient console and arguing fiercely about it. The argument eventually dissolved into laughter when Matt picked up his controller, walked his character purposefully across the screen, and made it punch Christopher’s character in the jaw. A virtual battle followed, so intense that eventually an aunt confronted them about their language, and then they collapsed into laughter once more. This was one of the last happy memories Christopher could recall.

Maybe he should have left Matt a note. Christopher had left a general-purpose note, just to make sure no one was accused of murder. Just a quick “sup guys finna end my life better send someone to clean up the debris” sort of note. Maybe it should have said “sup guys finna end my life better send someone to clean up the debris. Ps: sorry for cheating at video games, Matt. Love you.”

Oh well, too late for that now. He was on the top staircase now, almost to the door of the roof. And if he’d left a note for Matt, he’d have to leave a note for his mom as well. Or his friends or dad or girlfriend.

Is it fair to kill yourself without breaking up with your girlfriend first?

The door to the roof was a faded, peeling grey that revealed ancient green paint underneath. Christopher grabbed the knob, felt the smooth metal beneath his hand, wondered whether he’d be able to feel the concrete of the ground under his hand or if death would be too fast. 
Maybe, he mused, death is too abstract of a concept to be described by simple factors of speed. Then again, if death had been faster, then he wouldn’t have had to watch his life spiral out of control over the last few years. Maybe that would have been better for everyone.

Christopher threw open the door, walked quickly across the rooftop, and threw himself over the edge. All that followed was a blur of steel and sky and gravity, and then he was laying on the ground. There was no pain. 

Hmm, he thought. I expected at least some pain. Then hands were shaking him and he opened his eyes to see his grandmother’s living room and a familiar face. 

“Hey man, you all right?” the face said.

“Matt. What happened?”

“I don’t know man, we were sitting here playing and you just passed out. Can I do something? Can I call someone?”

Christopher felt like he was forgetting something, like something huge had just happened, like he had been here before. But he couldn’t remember; all he felt was a sense of relief.

“Nah,” he finally said. “But what you can do is pick up that controller.” He lowered his voice so Aunt Ruth couldn’t hear him. “Because I’m about to kick your ass.”

[WP] You commit suicide only to figure out that your life has just went to the last saved checkpoint,Helleryoudoing,"She sat on her bed and reached her hand out. She pinched one pill between her fingers and swallowed it, and again, and again,

and again....

The massive pile of pills slowly disappeared into her stomach and she laid down into darkness. No tears wet her cheeks or the note on her bedside table.

It was over.

***

She blinked her eyes slowly. She had a headache. Why did she have a headache? Why was she alive? She rolled over noting the large, homemade bandage on her wrist. She reached for her phone to check the time. 

""What the hell?"" She whispered to herself. This was her old phone. She had thought it was lost in the mess of her apt. She hadn't used this one for over a year. It was plugged in and powered up. She flipped it open to see a date that was over a year old. Her thoughts raced. She didn't have friends, this was no prank and as she glanced around her bedroom she noted her laptop was also an older version and things just felt...wrong. Either this was hell or something ...strange had happened.

She got out of bed, a memory forming in her mind that was confirmed when she saw the empty bottle of vodka and bloody razor in the living room. This was the morning after she had first tried to kill herself. She hadn't been able to do it then and had never confided that moment to anyone. The booze, the pain, the heart-crushing moment when she couldn't even kill herself properly. She remembered sobbing through the feeling of failure.

""How's that headache?"" A voice said softly from her kitchen. She whirled and saw a man, impeccably dressed sitting at her table. ""I know you have questions, but suffice to say, yes it is 'a year ago'."" He shifted slightly and she caught a glimpse of something behind him, it looked faintly like a pair of wings. 

""Are-are you an angel?"" She asked, ""What is going on?""

He smirked. ""You could say that. You could also say that 'We' inspired the fairy tale of angels...and demons."" He smiled broadly. ""I will be in touch so get yourself together. I will need you in the coming days."" 

Before she could even form a thought he was gone, the faint smell of spices lingering in her kitchen. She sat heavily on the couch with the realization that some sort of being that could bend time seemingly easily, wanted her for something....she needed another drink.",the_truth_lies

I open my eyes and turn to the left. A man is leaning from his window, frantically waving to me. I smile at him briefly, take a deep breath, then look down.

*Big mistake.*

Dizziness washes over me as I take in the twelve stories of air between me and the sidewalk. I sway, nearly fall, and dig my fingers into the bricks behind me. I wonder why.

""Please!""

His voice is growing louder and his waving more frantic. I turn to him and give him a full smile this time. ""Careful, you wouldn't want to fall."" A look of disbelief washes over his face, and I can't help but laugh. God, it feels good to laugh again -- even if I don't really know why I am.

""Hey, what's your name?""

I realize that he's trying to make conversation, and the absurdity of the situation nearly sends me into another fit of laughter. *I'm standing on a ledge twelve stories above the ground, swapping names with a stranger.* I answer him anyway.

""I'm Amy. What's your name?""

""Rick. Listen, Amy. Do you believe that our lives have a purpose? That we're here for a reason?""

""Would I be on this ledge if I did?""

He pauses for a moment. ""No, I guess not. But I do, Amy. I think there's a reason you're alive. Hell, I even think there may be a reason you're standing out there today -- but I don't think it's to die.""

I close my eyes for a moment. *How nice it would be to believe in something greater.* ""Listen, Rick. I appreciate what you're trying to do. I really do. But the things that have happened in my life... there was no higher purpose to them. They weren't ordained by the universe. And if they were, it's not a universe I'd like to be a part of anymore. Now, could you please look away? I don't want you to see this.""

""No, wait!"" His voice is the last thing I hear before I'm spiraling through the air. Suddenly, I regret what I've done. I want to live. I want to be. I want to talk to Rick, and learn more about the man who was so desperate to save me. *It's too late for that now.* I reach the ground, and suddenly...

""Don't jump!""

I yelp, surprised, and turn left quickly -- too quickly. I lose my balance and suddenly I'm falling, spiraling through the air... away from Rick and the ledge I jumped from a few moments ago. *What the fuck?*

""Don't jump!""

This time, I take a deep breath before I open my eyes. I turn left, and there's Rick, waving frantically. *What the fuck is happening to me?*

""Um... hi. I'm Amy.""


""Hi, I'm Rick. Listen, Amy. Do you believe that our lives have a purpose? That we're here for a reason?""

I stare at him for a moment. I start to speak, then stop and bite my lip. ""Well,"" I begin slowly, ""I didn't before. But I'm starting to wonder.""

""They're undead. They're falling apart, man. It's completely gross to look at one.""

""And you...created these things in your lab?""

Jamie looked toward the floor. Both of his hands were on the diner table, tightening slightly. After a few moments pause he gave a quick nod. 

""So...I dunno man. Beer stealing creatures of the undead doesn't scream *zombie* to me. Where's the terror? The apocalypse? Brad Pitt doing impossible feats while still maintaining perfect hair?""

Jamie frowned. ""I shouldn't even be telling you this. It's top secret. They're biohazards. I could be arrested for treason.""

""They aren't faux!"" Jamie hit his first against the table. ""These are real zombies, Leon. And the government is planning something. Something sinister and real and it very well may lead to the next apocalypse. 

Leon looked around at the mostly empty tavern. Jamie's outburst had caused a few of the heads to turn their way. Leon shot then a small apologetic smile. 

He lowered his voice and leaned toward Jamie. ""Say they are zombies. They don't eat brains, they just drink beer. What's wrong with that? So we make more beer.""

Jamie's face had turned a shade of green. He looked down at the table. 

""There's some really important detail you're leaving out here,"" Leon said. 

""I...I'll be fired. I'll be arrested for treason.""

""Why. There just in a lab, right?""

Jamie hung his head a little further. Then after a moment he shook it from side to side. ""They wanted to experiment. So they sent them to colleges. It was years ago that they started doing this. They didn't expect the...reaction. The zombies look like normal people. They just survive on beer and it's fine but...but... Shit, Leon. They're starting to be more aggressive. They're breaking laws.

No one much made it out this way in the BeforeTime. Figured it'd be the same after the Outbreak. Was fer awhile. There was the incident in the barn, but I'd every reason to believe that was isolated. Anyway, plenty of blades in there still sharp enough for cuttin'. 

Then McMurty's General, down the way there, got picked over clean. 'ssumed it was the Vaccinated, first thing. Too targeted. Lookin' too much a raid. Plus, they'n never taken the suds before.

It was bewildering, really. To be honest, I don't really know much about zombie behavior and biology, but I do remember some bits of stuff about the making of alcoholic drinks. They popped up after I decided to just let the zombies raid the beer stash. 'Sides, they keep my dad from being a drunkard.

""EAT BUCKSHOT, YOU ROTTEN BEER THIEVES!""

I wouldn't say that they kept him from being a raging man, though.

Anyway, alcohol. I remember them being made through fermentation, a.k.a. intentional and fancy spoiling. That alternate description for fermentation was something that sounded funny and catchy in my mind right after remembering wine being one of the things made through fermentation. And speaking of spoiling, how do zombies even take that stuff? I mean, them eating wounded and helpless people makes more sense, but alcohol? Shouldn't that burn them down or something?

""HAHA! SHOULD'VE USED YOUR BRAINS! OH WAIT, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY! HAHAHA! BURN, BABY, BURN!""

Huh. That makes sense. But that leaves me with...

""And now, time for some VICTORY BEER!""

Okay, back to dodging Dad again...Wait.

I have an idea.

""Ah yes, Victory Beer, the beer for ma--WHAT THE HELL, SERENITY!?""

Piss Dad off, all while killing zombies. Two birds with one stone. Or maybe several rotten and moving dumbasses with one popular and flammable chemical.

I threw Dad's half-finished bottle of Victory Beer, and its mouth landed right into a zombie's open and hanging mouth. I dodged to the side, and while I kept running, I heard the explosion of buckshot and the hissing of a chemical reaction.

Now, I'm gonna need more alcohol and more comrades.

""RAID ALL THE ALCOHOLIC DRINK SECTIONS!"" I shouted as I approached the local supermarket, which was being raided by people, both living and rotting.

I then heard a chorus of ""YEAH!"" from the living people, followed by the hissing and burning of rotting people.

Indeed, for the first time in my life, love for alcohol blossomed within me. Eat that, all you peer-pressuring dumbasses!",NuttyTobby

The undead hoard rapidly swarmed the wheat fields, ripping the plants straight from the soil and carrying them off. Elsewhere, a legion of walkers broke thought barricades to assault a pub. 

""It is worse than we thought... they are not satisfied with the lite beer."" The Brewer sighed in worry to his followers. ""We don't have much time. We must ensure our alcohols' safety in these trying times! To the vaults!"" The football players, hunters, and college students all cheered in unison, and stormed downstairs.

 It would be one hell of a fight, the zombies were in a frenzy from the lack of booze. But If they were unable to stop the sickness, what would stop the undead from drinking the wine? The martinis? The sake? No. Such a thing would be far too grave to suffer.

[WP] You are salesman of the year. But you can't speak.,MichaelLewis55,"With no preamble, Danny burst into the conference room. The three people seated at the table looked up at him in alarm. 

Danny signed rapidly at the seated people, a gesture he guessed they would interpret as a greeting. They all stumbled over their own awkward greetings and Danny had to swallow a smirk. He knew that despite the fact that he was selling hearing aids to a medical supplier that they wouldn't have anyone who was hearing impaired. He had actually signed 'Eat a dick, everyone.'

Danny was a miserable fuck.

Confident that the medical supply buyers would not expect small talk from a mute man, he reached in his pocket and pulled out three hearing aids. He slid them across the table while maintaining an aggressive level of eye contact.

Danny pulled out a remote and showed it to the buyers while they struggled to put in the hearing aids. Once they were in place, Danny started to snap with one hand while bringing up the levels in the hearing aids with the remote in the other.

The surprise and appreciation on the buyer's faces was predicable. The device was a proprietary design that raised the pertinent sound without increasing background noise, it never failed to impress. Danny stopped snapping. He turned the hearing aids off and set the remote down on the table.

Danny slid a business card over to the buyers. It had a single sentence in black on the solid white card. The sentence was “How many?”

The buyer in the middle, a weak looking man in his late 20s looked at his colleagues for support before  meeting Danny's intense gaze.

“T-ten thousand?”

Danny continued to stare at the man without moving but raised one eyebrow.

“I guess... I guess we could do twenty-five thousand.”

Danny stepped forward and shook the man's hand, then turned and walked out of the room without looking back.

Adrenaline started to hit Danny's bloodstream as he walked away. The rush of a closed sale. The numbers didn't really matter, he was so far ahead of the second place salesman in his company that he could take six months off and still be head and shoulders above everyone else. But this was what Danny was built for, it would be a thrill to manipulate buyers even if he wasn't being paid an unreasonable sum.

The product was a help, of course. Spectacular technology. It was a shame that it didn't really register human speech.

Danny reached the parking lot and climbed into his Porche. He started his post-deal ritual: he lit a cigarette, turned on 'Come Sail Away' by Styx and flipped the bird to the building behind him as he peeled out of the parking lot.",likecmdybutlessfunny

I'm not one of those people, and neither are the students who I spend most of my time with at Hogwarts. In Ravenclaw, by the end of the first year, if your grades are good enough and you've got the social smarts, the world of magic takes a backseat, and the world of money makes an entrance.

I was scouted in my first semester. 

Got pulled into the dorm room that the older students always hanged around, and forced to choose between swearing an oath of secrecy and loyalty to the house, or rejecting the offer and spending the rest of my school years stuck learning useless magic like Gryffindor or Slytherin. Of course, they already knew what my answer would be. When you've got older siblings on the team and the sorting hat gives you Ravenclaw, it's an easy pick. At that time, Ravenclaw's empire was at its peak. Our product was so good that our headmaster spent an entire year cold-shouldering his so-called Chosen One (that's Harry Potter if you haven't been reading the news) after a summer-long bender that gave the old man a depressive comedown immune to magical treatment. 

When I was inaugurated, the team couldn't have been happier to have another Ashmore boy on the team, given that Hufflepuff had been making more ground each day targeting the younger students. Ravenclaw sold good sh*t, but it was expensive, and although the idiots at Slytherin had more than enough of their parent's money to spend on our stuff, Hufflepuff's customer base was larger and we were losing more buyers to the weaker, but cheaper, Hufflepuff product.

As if that wasn't bad enough for Ravenclaw, they had a Hufflepuff informant on the inside. Worse yet, that informant was me.",Chazef

Luna Lovegood was crying. Again.

She cried a lot since being sorted into Ravenclaw - even more than she did when her mom died. Then, at least, it was an accident, something horrible that happened once, something that she could live through and let go. But those girls... Nothing they did was an accident. It was pure, malicious hate.

They started small. A stolen quill, stepping on her robes to make her trip. When she did not react, they got more bold, throwing hexes and tampering with her essays, always in a way that would make her look stupid. Then they did something worse. Three girls from her own house, making her life miserable, and openly inviting others to join them. Who could she, measly first-year without many connections, ask for help?

Other students were out of the question - they were just as likely to join the mocking as to help her. Professor Flitwick was not a bad man, but, being half-goblin, it was hard for him to grasp a concept of bullies. Ravenclaw prefect was too busy with her own studies, and prefects of other houses would not listen to her. Or would they? She was of Ravenclaw, after all, and her mind quickly raced through the possibilities. Hope fluttered in her heart, something that she almost started to lose.

Luna springed to her feet and left a hidden crevice of some abandoned classroom that she used as a hiding place. Hidden passages later, she was standing in a corridor leading to the Hufflepuff common room.

She did not have to wait long - after couple of minutes, she was found by an older girl with a yellow tie.

Her voice was cold, but Luna did not flinch. She heard of Hufflepuff as ""just"", and that was what she needed.

""I came because I need help,"" - she managed to squeeze out, suddenly feeling very weak.

But those words changed how one dressed in black and yellow looked at her. This firstie looked... bad. Bags under her eyes, ragged uniform, and a bruise on her neck! Something certainly was amiss.

""Come,"" - said older Hufflepuff. - ""Our prefect will listen to what you have to say.""


***

Hour later, Luna found herself sitting on a sofa, drinking hot cocoa, under a watchful eye of couple 'Puffs, including Gabriel Truman, Hufflepuff prefect.

""That's typical Ravenclaw for you, Luna, - said Gabriel. - ""When Slytherin started getting a bad rep, many families urged their offspring to join Ravenclaw. Don't get me wrong - most of them are brilliant, and they're ones pushing magic science forward. But they're also backstabbing bunch, always happy to throw you to an acromantula if that will get them results or fame. Preferably both.""

""Then why was I sorted into Ravenclaw?"" - asked firstie, still shocked by this revelation.

""Because you are smart, and you are interested in knowing things, duh,"" - answered third year that let Luna in. - ""Like Flitwick, you probably one more fitting to be there than all other pure- and halfbloods there. You can find decent folk amongst muggleborn, but they are not the ones running the place.""

""That's right. Only reason why you are not being pushed into believing whatever crap they tell is that they feel threatened by you,"" - confirmed Hufflepuff prefect.

""They? By me?"" - Luna was, to say the least, confused.

""I heard stories of you telling everybody about things you saw. Spirits and the like. Did you know that your Founder had a talent for such thing, even if she did not use it much?"" - some other fifth-year pushed an old-looking book in Luna's hands. - ""Read this. It is possible that you are a Ravenclaw champion.""

""Me? A champion? You must be joking,"" - Luna managed a weak laugh. Gabriel just warmly smiled at that.

""We will help you deal you with bullies, Luna, even if it means wrapping you in enchantments, giving you bodyguard and personally tutoring you on Defense. We don't like bullies, and that is something we would do for anybody. But, that is not all we can give. We can help you to rid Ravenclaw of those who do not fit.""

""But why?"" - that's all Luna could ask, her mind overheating from trying to trace all possibilities.

""They ruined our reputation, Luna, by spreading lies of us being stupid and useless. We used to have best healers and fighters in our ranks, but now we barely get half of what we used to. We used to be closest Houses, but now we are enemies,"" - by the end of this speech his smile turned grim.

They sat in silence for some time, looking at the magic fire, until cup in Luna's hand turned cold. Then she spoke:

""I will go through whatever you have ready for me, Gabriel. You putting a lot of trust in me, and all I can do is to return the favor.""

Saying those words changed something inside Luna. She knew that she can't run away anymore. Because now, she had allies, no, *friends*.

""Thank you, Champion. We *are* just. But we never said we were *meek*. And it is time to remind them of that.""",Respectful_russian

But first, Jon had to find this Harry Potter. He an upperclassman, though Jon had no clue what grade. The massive groundskeeper had described Potter to him and told him where in the giant lunch room to find him, now he just had to navigate through the hundreds of students. 

""I'm looking for Potter! Harry Potter! Please! It's urgent! Someone help me find Potter!"" He called in vain.

The voices of hundreds of people had formed a dull roar, it should've been impossible to find one person. Yet, Jon managed. 

""I know where Potter sits! Over there! At the end!"" One girl yelled, pointing behind herself.

As Jon yelled a quick thanks to her, he shoved his way past the students milling between the benches that separated the four houses. It took what felt like hours of pushing, apologizing, and squeezing past people that he finally reached the person he was seeking.

""Potter? Harry Potter?"" He asked, looking around the table, scanning each dark haired upperclassmen he saw.

""Yes?"" A young man with a scar on his forehead replied.

""I'm glad I found you, I'm Jon Renais of Hufflepuff. I came to warn you. There's a Ravenclaw. A big, scary, foreign one. He's hunting you. People are saying he's out to kill you. I don't know much about him, I just didn't know of any of the other first-years had warned you yet."" Jon explained hurriedly.

""He wouldn't be the first. Why is he after me? Do you know?"" Harry asked, glancing quickly to Ron and Hermione.

""His name is Grin. Grin Dickory. Cedric Dickory was his half-brother. The Ravenclaw I spoke to said that Grin is convinced it's your fault his brother was murdered. He said that Grin uses some kind of muggle science along with his magic. They called him The Battlemage."" Jon warned, sweat covering his brow. 

He worried that speaking of the massive first year would cause him to appear.

""And what does this big foreigner look like?"" Harry asked.

""Short, dark hair. Sharp, dark eyes. Rough demeanor. I'm pretty sure he's from across the pond."" Jon said nervously.

""A big, scary, American that mixes muggle science with modern magic?"" Hermione asked, clearly skeptical.

""The only time I ever crossed paths with him, I averted my eyes."" Jon admitted, attempting to hide the shame in his voice.

""Well, thank you for the warning. The three of us have gotten through much worse than one angry, confused underclassmen."" Harry said confidently, nodding happily to his friends.

Jon stood and bowed to them, as was tradition in his homeland when speaking to upperclassmen, then navigated his way back to his own seat. In his heart, he hoped that Potter was right. ",SquidsCantDance_

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""It's blood, kid,"" replied Avik. ""Some Slytherin bloke wanted to set it up where pure blood wizards rule over muggles like what Nosi's mum got over in Joburg.""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Just stay away from the triplets,"" warned Nosi. She pointed afar. Three Asian girls were huddled at one corner of the table, engrossed in their own universe.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Are they sisters?"" asked Tea.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""No,"" replied Nosi, ""But they've been friends since before Hogwarts. They hang out in all the social clubs and party whenever they can get away with it and still somehow get all the top grades in class.""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Tea wasn't sure why he was supposed to be suspicious of this. They sounded like some of the kids from primary school.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""They know they can't be touched by the teachers, so they go around bullying Hufflepuffs,"" continued Nosi, ""They think we're dogs. Stupid and dirty.

[WP] The Goddess of Hate reacts to a more tolerant world.,Sardonic_Deity,"Erida's eyes fluttered in the darkness as she awoke at last. Stretching, she shrugged off the rusty, shattered remains of the shackles of ages. She sat up, memory returning slowly. A big grin slowly returned to her face, exposing her rows and rows of needle-like teeth. ""The time has come... let us see what this world has become."" she hissed, as she slipped off of the altar and over to the mirror. A single touch, and it became her looking glass to the world.

Oh how society had changed. Preaching love, and justice...but all that hate still trickling through. One man cheerfully announces his right to wed one of his gender, at the same instant as a woman is stoned to death for an infidelity that never occurred. A husband and wife walked down the street with their daughter, past the house with the chained girl in the basement, awaiting her next raping. A murder, imprisoned for life for his crimes while the rich pour their money into cruel weapons to destroy undeveloped countries.

And the jewel in the crown.... the atomic bomb... they were everywhere, all over this world. They were waiting, restless and hungry in their bays... and everyone had them because despite the trade agreements, despite their declarations of friendships, and their UN and their EU... no-one trusts one another.

Her grin grew ever wider, as she saw the potential in this new world. A better setting she could not have orchestrated in a thousand years. Her blood red cats-eyes grew bright with malice as a plan assembled itself. 

""This...this will be fun...but first, I think a change of attire is in order."" With that, she stood straight and began to channel her power. Her teeth began shorter, blunter. Her midnight skin changed it's hue to that of a Caucasian human. Her writhing tentacled hair thinned, forming itself into a tight bun. Her wings enveloped her, wrapping into a military uniform. Her eyes she could not change- no god could- but in this world, it wouldn't matter. Contact lenses would not be hard to acquire, the mirror told her.

Satisfied, she strode through the looking glass, ready to wreak havoc on an unprepared world. This world that was to become her playground.",eternal8phoenix

As my eyes came to rest upon him, I could not help but feel a tinge of pity.  He was not a single bit the man who was depicted in the news and media.  All the energy, the triumph of will had been sucked from him, and he looked a hollow mannequin of himself.

Instead of the powerful stance he'd usually been seen as, he slouched in his chair, legs spread across the ground.  His shoulders sloped down, down into folded arms.  His face was not an expression of anger, or guilt, but of unflinching failure.  It had consumed his every being.

Despite this, his simple toothbrush mustache, perhaps in an act of defiance, remained clean and well-edged.  In fact, every facet of him was sharp and defined, with crisp, military cleanliness from his shirt to his shoes.  This, of course, did nothing to disguise the hollowness within.

Had I looked any longer, I would have thought him a ghost, a man not meant to be here.  As the court came to order around him, he flinched not, keeping his gaze on the floor.  I turned away and let him rot in his self-pity.",WWIflyingace62
"[WP] You wake up on a strange planet in a lifeless desert surrounded by crates of food, seeds, tools and reference books. You've apparently been sent to this dead world to colonize it all by yourself, but you don't know who sent you or why...",apopheniac1989,"This container is labeled ""Seed 1045: Radish. 5 kg. See inside panel for instructions."" It's an ugly thing, dull gray plastic, like it should have toy blocks in it. Very unremarkable. The label is printed on a white panel on the lid, big black block letters. It opens easily once all the latches are undone. Inside are seeds. Shocker. Hundreds of packages, full of little radish babies. Totally useless. What the hell. 

He doesn't know how long it's been since he landed here in his dinky one-time-use-not-intended-for-long-duration-voyages-contact-retailer-for-more-information-blah-blah-blah Crash Can Mark XI. Close to a day for sure. The sun hasn't set yet. No, scratch that. Suns. That's going to take some getting used to. There's three. Three suns! He wasn't sure what to expect down here, but this is far from it. Whole lot of good those training courses did. This place isn't anything like the simulations. Who cares if he's never seen a real forest? Forests have trees, that's for damn sure. He knows what trees look like, and unless they all got up and left, this ain't no forest. Also he's fairly certain forests aren't this blazingly hot. And dry. And yellow. And full of sand. Regardless of what this really is, he was told he'd be setting down in a forest, and goddammit, that's what it'll be today. It's not like there's anyone else here to say otherwise. 

What to call it. He doesn't have an actual name, and who'd ever want to go to ""XB-7872 Forest?"" No, he can't name it after himself. He looks up from the container, and for the first time since he's landed, he really takes in his surroundings. It sucks. There's more sand than an army of castle building eight year olds would know what to do with. He decides to ignore the sand, and focus on the only interesting feature this side of the planet, which the planet can't even claim responsibility for; along with the dumb radish box, several hundred equally dull storage containers are strewn across an area of what he assumes is the size of an old earth football field. 

In reality it's a much larger area, but such are the consequences of spending ones entire life on an interstellar colonization barge. When engineers are told to design a vehicle capable of shipping enough people and supplies to start a self sustaining settlement on a planet several hundred light years away, they always seem to forget the bare necessities. 
Like full size football fields. He doesn't know it, but a planet wide petition has just been written back on Earth. It calls for the construction of a new fleet of colonization barges, complete with more of the luxuries of home. Sending seven or eight or ten generations of humanity to drift across the void without even a football field to stay active is now considered an atrocious judgement call, punishable by massive petitions. XB-7872 (who has just decided to ditch that designation for the much catchier ""78"") would've very much liked to have been born on one of these new barges. But by a stroke of unfortunate probability, he wasn't. 

78 was born into the 9th generation of travelers aboard the Golan Mining Corporation's twelfth colonization barge; the appropriately named Golan Mining Corporation Colonization Barge 12. The corporation decided a long time ago to simplify things and do away with having to spend precious time and thought on the creative processes necessary for naming things like spaceships. And people. Numbers can be assigned by a computer, and a computer can run by itself, so the corporation figured that their miners would eventually get used to having a designation rather than a name. Interestingly, they did. The exception was XB-7872. He, unlike the thousands of others in his generation, was thoroughly unsatisfied with his designation. The few times he'd heard about the people on Earth with their unique words rather than numbers, he'd felt funny. It was like something was lost, but he didn't know what it was, and it didn't feel like his, but he wanted to find it anyway. Well today he found it, and now he was 78. He did a little dance to celebrate. Then he stopped as he realized that no one was there to acknowledge his evolution. Only the boxes, and they didn't do much in the way of acknowledgement. 

Now the suns begin to set. Actually, one already has, and the other two are following suit. 78 remembers something from the simulations about planets' temperatures dropping rapidly when their parent star drops below the horizon. He takes a moment to scream at the universe for making such fucked up rules. Then he sits down on the sad little radish box and turns on his brain. For the first time, he wonders if there might be something wrong about his situation. Perhaps there ought to be more people here to help him build an entire mining colony. He knows that some of the larger boxes contain construction drones that will extract enough raw metals from the ground to build the first permanent buildings, but what then? He can't produce offspring on his own. Who will run the colony? Who will grow the radishes? Who will operate the mining rigs? Come to think of it, where are the mining rigs? There should be some incredibly large machinery somewhere nearby, with big parachutes laying around from the descent. They would've been sent down from the barge. But unless they were buried under all this godforsaken sand, 78 is down here to build a mining colony without mining rigs. Something seems wrong about that. He spends some time fiddling with the wireless on his crash can, saying things like ""hello? Is there anybody up there?"" Unless they're very rude or just plain mean, no one's up there (as a matter of fact, there was a deep space reconnaissance probe that picked up 78's transmission. It should've had the capability to relay the message to nearby vessels, but it's transmitter antenna was destroyed by a speck of dust flying through space at several thousand kilometers an hour. Such is life).

78 has given up with the wireless. He has opened a pack of radish babies and is playing with one, rolling it around in his hand. It's a little brown thing, unassuming, almost cute. He knows that it takes a lot of work to turn this tiny pebble into a vegetable, even with the fortifying super powering awesomifying gene mods the scientists cooked up back on Earth. He could do it - farm for food - and he figures he probably will soon. The rations he found are only enough for about a year. By then he should have all manner of crops growing. 

The question remains. What the hell is going on? 78 is very aware now that his circumstances are perfectly abnormal, and he's going to find out why. How he's going to do that isn't very clear. Actually he's completely stumped. The barge is definitely gone, and this definitely isn't what was supposed to happen. There are more unknowns than he's comfortable with. Why did they send a complete colonization package down here without the mining rigs? Why isn't this the lush forest he was told they would arrive at? Granted, it's an alien forest, and is bound to look different than the pictures he's seen of Earth forests. But this?! No. A mistake has been made. Why did they tell him to get in a crash can by himself? And even worse, why did he listen to them?

78 spends too much time dicking around with his thoughts. Its almost dark. He barely notices the light disappear. On the barge it was always abrupt; the flip of a switch. Here it takes so long, gently fading, as if the sand itself is swallowing up the suns, bit by bit. Now its too late to come up with a plan; survival is priority number one. It's so cold he can't believe he's on the same planet. But he is, and he's royally fucked if he can't figure out some shelter. 

This part is actually quite easy for 78. He spent most of his adolescence and his entire adult life preparing for colonization, and survival skills were always something he excelled at. With all these supplies, it's even simpler. He has a temporary shelter set up in under an hour, complete with chemical lighting and a gas stove boiling some water. This actually might not be so bad. 78 is even starting to get comfortable here. Tomorrow he will dig a hole and see if there's any soil under all this sand. Maybe that farm could really happen. It will be lonely, but he has solar power, a wireless, and enough food and water to last quite a while. Surely a science vessel is bound to come along on an astronomical survey mission sometime in the next year. He'll wait here and get picked up. 

All three suns are long gone. The stars are brilliant; a vast sea of gems. In it float eight bright moons. They form an oblong disk as they drift across the black. In a few hundred years, humans will revisit this planet and look up at that disk and wonder what ever happened to the lost miner XB-7872. ",BroccoliMan42

The man scoops string beans from a bowl (two scoops each) and drops them on the children's plates, next to their chicken nuggets (5 each). The absence of protest from either of her children as they watch their father distribute the limp greens sends a slow shiver down the woman's spine.

The man sits back down and as he hands the bowl to his wife they exchange a glance. 'They know,' it says.

The woman grabs the bowl and picks at the miserable vegetables.

They had been quiet, she thinks. The children were asleep. She'd checked on them, right after it happened and twice in the next five hours. 

They had disabled the outside light - It had been dark in the garden as they dug the hole. No one could see.

They had been meticulous - Digging up the hortensia's by their roots, carefully setting them on the grass and putting them right back where they'd been after the hole had been filled and the soil returned. What earth had been left, its space taken up by a new occupant, they had bagged, binned and driven off to distribute by the waterside. It had taken them nearly all night, and by the time they were in bed the sky was turning a lighter shade of blue. Neither of them could sleep. But the children hadn't stirred.

They had made an excuse (a good one!) to explain why Lizzy suddenly wasn't there for breakfast. They had made an excuse, and Emma and James had bought it. They were children, after all.

But they still know, the woman thinks. And the knot in her stomach tightens. She looks at her girl, who's contentedly chewing on a nugget. Then at the boy, who's laying out shapes with his string beans rather than eating them. He was always a fussy eater.

The woman takes a deep breath in, and lets it out in a long sigh.

The man shoots her a meaningful look, then smiles. He puts a hand on her shoulder and rubs it reassuringly.

Suddenly, the young girl takes a comically deep breath, and blows it out loud and hard. The boy laughs, and then they all laugh. Even the dog joins in with a chorus of confused barks, to everyone's amusement.

The knot in her stomach is gone. The woman leans closer into her husband and pulls her feet up on the couch. The exhaustion of a sleepless night suddenly hits her like a wave, and she’s happy to let it overtake her.

“MU-UM?”

The woman shoots up as the girl bursts in, followed by the boy who’s awkwardly carrying their young black labrador. The girl points excitedly at the dog, stifling a giggle.

But the boy is not amused. The boy just looks at his father, then at his mother. 

“Why does Lizzy have a willy?”

His boots and overalls stained with the dirt and sweat from the day's work on the farm. His beard ragged, unkempt, and grey. With the light of the moon reflecting off the barrel of his shotgun he wondered who was worse: the zombies killing because of instinct or the people killing out of fear? The crowd approached the shepherd stopping about 20 yards in front of him and took turns shooting obscenities 

""Zombie fucker!!!"" 

""Necro-lover!!!""

""You're a burden to the human race!!"" 

The last one hurt the Shepard more than the other insults, it had come from a girl...no more than 6 years old and filled with hatred. The Shepherd took aim with his gun and fired a warning shot towards the crowd's feet, barely making them flinch. The rounds were rock salt, non lethal but also usually enough to scare off an angry mob that only wants to kill...usually, the crowd advanced slowly. Hisses and angry growling grunts rose loudly from the tall grass behind the Shepherd and chains rattled and clanked in the darkness. The Shepherd's flock sensed he was in danger and wanted to defend him, their barks and growls were enough to scare some of the crowd back into the woods. The more determined of the humans moved closer with knives, pitchforks, axes and baseball bats ready to kill. The Shephard fired off another round at the crowd, this time hitting an axe wielding former mayor in the chest, neutralizing him. Then the mob rushed the Shepherd, he fired off a few more shots, grazing people here and there before the mob finally  surrounded him, tackling him to the ground and taking his gun. More hisses and grunts rose from the grass as the flock finally rose up and broke their chains to save their master. 

""RUN!!! THEY'RE FREE!"" the Shepherd shouted to the crowd, he just didn't want anyone to die...that was the whole point of him defending the flock in the first place. One by one, the crowd was taken down by the Shepherd's flock. From a distance, it must have looked like the people were tripping and falling into the fields of grass surrounding the farm. In less than 5 minutes the crowd was incapacitated and crawling toward the forest at the edge of the farm. One by one, the farmer picked up the wounded and brought them to the barn to tend to their wounds.

By morning, the Shepherd's flock had grown by 15. 15 more lives to protect...15 more people that were more alive now then they had been as humans. The day dragged as the newest members of the flock tasted their first meals of their new lives...steak...as rare as it gets. They fed furiously on the cow, turning it to bone in under 10 minutes. The day slipped into night and the Shepherd loaded his shotgun again preparing to defend his flock from the next mob that would inevitably emerge from the forest.

""Watch."" He said, ""Just watch."" 
For some reason I felt a wave of trust come over me, I stepped back and dropped the gun to my hip. I kept a tight grip on it just in case. 
The man walked over to the tied up man and stared him directly in the eyes. The man didn't respond like the other infected, he just looked into the Shepard's eyes and let out a low grunt. 
But then the man did something I didn't expect and pulled a wallet out of his own front pocket. He looked back at me and starting going through the contents of the wallet. The first thing he pulled out was a driver's license. I took a few steps forward to get a better look and saw it was the man that was tied up. 
""Why are you showing me this?"" I asked, confused by what he was trying to say. 
Then he held up a stern finger and started looking through the wallet again. This time he brought a picture out of the wallet. He didn't show me what it was, but he did show it to the tied up man. 
I watched as the man looked deeply at the photo, he began to stir. That's when I saw the emotion is his face change. It was the look of total sadness. I watched as his eyes began to water, he started to groan mournfully at the sight of the photo. It was almost as if he was weeping. 
That's when the man who I thought was crazed turned to me with sorrow in his eyes and showed me the picture.
I felt my heart go cold, it was unbelievable. On the picture was the man and some beautiful woman. He was holding her tight and both of their smiles were absolutely true, you could just tell. 
""I told you."" He said. 
I barely heard him, my eyes were glued to the tied up monster before me.

[RF] Two friends go for a walk in the woods.,you-are-lovely,"I sat on the stone cold park bench waiting for Ricky. We agreed to meet here for one last walk in the woods that had left an indelible mark on our childhood. It had been the place we'd run to play in after school, or to just hang out in on a Saturday afternoon. And now we were here to relish old memories. 

I stood up as I saw him arrive. Not a word was said between us. I could read him like an open book, just like he could to me. We tracked on into the woods, hands in our pockets, on a memorable chilly afternoon.

""Time sure flies by,"" Ricky said. He exhaled a sad and tired sigh. It made yesterday's celebration party seem obsolete. For 12 years we were friends. We grew up together and went through the highs and lows together. But now that we've graduated, we'll have to go our separate ways. ""Remember that time we got lost?"" 

A smile pried at my face. ""Like it was yesterday.""

[IP] Theory of Machines,you-are-lovely,"Min watched as the titanic Eyyah rocks retreated into the steam rising from the shrinking shallows. If she squinted her eyes, she could see the shrouded cliff face shifting on the opposite shore. Min had never seen such a display of the Eyyah’s power. Wea, the only Eyyah the nine-year-old had known previously, seemed preoccupied with either guiding or conversing with the floating terrestrial parade before them.  Her stolid, metal guardian was huge in his own right, but now he looked like how Min must’ve have looked compared to him.  He had donned a jagged, stone-like appearance to match the massive sun-beaten red rocks, as if he was a child copying his older siblings.  Min giggled at the thought.

“What is so funny, Little One?” Wea’s soothing high-pitched tones tickled the air like the ancient chimes Min’s Ahppi hung outside his hut.

“You are so small, Wea!” she exclaimed, her nose crunched up in delight.

After taking a moment to process what she said, he responded, “I see. I am the little one now.”  

“Yes! You are Little One now!”

Min, holding her hands behind her and twirling her red dress side to side, found this role reversal especially pleasing.

“I do remind you that, though it may not seem so, all Eyyah is one. The same Eyyah that is in all the Earth is the same Eyyah that is in Wea. In other words, those rocks and I are the same being,” said Wea in his usual calm tone.

Min, still swaying, said assuredly, “Yeah, I know.”

But she only knew it because she had accepted it, not because she understood it. Since before she could talk, her Ahppi had taught her that “Eyyah is One” among other things she couldn’t possibly grasp but needed to keep with her before embarking on the Pilgrimage of Natural Intelligence. Or “Poni!” as she loved to say. 

Wea’s blue light was pulsating and becoming brighter together with the hazy blue glows in the cracks of the floating stone. The cliff’s rumbling, the water’s bubbling, and Wea’s high whistled warbling breathed and rapidly crescendoed in unison. Min took a couple of steps back. She knew something amazing was happening and she wanted to be excited but felt herself becoming stiff with fear. 

“Little One, do you wish to sheltered?” Wea’s voice was just barely audible over the increasing onslaught of sound. He had sensed the physical signs of stress in her.

The water was almost all evaporated now. In its place hot puddles and billows of steam impeded Min as she tried to get to Wea. but before she had gotten far, Wea was already there; hatch open. She crawled inside the interior and the door shut behind her. All noise was cut off.

Wea’s interior mimicked a hut similar to one from her village; it had the same conical shape, grass-covered floor, and wooden utensils stored in a clay jar. The only glaring difference was the colorful menagerie prancing, swimming, and soaring on the buffalo-hide walls that she had made into a canvas. Whenever Wea had taught her about a new animal during the Pilgrimage, a whole painted family of them would appear the next day.  She was especially proud of the porcupine family.  All those needles were quite tiring to draw. But now, as she tried to catch her breath. Min did not notice them or the rest of her creations.

Completely insulated from the outside turmoil, a recording of a violin sung into the placid silence a melody so familiar she must’ve have known it. Resting on the floor, with her red dress crumpled beneath her, Min remembered the days leading up to her departure.  The Eyyah had come to take her at an unusually young age. Her family had tried to reason with them, but the Eyyah were never ones to budge. There were many wary looks from neighbors, whispered arguments behind thin walls, and weighted smiles from her mother and father that were too woven in sorrow to fool her.  Ahppi seemed to take it the worst of all. He couldn’t even look at her too long before tears started to form in his eyes. Even though he knew he had taught her much about Eyyah and the Pilgrimage from a young age, all his didactic diligence could not help him weather the oncoming woe of separation.

“It is safe to go out now.”

Wea opened the hatch. The din outside had been replaced with quiet expectancy. Min got up slowly, using her small arm to protect her eyes from the light pouring in. She hesitated to exit. On the wall right above her usual sleeping place was the first family she had drawn. Using her free hand, she traced the outline of her father, mother, herself, and finally Ahppi. They were holding hands on a grass plain, smiling at her.

Min took a deep breath and turned toward the bright exit. As she made her way out, her red figure became enveloped in the vestigial steam. 

“Little One, what do you see?”

The sleepless nights. 

The endless amount of studying and work. 

I had spent three years planning for this moment. Three long, hard years. 

I was proud of what I was about to achieve. It was all planned...all perfect.

[IP] Visitors,you-are-lovely,"The first pod splashed down a few dozen miles off the coast of Florida. It crashed to the Earth with horrifying speed and came to a sudden stop above the water with its nose pointed straight up in the air like a SpaceX rocket. The only difference was the alien pod didn’t need a barge. It floated a few meters above the water, oblivious to wind, rain, and waves splashing against its dark hull.  

I always assumed the aliens had noticed the many human rockets taking off and landing near Cape Canaveral, and that’s why they’d chosen that spot as well. But experts say there's no evidence for that, and maybe they’re right. The millions of pods that followed were scattered evenly around the coasts of our planet.  

The first pod captured the world’s interest, though. I remember watching a live-stream of the coast guard ‘rescuing’ two drunk frat boys who’d been out sailing and smashed their boat into the pod. The pod took no notice. Later I watched a video shared on Facebook of three military helicopters approaching the pod and flashing lights at it. When no response followed, they blared sounds. There was no video of the fighter jets bombing the pod but they apparently caused no damage, and we were all assured that the pilots were safe. The imagery of the huge battleships arriving and encircling the pod was impressive. As was the reporter’s speculation that nuclear submarines were ready to attack if needed. But the pod seemed to care as much about the battleships as the frat boys.  

Two days later the lights on the pod turned off and the other pods starting splashing down.  

I don’t know why it chose me, but it became my personal enemy shortly after that. I didn’t realize that fact, however, until it was too late.  

The box floated up to me while I was sitting on a bench in a courtyard on campus, grading papers on my tablet. I looked up from the latest paper on The Impact of Violet vs. Non-Violet Video Games on Aggression because I had the unnerving feeling of being watched. The box floated above me completely silent and unmoving and, to be honest, a little hypnotizing. Its purple color was the perfect complement to my student’s paper. I almost jumped when the leader of a small squad of marines said, “Don’t move, sir. It should float away soon.”  

It never did, though. It followed me into my office when the Marines asked me to move. It followed me home, hovering just outside the driver side window while I fought the traffic home. When I pulled up to my driveway, I called my wife and told her I’d be spending the night at a hotel. It was small comfort that every pod had sent out a similar box to follow someone around.  

Three days of hotel living later, my lilac friend spoke to me.  

“Hello Professor,” it began. Its voice was a pleasant robotic tone. “They would like to extend greetings to you in the warmest manner possible.”  

I almost shit my bed. My marine protector fell off the chair he’d been sleep-resting in. At least he was able to call his supervisor and request help. I just pulled the sheets over my head.  

The box didn’t speak again no matter how many questions army professionals asked it until someone had the bright idea to have me speak to it.  

“Uh, um, wh-what brings you here?” I managed to stammer out.  

“They have authorized me to tell you that they have come to your planet for curiosity/science.”  

After many encouraging nods from the army professionals, I responded. “So they’re scientists?”  

“They do not have that exact concept, but I am authorized to tell you they are here for curiosity/science.”  

“I suppose that’s better than vacation/war.”  

No one laughed at my joke, not even the box.  

“I am authorized to inform you that a war would not be in the best interests of humans.”  

“Who is authorizing you?”  

“They are. The creators of the pods.”  

“And you aren’t them?”  

“No.”  

“Are you their computer?”  

“No. I am authorized to tell you that this box is similar to what you call a computer. It is also an authorizer. I can also tell you that I must stay inside this box and act as their messenger.”  

I was starting to realize that this situation with the box was even stranger than I thought.  

We chatted for several more hours. I returned to work. It watched me lecture. It floated silently above me while I typed emails in my office. It watched me FaceTime my family every night.  

I kept notes about all our conversations and learned what I could about the creators of the pods. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was missing something obvious, though. It was as if the messenger was trying to tell me something but had to do so in a way that the pod-creators wouldn’t notice. For example, one night after watching me FaceTime my children, the Messenger said, “The creators of the pods use a similar technology to communicate with me but no technology yet exists that would allow that type of communication with their home planet or any other planets they have visited/learned.”  

Was the messenger trying to tell me it couldn’t communicate with its family anymore? Maybe it isn’t employed by the pod-creators? Maybe it’s enslaved?  

“Why do they have messengers?” I asked it. “Why not just communicate with us directly?”  

“They have authorized me to tell you they believe a fellow meat-organic would have more productive/pleasant conversations.”  

That was the first time I really noticed that sometimes the messenger qualified its statements with ‘They have authorized me to tell you’ and sometimes it didn’t. Was there meaning behind this? Was it providing me with clues as to when it was telling the truth and when it might be telling me less than the truth because the pod-creators were censoring his message?  

“So, as a fellow meat-organic you’re better able to understand our language? Is that it?”  

“I do not understand your language. The computer translates for me. I respond in my own language, and the computer translates for you. They have authorized me to tell you that I am their messenger.”  

That was the first time I had the thought that the pods were some sort of inter-galactic or interstellar zoo. If there were a million pods, that meant there were a million boxes, which must mean there were a million ‘meat-organics’ inside. Or should I say trapped inside? I didn’t write the thought down though because it seemed too far-fetched. At least, that’s what I told myself. Now I think the idea was just too scary.  

Still, as time passed, I became more and more convinced the messenger was trying to warn me about something. 

“Perhaps you should visit your children.” It said one evening before the FaceTime session began.  

“You know I can’t. I want to, but we just can’t take the risk.”  

“I will not harm your children. They have authorized me to tell you they are here for curiosity/science.”  

Was this a clue? Was it telling me the pod-creators might harm my children? Was this a warning that managed to pass their censors?  

“Maybe tomorrow,” I replied.  

I relayed my concerns to my army handler, but it didn’t go anywhere. He explained that there were a million pods with a million boxes and a million messengers, and none had provided any cryptic warnings. My family was safe, he said.  

The next day my messenger again said, “Perhaps you should visit your children.” But this time, it’d said it a few hours before the FaceTime session.  

This message, to be honest, freaked me out. Was this a warning from my meat-organic messenger? Or was it a ploy by the pod-creators to get me to bring the box into my family’s home? My paranoia was real.  

“Maybe tomorrow,” I replied, again.  

“If I had that communication technology,” it said, “I would speak to my parents one last time.”  

I hopped in my car and drove straight home.  

“Honey,” I called out as I burst in the front door, “Where are the kids?”  

I searched the house in a panic, calling out their names every step of the way. I found my wife, asleep, in the laundry room. I couldn’t wake her so I called 911.   

“Where are they?” I yelled at the box.  

“I am authorized to tell you that they have enjoyed their visit/learn on your planet. Goodbye.”  

With that, the violet box floated away from me for the first time months. At first, I sat there shuddering with tears and holding my wife’s sleeping body in my arms. Then I remembered the Marines had been able to follow the box when it first traveled to me. I gently lay my wife on the ground and ran after the box.  

I followed it for miles all the way to the coast. The whole time I never stopped yelling at/begging the box to tell me what was going to happen to my kids. It’s only response was, “I’m authorized to tell you that I am their messenger.”  

I ran until I reached the beach. Standing in the tree-line, among the palm trees, I saw the pods blasting off.  

I sprinted across the beach. I dove into the water. I swam for as long as I could. The massive waves kept pushing me back toward the beach, but I didn’t stop.  

I swam until the last pod was gone from the evening sky and I was purple in the face. 

“How is this science?” I screamed. “HOW!”  

The next day the newspapers would say that the invasion went about as well as it could have for humanity. A few million children were taken but no damage to buildings or infrastructure. No loss of life. Humanity would move on with no lasting harm.  

Humanity would move on.  

Humanity.  

Not me.

[IP] Witch,you-are-lovely,"Thanks! If you've ever seen Supernatural, I was kind of picturing it the way that [dead angels have black shadow wings.](https://newstoriesoldbook.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dead-angel-wings-supernatural.png)",Luna_LoveWell
[IP] Witch,you-are-lovely,"Defallas panted and managed to pull himself up onto one more rock before leaning on his spear and gesturing to the others that he needed to stop. His legs quivered unsteadily, and only the shaft of his weapon planted between the rocks managed to keep him upright. ""Gods be damned,"" he growled after a few moments. His helmet went tumbling to the ground despite orders that he should never remove his armor around her. ""Do you really need to climb up this whole bloody mountain just to do some spell?""  

The Witch smirked. Despite her heavy cloak of raven's feathers, she hadn't even broken a sweat. Defallas and his three companion guards were all completely drenched and beet-red in the face. ""Unless you know another place where the Indos flowers grow, good sir."" Her gentle voice was like the trill of a spring bird. ""His Majesty commanded that I reveal the future to him, which is not as simple as it may seem.""

None of the guards really had an answer for that. Everyone knew of the King's obsession with witchcraft and magic; he'd spent years tracking down and capturing as many of the realm's sorcerers as he could find. From his pack, Defallas retrieved his canteen, gulped down water, and then poured a bit over his head. Cool trickles seeped through his hair and down into his stuffy armor. They'd already used up more than half of their water, but that didn't matter. They were so high up now that there was actually *snow* on the ground. And in the middle of summer! The witch could just use her fire spells to melt that down for the trip home. Defallas cast a sidelong glance at the young woman, who was gazing off into the clouds.

""All right,"" he finally growled. ""Let's get going, then."" She led the way up cliffs and rocky paths, always so sure of her step even on the steepest precipice. The guards, however, were not so bold. They required ropes and pitons to continue the climb, making the hike considerably slower. The Witch had traveled this path many times with her coven as a child, and it was just like coming home. 

""Why'd we have to get stuck with *her*?"" One of them grumbled while they took another break. A rockslide under Defallas's foot had left him dangling over a misty void, and once he was reeled to safety, had decided it would be a good time to stop for supper. ""The other court mages never even leave their quarters.""

The Witch pretended not to hear their complaints. ""Court Mages"" was just a nice way of saying ""prisoners,"" and ""quarters"" were generally *cells*. Not the iron-barred death traps that were buried deep under the castle, of course, but a prison is still a prison. Luxurious food and bedding didn't change the fact that there were armed guards outside her door every day. Thankfully she was the only one at court who knew where the Indos flower grew, and double luck that the King was *desperate* to learn what tomorrow would bring. This little jaunt up the mountain was the most freedom she'd felt in years. 

The guards ate a meal of crusted bread, smoked meats, and hard cheeses. Overhead, birds circled in endless wheels, waiting for any crumbs left over. The Witch picked flowers nearby while she waited; no one had ever seen her eat or drink. ""The path grows easier from here,"" she told them as they repacked their belongings and prepared to depart. A chilling wind sweeping off the mountain didn't give the guards much hope that that was true. But they followed her upwards anyway.

""Ah!"" Just as the sun was beginning to set, the Witch spotted a tiny purple flower breaking free from a rocky crevice. Defallas rolled his eyes; it hardly seemed worth the day-long climb, but orders were orders. He signaled to the other men to start setting up camp, and they immediately unrolled tents and sleeping furs.

After studying the flower for a while, the witch threw grass into a pile and then plucked the flower from its hole. ""You're doing the spell *now*?"" Defallas asked. ""Can't it wait till we're back at the castle?"" The witch waved a hand over the pile, and the grass began to smoke and shrivel with heat. Birds *cawed* loudly from the rocks circling the area, wondering why these humans were disturbing their home.

""Of course not."" She didn't take her eyes off of the pile of grass, which had now burst into blue flames. But the flower itself seemed untouched in the center. ""It needs to be as fresh as possible.""

The guards, having set up for the evening, all took up positions in a circle around her and traded glances. This was... unorthodox. But each one was too tired to really protest, especially now that she'd gotten started. If the crone had to find *another* flower, then they might as well just shove her off a cliff and go home to the local tavern. 

The flames arced out into a circle that licked the hems of the guards' cloaks. Each one of them took a step back, waiting for one of their companions to say something. But no one did. The Witch was chanting now, in a way that made it sound like a whole choir was humming and singing with her. The flames even seemed to dance and pulse to the song. From above, a bird swooped down and came to land on her outstretched palm. Flames flickered in its beady black eyes. Defallas looked up, only now realizing that there was a whole murder of black shapes flying overhead. 

Then the fire jumped up. For just a moment, the orange flames seemed to resemble birds taking flight. Defallas's cloak caught fire as if it had been soaked in oil. Around the circle, each of the guards dropped to the dirt writhing in pain and trying to extinguish the inferno under the metal plates 

The Witch lifted off from the ground with giant wings of black shadow holding her in the air. ""Your king should know not to cage a bird from the wild,"" she told the burning men in the same sweet voice. The crows cawed and cackled, and together they flew off deeper into the mountains, away from the four charred corpses and melted puddles of armor. ",Luna_LoveWell

[IP] Witch,you-are-lovely,"Renault felt the sweat beading up on the small of his back.  It was winter, so naturally he had worn several layers of protection against the cold under his armor, but the heat he could feel emanating from behind him was intense, and was making him very uncomfortable.  He knew he could not move though.  The Marshall's orders had been very clear on that.  Apparently any kind of distraction could disturb the delicate balance of whatever ritual the King's Witch was performing.  He heard a sound like a sudden pop.  It reminded him of something being pulled out of thick mud, and a moment later he heard the beating of wings and cawing of a raven.  He had to bend his entire will to the task of resisting the tempation to look behind him and see what in the world she was doing back there.  

""All right boys, I am finished,"" the Witch's clear pretty voice rang out like bell through the clear winter air.  Renault turned around to face her and saw that where she had been kneeling there was now a smouldering circle of ash where the grass had been.  She was standing there with a slight smirk on her face and a raven sitting on her shoulder.  

""Where has this foul bird come from?"" bellowed the other armored man.  ""Why do you bring ill omens and evil portents to accompany us on our mission?""  He was stockier and clearly older than Renault, but they shared the same rank as indicated by the insignia on their tabards.  

""My dear Sir Langley, this is no ill omen.  This is a friend of mine and I have simply called him from another place.  He is going to help us find our prey,""  the Witch's smile widened.  ""Now my friend here has been able to tell me that our little lost lamb struck out to the West towards the Pelenor forest after the battle, so if there is no objection from my gallant guards we shall proceed in that direction.  

""I 'spose not.  Just know that we are assigned to protect you, but the Marshall ain't mentioned nothin' about participating in your dark magics so if you need fresh blood to cast a spell you best look elsewhere."" Langley nodded resolutely and looked towards Renault for support.  The younger man remained silent, as he was still somewhat afraid of the woman who stood before them.  

""Hahaha, Sir Langley your knowledge of the arcane astounds me!""  Her laugh was not harsh or derisive, but more like an adult laughing at a child who has attempted to discuss a topic they don't understand in the slightest.  ""Trust me that it will not come to that.  Now let us move on!""

She swung up onto her horse and the men followed suit.  Renault had to stifle a smile at the Witch's jab towards Langley's ignorance.  The older soldier had never been kind to Renault so there was no love lost between them.  The odd company made their way across the remains of the battlefield towards the edge of the forest at a methodical pace.  They had to be careful because the field was still littered with detritus from the bloody conflict.  Most of the bodies had been disposed of but much of the equipment and other things, broken past the point of salvaging, still lay about like improvised caltrops.  

""So what did this girl do anyway?  Renault and I were out on the Eastern front when these lot attacked and we didn't see a thing,"" again it was Langley who spoke.  He seemed to be uncomfortable with the lingering silence of the dead.  

""She attacked the Kings men, there is little more to it then that, but I suppose it was the manner in which she did so that interests us.""  Renault noticed the Witch's use of the term us.  He knew that she was an important figure in the King's court, but it seemed he was only just beginning to understand how important.  He finally decided to speak.  

""I heard that she called down lighting from the sky and killed a hundred men at once.""  

""That is not far off, but is greatly exaggerated as the tales that pass through soldier's barracks often are.  She did appear to cast a spell of the sort you have described, and she is not of my order, so it interests me how she obtained the power that she demonstrated.""  

""I wonder why she was with those barbarians!  She likely cast some fell curse on them that robbed them of their wits,"" Langley chimed in.  ""No one with their head on straight would ever thing of attacking the Grey Keep straight on!""  He gestured to the killing fields around them as evidence.  

""That is also partly why we search.  This girl's motive may be more sinister than we could possibly imagine.""  The Witch grew quiet after this, seeming to ponder something. 

They continued on in silence for an hour or so until they reached the edge of the forest.  They paused for a moment and the Witch let her raven fly above the treetops.  He returned a little while later and alighted on her shoulder.  He cawed softly as she stroked his feathers and closed her eyes.  

""My friend has shown me the path our quarry took.  Follow me and do not stray!  I can feel an enchantment present in these woods.  It is probably something the girl left behind to confound us."" 

They slowed their horses to a walk in the woods because the undergrowth was thick and wild.  Most of the trees were needled and stayed green throughout the winter so very little light reached the floor of the ancient forest.  The Witch went first followed by Renault, with Langley taking up the rear.  Renault expected at any time for Langley to break the eerie silence of the sylvan realm, but he remained uncharacteristically quiet.  It seemed to Renault that they had been walking for hours, and that they must be approaching the night when the Witch held up her hand signalling for them to halt.  The remains of a small cookfire could be seen a bit further on in a clearing.  

""She was here, but she must have known we were coming somehow.  If she can bend the eyes of the forest to her will she is more powerful than I had though at first.  We must be on our guard.  Follow me, but leave the horses tethered here.  We cannot risk them bolting if we encounter a trap.""  She dismounted and her guards followed.  Renault felt a sickly fear creeping into his gut.  There was a smell in the clearing that he could not identify.  As they approached the campsite the Witch held her hands out in front of her and whispered several words in a language Renault could not identify.  

""There are no traps here, but this place reeks of magic.  I shall investigate further to see if I can discern what that cursed girl has wrought.""  She bent down close to the fire and picked up a pinch of ash between her fingers, smelling it delicately.  Renault and Langley set themselves at the edges of the clearing keeping a watch.  

""I can't see a blasted thing.  We would do better to have some light if we're set on continuing into the night,"" Langley suggested.  

""No!  No lights, not now at least.  She will know exactly where we are, and she is dangerous.  I fear she may have put a spell on the creatures of this forest to set them against us.""  A mere moment after she had said this a clear and bloodcurdling howl rose upon the frigid wind.  Renault and Langley unsheathed their swords, the polished metal glinting slightly in the little bit of moonlight that made its way to the forest floor.  

""Wolves!""  Langley cried, ""What now Witch?  I fire will certainly serve us as defense against those creatures, but it may be too late!""  He seemed frantic and unhinged.  Renault had fought through multiple battles with Langley and it was unlike him to show fear at something as simple as a wolf.  The howl rose again, this time seemingly from all directions.  Renault had dealt with wolves before, but he too felt a creeping dread building inside himself.  Something was not right in this forest.  

""Yes it seems we have no choice, light may yet be our best defense.""  The Witch  brought her hands together in front of herself and Renault caught a glimpse of what looked to be a spark kindling between her hands.  She let the spark fall slowly to the forest floor, and as it struck the ground it leaped up instantly into a blazing bonfire even though there was barely any fuel on the ground for it to burn.  

As the light of the bonfire was thrown out to illuminate the darkened forest Renault finally saw what they were up against.  They were wolves, but they were unlike any he had ever seen before.  They were all black as pitch, and at least three times the size of a normal wolf.  They circled the camp taking turns howling and bearing their wicked fangs.  Renault counted six that he could see by the light of the fire.  

""What cruel demons are these!  These are no beasts of the wood that I have ever seen before.  Gods help me!  Deliver me from these servants of darkness!""  Langley quaked in fear, and dropped to his knees letting his sword fall to the ground.  

""Now is no time for cowardice you weak minded fool!"" the Witch spat.  ""Pick up your sword or you will be devoured!  Renault plunge your blade into the flame.  These are creatures of darkness and you will need more than naked steel to kill them!""  Her words snapped Renault out of his trance, and he did as she bade him.  When he turned back around the wolves were advancing rapidly.  

(this is getting too long for one post so I will continue in another!)

[IP] Witch,you-are-lovely,"The first to break the circle of light was met with a gout of flame that leapt outward from the Witch's fire.  It struck the beast square in its broad chest and drove it back whimpering.  Renault had less than a moment to be amazed, because as he watched the Witch seemingly controlling the fire, another Wolf broke into the clearing at a run.  This time it headed straight for the kneeling Langley, and Renault charged forward to intercept it.  He was nearly to late, but as the beast's jaws closed around Langley's shoulder he hewed at its thick neck.  The stroke was strong and the creatures head rolled off into the woods with its tongue lolling grotesquely out of its mouth.  Langley screamed in pain and Renault could see that the wound was oozing a black liquid where the creature's fangs had punctured the flesh.  There was no time to comfort his comrade because the wolves came again, this time the remaining four all at once.  Again he saw the Witch sending forth a tongue of flame to strike at the Wolves that approached from the south.  The reared up and whined in pain, but some black rage drove them on.  From the north two more advanced on Renault and Langley.  Renault swung his flaming blade wildly in front of him, hoping to drive the beasts off, but they just circled him slowly growling and putting him between themselves.  He kept his back to Langley, but feared without his help they would be lost. 

""Get up you old fool!  Get up and fight or else none of us will survive this!""  His words were in vain and it seemed Langley didn't even hear him.  The older man's screams drowned out even the violent crackling of the Witch's bonfire.  

Renault steeled himself and let out a cry of rage.  He rushed forth towards one of the Wolves that was circling him and slashed wildly at the thing's legs.  His target deftly leapt over his attack repositioning himself behind Renault.  He heard another scream of pain from Langley accompanied by a sickening crunch, and then the older mans cries were silenced.  The wolf he was facing rushed him again, and he was barely able to sidestep as the creature's claws caught his hip, sending him spinning to the ground.  Somehow the thing's wicked talons had bitten through the steel of his armor and he could feel his own blood warming his legs as it poured forth from the wound. The wolf turned about and pounced at him again.  This time he had nowhere to go, so he swung his blade down with all his might at the beast.  The Witch's fire made his sword rend the flesh of the beast like a butcher's knife on a side of beef, and he was covered in the creature's thick black blood as its corpse fell on top of him.  Renault felt the wound in his leg throbbing, and the stench of the viscera he was covered in was almost enough to make him pass out, but he was afforded no such luxury.  The wolf who had finished off Langley was now advancing toward him.  

Renault mustered what strength he had left to throw off the carcass of the fallen beast and stand to face his enemy.  The fire on his sword was dwindling and he felt he barely had the strength to remain upright.  He briefly caught a glimpse of the Witch on the other side of the fire and it seemed she had vanquished her foes at some great cost to herself.  She was collapsed on the forest floor, covered in blood that he could not tell if it was her own or the beasts'.  He braced his sword in both his hands and bellowed towards the remaining wolf.  

""I may die tonight, servant of darkness, but mark my words!  If I do I swear by all the gods, that you will join me in oblivion!""  It must have been a trick of the darkness and his own fear, but Renault could have sworn that he heard a rasping laugh, like two burnt sticks rubbing together, come from the creature before it charged at him.  He leveled his blade at his foe, preparing for the impact, but just before he was struck a blinding bolt of black flew at the beast's face and stopped it short with a cry of pain.  It was the Witch's raven!  It clawed and pecked viciously at the eyes of the Wolf, causing it to rear up on its hind legs.  Though he was weary beyond all measure, Renault saw his opportunity and advanced on the thing, thrusting his sword upwards into its thick dark abdomen.  He was rewarded with an unearthly bellow as he pierced the beast, and the vile creature's hideous bulk collapsed on top of him.  He hit the ground hard, and was pinned beneath the thing's corpse.  He struggled for a moment, but all of his strength had left him.  He felt as if it had seeped out of the wound at his hip, and he contemplated if this was the last thing he would see as the darkness took him.  

(So ends the story of Renault and the Witch, well the first part anyway!  I think this one has some potential so I am going to try and continue it over at my sub /r/ka_like_the_wind.  I hope you enjoyed!)

The Great Hall could have been mistaken for a crypt, so quiet was the room. 

The only noise was the crackle of braziers burning with glowing coals, and the heavy, nervous breathing of the assembled courtiers. Their rich and colorful robes and gowns seemed at odd with the subdued atmosphere inside the hall, a muted contrast to the scenes of pleasure and pageantry displayed on the murals and tapestries decorating the space. Masked guards wearing the fish-scale armor common to the Undine lined the walls and entrances to the hall with tall ranseurs clenched in ready hands.  

A herald wearing the colors of his lord stepped forwards on the dais, his voice carrying throughout the hall. 

""His Majesty, the King of the Rivers recognizes Princess Faith of House Alathir, daughter of Prince Bran the Holy, Granddaughter of Brian the Great. His Majesty recognizes Hilary Flint, Captain of Rangers and Defender of the North.""

The pair moved towards the throne, the dark blue silk of Faith's robes blending with the green cloak Flint wore. The rifle he customarily carried had been placed in the care of a royal servant, ostensibly so that it might be cleaned and polished. No one bothered voicing the truth; there wasn't a Fae alive who didn't hate or fear firearms in equal measure. To allow one in the presence of their king was unthinkable. They allowed him his sword though, itself of Fae-make. It rested in its scabbard at his waist, its silvered pommel and worn hilt covered with scratches and nicks.    

Faith had spent hours preparing with servants provided to her, her nut-brown hair decorated with strands of gem-encrusted silver and stylized into an elaborate spray of curls and braids. Makeup hid the few cuts and scars she'd earned on the travails here and served to highlight her otherwise plain eyes.

Flint on the other hand had settled for trimming his beard closer to his jaw and allowing a few servants to wash and comb his hair. A few strands of graying hair framed his face and mouth, proof that time had not been kind to the man who otherwise looked mid-thirties. A tunic of dark leather covered a hand-knitted sweater, itself starting to pill here and there in places. A silver brooch pinned his cloak at his throat.

Seated on his throne was an older Undine, his long beard gone completely white. A mess of scars covered the left side of his face, burn marks from the look of them. His throne was a great thing carved from driftwood, worn smooth by centuries worth of waves.  

""So,"" he asked, his accent thick as mud. ""To what pleasure do I greet the Queen of Crows, and her Black Wolf?""

Faith spoke up. Though she barely came to Flint's chest her voice was even clearer and stronger than the herald's. 

""I come before the King of Rivers with words of friendship, and peace... and offers of vengence. The leaders of the Owl Clan and Kingdom of the Rivers have been united against the depredations of the Salamanders since before the Arrival. I'd ask the King of Rivers to honor that alliance once more. The armies of the Owl march South as we speak, prepared to bring the war to our ancient foes. I come as an emissary of my father, acting regent to my Grandfather. Will you answer our pleas for aid, and rekindle that alliance once more upon the field of battle?""

The King of Rivers said nothing. Gnarled hands clenched in thought as he stared down at the pair.

""You, Black Wolf, what do you have to say?""

If he was surprised at having been spoken to, then Flint didn't show it. 

""The inhabitants of the lands below the Lower Peninsula have always been the enemies of my people, even before the Arrival. The fact that they're invaders only makes it the act of fighting them all that sweeter. So the Salamanders are affiliated with fire. What of it? We're going to push them off their lands and drown them off the Banks of the Ohio. I'm told Salamanders can't swim. I'd liked to see that firsthand.""

The King of Rivers bellowed grim laughter, his beard hiding his shaking jowls.

""I'm told you Lakelanders are a bloodthirsty sort. Believe me, lad, if Salamanders could swim, anywhere wood could float you'd find their bloody lizard banners.""",LovableCoward
[IP] Witch,you-are-lovely,"She knows what happens next because we are the hurricane and we are the flame.

Her wings are wet when she returns home to me tonight. The circle of fire that binds us together reflects in the tiny droplets on her blackdark wings - she lands, alight with the flame on my outstretched hands. I hold her close and she rests her weary head against my cold, white neck. I know that the rain has begun and nothing will stop it until the wicked city is washed away. 

I know because I brought the rain. I brought the rain because I’ve been watching from a dark and dreamy world away. The night she first crash-landed into my arms, she cried and told me the story of how she came to be so battered and bruised. She took me to her home and I watched while her world was ravaged by fear and by hate. I watched and held her at night while she cried and begged for my help. I laid by her side and I strengthened my bond to her tortured world until I was strong enough to bring the rain that will wash it away. 

And now here is my darling, worn weary from the battle she so willing fights, traveling faithfully between our two worlds. Her wings beat ever so softly against the fate of her world, creating new and beautiful patterns when she flies to my side. She is shot from the sky time after time, and still she returns to me, bruised and sometimes broken. I hold my precious, wounded bird gently against my heart. 

I promised her rain. And after the rain, I will bring the fire. 

I studied her world while she slept. I mastered the laws of nature in her world as I have in mine. I learned to control the tide that is tethered to her beating heart and the winds that are now controlled by her sleeping sighs. She doesn’t know the power I breathe into her when we meet in her dreams. I protect her from the chaos that she helps me create by clouding her memory of me while she’s awake.
I have whispered my secrets into the girl’s ear while she sleeps. I have wanted her to know what I have planned for her world. I want her to know because our fates are now one and I know that one day she will remember. I need her to live so that she will continue to dream. In her dreams is where I find her, and from there that I work. 

When she wakes, her sheets are damply tangled around her bare legs. She feels something lurking, perched in a far corner of her mind. There is a light tapping at her window and she recognizes the soothing sound of summer rain. Pulling aside the curtains, she smiles at the kids that are already splashing happily in the growing puddles. 

“I hope you know how to swim,” she cheerfully whispers.

[IP] Witch,you-are-lovely,"An hour later and the village below was still burning, but the screams had at least quietened. Smoke rose from the settlement, caught in the wind and reaching the outpost of men and woman on top of the hill. It was not a natural fire. Roderick knew the smell of true smoke from his childhood in the blacksmiths, the harsh charcoal and wooden scent, not present now, a smoke without smell or harshness, he had stood amongst it and never needed to blink back tears or adjust his eyes, his vision was fine.

""This was indeed a magical outpost."" Roderick muttered.

""Was there ever any doubt?"" the Woman said.

Roderick tried to ignore her. He had been speaking with Benjamin, his fellow soldier given the undesirable task of staying with the Woman, and he would like to keep his words strictly with him.

""A magical outpost is one thing, but there were numbers here. The flames would never have amassed as much as they have with the individual sorcerers the women normally finds us."" Benjamin concurred.

""You seem to have an awful lot to say about me yet very little to direct to me."" the Woman remarked.

A few weeks ago staying with her would have been the most desirable task. The prospect of advancing ahead and engaging the witches and wizards that infested the Kingdom was a terrifying prospect, while hanging back and watching over there singular prisoner presented no obvious threats. With her Sister imprisoned back at St Pedros Castle, the Capital of the Land, she had quickly sworn to be of no threat to the men. No threat to their physical being true, but an aura accomonied her, one of uncertainty and fear, where in spite of her pleasantries her anger was obvious just by her presence. The terrible nightmares the oldest and youngest men had suffered was long suspected to be her doing, but none wer with quite the courage to formally accuse her.

By contrast the attacks had gone one of two ways. Easily or non-existent. In his first three raids Roderick had been in, he had come across a long abandoned settlement, a petty gypsy in a  tent capable of shattering her glass ornaments as they approached, and a pair of simple tricksters who'd managed to convince the some hundred strong street cats to descend upon the Knights. Roderick's feet were tired at the end of his sorties and his armour irritating from stray fur, but the Kingdom was no safer from the magical scum infesting it.

""Truth be told fair Maiden we are not fond of talking to a witch like yourself."" Benjamin exclaimed.

Benjamin was the bolder of the two of the, Roderick reckoned, Roderick was the more likely to make old age on the other hand he felt.

""You wound me with your words Ser.""

""Shame tis only words witch."" 

""It shall only be words, for you know that in exchange for my services in this Crusade of your King, my life is spared.""

""Indeed it is true, should you keep up your end of the bargain your life is safe.""

""Do you accuse me of something?""

""Now it is you who wound me with words.""

""Please both be quiet."" Roderick sighed, a little louder then he had intended.

There was an awkward pause, where Roderick tried to think of other things to fill the silence, a silence he he filled with stranger things if he let her. Weird things that he could not know or describe, just that they made him hurt.

Then, thank the Gods, there was a reason to be quiet, a noise in the distance.

""Yes, I hear it."" Benjamin said. ""Horses. Our colleagues have returned from glorious victory. Hopefully they have fun tales of magical scum shown the sharp end of a sword.""

Both ends are sharp, Roderick thought. And don't taunt her further. Benjamin was too slow to notice the magic about the way it was, and should he ever it would surely be too late for the all of them.

The two dozen horses trampled up in no particular order, there was confusion about them and a franticness about the approach. Truly this had been a battle.

""Get the medicine Roderick, Lord Dragston is wounded!"" A Knight shouted as they dismounted.

""And me?"" Benjamin shouted.

""You bring the wine, and the women.""

Lord Dragston was sat up against a tree, his breastplate removed to reveal a scorched blackened chest, the edges of the black cracked and seeping out an unnaturally pink blood. His face was pale and rough and when Roderick approached with the ointments he feared blood was seeping from his mouth. Upon closer inspection the wine was spilling out from his cheeks. He was drinking in hearty gulps.

The Ointment steamed and hissed against the burns and Dragston gritted his teeth but the screams seeped out. He was an old man, the leathery skin sagged and was coated in a silver layer of hair. After the innitial wash had cleaned the most of the burned poisoned flesh, he gulped down the first flask of good red wine like it was water.  Only then did his nerves truly begin to calm enough to speak coherently.

""What was that witch!?"" Dragston grunted.

""Those were the magical citizens your King so hates. Are you finally satisfied yet?""

""Ha!"" Dragston laughed, spraying red wine across the unfortunate knights near by, and the unamused Woman. Her pale complexion made the wine stand out.

""Do I amuse you?"" she said, wiping the wine from her face.

""Those were not true wizards. They blasted me square in the chest, a fully fledged shot from their strongest... and I'm still alive! If that had been a true wizard, there would be none of me damn it!""

Two Knights who had been with him the group tossed open a chest they had brought back from the raid. Books spilled out, old and brown around the edges with strange text and even stranger illustrations.

""We attacked novices! Trainees! Students not worthy enough yet to trouble the Kings Royal Kittens! Roderick!""

Roderick approached the scene, the tension palpable.

""Yes My Lord?""

""The suspicion we have long thought on is true, our unconsenting guest is not providing us any aid in our Holy Crusade, which leaves us only one choice, have you sent the daily letter!?"" Dragston ranted.

""No."" Roderick said.

""You are not to. The King shall receive no letter of our safety and her Coorporation, and your Sister Witch shall be dead by sundown tomorrow, unless you provide us with true information.""

There was a long pause. With every waking second the men could taste the magic brewing in the air, bitter and nausea inducing, it was noon in Summer but the world around them was a darker and colder place, unnatural sadness seemed to quietly scream around them.

She stood and began to walk to the edge of the hill where the crows gathered. The men had long since accepted the crow's presence, right now they flew close, and the Witch slowly defended to her knees and collected one in her hands.

For a minute they watched in silence, as the witch communed with nature the way only their kind did.

""I must bring them to you Augustus, there is no more time."" The Women said silently.

""I know, you gave us time, warned us, allowed us to gather and prepare, we thank you."" The thing within the Crow said without moving its beak. ""But the day is finally coming. How long do you think we have.""

""I will lead them the slow route. Three days it will grant you. Then we battle. Your numbers?""

""30 who can fight well, 30 who can fight, a dozen more who can slow down a sword with their body. Your numbers?"" The one called Augustus that was now a Crow asked. 

""25 in the advance party I lead. 100 more behind.""

""That is a lot.""

""There will be less when I start the fight. Many less. The foolish will go first.""

""Then may we meet again in my true body.""

""May the Gods go with you.""

The crow finally took flight. She was alone again. So very alone as the men surrounded her. They had now heard her silent communion and it was time to speak.

""I know where you can find a wizard, one of the greatest. You've heard of Augustus.""

""Augustus Ogre Scurge?!"" Benjamin exclaimed.

""Three days from here. I will lead you to him, just spare my Sister.""

A long pause as Dragston finished his second flask. He coughed up some red spittle and stared at the women for a time before finally answering.

""I'm going to kill Augustus Ogre Scure with my bare hands, and make you wear his head for a necklace, so every piece of magical scum know you are a traitor to your kind, and every good normal being know you for the scum you are.""

""And my Sister shall live?""

""You shall wish we killed her and showed you mercy instead.""

Three days later they made camp ahead of their destination, and that night Roderick dreamed of his men burning around him, flesh melting from their bones and the smoke not obscuring his vision a bit. He thought Benjamin was trying to scream but he couldn't hear a word from him, only the words of that one women.

""Run away boy, run far far away so that the flames of St Pedros look no more then a star in the night.""

As the morning sun rose Roderick ran across the land, his hands covering his ears so he could hide from the screams.

[IP] Witch,you-are-lovely,"In passion, he'd forfeited his soul.

At the end of an unsuccessful hunt, he'd begun the journey home through the wood. In the diminishing sunset, rays of light shone down on her, strands of her brunette locks glimmering red as her thick lips stretched into a wicked grin. Her honey-brown eyes danced as they sipped him in; her green smock hugged her full breasts firmly. Her feet were bare and dirty, casting onto him thoughts of her wildness. Around her neck hung half a dozen beaded necklaces, colored apple-red, forest-green, and sapphire-blue. 

She leaned coolly, resting a bent arm against the door frame leading into her shack. Had he been able to, he would have seen beyond her, into her living quarters. He would have observed piles of thick books stacked on tables; bones from various animals hanging from the ceiling; and jars upon jars of all sorts of substances, lined up against the far wall.

She offered a wagging finger, and he came to her. He dared not speak as she led him to her bed. There, they spent the next hour. 

She excited an array of feelings inside of him, from lust to hate to shame. The wine she'd forced upon him did little to dull these intense emotions.

The act completed, his wife hung heavily on the man's heart.

Suddenly, he flung himself over the mattress and expelled the sour contents of his stomach onto the dusty floor. She climbed over him on her way out of the bed, and, in the light of the candles she'd lit before they'd come together, he saw that she was no longer a beautiful, young temptress, but an old, wrinkled hag. 

She stood in the middle of the shack, murmuring terrible things, wonderful things, words that had never before met his ear. She raised her hands to the sky, and, as he continued to be sick, he watched the drooping fat of her arms tremble from her movement.

*Stop-* he begged between the infinite fountains of rancid puke pouring out of his mouth.

Stop, she did, and turned to face him. Her hair was white and stringy; her breasts, the necklaces resting between them, hung flat, resting just above her belly button; her stomach, flabby and dimpled, covered her groin. She smiled, revealing yellowed teeth. Yet those eyes, those honey-brown eyes, remained, truly belonging to the witch.

*What's-happening-to-me?* 

He understood, though. He'd bitten from the forbidden fruit, and it was rotten.

The witch had poisoned his wine.

Bonnie. Bonnie was home, where the smoke lazily floated from the chimney on a gentle breeze. Bonnie was pure and good and matronly. Now he clutched dearly onto a vision of her sweeping, the skirt of her blue dress swaying as she cleaned.

The witch ambled over to the wall with the jars and snatched an empty one up. As she drew closer to him, she opened it, then seated herself beside him on the bed, patiently awaiting his demise. All the while, she gripped the jar in her thin, long-fingered grasp.

Some time later, the moon high in the black sky, he rested on the floor, sprawled out in his own vomit. He was dead.

He no longer resembled the handsome, sturdy hunter who had come to her, but a man who had succumbed to starvation.

She screwed the lid back onto the jar, the jar that now contained essence of hunter, and nodded in satisfaction. After the jar was put back with the others, she peered down at the mess the hunter had gifted her before his passing.

Her life was never simple.

[IP] Witch,you-are-lovely,"It was still early. The morning haze tickled the mountain tops and danced with the patchy grass. It was unusual in character; a magical enchantment almost hung within the haze and taunted the senses at every breath. My eyes could barely see figures more than a arm's reach away. My companion to my right left just a shadowy figure. The companions behind and to my right I could not sense at all. Not the way I wanted to start my watch. Not today of all days. 

I suppose, though, it didn't really matter. My three companions and I were a spectacle of sorts. Our spears had not tasted a soul in years. Some days, we sharpened them only to stave off boredom. When we marched, no one ever came to meet us. Truly, no one now dared to come. Our names were synonymous to fear and death. We were the most ruthless of companies. Our weapon was *her*. With her we are invincible. Truthfully, though, we existed purely on her whim. The protectors she didn't need but kept for some reason anyway.

None of my company know her name for certain. ""Luna"", some whisper, is the name they have heard her called by the few she chose to speak to. Secretly, I studied her. Luna Lovewell, she called herself. Her tongue was magic and her words golden. The purest aromatic elixirs pale to describe her linguistic finesse. My companions thought her a bloodthirsty witch in a quest for glory. I know her to be like a deity of the spoken word and the invincible thought.

Today started like many before. Her words, this time, were enchanting the birds to do her bidding. I could not see how far off the birds were flying, but the fire near my heals told me her thoughts were fully engulfed in her quest. If a challenger was to take her throne, now would be the time.

Today, started like many before, but it wouldn't end like any before. Instead of idly protecting, I turned to face her. I turned to challenge my my wit against hers.

It was but a moment before she saw me. The glimmer in her smokey red eyes was truly frightening. I thought, briefly at least, of backing down and groveling for forgiveness. What crazy thought had gotten hold of me? Whatever it was, I would not back down now.

&gt; So it is you who challenges me?

The words resonated in my ears like little faeries carrying large diamonds of blood. So beautiful and, strangely, so poignant. Those words were all she needed to say.

&gt; Yes.

With a smirk from her blood red lips, the battle began.

But the only thing is that everything they do creative (be it writing stories or drawing) is incredibly grimdark and edgy.,ExistentialOcto,"I grew more and more uneasy with each day that went by. It was only coming to the first month of school and I felt I had to quit. Not because off stress. Not because of financial issues. No.

My kindergarten class of five year olds was full of psychopaths.

I still have chills shivering down my back about what Samantha wrote for her family project:

            Daddy and mommy always like to play games with me. One day daddy cut our dogs head off and used it as a hand puppet while mommy cooked my goldfish for dinner. Daddy was telling me jokes about how he killed his brothers. I like that joke I always hear it. Mommy told me to put away my dead cat and come and eat. Daddy said the fish was raw and yelled at mommy. He began to hit her on the head with our dogs head. After mommy passed out in a pool of blood. Daddy began to growl and bark making his puppet bite me. He's funny.

           Moral of the story is don't forget to cook daddy's fish. The end!

My stomach turns inside out just thinking about it. She even illustrated it with her dad and the bloody dog head hurting her mother. Disgusting.

If that's not proof Billy is another case. We all drew a picture for our Friday celebration and he drew a disturbing scene.

It was him poring gasoline over his dead family with slit throats. I asked him what it meant and he told me ""They should have let me play my game!""

It doesn't end there. Gregory drew of what his dad does for a living. There his dad was with a knife stabbing multiple women.

""My dad likes to kill girls for fun. He killed my mom and sister.""

It rings in my ears like a curse. All of my students draw these unspeakable acts. Blood. Death. Rape. Genocide.

Their only five.

As the class filled up sweat began to trickle down my neck. I took a nervous gulp and stared at my seemingly innocent class.

""Don't forget today is...""

I could barely let it out. Fear was overwhelming me.

""Open house day. I hope your- your parents are here to see all of your work.""

[TT] You are a kindergarten teacher and all the children in your class are very creative. Exceptionally so. But the only thing is that everything they do creative (be it writing stories or drawing) is incredibly grimdark and edgy.,ExistentialOcto,"Despite the warm sunshine, a chill April wind was blowing in off the Atlantic and Emily pulled her coat around herself to keep out the cold as she hurried towards the building that was the island’s only store and general post office.

She paused at the door, glanced at the paper in her hand once more, and stepped inside.

Mrs Macdonald greeted her with the usual friendly welcome.  “Good afternoon Miss Howard, how are you?  Did you come in for something in particular? We have fresh eggs today.”

Emily forced a smile.  “Um, no thank you, Mrs Macdonald. I… er… I wanted to talk to you about Jamie, and his behaviour in class today.”

Mrs Macdonald’s face fell. “Oh dear, has he been causing trouble? Getting into fights with Connor Fitzpatrick again?”

“No, no, nothing like that,” Emily said with a shake of her head. “But I was rather concerned about this picture he drew.” She laid the paper down on the countertop.  It depicted what appeared to be a giant man, crudely drawn in wax crayon. The man was on fire, and there were spiky things sticking out of it, and a group of people standing around to watch.

Emily pointed at the picture. “Those spiky things,” she said, “are people. They are trapped inside the statue and burning to death.”

Mrs Macdonald frowned at the picture then smiled. “Children have such wonderful imaginations at that age don’t they?” she said breezily. “Would you like a cup of tea?”

“No, thank you. Mrs Macdonald, Jamie is six years old. He shouldn’t be able to imagine this sort of thing.  Human sacrifice.  I’m concerned that he may be watching television programmes or playing video games that are inappropriate for his age.”

Mrs Macdonald chuckled. “Miss Howard, you’ve been here on the island almost a whole month and not noticed that we don’t have any televisions here? No signal.  And I don’t let him have video games. Children should play outside, get fresh air and exercise. I’m sure you agree.”

Emily sighed.  This was not what she expected when she accepted this, her first real teaching job since graduating from Edinburgh University. Stuck on a tiny island in the Hebrides with a class of thirteen children aged from five to seven, all of them apparently crazy.

“Of course I do, Mrs Macdonald.” Emily stuffed the picture back into her bag. “I think I will take half a dozen of those eggs after all.”

Jamie Macdonald wasn’t the only one.  Sally Fraser had drawn a picture of what she called a “hobby horse” but it wasn’t like any hobby horse Emily had heard of before. This one had teeth and it chased children, and would eat them if it caught them.  Connor Fitzpatrick had written a story about a little girl who had died and came back from the grave. The others too, all of them had drawn pictures or written stories that made Emily’s skin crawl.

And yet, despite what she had learned in University, these macabre pictures and stories did not seem to be a sign of distress in the children. They were all happy, well-adjusted, seemingly normal kids, who just happened to talk about sacrifice and death in the same way that other kids talked about football or kittens.

Something was very wrong on Summerisle, and Emily Howard was determined to find out what it was.

--------------------------------------------
A dark room is filled with cries of four desperate people and annoying puns of one other guy. 
""Let's play a game"", said a cold and rusty voice from a corner of the room.
"" The reason why all of you are here is because of your choices that have caused great pain and misery to others"", said the rusty voice as the room was lit.
Five people were restrained with heavy metal chains, making movement almost impossible. Eyes widened as everyone was beginning to realize what was going on.
""In front of you all lies an electric saw, which you must use to cut of you limbs to escape this room. If you fail..."", said Jigsaw, as he was interrupted by by a person named Wade Wilson...
"" You really have no creativity, huh,
 /u/Daarukan?""
Jigsaw was confused and irritated by Wade's behavior, but he continued anyways.
""...If you fail to escape before the time is up, these very chains will crush you to death"", said Jigsaw as his voice faded away.
All the four people were extremely terrified and begging Jigsaw to let them go.
"" Let me gooo!!! You psycho! Let me go!"", said Rufus, a child trafficker as he broke down in tears.
""What the hell is going on!? I never hurt anyone! I make comics! This is a mistake!"", said Stan, an old man who was very confused.
"" Holy chimichangas! I know you!"", exclaimed Wade while looking at Stan.
""Shhh..."", said Stan quickly.
""Who are you!? Let me go!!"", cried Ruth, who had killed 3 men.
"" Fuck it! I'm doing it!!"", shouted Max as he started sawing his left calf...

""Meeh! This is so booooooorrringgg"", said Wade and chopped his left leg and right arm. Wade casually tossed his limbs away and freed himself of the chains within a few seconds.

Everyone was too stunned to see what had happened but, nothing had prepared them for what was about to come. Wade casually hopped towards his severed limbs and picked them up and reattached them. The room was silent...dead silent. The chained pulled harder on  everyone's body and had started to crush them.

Jigsaw couldn't believe what he had just witnessed. He immediately switched on the speaker and screamed, "" Who are you!?""

Wade Wilson stared into the camera with the most unimpressed face and said, "" I'm Deadpool!""

""But... How!?""

""Haven't you seen the movie!?""

""Movie? ...what do you... How!?"", shouted Jigsaw.

"" Well you are in luck! Because Deadpool is now available on DVD on  Amazon for $14.96 only! Click the link to order: https://www.amazon.com/Deadpool-Ryan-Reynolds/dp/B01BLS9EVA "", said Wade while looking back over his shoulder.

Jigsaw was more confused than ever...
"" Wait.. Who are you talking to!?""

""The reader, of course!"", replied Wade.

Jigsaw was horrified while still looking at his screen. He was still in shock of what he had seen when suddenly, the strange man on screen disappeared. Jigsaw almost fell from his chair, "" Where did he go!?"", Jigsaw said to himself.

""How is he doing this!?""

""Teleportation!"", said a voice behind him.

"" Impossible!""

Jigsaw was too afraid to look behind, but he knew that the voice was of Wade Wilson.

The pain of hunger was nothing compared to depriving his daughter of the childhood she deserved. She had already lost so much. 

He lay on his back, patting down his jacket next to him for Ola. They stared up at the night sky. Abdul found himself looking up at the stars alot. When everything around you was just a cruel reminder of your sorrow, there weren't many places left to turn.

""You see the shape of the pot?"" Abdul slowly traced his hand around Orion's belt. ""Thousands of years ago, all of those stars were the home of Centaurs.""

""What's a centaur daddy?""

""Well, one day, a very powerful god decided that his people were far too slow for his liking. So he gave them all horse's bodies."" Ola started giggling at the thought. ""The centaurs no longer had to walk long distances to visit their families and fetch the water. They ran with the speed of horses, everywhere. But they were so fast, that they were always early and had too much time on their hands. So their god made them magic powers. The centaurs were so happy and thankful that they decided to thank their god by making him supper. Now, gods eat *alot* more than us, so much in fact, that the centaurs had to cook a curry in a pot made out of planets! So if you look closely, you can still see the giant pot in the sky.""

Ola stared in wonder then bubbled with joy when she found the giant pot. 

 ""Look you can see it!"" She gleefully pointed at the constellation. ""Tell me another one!""

""Well I was going to tell you about the planet I was born on... but I think i'll wait until you're older."" A mischievous grin spread across his face.

""No, i'm already older! You have to tell me now!"" Ola begged.

""Oh alright. I suppose you are old enough. Well, the planet was the most beautiful planet you could imagine. And I lived in a palace on top of a mountain. Back then, everybody could fly. We would fly around all day looking at all the beautiful things. There were fields full of centaurs and unicorns that were all the colors of the rainbow. And everybody was best friends. Falafel and Baklava grew straight from the trees! So noone ever went hungry. Well one day, I met your mother there."" Ola gasped. ""She was the most beautiful person on the planet.""
 
""I want to go there! Why did you leave daddy?""

""Well you're mother sent me on a mission here, to get you and bring you back to our planet. But you weren't supposed to know this until you were older remember?""

""When can we go back there?""

Abdul didn't respond immediately. He swore to himself he would be strong for her. He put on a brave face and smiled.

""As soon as we can Ola.""

"[WP] Death is so bored of his job, he had taken to flipping a coin to derermine someone's fate. Today, the coin lands on its edge. Three times in a row.",RedLanceVeritas,"He got down on both knees and eyed the floor with an incredulous gaze. Or as much of a gaze as a skull with no eyes could. Dumbstruck was a good word to describe him.

""Three ruddy times."" He muttered to himself.

He took a moment, breathing a small sigh of frustration before putting a bony hand onto one knee and pushing himself back to his feet. In a huff and leaned on the table and looked at the box.

""This happen a lot?"" asked the doctor.

Death not amused, looked at the doctor, ""No.""

""So what does it mean?"" the doctor said, pressing the question.

Death looked up, showing more visible frustration, ""It bloody means nothing! Not unless I can see it.""

The doctor scoffed, ""That'll ruin the whole thing!""

""THEN WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME! I flipped the coin, it's *generally* 50/50 and yet here we stand."" Death said, he pointed to the coin.

It stood straight up on the ground, right on its edge. The doctor looked at Death, a frown creasing his lips. Death's permanent bony smile taunting the doctor's gaze.

""If you'd let me see in the box, I could flip the coin and solve the whole thing right then and there."" Death proclaimed.

""The experiment is meta-physical by nature! The whole purpose of the experiment was to never know in the first place."" argued the Doctor.

Death looked at him, ""Y'know what, Dr. Schrodinger, I think you're a kook. A weirdo. And you called me out here just to waste my time.""

The doctor's brow furrowed, ""Your time! You're death! You're timeless.""

""Mhmm, and right now you're demanding an answer I can't give you because you're experiment hinges on the basis of something remaining unknown."" Death said walking out, ""Since you don't want to open the box, you beg for an answer. Seeing as I'm overworked, I've resorted to flipping a coin. A COIN MIND YOU! And the coin has given me the universal sign of 'I don't know'. Something it's never done before. Good day Doctor. Good luck with your kook experiments."" Death slammed the door behind him.

The doctor pushed off the table and looked at the box. His gaze fell to the coin, which Death had left standing straight up on the floor. He'd spoke of being bored and using coin flips to speed up a 'dull, unenviable process' as he put it. Schrodinger looked back and forth to see if anyone was around before hunching down to pick up the coin. He flipped the coin with this thumb and snapped his hand over it as it landed.

""He could have easily known. He was just toying with me."" Schrodinger muttered.
 
He lifted his hand up and saw nothing. The coin was gone. He looked around, astonished. Finally his eyes fell to the floor, and the coin with it, still standing on edge. Schrodinger took a few steps back before nodding slowly.

""How did the experiment go doctor?"" said the assistant.

""A little of column A, a little of column B. Not enough to be sure."" said Schrodinger, ""Just don't touch that coin in the floor. Leave it be.""",Simsar

I don't know what Stevie is smoking but this is definitely not great. ""You're a buffoon."" I tell him.

""You don't love it here?""

""Stevie, how? How are you happy?"" I ask, annoyed but a little curious as to what Stevie here sees that I can't.

""The clouds, it's like we're floating. The sun is out, weather is perfect. How can you not love it here?""

I don't understand him at all. The clouds hide the ground. I can't feel the ground. It's painful. My legs ache, I just need to feel solid earth beneath my feet. But I can't. The sun is viciously blaring waves of heat at me. I can't stand it. I feel like I'm being cooked slowly. 

""Oh!"" Stevie starts jumping up and down excitedly, ""Here he comes!""

I turn to where Stevie's finger points. A man glides through the clouds towards us. His beard long and winding, hiding most of his face. I don't trust him.

""Welcome!"" He says with open arms. ""You have finally arrived. Please just sit and relax, my friends will be here shortly to escort you to your rooms.""

He evaporates. Just like that. Creepy. 

""Wasn't that amazing!"" Stevie gleefully screams, diving into the clouds and swimming short laps back and forth.

""We need to leave."" I tell Stevie. He looks at me innocent and dumb. He's not going to survive out here. I have to look out for him.

""Why would we leave?""

""It's dangerous here Stevie."" 

""Well I want to stay.""

""We're going."" I grab Stevie's arm and start floating through the clouds in whichever direction I think won't lead to our ends. It's hard to tell though. Best I could do was make a random guess. All I see is clouds. No matter where I look, just clouds. For days and days. No ground to walk upon. Stevie's yelling at me now, he really wants to stay but I ain't letting him go. He'll thank me later.

I don't know how much time had passed. Maybe minutes. Maybe hours. Maybe days. Maybe years. It's driving me insane. Stevie was crying earlier but the further I took him the quieter he got. I think he knows I ain't leaving him. We have to escape together. 

Before I can float a few meters further, winged beasts pierce through the clouds.

""We're here to escort you."" They say in unison. Fucking creepy. Stevie jumps for joy and they grab him. No! I push towards him but the clouds get thicker and harder to sift through. I couldn't do anything. They took him. And now a few winged beasts come for me. They look like babies. But they can speak perfect English. It scares the fuck out of me. 

I try to bolt but the clouds hold me tight. They grab me and start dragging me away. ""No!"" I scream, ""Let me go, I don't want to go!"" 

The winged beasts pause. ""Don't worry. You'll love it here. Just stay calm."" They resume dragging me.

No way am I staying calm. I struggle hard until I break free and then manage to will myself through the heavy clouds. I do this all in a very un-calm fashion because who the fuck would be calm during a situation like this? Unless you're stupid happy go lucky Stevie there's no way anyone would find this to be a jolly good time. 

They swoop for me but with some well timed ducks and rolls I manage to keep out of their tiny hand clutches. I keep going. No idea where but I keep going. And they keep coming after me.

I don't know how much time had passed. Maybe minutes. Maybe hours. Maybe days. Maybe years. It's driving me insane. But I keep going. I hate it but I keep going. This is Hell. What did I do to deserve this?",Dark_Jester

It was embarrassing, too!  I mean, the other person's patient, they've done this before, they know how to help and they'll stop everything if I end up going spectacularly wrong, but it just feels weird having a professional do this.  It should have been someone I knew better.

Like, spilling-out-my-mouth-and-dribbling-down-my-chin wet. In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have sucked so much, so quickly.

Don't look at me like that. 'S not my fault. Like I said, my first time. Lots of people told me, ""You gotta really suck on it, like you're trying to pull it down your throat all at once. Hell, do your best to wrap your tongue 'round the thing!""

I grew up in a little Southern province. Didn't have much to do during my girlhood days. Straw dolls and bits of scrap metal I stole from my dad's tractors were the only toys I had. Not many friends either. Definitely no boys, least not 'til I began schooling.

Oh, and just so we're on the same wavelength, ""school"" here means college. Yeah. I was eighteen when I met my first boy.

""Hold it,"" I can hear you say. ""You've never met a boy in your eighteen years of life?""

Here's the thing: my family lived in the wilderness. Our neighbors were pine trees; we had more bears and eagles than we had dogs and cats. But that doesn't mean I've never seen a boy. I've seen plenty of them. Sometimes, dad took me to town. I just never really had the chance to talk to one.

Growing up, Mom never passed up on an opportunity to warn me about boys either.

""You remember this, Jade,"" she said one day while we were shelling peas. ""Boys only want you for three things. Two of them are on your chest, one more's between your legs. Don't talk to him if he only talks to them.""

""Don't ever follow a boy home unless he lives with the Lord,"" she said while she was aiming her shotgun at a bobcat.

""Don't listen to the first ten compliments a boy pays you,"" she said, while plucking thorns from my father's shins. ""He's only saying them because he wants something.""

""But you make Dad tell you how beautiful you look every morning,"" I said as I watched them.

She smirked and slapped him on the rump, causing him to groan. ""Compliments freely given have no value.""

Come to think of it, most of my mom's advice regarding boys started with the word ""Don't"". Maybe that was why the first time I spoke to a boy, I almost had a panic attack trying to remember everything she'd ever told me.

His name was Adrian. Grew up in a city. Had a car, a computer and a dog. He played the guitar, and loved pizza. I only learned much later how normal all those traits were, but getting to know him was a terrifying ordeal.

I didn't have a dog; how was I going to respond if he complained about Spot's behavior at the vet? I played a little flute, dad having carved it for me, but when he showed me his guitar, the only thing I could say was, ""Um, wow, nice strings.""

He thought I was pretty weird. ""Like a mouse trying to befriend a cat,"" he said.

Strangely enough, we clicked. We hung out in the library after classes, ate our meals together, and sometimes skipped lessons to go the mall. It wasn't long before the first whispers floated to my ear.

""Is Adrian going out with Jade?""

After hiding in my room for the entire day, missing all my classes and yelling at three different classmates to go away, I went to Adrian's room in the evening and knocked on his door.

""Are you in there?"" I said timidly.

He opened the door and frowned at me. ""What's going on? Where were you the whole day?""

""Can we, er, talk?"" I said. ""Inside?""

""What's the matter?"" he said as he shut the door behind us. Music blared from his speakers until he lowered the volume. ""You look really pale. Are you sick?""

""Are we lovers?"" I blurted out.

He froze for a moment, and then tumbled onto his bed, laughing. I simply stood there, not knowing what to make of his reaction, while tears poured from his eyes.

""Adrian, what's so funny?""

Suddenly, he grabbed me by the wrist and yanked me onto the bed. Before I could do more than yelp, I found myself lying on top of him, face pressed against his neck. His body was warm. Very warm. And firm. His chest was soft, yet ...

""I don't know if we're lovers yet,"" he said. ""But I have a surprise for you. Get up.""

He pushed me into a sitting position. ""Close your eyes.""

When I did, I heard him step off the bed and begin fumbling with something that clinked. And then I heard a zipper being undone.

No, I wailed in my head. I'm not ready for this. Mom was right. Mom was right!

""Open your mouth,"" he said.

Despite the tumult of fear and loathing, that little spark of curiosity broke through and made me obey. Slowly, I obeyed, even sticking my tongue out a little. Something with a round, knobbly end touched the tip of my tongue. The cold made my eyes fly open.

“Since you always wanted to try this, I smuggled some into the dorm today. But don’t make a mess,” he said, grinning as he brandished the popsicle before me.

""Dont be scared. It'll hurt just a bit""

I slowly bent over and tried to relax my behind. Someone had advised me to do that, it would make its entry easier. I closed my eyes. I felt its tip on me and without warning, he pushed it in. My body jerked forward with the push. Tears crept up my eyes. The pain was more than I had imagined. I could feel my ass pulsating in anguish.
He pulled it out slowly as if savouring the moment. He giggled at himself which made me turn my head,in time to see him dispose off the syringe.

""Seriously, Jessica?"" I looked at her mildly irritated. ""Right now?""

""""Yes, Eric. Right now.""

""Ugh... fine.""

I have to admit my first time didn't really go like I thought it would, but it ended up turning out okay. I think I had just turned 17. It was the beginning of my senior year in high school. So, yeah.. 17.

The town that my family and I lived in was just a pretty normal town. Exactly like the towns that you see on daytime TV docudramas that get described as ""a pretty normal town."" The high school that I went to was a pretty normal high school and I was just a pretty normal kid and yada yada yada. You get the picture.

My friends and I used to always hang out and do dumb teenager stuff. Nothing too crazy usually. 

*what the fuck? Is she writing down what I'm saying?*

""Hey, what are you writing? What the hell?"" I snapped at her.

""It's nothing, Eric. Don't worry about it. Keep going.""

Anyway, one day we decided to pull a prank on this history teacher that we had. He was areal pompous asshole. He always talked down to us and treated us like we were in the 2nd grade, not the 12th grade. 

We decide that our grand, master, prank was going to be to stage a carjacking. We were going to wait until the end of the day when he was walking out to the parking lot and pretend to hold him up and steal his car. We didn't really have much of a plan after that. We thought we would scare the shit out of him and then yell ""SURPRISE"" or something like that and all have a good laugh and maybe he wouldn't treat us like little kids anymore. 

""Eric, let me stop you really quick. What were the names of these friends of yours?""

""Uhhh..."" I thought out loud. ""It's been so long I can't really remember. Mark. Andrew, maybe? Ryan?""

""Okay, keep going.""

So, there we are. Sitting behind some bushes in the parking lot waiting for this guy to come out. It was a beautiful day, so we didn't really mind waiting outside. We smoked a couple cigarettes, played blackjack with a deck of cards that someone brought, and just kind of hung out. 

As it gets to be about dusk out, we see him. When he gets closer to his car, we all throw on these old winter ski-masks that we found in my attic and rush after him.

""HEY, MOTHER FUCKER. GET ON THE GROUND!"" Mark yelled at him. ""TAKE OUT YOUR CAR KEYS AND YOUR WALLET.""

The teacher, Mr. Brooks, slowly laid down on the concrete. ""I don't want any trouble."" he said. ""Please, don't hurt me.""

""Oh, don't worry."" I looked him right in his eyes. ""We are going to hurt you. Too badly."" 

At this point, Ryan opened up the car and popped the trunk.

When we tried to pick Mr. Brooks up to put him in the trunk though, something seemed *off*. He wasn't moving. or breathing. or anything, really. 

""Oh, shit!"" I yelled. ""I.. I think he's dead! We must have scared him so bad that he had a heart attack or something.""

Just as I was getting to the good part of the story, someone walked into the room. 

""Okay, time's up. We have to take Eric back.""

""2 more minutes. Please."" Jessica snapped. 

""Eric, Mr. Brooks didn't die of a heart attack. You *savagely* beat him to death with the tire iron from inside of his trunk. And those friends of yours, didn't exist. From what I have been told by people around the town, you didn't really have any friends at all.""

""Huh? What are you talking about?"" I asked almost sarcastically. ""Stop messing with me.""

""I'm being serious, Eric."" She said slowly. ""This is all true. I have asked you about this story many times and it's different every single time that you tell it. They have to take you back to your room now, Eric. We will try this again tomorrow.""

That was the story of the first time that I ever killed someone. Or at least I thought it was.

A sharp sensation coursed through me.

Then, the adrenaline. It shot through the entirety of my being. I could feel the tips of my fingers and toes start to tingle. Then came the numb.

A cold chill slowly crept down my neck from the base of my skull. It shook my being completely. I had no time to react to the flood of sensations swarming my mind in such a small span of time.

Just as I began to understand what had happened, the feeling was gone. The suddenness of it, the thrill and excitement, gone, like a flame doused. I felt my head go light, the lights in the room start to dim. My feet fell out from beneath me.

It was nerve wracking. I couldn't think, couldn't speak, couldn't feel. My breath was stunted and sharp. My chest was tense, and I could feel my lungs contracting in protest.

"[CW] Write a story in response to the question ""What was your first time like?"" Don't reveal specifically what you're referring to until the last sentence.",_newphonewhodis,"I was nervous, who wouldn’t be? 

I suppose it was because I grew up sheltered that I didn’t try sooner, but since I was 16 and people were starting to make fun of me for having not done it yet, I asked around. My friend Shelby, who is two years older than me, offered to teach me how to do it, claiming to have done it for years and that she’d done it with tons of people. I had a crush on her and readily agreed to take her up on the offer. We decided on a weekday in late October, the time set for after school and before her parents got home, the place was to be at her house. 

As the day approached, she and I talked over more and more the ways to do things. We discussed how some people went at it from behind, but she advised the classic approach for my first time, that I’d have plenty of opportunities in the future to change up how I did it.

I arrived at her place having walked home first to shower and change out of the school day’s clothes. She smiled shyly as she let me into the house and led me to where it would all happen. I have to admit; Shelby went all out. There were candles and themed music to get us into the mood. I don’t remember much of what happened leading up to when we started, but she clearly explained what would happen and that I should try to take my time and enjoy it. 
When I first wrapped my fingers around my tool and I felt the hard form in my hand, I’d been told it was larger than normal, but apparently that could be a good thing.  

“Okay, so you're going need to put it here,” Shelby pointed while another hand went to wrap around my own, guiding it and the tool to the designated area, “Go slow to start, pushing it all the way in can take time.”

I applied light pressure, feeling a slight yielding pressure back against my tool, but Shelby and I both smiled as the tool began to sink into the flesh. She crooned to me and released my hand to allow me control, her eyes watching me the entire time. In my eager excitement I soon I began to work at going deeper, finding that I was enjoying the strange difficulty of trying to pull my tool back out each time.

There were a few times that in my haste I pulled out too much and had a hard time finding again the hole I’d been working. I was working up a slight sweat and realized the end was soon, Shelby also noticed and urged me on with words I couldn’t quite hear as I focused on the final seconds. 

I found myself grinning as I felt the excitement and work hit its finish, gasping when finally, I was able to pull my tool out. 

Shelby wanted to show me how the inside looked, saying that since it was my first time, I should know what it looks like after that hard work. I adjusted as she moved some things around and got me a flashlight to see better. 

I’m not going to lie, it looked weird, especially the angle she’d put it at. Thick ropes of seed slimed around the inside, and spilled out with any movement. I was unnerved at how much of the gunk was inside. 

Shelby softly said, “Touch it…” Then she giggled as my head shot up to look at her with a look of shock at her suggestion.

“I dunno. I just thought I’d have to do the main bit, not do that!” My voice was shaky and cracked on the last word, something you’d expect from a boy my age.
“Go on, it’s got to be cleaned out anyways, and this can be really fun too!”, it was her gentle encouragement that had me finally reach out to tentatively touch the outer edge. “There ya go…now put at least a finger inside.” 

I cringed as I pressed my finger into the hole, feeling the slime and seed for the first time, but it wasn’t exactly bad. “It’s so squishy!”, I softly exclaimed.

“Yup, go ahead and play around a little.” 

Perhaps it was because I’d known she’d done this before, or maybe it was because she seemed so eager for me to do it, but I pressed another finger inside. Then another finger, then my whole hand. I was amazed at how easily my hand slid inside with the help of the slick inside. Shelby giggled and moved about a bit, whispering about how fun it was for everyone once they tried it. 

I don’t know how long I played around inside, but finally Shelby said it was time to clean out the goop and that while I could help, it’d be easier for her to do it as she knew how to really scoop the stuff out. I didn’t object and merely went to the sink she pointed out in a side bathroom. 

After getting cleaned up, I went back to Shelby to find the space all cleaned up, “How about we do some work with the mouth?” 

I giggled and began to get excited again, “Sure!” 

…

It was not long later that I had finished again, Shelby had done a majority of the work, using my tool with an ease that comes with a practiced hand. 

At the finale of my first time we were grinning fools; Shelby, myself, and my newly carved Jack-o-lantern. ",A_Sassy_Sammich

“Hello, Officer?” I timidly said to the officer who had parked his car in front of the house we were at.

This’ll be one hell of a conversation. Everyone here is either stoned, drinking, or both. All except me. We should’ve turned the music down, now we’re all screwed. And I’m stuck explaining this.

“Hi. We’ve gotten quite a few noise complaints from your neighbors about loud music. Mind turning it down?” he said.

I started to reply “Not a problem si—”

He was smelling the air. It reeked of vodka and weed.

“Officer, is there a problem?” I regretfully asked.

After a few more seconds, he asked “You have any alcohol or weed here?”

That’s it. Either I fess up, get everyone arrested and go free, or lie and risk getting myself arrested. I’m trapped. I decide to rat them out.

“Yes officer, we do. I’m the only sober one here. That’s why I came out to talk to you.” I reluctantly told him.

The officer pulled a breathalyzer out of his back pocket.

“Mind if I use this on you?” he asked me.

“Not a problem officer.” He used it, and unsurprisingly, I was sober.

“Looks like you’re clear. I’ll have to use it on the rest of your friends now.” he told me.

I sank. I didn’t want some of my friends arrested, they were all stoned and drunk too. I only had one option, I had to stop the officer. I glanced down, and saw a gun in his holster.

“Not a problem, sir.” I told him in the most polite way possible.

I shook at what I was about to do. There weren’t any cameras in the neighborhood we were in. I hoped nobody was recording anything. As the officer passed by, I dove for his gun. I pulled it out of the holster, and he fell to the ground from my force. I only had a split second to act. 

I pulled the trigger.

The safety was on.

The officer pulled out his taser, and instantly I was on the ground writhing in pain. He put me in cuffs, and threw me into his car. It was over. I was finished.",osterbergjordan

Everyone was too drunk or high (most both) to realize the E.D.M. playlist had long since jumped the shark and the laptop was currently auto playing it's way though the dark waters of youtube tracks best left unheard. The party started around six, a freak beer pong accident broke the wall clock at one and I gather another couple of hours have passed since then. Currently my only reason for being here is making out with the schools star quarter back on the couch and I'm doing my best houseplant impression in the corner.

*It will be fun* she said. *You need to relax and meet my friends* she pleaded. *I promise I won't have much* she reassured me. I break my tree like posture and take a sip out of my cola filled solo cup. At this point I'm only not drinking because the keg is dry and the group that left for the beer run hasn't made it back yet.

Someone came down enough to notice the laptop had been playing the first 20 seconds to Party Rock Anthem on repeat and started fiddling with it. I'm not sure if they realized the song they loaded was a Weird Al parody or not but it certainly added some much needed levity to my mood. That is until I noticed the flashing blue and red lights outside.

Flash forward, change the camera angle outside to see the door, and watch me be pushed out the haze with a broom handle like a goat to slaughter. 

There's a patrol car parked across the street, and a stocky man in a brown shirt and black pants stalking towards me. I clamp my  solo cup tight to my chest and go back into tree mode.

""Excuse me!"" He yells despite only being 10 feet away. I bring my solo cup to my mouth to buy time while my body decides to evacuate all the sweat I can produce in about 5 seconds. 

""Excuse me?"" Again. *What the fuck do I do!* I rack my mind for anything, anything at all that can keep me from going to jail tonight. I think I remember reading on Reddit once that you should never speak to a cop. That they'll frame you or something even if you tell the truth and are innocent. 

I raise my eyebrows high and point incredulously to myself, looking around as if I were standing in the middle of a stadium packed with people.

""Yes you!"" he yells. This guy was strait from the boot camp drill Sargent school of communication. 

I raise my eyebrows higher and bob my head with stammered nods. 

""Can you say something?"" as much of a command as a question. 

I think for a moment and dart my hand out with my fingers crooked and bent, zig zag them down, draw a circle and point to my ear. The cop tilts his head puzzled at my gesture before shouting once more.

""Are you deaf?""

I nod vigorously with a slight grin and raise my hand up, making a mouth shape with my thumb and index finger, throw out some one handed gang signs, and then pointed to my lips. The office furrowed his brow and pulled out a note pad and paper and began scratching furiously across it before flashing it into my face. Even his hand writing was loud. 
 
**I'M HERE BECAUSE OF A NOISE COMPLAINT**

I smiled broadly and shrugged, cupping one hand to my ear and shaking my head. The cop looked furious before a slight smirk crept up over his lips. He began scrawling again.

**CAN YOU SMELL?**

I looked at the pad puzzled and nodded slowly.

**I SMELL MARIJUANA.**

*Oh, fuck.* I shrugged absently and tried not to gaze back at the house. The cop leaned over to look beyond me and no doubt saw the haze of smoke in the windows.

""Let's you and I take a walk inside deaf boy."" He commanded and took me by the shoulder.

""OK."" I muttered, and he didn't seem the least bit surprised. We reached the door and he pounded on it with a meaty fist. The sounds of dozens of footsteps rocked around the building as the back door crashed open. I wondered how many would be able to make it over the 8 foot fence in back. Several faces also appeared in the bay window, probably too high to realize just how much trouble they were in. Among them my girlfriend and her boyfriend. Captian Loudmouth noticed them.

""I want you kids to see!"" He shouted and pushed me up against the door. ""What happens to you youngsters who go and break the law."" My arms were forced behind my back and I felt a cold snap of metal around my wrists before I was pushed down to my knees. ""Turn around.""

I obeyed and found myself looking up at the cop, only a mere foot away staring down at me.

""I hope this teaches you a lesson about partying."" he yelled and put his hands against his waste.

Then he ripped his pants off in one swift pull away motion, revealing a black tight thong. His shirt tore away and next thing I knew, Loudmouth was pelvic thrusting his way around my head with the skill of a seasoned jouster. Everyone in the bay window burst out laughing and the music cranked up even louder while I sat horrified by the gyrating man dong assault.

I looked at him. His eyes were red, his shirt was wet with perspiration, and he had the most idiotic grin on his face.

I looked around the room. It wasn't just Sam. Everyone here was stoned. Some had the idiotic drunk grins, and the others had idiotic drunk scared faces.

""This is bad"" Sam said.

*Oh look. He shifted to scared face.* 

""Bad?"", I replied. ""Bad is nowhere close."" I turned around and decided to take matters into my own hands.

************************************************************************

""Evening, officer. How may I help you?""

""I've been getting complaints from the neighborhood about this party. You guys are too loud, they say.""

The music was still on. Of course we're too loud. The music was rattling my teeth inside. 

*Fuck this. Fuck all of this. I have a house full of my drunk underage friends, I threw a party at my place which everyone in the neighborhood is going to tell my parents about when they come back next week, and I have to deal with all of this alone.*

I took a deep breath. I had to calm myself.

""Yes. It is loud. I'm sorry, officer. Let me just go turn it down.""

""How old are you, kid?"" The policeman asked.

The moon was shining down. There was a soft breeze blowing. The entire neighborhood was eerily quit except for Miley Cyrus back at my place singing how she couldn't stop. You couldn't even hear the crickets.

*Of course we're too loud*

""Why do you ask, officer?"" I said. I tried looking confident.

""Because I smell booze all over you.""

""But I don't drink.""

""How old are you?"" he asked again, sterner this time.

*Not old enough*

""I'm 16.""

""Looks like we've got a WHOLE new problem here.""

*Is he smirking?*

""Should I go turn the music down? We can talk after I let my neighbors sleep.""

He chuckled. 

""You are loud, yes. But your drunk, kid. All of you probably are, right?

I stayed silent. I had to calm myself down and think more clearly. There has to be a way to keep him outside. I looked him in the eye. He was old, probably in his fifties. He had a mole on his left cheek, just next to his pointy small nose. He had blonde hair with pale blue eyes.

""No.""

""Only some of you?""

""None of us.""

He chuckled again. This time he didn't reply. He walked back to his car, opened the door and bent inside, reaching for something.

He returned with a big digital stopwatch.

""Put this in your mouth."" He said. Showing me the small tube at the corner of the device. 

""Why should I?""

He raised his eyebrows and smirked again. 

""Because I said so. Your not drunk, eh? Put this breathalyzer in your mouth.""

I obeyed. He bent close to see the display. I could smell smoke.

*This guy smoked a cigarette. Maybe I could use this against him.*

He pulled the device out and gave it one last look.

""You clean.""

*Hallelujah.*

""I have to look inside for the drunk ones, I guess.""

""Do you have a warrant to check my house?""

The music stopped. Someone must still have a few senses left inside.

He let out a huge bellowing laugh.

""Look, kid. Don't try to be tough or witty, you suck at both. Now I could call in some backup and get a damn warrant, but then you can expect a lot more trouble.""

He was lying. There was going to be trouble anyway. By now everyone must have left through the back door, over the backyard fence like I planned. I just needed more time.

""I don't want trouble, officer. Not with the Law, of- ""

**BAM**

A shot fired. I turned around and looked at the house. A woman across the street let out a shriek from her window. I looked down. The policeman laid there motionless with blood splattered all over his neck and uniform. More oozed out from his face. He had been shot.

I shrieked too and fell to my knees. I don't remember how long but by the time I was back to my senses I saw the entire neighborhood was up. More people were shouting. Behind me, in front of me, everywhere. I heard police car sirens in the distance.

*Who did this? Did someone from the party use Dad's shotgun? Everyone was drunk back there. Who did it? Who?*

""Are you Michael Mckenzie?"", someone said. It was a deep, calm voice.

I looked up. There was a man standing infront of me. He was tall, white and clean shaven. He had a black jacket on and blue ripped jeans. He wore sunglasses and huge leather boots.

""Y-Yess"" I managed. I noticed he had a pistol in his hand.

"[RF] You are at a high school party where everyone is stoned and drinking except for you. When the cops arrive due to the noise level, you are given the task to go outside and speak to them because you are the only sober one.",inksmudgedhands,"The party had spilled out onto the screened in porch of Dave’s doublewide. Someone had turned the stereo up as loud as it would crank, banging out a slightly distorted indie tone by a group called White Poppy. Several of the cowboy boot wearing, wide-brimmed hatted 4H crowd were shooting beer cans off each other’s heads with Airsoft guns. Empty and half-empty bottles were everywhere and the air was thick with weed. In other words, this was exactly the scene Mei-Mei would have loved six … hell, even three … months ago. But then she broke down the door of her house after her mom locked her out. And when the cops came, she threatened to break her mom’s arm when they were pulling her and her mom apart to stop their drunken slap fight.

She’d ended up in juvenile hall after the court piled on some truancy charges and her mom stood up and testified that Mei-Mei was incorrigible. In an odd way, it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to her. The counselor assigned to her case somehow crawled inside her head. She started actually paying attention in the classes and he arranged for her to take weekly tests in an accelerated pace. When she’d gone into juvenile, she was a second semester junior with the credits of a freshman and a wall of F’s on her transcript. When she got out of juvie she was on track to graduate. Plus, she’d gotten drug and alcohol counseling. It was supposed to be a family based treatment program, but her mom refused to show up. Her older brother had come though and suddenly they were talking for the first time in years. 

“Shit!” The loud word snapped Mei-Mei out of her reverie and she realized that everyone here was drunk and panicking. One of the 4H boys screamed, “The cops are here.” He started to walk outside waiving his Airsoft guns, but his friends quickly pulled him onto the broken down, once-upon-a-time-white couch.

Mei-Mei laughed and thought, great way to get killed. Just then Dave came up and said, “Hey, Mei-Mei babe, you know cops. Go talk em down.” 

Mei-Mei rolled her eyes. Yeah, she knew cops. “Whatever,” she finally said and headed outside. Flashing lights lit up the front lawn. Well, front lawn was too bold a description. It was mainly dirt with patches of weeds and crab grass. Dogs were barking like crazy and she knew what the cops were thinking as the flashlights hit her pierced and tattooed body with one side of her black hair shaved and the other partially dyed. 

“People were just having fun officer,” she called out. “We’ll tone down the noise.” The two sheriff’s deputies, San Bernardino County’s finest, were actually pretty damn cool. Dave got everyone settled down and turned off the music. But then they asked for Mei-Mei’s ID and ran her name through their in-car computer. 

Bingo! Moments later, silver handcuffs were snapping around her wrists and she found herself once again being shoved into a police car. Why? Why the hell did I come over to Dave’s? she asked as the patrol car pulled away. Her last sight was of her “friends” making drunken cat calls and flashing their butts and generally being asses. She knew she was headed back to juvenile hall on a parole violation. I was really looking forward to school, she thought almost amazed. She knew the next time she would see freedom; it would be her eighteenth birthday when they handed her $120 and booted her out of the system.

This monster has always taken the form of the women you desire most in your life.",nathanguitarman,"When a human is cold their body redirects blood flow from their exterior to their internal organs. That's why people look pale around Christmas. It's natural then, that people warm up their exteriors then. They bundle up with blankets and they huddle around the fireplace. That's all very normal. However, they also drink hot coco and eat warm chestnuts to warm up their insides. 

Why?

Why are people not satisfied with their own warmth? Why can people not keep themselves warm? Why do we need anything? Why can't we exist alone?

Most people feel that college is where they are alone for the first time. It's a romanticized time of adventure and growth. But they are not truthfully alone. 

""A care package from home"" ""I can't wait to get home for the holidays"" ""Mom's going to be totally pissed about my grades""

Mom. Pissed. How delightful, to have someone care about you. My mom stopped caring about me when the cord got cut! Imagine that, no mom all this time. Except that's not true. She's been here all this time. 

""Second place in the spelling bee, your mother must be proud!"". No she's not. She's not even here right not. There is no second place for heroin.

""Accepted to Yale, you've always been so motivated, so destined for greatness!"" Motivated? Is a baby rabbit, running from the fox of it's past motivated? Is surviving one more milestone great?

Other students thank their mothers, credit their mothers with their success. I am ashamed of where I came from, succeed in spite of my heritage. College is a time when most break free of their loving mothers, but I would give everything to be warmed by my monster's embrace.",lotusblotus

Rebecca sits at the edge of your bed. “I know you aren’t real”, you slur as you begin to wake. Normally a person sitting on your bed would startle you. But not Rebecca. Rebecca died three months ago. And yet, you aren’t afraid to see her there. Whether or not you have truly gone crazy seems to matter little to you. This being that has stolen her image relieves you. They often talk back to you, just like Rebecca would. They smile just like she used to smile when you held her. She knows you, just like Rebecca knew you.

“You need to wake up for work Michael.” You wonder if this will ever stop. These visions have been happening for two months now. You catch your reflection in the mirror. Bags under your eyes, hair falling out, you look a mess. You quickly open your cabinet and cycle through the 4 medications you have been taken since Rebecca died. While the pills help numb you to the reality most days, they don’t seem to relieve your visions. 

“Join me Michael”. Five months have passed now since she left. The visions of Rebecca have turned more monstrous as time has gone on. What once was a relieving visit by the love that you lost, has turned into a haunting. You are unable to remove the images from your head. She now stares at you with her disfigured face after the accident. This time, you mix your pills with alcohol. This time you don’t count. You begin to feel sleepy. You know you will soon join her. You know the visions will soon stop. You close your eyes. And sleep.

""This. Explains....so much."" He said quietly, ""All those breakups.""

She nodded. ""You've helped me grow a lot. I used to fly off the handle over stupid little stuff and get super jealous about every little thing.""

""Yeah, that's no joke."" He said bitterly, ""You've always hated Rita.""

""I don't *hate* Rita. She's cool. I just think she wants you as way more than a friend and you're too blind to see it."" She straightened, lifting her chin, ""But I'm a bigger woman now. I understand that she's just a friend to you and I'm not jealous anymore.""

""Is that what this was all about?"" he snapped, ""Some experiment to make you a better person?""

""Partially."" She admitted, ""But let's be perfectly honest, babe; you weren't always a peach yourself.""

He looked back at her in stunned disbelief.

""You're going to call me out, right now?"" He said, voice rising, ""After everything else.""

""It needs to be said, that's all."" She said, putting up her hands, ""I had to go through Mary and Sandra just to give you a little confidence around pretty girls. And it took a year as Tina to get you over that little drinking problem.""

Another furious blush. He hadn't always been Prince Charming, he supposed. Unbidden, memories of fights, petulant tantrums and all the times he'd flirted with other girls when he had a perfectly good one came to him. He didn't want to admit it, but she had a point.

""So why me then?"" He asked, ""If I was so immature, why'd you go to all this trouble to stick with me. With your talents and money you could have anyone you wanted.""

""Because I wanted you, stupid."" She said gently.

""Yeah, apparently. But why? What's so special about me.""

She reached out and took his hand. ""Because you really, genuinely loved a little fat girl back when most guys wouldn't give her a second look. You were always nice to her and you stood up for her when other people picked on her. I never forgot that. And even though we all have our flaws, you're a pretty great guy. You just needed a little time to iron out.""

He found himself absurdly touched. He took a drink of his beer, considering it.

""Anyway, it didn't feel right to keep lying to you. And I've switched things up enough times that I wanted something to stick. I'm too happy with you right now to go through the change again.""

""So why tell me at all?"" Alex asked, ""I'd have been happier with you if I never knew."" 

""Maybe, but I wouldn't. It'd have meant cutting off from my family and I don't think I could have handled the guilt.""

There was a playful twinkle in her eye, ""Besides....this little gift of mine has some  bedroom applications that I'm just dying to explore.""

Alex choked on a gulp of beer at that, almost spitting it out. It drew a giggle from Monica (or Jessica, he supposed).

She grew more serious. ""Look..."" She said, ""I know that what I've done is pretty messed up. And I've lied to you for a really long time. But if you can find a way to forgive me, I think it'd be like we were old high school sweethearts. We did sorta grow up together.""

He could see it then. There was longing in her eyes, and a very sincere remorse. There was affection as well. It almost undid him, and he took a deep breath to steady himself.

""Alright..."" He said quietly, ""But what do I call you? What are you going to look like?""

""You can call me Jess."" She said, breathing enormous relief, ""And I'll look like anything I want to. Or I guess anything you want. I kind of owe you after...""

Alex smiled, putting up a hand to stop her.

""That's okay. Monica's the one I really fell in love with."" He said, ""This is going to take a *lot* of getting used to.""

"[WP] The main character just found out that their significant other is not only a shapeshifter, but also every person they've ever dated.",project_matthex,"I did it, I finally told him. I apologized for not telling him sooner.

The look on his face was bringing tears to my eyes. He looked as if I just simultaneously told him Santa wasn't real and his dog Happy didn't go to a farm to live happily ever after. It's such a morbid mix between bewilderment and betrayal. I wonder if Julius Caesar had a similar face when he spoke the words ""Et tu, Brute?"" As I stared at his face, I wished with all my might he could understand why I did what I did.

I've only ever had two boyfriends. My first boyfriend Brad, was a total lunatic. On the surface, he was the perfect man. He was absolutely charming, with dark brown hair the color of oaken tables, and dark eyes to match. I loved his neatly groomed haircuts, and the 5 o'clock shadow he seemed to always perfectly trim. But despite how gorgeous he was on the surface, he had demons deep inside his heart.

Behind closed doors, he was downright abusive. He spoke to me like he owned me, and told me daily how worthless I was. I hated his nickname for me, sweet cheeks. He always objectified me in front of others by calling me sweet cheeks, and smacking my ass. He verbally beat me into submission, to the point where I felt scared and hopeless and trapped. I fell into a depression, and I just went through the motions to try to appease him. I let him rape me sexually whenever he wanted, because it always improved his mood. Occasionally after sex, he'd let me go to my favorite little French café, where I'd have a cup of French vanilla cappuccino and some biscuits. It was the only time I ever felt alive during our relationship.

One cold chilly night, after I refused sex due to the gut wrenching pain from my period, he backhanded me across the face. It was the first time he physically assaulted me. It stung, and my face felt red hot, like it had been burned by the summer sun. I ran into the bathroom crying, and locked the door. In that moment, all I wanted was to escape and run away. I think my fear and desperation is what awoke my dormant shapeshifting powers.

I shapeshifted for the first time. I became another woman. This was my salvation.

I didn't shapeshift to lie, or to deceive. I shapeshifted for self preservation, to escape Brad. I shapeshifted out of necessity, and it became second nature. The worst I've done was shapeshift in a side aisle at Costco, to double back for a second sample. I never shapeshifted with any malicious intent, and it was the same when it came to John.

After I escaped Brad, I stayed in an altered form constantly. I only ever returned to my original form to recharge for 10 minutes a day, before going back into hiding. I was mortified of going outside at first, but gradually realized Brad wouldn't even recognize me. I began to frequent my favorite little French café, and never saw Brad again.

I'm glad I did, because that's actually where I met John. He was sitting alone with his short, beach blonde hair, and his scruffy facial hair. He had bright blue eyes, that looked like the ocean, and they were intently staring down into one of my favorite books. I saw him a few more times, before I asked him nervously if he was enjoying the Game of Thrones books. We chitchatted, and he seemed to know everything about me and we clicked instantly. We were soulmates, made for each other. I fell madly in love.

That's why I shapeshifted every time we broke up, and found him again. To fall in love with him again. I couldn't lose him, and I couldn't live without him. We fought and broke up over the dumbest things. He would close off, but I always came back to him as another woman. Someone he'd find attractive, and someone he could open up to again. It was a vicious cycle, and he's loved me as four different women now.

And then it hit me. That's a justification he would understand. The words formed in my head, and finally came out.

""John, I know I've deceived you, but I did it out of love. You've loved me as four different women. Isn't that proof enough that we're meant to be together? Doesn't that justify what I've done to preserve our love? You've fallen in love with me four separate times!""

He looked at me, with a blank face, and a smile began to form at the corners of his lips. His eyes narrowed, and suddenly, I didn't recognize him anymore. The hair on his head and face started darkening, as he stared at me with cold threatening eyes.

""Oh I understand. And you've fallen in love with me twice now... Sweet cheeks.""",Lfehova

I guess I'll work on balancing the hints toward the twist so that it makes more sense in the future, and making sure the hints aren't obvious until the twist happens.

The goal being, wow I did not see that coming but man do all those things make sense.

One thing to note though, I left the story up to interpretation.

In my imagination, Brad changed into the innocuous John, and camped out her favorite cafe with her favorite book, looking for her. Maybe he saw the error in his ways, wanted a second chance so he shapeshifted. I mentioned it seemed like he knew everything about her, which he should after being in a relationship with her. But maybe he was never sure if it was her or not, maybe he didn't know if there were any other shapeshifters. 

Maybe he's changed and a better man. She is traumatized by his reveal because she fears the old him. Maybe she decides to give him a chance.

There's a whole lot of possibilities that could be explored and fleshed out, but I just didn't have the time on my lunch break to type it all out. Nor do I expect anyone wants to read some epic novel on Reddit lol. So I left it up to the reader to interpret :)",Lfehova

""Naw, she is the the jealous type,"" he smirks, knowing it's a lie. ""Anyways she'll never find out about us getting some drinks here and there."" It's always the same with him. You would think pretty blond secretaries fell from trees as often as he tries to seduce them. 

-----------

""Honey, I'm home!"" Here he comes, the man of the century! Fresh from banging his assistant in the handicap stall of the bar bathroom. I actually barely made it home before him this time. Usually I get him to get me a drink when he tells me he needs to make it home for dinner and disappear, but this time I lingered. I guess because it's time. He deserves to know. 

""Happy anniversary babe! Ten whole years married, it's a big one!"" Being Leslie the housewife is getting boring. I'm bored, he's bored, and nobody's happy, which is probably why he cheats.  I lean in to give him a chase kiss. Nothing like what the buxom blond was just doing with her lips and tongue. ""I have a present for you.""

""Oh, our anniversary, right, I mean, I remembered..."" He never remembers. 

""I know you did honey, but let me give you your present first. It's going to be unforgettable!"" He looks nervous. ""Close your eyes,"" I whisper in his ear, reflecting how his assistant touched him earlier today. He complies, but is wringing his hands. I guess the countless women he has cheated on me with has been wearing on him. 

I take a step back, whirl around to change my shape into Ashlee the secretary, complete with sexy lingerie and fuck me heels. ""Ok, open!"" John's eyes pop open and he stumbles backwards. 

""Oh, shit! You can't be here. Oh, shit""

""Relax babe, it's me! Leslie."" He's looking around bewildered. Maybe I shouldn't have sprung this on him. Maybe I should have just settled for a divorce and a new skin to walk around in, but this does seem more fun, and I'm desperate for some fun. 

""What... What do you mean?"" 

Ugh! Boring! ""Ok so long story short, I can shape shift, so looks like you have the two for one special!"" Crickets. Guess it's time to take it up a notch. I whirl around and now I'm Katie, the cute girl in HR. John starts crying. 

""I'm so sorry,"" he starts babbling while tears start streaming down his face. ""I don't know how you know, and I don't know how you are doing this, but I'm sorry. It was only the two times. I swear. I love you and I'll never let it happen again. 

""Oh silly man!"" I complete a series of turns. Whoosh, Jessica, whoosh, Abigail, whoosh, Emily, whoosh, Alexa, whoosh, Brittany. Feeling a bit dizzy I stop and stare at him. The man I would do anything for. He looks dumbfounded. ""I'm all of them. I know you love me. You have always loved me. You will always love me. I'm your person.""

""But how...""

""Well, when most girls go through puberty, they start their periods. I didn't get that, instead, I looked at a magazine enviously staring at all the pretty girls and all of a stuffed I was that girl. Remember when everyone thought you were dating then Guess model in high school."" I shot him a dazzling smile as I twirled into my first transformation. ""Surprise!""

""But there have been so many. You couldn't have been all of them."" 

""Actually I can. It only takes a spin and I'm someone new. I have been to every post football game party, every frat event, every class, every meeting, every bar, every date, every bathroom hookup,"" he blushed at that last one. ""Remember when you told me you loved me and that you wouldn't leave me when we were 18 and pregnant, well, I wasn't pregnant, and you left me anyways. I wasn't going to let you go so easily.""

""They have had apartments, families, cars for Christ's sake! How could you manage all that?"" 

""It's easy really. The families took some forethought. I actually had to make a friend and meet her family, then I would become her and poof instant family!""

""But the money, Natasha only wore designer clothing, and Sarah had a Lexus and a killer apartment.""

Looks like he isn't as dumb as I thought. ""Killer being the main word there."" I start to prowl across the room like a panther eyeing its prey. ""Do you know how easy it is to get close to someone when you have a different face? Of course you do,"" I smile, ""I've been close to you so many times. But that's not really the point. You can't get away, and I can't get caught if something happens to you. It's as easy as that!""

"[WP] The main character just found out that their significant other is not only a shapeshifter, but also every person they've ever dated.",project_matthex,"For the dozenth time, Alex stopped to check his reflection in the mirror. Average height and average weight with a modest drinker's gut, parted dark hair, a decent beard that had just received its weakly trim. He worried at it slightly. Had he trimmed it too much? Not much he could do about that now. He fiddled with his hair a bit, trying to get the lay right.

*You're being ridiculous.* He told himself, and forced his legs to continue on toward the little brewery where he and Monica had enjoyed their first date.

That had been eight months ago, and things were going well. Damned well, even, at least to his way of thinking. He'd never had much luck with women, and his dating history prior to  her had consisted of a dozen short stints with various girls never lasting more than a month or two. Before he met Monica, he'd only ever managed to see two of them for a year or more and one of those had been all the way back in high school. Oh, he could meet the pretty ones easily enough; had in fact been with them almost exclusively, save for pudgy Jessica Higgins. But it always seemed to end the same way. She lost her cool in public one too many times, or she got needlessly jealous over one of his female friends or he quit as soon as things got tough. Yeah, Alex had a type alright: slim, leggy girls with a flair for the dramatic and a bizarre and unyielding devotion to him.

But then there was Monica, who'd been a breath of fresh air. She hadn't been controlling or smothering in the slightest. She was so low maintenance compared to the other girls he'd been with, always cool headed. Even their lovemaking was incredible, and she always seemed to know exactly how to please him. The last eight months with her had been a waking dream, and he'd finally begun to wonder if he'd found that fabled ""one"". 

And all that had come crashing down that morning when he'd gotten the dreaded ""We need to talk"" text from her. He pulled out his phone, checking it again, as though he would find some hidden meaning in this 700th reading that the previous 699 hadn't revealed. ""Meet me at Lou's. I have something important I need to discuss with you. Don't worry about the cost, I'll pick it up this time.""

He sighed, checking his reflection, and decided that the only way to get through this was to grab the bull by the horns. After a whole day spent worrying about what he'd done wrong or whether there was some other man, the only recourse he had left was to walk into Lou's and deal with it like a man.

He found her in the beer garden sitting at one of the iron tables. She had a dark beer in front of her and had taken the liberty of ordering him a pint of something with a yellow, wheaty look. As ever, she was a vision of loveliness; peaches and cream skin with a braid of dark hair that fell to her waist and a lean build with long, shapely legs. She wore sandals today and a flowing white dress that hinted at her alluring shape without giving too much of it away.

Her blue eyes turned to his as he approached, and her face lit up in a smile that put him slightly at ease. 

""There you are! I was starting to think you were gonna stand me up."" She said.

""Ugh...sorry about that."" He said, ""Work caught me late.""

""Uh-huh. You can't fool me, Alex Terry. You were nervous.""

He blushed a little as he took his seat. She'd read him perfectly, as she often seemed to. He looked around the beer garden and found that they were mercifully alone there. On a such a beautiful Friday night, that was a small miracle.

""I don't blame you,"" She said quickly, ""There's nothing as infuriating as the whole 'we need to talk' thing. But I'm not here to break up with you. Just to come clean about some stuff.""

The momentary relief he'd felt was quickly replaced by an uneasy rock in his stomach.

""You're not cheating on me, are you?""

""No! In fact, I think it's safe to say I've never cheated on you in my life."" She said.

He found that passing odd but ignored it. If she wasn't breaking up with him or announcing some foul relationship trouble, what could it be?

""Okay,"" He said, reaching out to take her hand. She returned the gesture with a smile, stroking his palm, ""What's going on then? You had me really worried."" 

""I'm sorry for that, really."" She said apologetically, ""But I do have something to share with you and it is very important.""

She took a deep breath before saying, ""I'm a shapeshifter.""

Alex blinked.

""A what?""

""A shapeshifter. One who shifts her shape."" She said, ""I can...well, I suppose it would be easier to show rather than tell.""

She closed her eyes and focused on her power. Alex watched in astonishment as the pretty brunette in front of him shifted into a bikini clad, bronzed blonde straight off a post card for Santa Monica beach. She giggled at his gaped mouth reaction and stretched over the table to push his jaw closed. In another moment, she was herself again.

""I...that's incredible! How long have you been able to do it?"" He asked.

""The ability started to manifest when I turned 18. I found that every time I wanted a little belly fat to go away or my hair to change, it just...did."" She said, ""And then I learned that I could change my clothes and we were off to the races.""

""Why didn't you tell me sooner?"" He asked, ""Were you afraid I'd freak out or something? I think it's kind of awesome.""

A little rosy blush crept into her cheeks this time and she bit her lip.

""Weeeell, that's the *other* thing I needed to talk to you about. I'm afraid I have some other confessions to make.""

""Okay...It can't get a whole lot weirder than that, could it?"" he asked, mind worrying at ways that it might be.

She sucked in air through her teeth.

""I guess there's no way to tell you this but to give it to you straight. You remember Jessica Higgins? Big girl that you dated for a couple years back in high school?""

He remembered her all right. She'd been his first and only high school girlfriend. They'd gotten together when they were both 15 and hadn't broken up until she moved away just before their junior prom. But why would she bring...

Recognition flared in his eyes. ""You? You're Jessica?""

He felt a little dizzy. The entire fundamentals of this relationship had been based on a lie.

""Why on earth didn't you just tell me that to start? I wouldn't have been angry to see you again.""

She looked away, unable to meet his eyes. ""Well...you're getting warmer."" She said, ""But there's a little more to it. This isn't really even the second time we've dated.""

His eyes went wide and his skin paled, ""How many?"" He asked, shakily.

She shifted uncomfortably, taking a quick glance at his face before casting her eyes into her beer again. ""Well...all of them."" She admitted, a miserable sort of resignation in her voice.

""All of them?"" He asked, ""What do you mean *all* of them?""

""I'm sorry!"" She said, grabbing his hand, ""But I'm, well...I'm kind of every girl you've ever dated.""

He didn't pull his hand from hers, but he did slouch into his seat. Every girl he'd ever dated? It didn't seem possible. Yet even at a quick inventory, it made a lot of sense. Hadn't he had a very specific type? And hadn't most of his relationships ended in pretty much the same way? Still, it wasn't possible. There'd been too many.

""No way. You can't be."" He protested, suddenly remembering, ""I met Jess-I mean, your family back in high school. That was a completely different family than Tina's.""

She frowned, ""Tina...I really thought that one was going to work out."" She shook her head, ""But those were all paid actors. Really just a paid family. They were a little weirded out but I named them a price for hosting you and they couldn't really refuse.""

That had been a bit of a relief. He'd never liked them.

""But that's crazy. No one has that kind of money."" He said.

""Oh, I do. Do you have any idea how easy it is to make money when you can do what I do?"" She said, ""Doubling for actresses, modelling...I've even got a guy who pays me to just morph into clothes he designs. Saves him millions over the year.""

He shook his head, trying to get back to subject at hand.

""Is that how you tracked me? Paying to keep up.""

""That and your social media stuff."" She said, ""You really need to come up with some new passwords, babe. Most of the time, figuring out where you were was as easy as tapping into your Facebook.""

He pulled away, rubbing his temples.

""Then the dating sites...""

She giggled. ""A special favorite. It's like that scene from *Mrs. Doubtfire* where he switches the number and all Sally Fields gets is crazy chicks...""

""I know the scene."" He interrupted, ""Still, you can't be *all* off them. I barely even dated some of those girls. Like that one girl...""

""Angela."" She supplied, ""The busty one. Big boobs were such a mistake. You were kind of a moron on that date.""

""I wasn't that bad!"" He protested before dropping his eyes, ""I guess I was kind of that bad. She never even called me back.""

""I had to do something to let you know you screwed up. You wouldn't stop shifting. Or staring, for that matter."" She said, ""You were so distracted that you tried to pay with for dinner with your driver's license.""

He looked away uncomfortably. She couldn't possibly have been lying about that one.

""The artsy girl. Pamela. What about her?"" He said, ""She's nothing like...well...all the others.""

""Yeah...might have hammed up the quirky bit much on that one."" She admitted, ""I just got so caught up in the character, especially when I got into the paintings.""

"[WP] The main character just found out that their significant other is not only a shapeshifter, but also every person they've ever dated.",project_matthex,"Not the person you replied to but if I could just give my two cents; I honestly think the story (and the prompt itself) are both excellent, however I personally disagree with your twist at the end. Up until that point, it seemed like a bittersweet thing, how much she loved him, what she'd do to change for him. But then maybe she could realize the fundamental limitations of her power. She was a shapeshifter; every time they dated, she tried to be better for him, but only in the most superficial of ways (maybe never really ""getting"" him). This could even be linked to her abuse with her first boyfriend (though it may make everything fit together TOO well). I just feel like your story has the potential be different and unique, but I feel like the twist at the end was rather predictable and takes away from the piece, leaving the reader with a bad taste in their mouth for no other reason but the split second ""surprise"" twist that I feel the story could do without.

Please don't take these comments as an insult, truth is, I rather enjoyed your story and that's exactly why I so badly want to see it perfected (but then again I might just be asking you to make changes for the sake of writing a perfect story for ME, I'm not sire right now. 1 1/2 days without sleeping does that to ya).",ZoggZ

"[WP] The main character just found out that their significant other is not only a shapeshifter, but also every person they've ever dated.",project_matthex,"My two cents, this subreddit loves a twist ending.

I think your story is worse for the twist.  It's shocking yeah, but it doesn't make sense.  Think about it from John's perspective.

He beats his girlfriend, she disappears, he decides to shape change.  His next four girlfriends, he doesn't hit, and after those breakups, he doesn't change shapes.  It's the exact same relationship with the same two people, what changed?  Did he?  And if so, why did he revert to being scum once he realized what was going on?

So if you'd like to take the advice of a stranger on the internet who's no better at this than you are, I'd suggest deciding how badly you want imaginary internet points.  If you do, I'd actually increase the hints just so it makes sense.  Imply that had the latter four relationships lasted longer, he would have gotten violent.  Maybe add in a line that the narrator thinks her breakups with John were her fault, innocuous language that's far more sinister once we realize who John really is.

But if you care more about dumb-ol'-me than karma, cut the twist ending.  I was really curious where it was going to go.",0gl1tch0
[WP] You buy a selfie stick from a garage sale that you soon find out is charmed/cursed.,richardkelley21,"I usually never go to garage sale because, quite frankly, that sounds like the kind of thing my mom would do, and I wouldn't want to be seen there.

But the thing is that tomorrow in Jemma's birthday and she'll get reaaaaaal cranky if I don't show up with a gift -for the third time in three years-.
So I thought, whatever, I'm not going to spend too much for Jemma because she's kind of a bitch anyway, and the house down the street is having a garage sale.

Like I said, I don't really like this kind of place, especially when the owner of the garage is a total weirdo, so I just wanted to get there, pick up the first coloured thing I found and buy it.

Turns out that the first fluo shit in a box was a selfie stick, you know, the thing you're were supposed to put your phone at the end and take a picture with, I hadn't seen one in over ten years, the last time being when my dad went through his old stuff from when he was a teenager and selfie sticks were still kinda cool.
It's perfect considering Jemma likes to pretend she's a hipster and I know she doesn't have any (probably because no one in their right mind would offer a selfie stick to a loved one).

The guy takes my 5$, even tries to make me buy the green and the yellow selfie sticks he still has at home, but finally lets me go when he notices a kid playing with his vintage Fallout 4 game case across the garden.
Back in my bedroom, I throw the selfie stick on my bed and decide to go through some old memes on my phone.
But I don't know why, I can't shake the feeling that there's something weird around. The fact that I went to a garage sale is weird already, and bringing back a selfie stick makes it all even more odd.

I turn around, eye the pink stick on my bed, and sigh.
Seriously, it's a selfie stick, it's not like it could cursed or something.
So I turn back around and go on through the memes.
I mean really, of course I feel weird, I actually went out for the first time in a week and seeing the sun made me feel a little updown.
And I just KNOW it'll be hilarious when Jemma tries to get her old school Iphone 9 SC 2T on it and decides to take picture of the entire party with it. 

And then, just like that, I receive a notification on my phone. I click on it, and it leads me to facebook.
Jemma made a post on her 22nd birthday page, and apparently she's decided that she's too cool for gifts and surprises, and would rather have everyone give her money so that she can buy what she wants. Bitch.

I guess this selfie stick is useless now. I might as well have some fun with it.
Turning around, I jump on my feet and throw myself on the bed, then grab the stick.
I hook my 1plus6 at the end of the pink fluo stick and put the cable in.
Immediately after, the photography app runs and I see myself on the screen.
I take a pose, then another, try to get my hair in the right place but apparently it's too cool for selfies, so I just give up and make an ugly face.
When I press the button, my phone makes a click sound and the picture is taken.
I bring back the stick closer to my body so that I can use my phone, and go through the picture.
I'm not hoping for much, I mean I crossed my eyes and stuck my tongue and frowned and smiled stupidly at the same time and OH MY GOD I HAVE NEVER LOOKED SO HOT!!
What the hell?! I know I deliberately made a weird face for the selfie, there's no may it can make me look like the picture was taken by a professional photographer and I went through top-model classes!

Am I really this sexy? I giggle, strike a pose for the next picture, click on the button and go through the pictures.
Aaaaand... I'm disappointed. I took a pose this time! Why do look spongebob had rape-sex on my face?

Man, this selfie stick works backward! When I'm supposed to be ugly I look pretty, and when I try to look like Marylin Monroe, I look like Stephen Hawking had a bad stroke?
Is this the reason why selfie sticks didn't sell well? Because everyone took bad pictures with it?

But on the same time... It's a bit weird. Selfie sticks don't get cursed with backward beauty photography like that. I'm just not a photographer, so that might be the real reason.

Still... I'll try to test my theory. I take up the selfie stick again, and take alternatively bad and good pictures. And in the end, when I look through the pictures, the good ones are bad, and the bad are the best thing I've ever seen.

This selfie stick... It holds so much power! Which means... Great... Now I have great responsibilities and shit.
I can barely stay alive on my own if my mom doesn't call me everyday to remind me I have to eat, I can't keep this selfie stick or else, one way or another, I'll bring down the government...

And I don't want to bring down the government. But I do want to bring Jemma down. I think I've never bought a better gift.
She'll be way too damn proud to ever think about taking a picture of herself making a funny face, however she'll be using it to make ''duckfaces'' and other so-called cute faces.
When she'll go through the pictures, she'll be desperate to see that every single image depicts her as the ugliest human being that was ever born.
But still... This isn't very nice. I do think she's an awful girl, but I like to believe I'm wiser and better that.

Oh! New notification on my phone! Let's see...

Jemma: Flav, you better bring money or at least some kind of gift because I swear it's the last time I pay for a cake that'll be eaten by someone who doesn't care enough about me to bring me something on my birthday. Got it?

Oh I'm bringing this bitch down.",flaflou

She knew the voice though, she would never forget the voice those eyes belonged too. Overwhelmed Veldi glanced down at the soul she had been given, her soul. She couldn't mount an answer to the favor she'd been asked, only a question.

""And our previous deal?"" She asked carefully, the warm light in her hands the only heat she'd felt in the past five years. ""Will you still stay true to it?""

The empty eyes filled instantly with fire and the smell of rotten eggs became an all-consuming smell. Veldi ignored the temper tantrum, her gaze never leaving the orb of light that levitated in her hands. A voice like a broken bell seemed to shatter the air itself. ""You dare attack my honor? I have never broken a single deal I have made, you humans are the ones trying to weasel your ways out of it! So eager to sell your souls until you know what it means!"" 

She glanced to him once, the effects of his power lost on her. The fire and brimstone felt like ice in the presence of the heat she held in her hands. ""Yes then?""

""OF COURSE ITS A YES!"" The world seemed to shift in reaction to the scream.

""Then what do you need?"" 

The devil blinked, slowly, and the fire died away. Then, after a moment of silence, explained his situation.

~

That was how Veldi ended up on top of a skyscraper. That was what lead Veldi to jump. And, as you would expect after a jump, a fall, a crash, a death. The sidewalk was her bed as she stared helplessly up into the cloudy sky. She suspected her body was already beyond saving, luckily she had a soul.

The world stopped, the noise stopped, the crowd that had started to run to her shattered form stopped. Everything stopped. Veldi enjoyed it while it lasted.

With a sound like tearing fabric, a black scythe cut out into the world. A towering form of incomprehensible details approached her where she lay on the sidewalk, scythe rising off the ground as it prepared to strike her down.

""The devil wanted to ask you out for a date tomorrow afternoon."" Veldi said, looking into the black shimmering shape that she couldn't remember, couldn't discern at all. 

The scythe halted with its owner, then lowered slowly to the ground. ""Really?"" Said the form with a voice that seemed to cut through reality. 

""Yea, says he's sorry for what happened five years ago.""

The figure laughed silence into existence. ""Why would he apologize for that?"" The figure brought the blade of the scythe within a hair's breadth of Veldi's neck. She remained silent, she no longer felt in control, she felt paralyzing fear. The figure continued, ""He may have stolen that boys life from my harvest, but he was only keeping up his end of the bargain, guess he sent the one truly responsible in case I didn't accept his apology.""

Veldi gazed up at the sky, waiting. She'd been waiting for death all her life. Now she'd finally found it. ""Don't worry though,"" Said the figure, pulling the scythe away and vanishing it somewhere into the impossible black that composed it. ""I accept your apology."" Veldi felt the world coming back to her, she could feel the pain that was swarming her body. ""And thank you for delivering the message.""",Vampiric-Argonian

""I suppose so. I hadn't really thought about it before, but now that you mention it, it really is in everything.  Have you noticed it adding much?""  
""Not a thing.""  
""Perhaps I don't need to go to the store after all,"" I began to think, but then a daring thought entered my mind. ""Say, Luci, what if I were to make two stews? One with Bay Leaves, and one without.  Then we would be able to know for certain if they are worth adding in the future.""  
""I never thought about that,"" said Satan, ""Seems reasonable. Oh, I almost forgot, back to the favor.  If I take you to the store will you do this favor for me?""  
""Probably"".  
""Wait. I would like some stew too.  Both kinds, so I can judge for myself.""

I wasn't really in a position to answer him with an outright no, despite however awful and terrible thing his favor must be, because however awful and terrible the favor is, I would surely be forced to do it if I were to go to hell, perhaps forever. Though, I'm not entirely sure. Jesus, with his ever-loving soul and omniscient mind, never told us wretched souls on Earth what may actually become of us were we to end up in hell.  
""The stew,"" asked Satan, ""there will be carrots in it, yes?""  
""Oh, surely,"" I responded; and with that, we were off to Safeway.  Satan told me on the drive that the favor he needed from me was to watch his dog for him while he was out of town. I asked him if the dog was a hell-hound but he said that wasn't funny and to sod off.  It was a terrier, he told me.  His wife had been wanting one for a long time and he finally caved.  I asked him why such a small favor would be worth my soul.

I was hunched over, whispering barely pronounceable Latin words. Kneeling on the cold, concrete floor of an abandoned building on the edge of town. I'd tried everything... Spent almost penny I had on experts to quacks to crooks to one mad eyed old priest who'd claimed there was a way, but only if I could pay with something other than coin.

A month later, here I was, murmuring phrases that I could only hope Google had given me the correct gist of. Red wax candles burning low, a paint can full of lambs blood adding a thick smell to the room as I chanted over this ridiculous Pentagram that looked like something out of a B grade remake of Stokers Dracula.

I said the last word, slapped my hand in the middle of the pentagram, violating the boundary of the circle and...

Nothing.

No pop. No smoke. No brimstone. No towering demonic form.

Just silence.

Then my sobs as I curled up on the floor, empty. Spent. Nothing left but my tears.

I don't know how long I lay there before he spoke. No trumpets, no sinister violin, just a man stepping out of a shadowy doorway and speaking. His voice was rich and sultry, with hints of exasperation crisping the edges.

""Whadda ya want?""

I looked at him, wiping away my tears, sitting up slowly. If the pentagram was out of a B grade movie, he was out of some straight to TV mafioso shlockfest. He was broad shouldered in a well fit, pin striped suit.

He held a fedora in his hands, his fingers idly tracing its rim as he eyed me, looking bored but with this faint spark of predator. He had glossy, slicked back black hair and a little goatee, with just one or two grey strands at the temples.

But the give away was the shadows... He didn't seem to have any actual horns, but there was these inch long shadows being cast across his forehead like he did. It was Satan. The incantation had worked or.. Or he'd heard my crying... Or he just liked hanging around abandoned homes.

I sniffed and wiped my nose as he sighed and checked his watch impatiently. I ran over it in my head, the bargain I'd figured out. The clever as a whip deal.

""Oh great lord, king of the darkness, comma-""

""Skip it."" he said, a short blunt statement that cut me off as he slouched against the door frame.

""Uh..."" I stammered, running through my mental script. Oh, right.

""I want to be the smartest person in the world."" I said, ""I want to have perfect recall of everything I read, experience or think. I want an implicit understanding of human physiology, physics, immunology, viral behavior, genetic diseases, pathogens and all tangentially related things. I don't want to suffer any fatigue, depression or anxiety from my new abilities or in general.""

The mafia hit man with the too white teeth smirked. ""That all?"" He asked, in his best wiseguy drawl.

I stammered a little. This wasn't going how I'd read... How I'd /imagined/ it would. I swallowed and nodded.

""Yes oh grea-... Er. Yes. Satan. And in exchange I shall give you my immortal soul!""

He looked at me for the longest moment, then the edges of his lips curled up into a smug, devilish expression that would of made a cartoon Grinch jealous. He moved away from the door, finally, his motions fluid and predatory like a lion circling a wounded gazelle. He crouched down, balancing on the balls of his feet as he squatted two feet from me and responded...

""No deal.""

He actually chuckled at my reaction, shock and horror and disbelief.

""What? But... I... It's for my soul. You give me everything I asked for and I give you my soul... That's how it works..."" I said, my eyes flicking back and forth as I mentally went back over what I'd said, trying to figure out what had gone wrong.

He shook his head, still smirking, and responded slowly in those deep rich tones, the exasperation and impatience replaced with a hint of smugness.

""No. That ain't how it works. You can ask and I can do, but the deal can't be complex. Capisce? It's magic. Simple offer, simple deal. None of this ifs, buts, whats and contract nonsense. No circumventing the small print. Simple.""

I stared at him for a long moment, my lips moving as I silently went back over my carefully worded 'wish'. What could I say? How did I condense all that down into one simple thing.

""I... I want to be able to cure anything!"" I blurted.

He looked as pleased as a cat about to sup on cream. He extended one hand, thick gold pinky ring catching the faint light from the still burning candles.

""Bing. Bang. Boom. Done."" He said, with a sense of finality like the granite lid of a sarcophagus sliding home.
^~@~@~@~@~@~@~@~@~@~@~@~@~^

That must of been... What? 50 years ago? 60 now? I stood next to my desk, a 30 year old single malt in the glass in my hand, facing the windows of my office that looked out over a city that had been fundamentally changed by me. My eyes flicked back to the reflection in my office window, to the familiar shape who'd a moment ago appeared through the shadowed doorway leading to my private en-suite.

He'd changed.

He still wore the same suit, but it was worn now, threadbare and dusty. The seam at the shoulder was even coming undone. His once bold and perhaps even handsome face looked drawn now, gaunt. From his grey temples to his bony fingers rubbing nervously at the rim of his hat, this looked like a man who'd been on a 20 year losing streak.

""Hey..."" He repeated, his once rich voice now breathy, barely carrying across the room never mind filling the space like it once did. ""I... Uh... Came to make you an offer.""

I smirked, but it was a sour expression. I sipped the scotch, but its smoky tones couldn't remove the strangely bitter taste from my mouth. I'd imagined this moment, but now it was here it tasted... Wrong.

I pivoted, placing the glass down upon my desk and arching an eyebrow at him.

He gave me a broad smile, his once incandescent teeth now dull and slightly yellowed. He stepped forward, tugging at the hat brim nervously as he slunk to one of the seats in front of my desk and sat down. His smile, an expression of hopeless gratitude faltered.

""See... The thing is... Back when we made our deal, I think... Uh... I think My wording might of been a little broad.""

I offered a thin smile, my lips firmly pressed together as I sat down in my own chair... My $6000 dollar, shiatsu giving, lumbar supporting throne. I indicated he should carry on with an impatient flick of my fingers while sliding my desk door silently open and eyeing its contents.

""See... I knew you wanted to cure your sister."" He said, my eyes flashing to the picture of her that sat on my desk.

""I knew you were desperate, like most people who make a deal with me... But I just... I never figured."" He faltered, giving a nervous flicker of an apologetic smile and started over

""Look, the thing is, I never figured you'd use your... Your gift this way, ya know? You've done so much good with it... Plenty of profit for you, 'eh?"" He gestured emphatically out the window behind me, taking in the grand views provided by my companies towers.

""But... Well, most people who come to me are pretty selfish, pretty greedy, ya know? You're not the first person to come up with a cure for ageing.."" He gave a nervous little chuckle 

""But...""  He carried on, the expression of comradely conspiratorial humor fading ""You are the first one to turn it into a pill... And sell it... to everyone. You're the first one to go about systematically curing everything, then selling those cures at barely above cost.. And donating 90% of your proceeds to charity to boot.""

I picked up the whiskey glass again and eyed him over the rim, tapping my mouth with a delicately manicured nail.

""Do you have a point? And do you think we'll get to it before my Telomeres treatment runs out?""

A spark of anger flashed across his face. Even now, he wasn't used to this. To grovelling. To begging.

""Look... You've done great out of all this. But with all you've done... People aren't dieing like they used to. People aren't coming to me, desperate to strike a deal like they used to... You've kind of... Fucked up my whole game. So... How about this. I give you back your soul...""

He dropped something on the edge of the table. It looked like of like an apple... Or some kind of fruit, but made of shadow and light and... With what appeared to be a bite taken out of it. It's surface was smudged, dirty.

His eyebrows bounced suggestively, like a sleazy tailor trying to talk you into buying his totally authentic Armani suit that happens to be only $300.

""i know you want it... Everyone who loses theirs or trades it away feels a little hollow inside, a craving they normally try to fill with drugs or violence not.."" He looked around at the room, this edifice to my philanthropy and gestured with a look of plain confusion ""All this... But anyway. I give you back your soul and you can keep doing what you're doing... Just, ya know... Maybe you raise your prices.. A couple of thousand percent. Bing. Bang. Boom. Everybody wins.""

He sunk back into the little chair slowly, smugly. A trace of his old confidence returning. So when I started to chuckle and his confidence shattered, I couldn't help bursting into peels of rich light laughter.

My hand fished in the draw, palming the object I was looking for as I smirked at him.

""No deal."" I said, as I settled the small glowing orb on the table, resting a finger atop it. ""This..."" I said slowly, enjoying his expression ""Is the cure for you, capise? The worlds first artificial soul. Take that if you want... Gratis.""

I reclined in my throne as he stared in shock at the orb.

""Bing. Bang. Boom. You're done. Get out.""",KiljoyAU
"[WP]You sold your soul to the Devil some years ago, today he gives it back and says, ""I need a favor"".",worktillyouburk,"  The device in Tom's hand hummed like a low intensity laser. Only no laser light was emitted. No light at all except for the faint green glow of the L.E.D. control panel. The ergonomic grip of the pistol sat just right in his hand. The weight perfectly balanced, but all of that was inconsequential compared to what it could do. This device would let him traverse between parallel dimensions. The price of his soul seemed a paltry trade in comparison to the intellect to create such a device. Hell, at the time, Tom just wanted to pass Calculus II, but being a broke college student, he had learned to haggle and stretch his dime as far as it could go. Tom had made sure he secured enough brains to earn a doctorate degree in Physics, Mechanical Engineering, and Chemistry. All within a brief seven year period.

Suddenly a blast of hot smoke in the empty corner of the lab startled Tom. The black thick smoke was hot and accompanied by the smell of sulfur and brimstone. It had been seven long years, but that entrance was unforgettable, it was Lucifer himself.  
 ""Hello Tom, busy at work I see."" the Devil said with a sinister inflection in his voice. Tom shot back a suspicious scowl.  
 ""And to what do I owe the pleasure, Luci?"".  
 ""Oh come now,"" the Devil retorted, ""is that anyway to treat an old friend?"" As the smoke dissipated the Devil made his way over to Tom's workstation inspecting the laboratory and admiring Tom's handiwork. 

The Devil himself looked so cliche that it was ridiculous. He looked like something straight out of a children's cartoon. His smooth red skin, slicked-back black hair, down to the thin pointy mustache, although he had no hooves, just plain human legs was all to familiar that in passing you would think he was on his way to a costume party. The Devil approached Tom casually, put one red hand on Tom's shoulder and looked him square in the eyes with a sincere smile, the way an old friend would look at you when they are about to ask you for a favor.  
""Tom,"" he said ""I have an amazing deal for you.""  
""Oh, a favor? What's that?""  
""Well you see Tom, I'm in need of your help. And in exchange for this help, I'm willing to offer your soul back."" Excitement crept into Tom's mind after hearing those words, but he stowed it immediately knowing their would be some catch. If the first time he had to give up a soul, what would he have to give up this time he wondered.  
""I'm listening."" Tom retorted.  
""You see I happen to know that the device you've just created, with my gift I might add, allows you to travel to parallel dimensions. And it just so happens that I have need of someone with just such an ability. You see I am not the only devil. In fact their is one for each dimension and their are infinite dimensions. Now devils like myself are always vying for power in the form of souls and their is an opportunity for a whole hell of a lot of souls, no pun intended, to be gained in another dimension, but I need your help in defeating the devil of that dimension."" 

  The Devil had just come to Tom and asked him for help defeating another version of himself. Tom had barely even tested his dimensional teleporter and now here was the Devil himself asking for help taking over an underworld. Tom sat stoic, expressionless as he thought through the possible scenarios. It was a shot at getting his soul back, possibly finding a way to conquer the Devil himself. In the end what did he have to lose? He'd already lost his soul.  
""Well Luci, you have yourself a deal.""  
""Excellent Tom, I knew I could count on you."" the Devil replied with a wicked grin. ""Well now, all we have to do is shake on it."" 
  Tom extended his hand and the Devil grasped it in the secret pact-binding handshake they had shared just seven years ago. Red light waves emanated from the grasp and so the journey to the parallel underworld would begin.

"[WP]You sold your soul to the Devil some years ago, today he gives it back and says, ""I need a favor"".",worktillyouburk,"I awoke startled, there was a loud crack coming from the other side of the room. I nearly knocked over the empty bottle of Jack Daniels as I rolled over off the tattered couch of my small apartment. It must have been late as it was still dark in the room, and the crack must have been loud enough to wake the neighbors if it was enough to wake me before my usual 2pm hangover. Before I was able to stumble over to find the light switch I heard the familiar voice I had first heard two years earlier. 


""Sorry to wake you Andrew,"" I hear coming from a voice with no inkling of regret and a slight laugh, as a faint red light glows around an enormous figure enveloping most of the little room. I decide the glow from his eyes and aura provided enough light for my current state, my head still spinning and gave up on my quest to find the light switch.


""What time is it?"" I'm finally able to mutter, my mouth dry from my whisky induced slumber. 


""That is unimportant, what is important is that I need a favor.""


""And why would I ever do that? I've already sold you my soul, What more could you want?"" I asked cooly. It's amazing how easy it is to scoff at the Ruler of Hell when you have nothing else to lose.


""Because that is precisely what you will get in return for the favor, your pathetic soul back,"" the Devil responded with an arrogance I tried to match.


""It can't be too pathetic, you still wanted it,"" I spat. He didn't seem to find it as amusing as I thought. I could feel his arrogance shifting to anger as he loomed even closer.


Ignoring my response he continued, ""I need you to accompany me to Hell""


""Need some help moving into your new fiery palace?"" 


""Many of the demons and Hellspawn believe they deserve the right to rule Hell more than I do.""


""Well if you're coming to me for help they may be right,"" I replied with a subtle grin.


""I need you to act as a decoy so I can overthrow their leader.""


""Glorious, so in the great battle for the underworld I will go down in history as the decoy. What's the catch?""


""Aha you know me too well,"" the Devil finally regaining his sense of humor, ""the catch is similar to your last deal.""


I recoiled at the memory of the deal I made with him. All the whisky in the world hadn't let me forget it. I should have known better than dealing with the Devil. Of course I got the love of my life in exchange for my soul, but there is always a catch. Always. 


The devil seeing my discomfort continued, ""Too soon? She's been gone for over a year now.""


I finally was able to swallow and force out words, ""There is nobody left for you to take from me.""


""The life I need is yours. You will serve as a decoy, but the catch is that you will likely not survive.""


""The word you were searching for was sacrifice. Not decoy. What if I refuse?""


""By all means go ahead, continue this path and give up your one shot to regain your soul. There are countless fools who have made deals with me I could find instead.""


I thought for a moment. It was a death wish. If I got my soul back I could be sent to heaven when I died. I never thought it would be possible, but it was the only way to be reunited with my love. I had no other choice, but to enter into another deal with the Devil. I just prayed that this time their would be no catch.


""I'll see you in Hell.""

""Look, man, I'll do anything to get my soul back but I don't swing that wa...""

""NO! OH GOD, NO! I can take care of myself."" He stammered in circles around my room, tail sloshing around, knocking over my lava lamp. I saw he was way out of his league about his predicament. Pacing back and forth he lit a cigarette. I've seen some shit the last couple years. Imp's in my cereal cupboard trying to sneak food. Shadow Figures having poker night in my basement. A ton of baggage The Dark Lord failed to mention that was in ""the fine print"". As an associate, my house was kind of a safe haven for those from the other side. However, the queerest thing thus far was having a monstrous Bull God pacing around like an antsy school girl in my bedroom. 

Glancing back I notice my girlfriend was hiding under our top sheet, with her nose and eyes peering out with fingertips clenched. She'd never gotten used to it, but she stopped threatening to leave once she realized she was in no danger. But at 3:15 in the morning, she couldn't help but be startled from his fiery entrance. 

""Oh, Hi Clair,"" noticing her aghast expression.

""Hi Satan...."" he eyes welded open.

""How's your mother?""

""Good""

""Tell her I'll be seeing her soon, oh and Uncle Benny says hi""

""WHAT?""

I slap him in the arm and stared at him; he whips his head around with deer-in-headlights eyes and drools his smoke like I popped his Sunday fair balloon.

""Uh...it was a joke Clair, yeah just a joke,"" he says snubbing his smoke into his hand and tosses it out the window. 

""Ugh,"" Clair sighed as she rolled over while burying her head with a pillow. ""Why does this keep happening?"".

""Look, man! What's up? I know this may seem normal for you, but mortals usually are asleep in the middle of the night."" Foggy, scratching my ass, I just want to know what is going on so I can get back in bed.

""Right,"" Satan said. ""Sorry, I'm just... I'M JUST LOST FOR WORDS! I'm in so much shit, and I've asked so many others and they've all said no. Your my last hope Phil!""

""What do you need?""

""Well... I need you to kill my mother-in-law""

""WHAT?"" Clair yelled.

""What?"" I asked befuddled.

""Come on Phil! She's a fucking bitch, man!""

""Wait, you wait, what?"" Still processing the information, I'm beginning to wonder if I'm actually awake.

""Are you fucking kidding me Satan?"" Clair inquired, now standing on the bed. ""You want Phil to kill.... your mother-in-law?""

""Yup""

""And you think I'm capable of slaying a demon?"" Finally coming to terms I'm awake as my ears are now ringing.

""Yup""

""But how? And why?""

""I told you, she's a fucking bitch.""

""Why can't you do it? I mean, that's kind of your business""

""No, I can't technically kill. I can just manipulate people into their demise."" He plops down into my bean bag chair and opens up my cheese puff snacks. ""It's a contractual thing between God and I. It's complicated"" 

""But,"" I continue, ""you at least know a few, right?""

""Oh! Tons! Yeah, they have a club that meets on Tuesdays""

""I mean, couldn't you have asked on of them?""

""No! That's the thing! She's such a bitch!"" Satan jumps up, scattering the cheese puff snacks all over the room. Clair sighed and rolled her eyes, swearing under her breath, and starts to pick up the mess. After a handful, she walked passed Satan and back handed his shoulder as she walks out of the room, intentionally stomping down the stairs. ""To everyone else, shes has this facade of 'sweet old lady, what nummy cookies she makes'...ugh!"" He growled so loud the whole house shook as it sounded like a garbage truck being vomited out of a screaming hippos mouth. 

""Um if she's so sweet, why do you want her dead?"" I asked.

""Behind closed doors she sits there and tells the wife how she could do better."" In a mocking female ton he explained ""all day he sits and tortures these poor souls. All day he enslaved the ill mannered mortals of the Earth, just to try and get back at God. What a career to have, lying and cheating and stealing to get his way. Belial would have provided for you financially. Azrael at least had the means to protect you!"" Clearing his throat he continued in his normal voice, ""it's just exhausting, 10,000 years of busting my balls, I've just had enough of it!""

Clair stormed back in with a trash bag, still steaming and glared at me telling me to get rid of him. Satan sat on the bed and grabbed a cheese puff snack off the ground as Clair thought for a second that he might have enough manners to clean his own mess. Staring at Satan she waited. Satan stared at the puff for a long while. Like. A long, long while

""You know Phil,"" Satan exclaimed as he popped the cheese snack puff into his mouth, Clair sighing yet again while continuing to pick up the cheese puff snacks. ""I'll make it worth your while?

""Yeah,"" I said trying to sweet talk Satan just to get him to leave.

""I'll make sure you guys get whatever you want, both of you, and still get into heaven. Free pass here and in the afterlife."" We both looked at him in amusement.

""Yeah?"" I asked. We both looked at each other of the things we could come up with. Money, homes, good looks. Clair looked excited, but also signaling we needed to move this along, quickly.""Sure man. You know what. I'll do it. But right now, I need you to let us sleep. I have work in the morning. Could you come back tomorrow in the afternoon and we will talk about it?

""Oh really Phil? Oh man...that's such a relief!"" Satan jumped up and started dancing around. ""Sure thing man, yeah! I'll stop by tomorrow after sundown!"" He reached across the bed and picked me up and pulled me in. He reached down and grabbed Clair and pulled he in. There we were, being embraced by Satan against is red and sweaty flesh. ""You know what guys, you humans aren't half that bad. If I weren't in the business of trying to destroy your lives, you'd be alright to hang out with"". I look him in the eyes and just half assly give him a smile and nod. I placed us back into bed, and just grinned for a little while. 

""Well!"" Satan said after taking a deep, life sucking fresh breath. ""I'm out of here now! You kids have a good night, and I'll see you tomorrow."" He slowly started walking towards the door, and we sighed with relief. Once he got to the door, he stopped for a second and then slowly turned his head were we could see one glowing green eye. ""Oh, um Clair?"" Her eyes rolled, mentally famished from this whole ordeal.

""Yes Satan?""

He was sitting on my couch, his finger tapping the arm rest. He didn't even move when I walked in my apartment. He just stared at the wall in thought, like it's perfectly normal to sit in the dark like that inside someone else's apartment. To be fair, I doubt he has a solid idea of what's normal or not; he is the devil, after all.

""What are you doing here?"" I asked him, loosening my tie as I walked towards the living room where he still sat, motionless. His eyes shifted to me after a while, and his eyes had this look not very different from the one my officemate Doug gives me when he's about to vomit a lot of strange work ideas on me. While I understand that most people would probably get scared shitless by the idea of the devil waiting for them in their living room, the look in his eyes made me feel curious than anything else.

He didn't answer my question so I sat on the couch across him, leaned back, and closed my eyes. I couldn't get myself to worry about what this visit means. My life hasn't exactly been good since the accident, and since then there had been a lot of times when I wished I didn't sell it just to stick around for a few more years. 

""I need a favor,"" he finally said, jolting me awake. When I openend my eyes he was still in the same position he was in, but his eyes were looking straight at me. ""I will give you back your life if you do this for me.""

I couldn't help but raise my eyebrow at him. ""What kind of favor is this?"" My mind began running through things he can possibly request for. Part of our agreement then was that he'd buy my soul in exchange for letting me live and me being his mortal errand boy for as long as I lived. He'd requested several things in the past, but this felt different. 

""I can't help you if you won't tell me what it is,"" I continued after not getting any response from him. It seemed like he was hesitating to tell me, like he was still figuring out in his mind how to explain things. Wait, is he embarrassed?

""I need you to talk to a mortal for me,"" he started.

""Who? What will I say?""

""It's complicated.""

""What do you mean it's complicated?""

""I don't know how mortals talk about this.""

""Talk about what?""

""It's complicated.""

""Jesus Christ!""

""Not him! Why would I ask help from you to talk to my brother?""

""It was an expression! Who do you want me to talk to, and what will I say?""

He looked tense, which was a very odd thing to witness. He always had this calm and dangerous demeanor that reminded me of Marlon Brando in The Godfather. I've never seen him like this.

""I want to engage with a mortal in a friendly manner,"" he started. ""To converse and understand.""

At this point I was still completely lost by all of this, but his mention of the word *friendly* caught my attention. I've never heard him say any word that was even remotely close to something as positive as friendly. It was weird. Everything about him was weird today. He reminded me of how my younger brother acted like when he talked about his first date. Oh my god, is that it?

""Is this a date scenario?"" I answered back. He immediately broke eye contact which made me think I was right. The devil was stressed about asking a mortal for a date. Imagine that.

""So who is this mortal?"" I asked, not bothering for him to answer. It didn't seem like he would admit it, anyway. 

He let out one deep breath, his eyes crawling their way back to mine. His lips showed a tiny hint of a smile right before they opened as he said, ""Your downstairs neighbor, Jeff.""",cheekmagnet_

"[WP]You sold your soul to the Devil some years ago, today he gives it back and says, ""I need a favor"".",worktillyouburk,"“Good morning, Dave.”  
  
The voice was deep, warm and threatening. It pervaded deep into my being, washed over my bones and filled the hole inside me that had been left when I’d given away something I hadn’t known I’d needed. Bile rose in my throat and the cold hand of fear gripped my heart; this voice wasn’t human.   
  
I leapt out of my tent, grappling with the branches of the tree I’d hidden in and swinging across to the next one. I reached inside an owl cave and pulled out my pistol, the finest Smith &amp; Wesson ever made and span with the barrel pointed at where I’d heard the voice come from. “Out, spirit! Begone, or ah’ll do for you like the others!”  
  
“Such a sorry state of affairs I see you’ve sunk to.” There was a sibilant laughter in the voice, so uncomfortably familiar my skin pimpled and my hackles rose. A serpent with green and gold scales slid out from the foliage, a hood raised regally and a purple pattern across its brow. “This is certainly not how satisfied customers salute a salesman, David.”  
  
“You ain’t him. You ain’t ugly enough,” I spat and fired two bullets at the thing. The rounds were blessed by the only priest who’d speak to me, but that didn’t make him any less sacred. I’d seen them burn up demons and spirits alike, but when they struck the serpent they just stopped and melted slowly. I fired another shot to be sure as the molten metal dripping over the snake and burnt holes in the tree branch. “Okay, maybe you are him.”  
  
“I certainly am,” Satan hissed. It wasn’t annoyed, no; it was the closest to an arrogant laugh he could muster in this form. If anything he sounded amused. “How’s my favourite Soulless?”  
  
“Shit,” I said darkly. I reached into my pocket and pulled out three bullets, cracking open my pistol to reload it.   
  
“Ah, such a shame.” Satan slithered closer. As he spoke he crossed the gap between branches by wrapping himself around one and leaning over, then wrapping his neck around my branch and pulling the rest of his length behind him. I shuddered at the unnatural, serpentine motion. “I remember those wonderful dreams you had. Smiting your foes and being loved by so many. Whatever happened, David? What made you a hermit hiding in trees?”  
  
“Don’t mock me, you shit. You know why.” I sat down and looked below us. Sure enough three white, wispy dog-like figures were gathered around the base of my tree. “Coyote spirits can’t climb, and we’re too close to the desert for birds to risk it. Just gotta watch for your folk up here, and they don’t like riskin’ a fight they could lose. ‘Cept you snakes. Snake spirits are the worst kind of shit.”  
  
“How fortunate there’s only one,” Satan hissed, amused. “Did you find your wife’s killers? Your child’s?”  
  
“Wouldn’t you know a thing like that? Ah figure they’d have come down your way.” I looked up at the hills off to the West and then the horizon to the East. The sun was just creeping over into a new day.  
  
“Indeed, they did. You did some very unkind things to them. I applaud your…creativity.” Satan snaked his way around my waist and then up to my shoulders, his cold, slippery scales lying against my skin. I’d tried pushing him away before when he came for his part of our bargain and I just got bit – and getting bit by the Devil ain’t fun – so I let this time slide. “You seemed to enjoy doing it too. So why so sad to see me again?”  
  
“You damn well know it’s what happened afterwards ah didn’t enjoy!” I yelled, glaring at him. “You didn’t tell me all that shit about ghouls and ghosts and shit was true!”  
  
“David, I’m hurt,” Satan said with false injury in his voice. “You never asked. And you seemed a smart man, I assumed you’d think if *I* was real then so were all the rest of those things.”  
  
“Do you really think someone who sells his soul to you is a smart man? Are you fuckin’ kidding me?” I gave the snake another glare. Satan managed to move his hood in something like a shrug.  
  
“Perhaps not, but you were…upset at the time. I thought you might make the supposition later.”  
  
“Ah didn’t.” I spat down at the coyote things below. “And now ah get chased by all sorts of ugly things across this God forsaken country.”  
  
“He gave you all souls to protect you from them, to keep you out of their reach. And mine.” Satan reared back and spat a black ball of ooze that smelt like ash and burnt flesh down after mine. One of the coyotes gave a confused, panicked yelp and then exploded in a shower of thin, gossamer threads. The others barked and fled, tails between their legs as they jumped with eerie, deceptive speed through the trees. “I can’t be blamed for mistakes made by the uninformed.”  
  
“Lots o’ folk would say it was wrong o’ you not  to tell us. I guess they’d be missing the point, though.”  
  
“Somewhat.” Satan slunk back down on my far side and began nosing at my gun, an awkward  investigation without hands. He might be the badassest son of a bitch around, but when God said he was stuck being a snake on Earth, he got damned well stuck.  
  
“What do you want?” I sighed eventually.  
  
“Ah, I’m glad you asked,” Satan smiled up at me, abandoning his feigned interest in my pistol. “I have a proposition for you.”  
  
“Another one?”   
  
“Exactly. I need something done, and I’m willing to give your soul back if you do it.” Satan looked out at the rising Sun with blank reptilian eyes, but his tone felt awkward.  
  
“I can barely keep myself from being torn apart spirits and demons – *and* angels, when they come wandering by. All because of you! Why should I help you?”  
  
“Angels?” Satan looked at me quizzically for a moment then nodded in realization. “All humans have souls, so how could you be human without one? Simple thoughts for simple minds.”  
  
“Still ain’t hearing a reason to help you,” I grunted and stood.  
  
“You get your soul back.” Satan blinked, confused. “You won’t be damned eternally into hellfire and the cold, empty silence of-”  
  
“Yeah, gnashing my teeth an’ all that. Kinda what I’m doing now. I lost an ear to one of those bird spirits and two figures where and angel damned near got me with his flaming sword. Hurt all over like a motherfucker pouring oil down my throat and setting it alight. But if that’s all you got, I survived it.” I turned away.  
  
“I see,” Satan’s tone was cold and unfriendly. I tensed, expecting a ball of ooze to melt me like it had done for the coyote spirit. I stopped breathing. Birdsong died. Time stopped. *Everything* stopped. Then Satan’s voice, warm like rot and full of confidence, spoke out again, “I guess I’ll just have to ask the next lost Soulless on my list.”  
  
“You do that. Go find some other poor shit.”  
  
“That's no way to talk about your daughter.”  
  
I stumbled, nearly falling off the tree branch. I fell, grabbing at it desperately as I tried to look at the snake behind me. “What the fuck did you just say?”  
  
“Your daughter,” Satan repeated, blinking as if it was obvious. “She’s next on my list. This alphabet is such a convenient way of organizing things.”  
  
“She’s dead, you shit eating snake. Leave her out of this.” I climbed back to my feet and squared off against the Devil.  
  
“Are you trying to threaten me?” Satan’s tone was dry, flat and unimpressed. There was a lake of cold, reptilian promise behind it, but my blood was up so I got stupid.  
  
“Ah’m just plain threatening you, shit ball,” I drew my gun. “Got plenty of other things I can try to hurt you.”  
  
“I can’t let you do that, Dave. You’ll fail. And you’ll fail to save her too.” Satan smiled. Or at least stretched his mouth and revealed part of his fangs. “I’m sure she’ll be happy to try and win her soul back. Sadly she won’t get one – I can’t give back something I never took, can I?”  
  
“What are you…” I trailed off, my anger smothered by shock. Living on the road meant we hadn’t baptized her. Preachers ain’t always easy to find when you’re travelling. We’d meant to, but…things had happened.  
  
“Souls are just like guns, David. Anyone can pick them up and use them.” Satan slithered along the branch and up my leg until his wicked, grinning face was pressed close to mine. “You could always give her yours. If you had one.”  
  
“You shit!” I said through gritted teeth. I imagined all the hedious, sinful things Satan’s shit-for-souls servants and offspring could be doing to my poor, innocent child. The snake nodded encouragingly as images played over and over again in my mind, things no person should suffer let alone my sweet child. He had me. He’d won. Again. “What do you want?”  
  
“There’s a priest I need killing, and as you know I can’t very well do it myself. He doesn’t like me doing that sort of thing.”  
  
“Just some preacher? A normal, everyday man?” I squinted at Satan, fighting my gag reflex as his hot, sulfuric breath washed over me.  
  
“I have concerns about what he may become. Kill him, and I’ll give your soul to your daughter. She’ll go up to Heaven – and *no* questions asked.” Satan hissed to cut me off as I opened my mouth to speak.  
  
This preacher must be someone special to have the snake so worried. But he weren’t my daughter. I nodded, and Satan grinned.

He wanted to seal the deal, chat and feel,

So I say ""hey mister Devil, what is it you want? You got my soul, no takebacksies, it's a foul!""

The devil glowered at me and stood up all tall, you wouldn't be able to tell it was an angel before the fall, but one thing I knew about dealing with the devil, is that it helps if your degree involved legal...

The devil pulled out a contract, and pointed out a loophole, refunds were possible if he gave back my soul.

You see, the devil wanted something, and he was willing to pay,

And the following, is what he did say.

""Boy I need people, standing by my sides, a human strong and proud, and free will behind their eyes. That there god, on his throne made of gold, he's got a lot of people, the game he's been playing is old, but boy I ain't got nobody, but sinners and busybodies, so I'm recruitin' you for one last scrap.""

So I told the devil, ""That's a load of crap.""

In front of me stands an old acquaintance who I didn’t expect to see again quite this soon. He is handsome and peaceful as you’d expect an angel to be. Nothing about this man would ever betray the true darkness that lie beneath, not his calm blue eyes, his well groomed appearance or his demanding presence. Only the shadow of his broken wings give away a hint of my acquaintance’s doomed nature. 
 
‘Lucifer’,  I say. ‘I don’t believe my time has come.’ 

‘I know our deal, Dave’. He says as anger flashes through his eyes and I expect to be thrown through my living room or pinned against the wall by my throat. Instead, Lucifer reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small, glass box. Inside it is a dark matter with small specs of pure light I recognise with ease. 

‘It’s grown darker since the day I sold it to you,’ I tell him calmly and Lucifer nods as he hands my soul to me.  ‘I need you to listen to me Dave’, he replies as he sits down in the leather armchair in front of me. This man, the creature who’s commanding presence once boiled every nerve in my body now looks like the fallen angel he truly is. Hurt, broken and exiled for a reason he never truly understood. 

‘I once had my reasons for selling you my soul,’ I tell him. ‘And you now have yours for giving it back. Tell me what they are, Lucifer.’

A long silence follows while the demon searches for the right words. ‘Dave,’ he finally says, ‘it’s Him. He is letting everyone into paradise, no matter what they’ve done, no matter if I own their souls, no matter if they ever believed in him, prayed, repented. No matter what. His little pet son convinced the Lord that it was time to drain my existence by denying me any souls. Everyone gets into heaven. My former brothers have even stolen tortured souls off my racks.’

Lucifer’s voice has grown angrier with every sentence he spoke.  I look at him, calmly, as he regains his composure and continues. 

‘I realise that what I’m telling you sounds like good news Dave, but it’s not. What is paradise for one is hell for another. If there is nothing to fear then there is no order. People will do as they please without being fearful of suffering the consequences in eternal life. I am the one they fear, the one that makes them think about their actions, forces them to do good, repent for their sins and help each other. Without me there is no faith, no God and  in time, there will be no world left to live in. I am the bad that needs to exist to let the good prosper. And heaven,’ Lucifer lets out a deep sigh. ‘Dave, souls do not change when they move on to eternal existence.’

Lucifer pauses once more before finishing his plea, not knowing that I already understand what needs to be done. 

‘I need you to show the Lord, Dave. I need you to die. I need you to help me.’

I look the angel in the eyes, knowing that he just told me I’ll get into heaven no matter what. Knowing that instead I will die, here and now in order to make the Almighty exile me to be put on the racks. Knowing it has to be done. 

‘I’ll help you.’

"[WP]You sold your soul to the Devil some years ago, today he gives it back and says, ""I need a favor"".",worktillyouburk,"The weird thing was how much it looked like a Christmas tree ornament, red and shiny, although I guess to be properly festive the swirling streaks of smoke would have been gold instead of a sort of angry smoke-color. Twice the size of a ping pong ball, with about as much weight, it definitely didn’t look like a soul, much less mine. 

But the look on his face wasn’t the sort that invited questions, so I just stood there, trying not to somehow crush the thing before I even got out of the parking garage. 

“I don’t normally do this sort of thing, you understand.” 

The devil wasn’t a tall man, wasn’t particularly remarkable looking in any way. You’d expect a sinister beard, a lean physique with a vest and a red silk shirt, but he looked more like an accountant than a saxophone player, with a slightly rumpled sweater and slacks the exact color of dirt. I’ll tell you something, though: it takes a truly scary man to make cable-knit look intimidating, and when that kind of man comes along, you don’t ask him about his fashion sense.

So I just nodded, and smiled, and tried not to calculate my odds of survival.

“In this case, though, you have something I want.” 

Almost exactly the same words he’d said to me the first time around, standing in exactly the same parking space, and the fact that he was the one asking for the favor did absolutely nothing to shift the balance of power. 

“Honestly? I can’t imagine what that would be.” 

He smiled at that, a terrifying quirk of his lips that was all amusement and no warmth.

“They never do.” 

The smile was gone as quickly as it had come, and he gestured to my soul with a dismissive flick of his hand. 

“All you need to know is that when I’m done with you, you and your soul get to spend the rest of your short, pathetic lives together, with no big bad boogie man holding an eternity of damnation and clerical work over your head.”

The shiny little red ball pulsed warm in my hand for a moment, and then as suddenly as all of this had begun, it vanished. My fingers tightened convulsively over the empty space, in the same instant that I realized how useless that would be, how desperate it would make me look. I shoved both hands in my pockets to keep them out of any more trouble.

“What is it you want from me?”

The devil pursed his lips, tapped his fingers lightly on the hood of the blood red Ferarri. I concentrated very hard on breathing in and then out again and on not imagining what he could possibly want from me. We’d recently agreed to represent Antonio Leonetti, who maybe was really just a bookkeeper, and who probably had more blood on his hands than that guy who ran the red light and T-boned an ambulance. Antonin Ivanov owed us at least two favors for the strings we’d pulled for his cousin, one of them directly to me. 

How many other assholes had I helped stay on the streets? How many monsters thought that I was a pretty decent guy? Why, exactly, had I thought that shoving morality into a storage locker eighteen years ago was a good idea, and how badly would I end up regretting it this time?

It just goes to show that you really don’t ever have any idea how much worse things can get.

All I had wanted was a nice house in Culver City and a work from home paralegal job so I didn't have to commute along with an erasure of my student loans.

I'm not that ambitious, but can you imagine that kind of security?

So I was curled up on my couch with my gentle pitbull Francis at my feet when the door bell rings. It occurs to me that I don't have a door bell and that clock on the wall reads 3:15. The door bell rings again it, it sounds like the echoing off of cavern walls. 

Francis jumps to his feet. His ears perk up. And her points to the door front door and growls.

The doors rings again. I shut off Netflix and open my front door. As I do the heat of a hellgate rushes into the room and Lucifer himself steps through. His horns are subtle. His eyes are red. And two impish demons flutter by carrying a chest and a glass of wine.

""Martin,"" he says, ""may we come in?""

""Uhh... sure,"" I said.

The Devils rolls his eyes.

""You have to say the ritual words?""

""Oh right..."" I say straining my memory, ""Lucifer, oh Morning Star cast from Heaven, may be welcome in my home as you were in pandemonium.""

""Thank you he stepped in,"" Francis growled. He took a seat and opened the chest. Inside was the purplish gem on which I had breathed my soul into just two years out of USC.

""Look, Martin,"" he said as the Imp produced a magical Goblet filled and poured it with warm wine, ""The world changes so much that even folks like me make mistakes. What worked in the middle ages tends to backfire on you later you know?""

I'd given up my soul willingly, but now I'm wondering if there was something wrong with mine.

""No, you're souls fine,"" he said, ""in fact I want to give it back. I need a favor from you.""

""What kind of favor?"" I said.

""It's these assholes,"" he snapped his fingers and my television clicked to a strange guy with a flashy suit and weird hair. He spoke in a strange Texan accent about how God needed him to build a jet if only the people he spoke to would plant seed faith money to buy it. The Devil shook his head in utter dismay.

""Can you believe this shit?"" he said, ""Give me money and God will heal you. Fuckin' gullible ass humans make me embarrassed sometimes.""

""Yes, Lucifer,"" I said sipping the wine still confused.

""Look I made a deal with these assholes so they could start a Television network right? I think called it TBN or something, I don't know I didn't pay attention,"" he said, ""At first I thought I'd get one of my classic ironic punishments: Fame, influence, and money... and then watch them weep as it rings hollow and they find no joy. I didn't think they'd be this sick though, or this successful.""

My mind wandered curious about what level of hell they would go to. This is what people with English degrees do after they leave college. We're exciting.

""Sure I'll punish them in the Heretic circle,"" the Devil continued, ""but look at their followers!""

He indicated to screen. Cheering, sobbing, convulsing masses were involved in some crazy orgiastic ritual that involved cheering and throwing of money.

""They're going to take over, Martin,"" he said, ""I'd have a civil war!""

I stepped up and drank up my wine.

""We'll I'd love to have my soul back,"" I said completely unable to convince even myself, ""what exactly do you want from me?""

""Hitmen,"" he said.

""What?"" I said spit taking out the wine, ""Do I look like a contract killer?""

""No Martin, you don't,"" he said, ""But you can help me get a few out of prison. You'll still keep your nose clean. Hell I'll even uphold the terms of our old contract.""

He stood up. I felt the room get a little darker.

That voice.  It brushed fingertips across your spine.  Every word melted into your brain, silken honey smooth.  There was arousal and fear, pain and promise.  It woke me instantly with no early morning stupor, my eyes flashing open.  Straight from sleep to consciousness.

I'll never forget that voice.  

He sat across from me.  Impossibly beautiful.  Endlessly attractive.  Deeply disturbing.

I risked a sentence.

""Please.  For the love of everything holy.  Please.  Fuck off.""

A theatrical gasp, feigned looks of shock and hurt.  I was straighter than a freeway yet felt myself go hard just at the shape of his lips.  I dropped my head.  If I didn't look, maybe he'd have no power over me.  Maybe I wouldn't fuck it all up like last time.

""Language!  Now, now, Crash,"" he admonished.  ""We're old friends!  Why would you hurt me so?""

I ignored his question and slumped up, sitting on the edge of my bed.  ""Is it time already?  I don't feel dead.""

His laugh was deeper than the ocean.  It shouldn't sound so pleasant, so genuinely amused, so comforting.  It was a brass bell from a distant tower, a drum beat in another room.  ""No.  Not yet.  Noooot yeeeet...""

I looked up, annoyed at his toying tone, mistakenly glancing straight into his eyes.  They were crystal clear and full of happiness.  They were bright and shining stars.

They were endless voids with no end.  

I caught myself before I tumbled too far into them.

He laughed again.

""No, not yet.  In fact, Crash, old friend.  Maybe not ever.""

""There's always a catch.""

""I fuckin' know you!  There's always a catch!""

""Like, in the bible 'know' me?  I think I'd remember that.  And you're quite the catch.""  He smiled.  A little smile with endless warmth.

""You know what I mean!"" I yelled.  ""It all went to shit!""

""Young man, you can't blame me for that.  I gave you exactly what you wanted.""

""And look where I am now!""

He glanced around.  The cell was eight by eight feet.  There was a frosted window high in the wall, much higher than I could hope to reach that let in feeble light that just happened to strike him across his face, bringing shadows to his neck and shoulders and light to his eyes.  Not a coincidence.  He was sitting on top of my desk, feet on one of two chairs in this cage.  The other seat was a toilet.

He looked around.  ""So you're saying you have better offers?""

----------

That familiar lurch.  The cold of moving *between* things.  A rush of wind and I gasped for breath as we appeared a carefully clipped lawn.  I flopped to the dirt and sucked in warm, fresh air, trying to lose the chill in my arms and legs.  He was still talking to me but his voice was far away, but growing closer.

""...just her type, really.  I couldn't have planned it better if I tried.  You'll need to move a bit fast or the other guy will pip you.  You've got the advantage in that that poor soul doesn't know what's coming, whereas you know the master plan.  I've given you a haircut, by the way, and trimmed that brambled filth you called a beard.  You've still got the gifts I gave you, so I'm sure you'll have no trouble winning her over.""

I rose slowly to my feet.  He was used to moving *between*, but it still took me a long time to get back to normal.

""Don't forget your new ID, I've put it in your pocket.  And you'll like her.  Love her, really.  She's adorable, just like... well... you know who... but not a rampant hussy like she was.""

""I hate this shit,"" I mumbled, holding my stomach contents in.

""LANGUAGE!  Especially with her.  She's a bit of a prude and won't take to a potty mouth at all.  Also... like I said, she's got a 'good samaritan' complex, so... well... I'm apologising in advance, alright?""

Pain spiked up the side of my face as he slammed his fist into my still-reeling head.  I did vomit, then, prison crud all over the clipped lawns and small garden beside.  He hit me again, thundering a fist into my stomach then back into my face.  

Distractedly, I watched as his foot rose up to strike my stomach.  His balance was perfect, his timing impeccable.  You could play music to this beating.  His face was all glee and happiness and spattered blood and vomit.  

I thumped into the dirt once again as the light started to fade from my eyes.

""Remeber, Crash.  New ID.  New life.  Your old soul back.  You have three days.  Three days to make her fall in love with you."" That laugh again, deep and mirthful.  ""Heck, you'll definitely fall for her, God knows you're a sucker for her type.""  A harsh hand on the back of my head.  ""And then you deflower her, Crash.  That's the important part.  Three days.""

Blood dripped from my lips.  ""Three days, fuck you.""

""Language!  Now.  Put your stage face on.  Here she comes, stage left.  She sees your plight, your broken body and battered face."" A distant gasp.  ""On her lawn! What an atrocity to occur in this area, a good, God-fearing neighbourhood!  She runs.""  Pattering.  Small feet in rapid steps.  He leans close to my ear.  She can't see him, nor hear him.  Only the fallen are granted that priviledge.  ""This is your cue, Crash.  Three days.  No more.  I believe in you.""

I groan as the pain finally breaks through the stupor induced by his presence.  There are warm hands on my shoulders as I roll to the floor, hot tears on my cheeks.  I realise they're not mine, I stopped crying years ago.

""God, what happened!"" her voice is surprised but lovely.  I can't see her clearly through my swelling eyes, but she has dark eyes and short, brown hair in framing a plain but friendly face.  I try to speak but just choke on my blood.

""Mary!""  a voice from the house.  ""What are you doing out there? Who is that?""

""Hold on, Papa!"" she calls, then sniffs. ""Help me! He's hurt!""

Her light hands check me over, looking for wounds when another pair roughly grab at my pockets, pulling out the last thing the devil gave me.

""Can you hear me? What's your name?"" she calls, as another voice speaks to an ambulance operator.

""Mary.  Here."" the other voice.  The voice from the house.  Her house.

I see 'my' wallet change hands.

She looks at the ID inside and smiles, wiping the tears from her eyes.  ""Don't worry.  You're safe with us.  You're safe with me, Joseph.""

[WP] England’s string of bad luck continues as Argentina launches a surprise attack and captures the entirety of Great Britain,CrazyCrazyCanuck,"After Southampton was sacked in 1338, the people of the city, lacking funds to build a proper defensive wall, had merged the existing walls of the merchant houses to form a defensive wall.  

I knew this because I'd walked by and spotted the plaque about twenty minutes ago.  I'm not used to walled cities.  But I guess the walls weren't totally useless, because centuries later, I found myself hiding behind them, hoping that none of the bullets would hit me as the helicopter flew low and slow.

I felt for my passport, in my right-hand pocket.  It was still there.  Good.  But... First things first.  Not getting shot.

Off on the other side of the wall, they were landing their boats.  As I watched, Two police cars pulled up.  A cop got out of one car, opened the trunk of the other car and pulled out a rifle.  Before he could aim, he slumped forwards.

I pulled out my phone, gave it the side-to-side shake that turned on the camera.  As the men climbed out of their lurid orange lifeboats and advanced, a grizzled bearded one held a flag high.  I pushed to take a picture.  I ducked for cover again and looked at the picture as I uploaded it to Facebook.  Light blue, white, light blue, with a sun in the center.

I was distracted by the sound of a jet fighter's engines, then a sudden wooshing sound, followed by a fast explosion.

""Surrender or we'll open fire!"" I heard.

I pulled my passport from my pocket, held it in my right hand as I raised my hands.  ""Don't shoot!  I'm an American!""

I had a bunch of assault rifles pointed at me as I stood up.  ""Okay, American,"" one of them said.  ""You are now a prisoner of the Argentine Army.  Walk forward.  Slowly.  Hands where I can see them.""

[WP] England’s string of bad luck continues as Argentina launches a surprise attack and captures the entirety of Great Britain,CrazyCrazyCanuck,"Sunday Night. A Full House at the MetLife Stadium. After 120 minutes of tense fighting, the Copa America Final reached the final stage - a cruel penalty shootout. Lionel Messi, the best soccer player on earth, stepped up to take his penalty.

""You know what to do, Leo. All we need is the signal from you.""

""Yes, Commander. I'll try my best.""

Messi placed the ball and took a few strides back. Argentinian troops were lurking right outside Blackpool, fueld for revenge for Falkland; there was no better time than now, with all the Englishmen in France dreaming about their whale-watching holiday. 45 degrees launch angle, max power with left foot - that should get it right to Bristol, terrifying the English defence while the troops make a surprise landing in Blackpool. Then, with the help of Scotland, Argentina will storm through the nation in no time. Messi took a deep breath, ran up to the ball and absolutely blasted it with his left foot.

The ball sailed over the bar, far into the night sky of New York.

The crowd was stunned. The Chilean players jumped up in joy. Messi took one look into the distance, turned around and slowly walked back to his teammates, covering his face in his hands.

""Sorry Diego, I overhit it.""

30 minutes later, an Argentinian soldier charged into the office of the commander. ""Commander Maradona,“ he shouted, gasping for air. His face was bright red, filled with excitement and disbelief.

""Yes?"" Maradona looked up from his phone.

""A missile just hit the Big Ben! The clock is down!""

""All units attack!"" Maradona screams into his microphone. ""I repeat, all units attack!""

As his battleship jolted forward, Maradona sat down and picked up the phone. 

""Leo, I know I can count on you. Now, quit the team and join me; we'll take over the world.""

"[WP]After the occurrence of Brexit and the threat of seceding nations in the United Kingdom the crown takes control and decides to ahem...""re-acquire"" them.",Crypticlibrarian,"She couldn't just sit back and watch any longer. For days the pundits had been telling her that there was no chance that the UK would vote to destroy itself. She raged at the sight of the empire of her childhood crumbling at her feet. She loathed the boredom of her reign and craved to rule a kingdom like her most esteemed ancestor and namesake, the Virgin Queen.

Memories of her father leading the British people through their darkest hour instilled in her the deepest desire for making something of herself. Everything in her life had been handed to her, and she felt compelled to leave her mark on her beloved kingdom. It didn't matter to her that she would never reign over a British Empire that covered every corner of the globe. She would die before she let her subjects and her kingdom down in what could be its biggest crisis since her father's trials. 

Just because the country shot itself in the foot doesn't mean that the queen will not hold her weekly Audience with David.

""Your Majesty.""

""Oh David, sit down. Let's not waste any time here as we are, how do the Americans say it? Oh right, fucked.""

David, shocked, stood back but then obeyed her order.

""I plan to announce to the press that I will be stepping down by October. I am here to tell you first, and in person."" He nervously wiped his clammy palms on his jacket pocket and said, ""To be frank I truly thought that we had a great relationship as PM and the queen. It was you and me leading this country through some pretty good ...""

""Oh cut the crap David and listen to what I am going to do. I am the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."" Her voice was slowly getting louder and louder. ""I will not allow some bonehead Trump wanna-be to destroy the Kingdom that my predecessors worked so dutifully to build."" She asked, ""David, you will gather both Houses in Parliament at 5 pm tonight, and I will be the one making an announcement. Be sure that this is telecasted to the entire country. Brexit never was and never will be a thing.""



She walked into the room and could feel that all eyes were on her. In all of the media frenzy that led up to the vote, the Queen hadn't uttered a single word on the matter. 

""Good Evening Members of Parliament. Thank you for all coming this London evening. The people have made a terrible mistake in voting for this Brexit, and I am here to fix it. Yes, I the Queen. The one who has been sitting here technically ruling this country. Since this Kingdom is actually a constitutional *monarchy,* I have the final say in what happens. I hereby decree that in the matter of 'Should the United Kingdom remain or leave the European Union,' the United Kingdom shall remain. Good Evening and Good Night.""

That was all it took for her to be right back in the driver's seat.

"[WP] You are part of an elite band of soldiers tasked with killing enemies on ""the other side"". You enter battle by killing yourself.",DinosaurRageQuit,"Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. I was getting sick of the heart monitor. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.

My first week here, the monitor was the bane of my dull existence. I couldn't tune it out, no matter how hard I tried to ignore it. The beeping was constantly there, a constant reminder that yes, my tired old heart was still beating. Beep. Beep. Beep. By the second week, it finally faded into background noise, which was worse. Some tiny part of me was still afraid of death, and that annoying beep was a reminder that after ninety years, I was still ticking. I was kind of proud of my heart; ninety years, it had been pumping with barely any issues. You keep going, you lovely little lump of muscle.

By week three, I was back to wanting to tear the monitor apart with my bare hands. There was never anything good on the little TV in my hospital room, and I didn't get many visitors. I was just another old man with no family and few friends that hadn't beaten me in the race to the grave. Eleanor had been dead five years - no, no, ten years. Ten years. It was so damn hard to keep track.

At the start of week four, a dead man walked through the door, wearing a general's uniform festooned with medals, colored bars, and two stars at the shoulder. General Matthew Ellis, in the goddamn flesh. I sat up at the sight of him. ""Matthew?"" I gasped, trying to understand how the man that had grown up like my brother was still alive. I had *seen* him die. Been at the funeral. But there he was, hair white as snow and nose as crooked as a bad comb.

Matthew smiled sadly. ""Grant,"" he said, and the face of my friend vanished. I cursed myself. Matthew's son, Grant. I could see the differences, now. Grant had his mother's high cheekbones and eyes, green as summer grass. Fuck, I felt stupid.

Grant sat down at my bedside, laughing gently as he lay his attache case across his lap. An old leather thing, probably as old as me. ""It's alright,"" he said. ""How are you feeling?""

""Shit,"" I said honestly. ""The food's terrible, there's nothing good on the tube, and there's some bastard with lung cancer next door that won't stop coughing.""

""It's gotta be better than Normandy, though,"" Grant said.

I thought about Normandy. Charging up the beach, barely eighteen, with bullets whizzing past my head and artillery booming in the distance. Death could have been a step away, and I wouldn't have been able to stop it.

""A little bit,"" I conceded. My eyes kept drifting back to the attache case. There was something about it, some memory fighting to surface... ""Why are you here?""

""A man can't come to check up on his dying old godfather?"" Grant laughed.

""In full dress uniform?""

Grant stopped laughing. ""It's not just business,"" he promised. ""I swear, I'd wanted to come sooner, but the last few weeks have been..."" He tightened his lips. A quirk of his mother's; there was something he wanted to say, but he didn't know how to say it. ""...Busy.""

""I understand, relax,"" I chuckled, though truth be told I was a bit bitter that he hadn't thought to visit. ""So, what could you want with a dying old man like m-""

I fell silent.

""Oh.""

""Yeah.""

""They're enlisting?""

""Yeah.""

""First time in, damn, thirty years, isn't it?""

""There's movement. I don't understand it, thank God, but the spooks are saying it's big.""

""Isn't it always?"" I let my head sink into the pillows. ""Christ. And they want me?""

""Captain Walker asked for you by name.""

Walker! I felt an old revulsion and respect that I hadn't felt in decades. ""That mad old bastard,"" I growled. ""Is he here? He's here, isn't he?""

Grant looked around the small room. ""I don't *think* so,"" he guessed. ""Maybe? I don't know. I can't see 'im.""

""'Course you can't. He's *dead.* He wants me?""

""And a few others,"" Grant said, opening the attache case. ""I've been flying across the country all month, convincing as many of them as I could.""

""Anybody I know?""

""Can't say,"" Grant said. ""I guess I don't have to give you the spiel?""

""I heard it from Walker, before he..."" I mimed putting a gun to my temple and firing it. ""Y'know. I thought he was crazy.""

""At the time.""

""The man wanted to build a unit of dead soldiers to *fight evil ghosts.* Of course I thought he was nuts. Damn him for being *right.*""

""If you don't want to, nobody's going to blame you,"" Grant said. ""There's no pay, no glory, no retirement...""

I stared up at the ceiling and listened to the heart monitor. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Counting seconds of my life. How many of them did I really have left? I *could* join the Ghost Riders - I had a few old friends that Walker had talked into it back during the Singing Mountain disaster - but that would be it. Being a Rider would trap me on Earth for eternity, never passing on. 

I'd never see Eleanor. I'd never see Clara, and beg her forgiveness for being such a terrible father to her. I didn't even know what was waiting after death; ectology was a fresh discipline, barely thirty years old, and nobody knew if Heaven actually existed as we believed it did.

Do my duty, and join the Riders, or take a gamble and hope to see my family again.

""I don't know,"" I said. ""I'm sorry, but... I don't know.""

Grant smiled sadly. ""I didn't think you would,"" he said, taking something from the case. A necklace, teeth and feathers on a wooden cord. One of Walker's. He placed it on the bedside table. ""For if you decide,"" he said.

""You can't stay?"" I asked.

He shook his head. ""I wish I could. I really do. But I've just got too much to do,"" he said. ""I'm sorry.""

""Can't wait around for an old man to die,"" I said. ""I understand. Completely.""

""I'm sorry,"" he said again, putting a wrinkled hand on my shoulder. God, when had he gotten so old? I had seen him in diapers. He shouldn't look so *old.*

Beep. Beep. Beep.

I put my hand over his, weakly gripping it. ""Thank you,"" I said. ""Give your family my best.""

""I will,"" he said.

And then he was gone. Leaving me alone, with a beeping heart monitor and a vapid talk show on the television.

I sighed. ""Walker,"" I said to the empty room, ""would you mind turning that shit off for me?""

The screen shut off. I felt a cold - sort of *weight* on my shoulder, and then it was gone.

Beep. Beep. Beep.

I don't know how long I lay there, thinking. I don't know when I made my decision, but I looked down and saw the necklace hanging around my neck.

Beep. Beep. Beep.

Paradise was probably overrated, anyway.

Beep. Beep. Beep.

"[WP] You are part of an elite band of soldiers tasked with killing enemies on ""the other side"". You enter battle by killing yourself.",DinosaurRageQuit,"Historian Balund Amarth on the Batala

The death ritual or ""Batala"" was performed by the C'Aliana people before any battle or skirmish. A warrior wishing to perform the Batala would dig a grave and place a family heirloom or other important item in the grave and doing so would symbolize the soul staying behind when the warrior would go into battle so that the warrior's would could remain untainted and unhurt by the inherent sinning required to do battle.

This excerpt is from a Fubari warrior's journal and gives us a first hand account of what it was like to wage war against the C'Aliana

"" All of us miss our families and the war was lost long long ago. We are leaderless and unable to flee any time one of us rises to run we are struck down by a stone from an Aliana slinger with eyes red with passion and a tongue thirsting for blood. When anyone rises to attack they are brought down by an Aliana spear man with a mind maddened by battle and gleefully laughing. We can no longer hide here. There is nothing else to do. They will not stop. They will not tire. I'm done with this fighting and so I will end my suffering. ""

Did the Batala actually grant the C'Aliana superhuman fighting capabilities? Or did it merely lead them believe they had them? Or did it have no effect over them and their fighting capabilities were due to training rather than ritual?",Ugunti72
"[WP] You are part of an elite band of soldiers tasked with killing enemies on ""the other side"". You enter battle by killing yourself.",DinosaurRageQuit,"Captain-commander Broderick with scars that paint his body as proof of his value in battle, marched towards the lost ancient Castle Loan. 
Once ruled by the fair and sovereign King-commander Magneus Chaplean whose whole loyal order took the first honours of entering the most unknown and occult battlefield by order of the holy God emperor, paying their own lives as a toll in an endeavour to weaken as much of the sinister lord's revival, once the immortal brother of the Holy god Emperor.
The captain-commander and his band of seasoned battle-brothers and loyal sergeant have stepped on the unholy plains of Maleus, lands long forsaken and ruled by false kings and idols, thus know what may lurk in the Dark Empire, The layered Hell.  
Broderick and Sergeant Sammael zealously entered the fray in the fiercest and most violent battles of the Long Grey Mass Crusade in their younger years. All the while the foul stench of decaying corpses and innards of false idols, false kings and brethren followed them in every glorious victory. 

Tempered by blood, hardened by steel and blessed by the Celestial order, Ordo Sacratus. These warriors whole mere existance in the mortal plains were to extinguish the growing unholy presence in the forsaken lands. They were proven victorious in a mere quadranscentennial of unending battle. Although victorious in the mortal realm, they were needed for one last holy battle on unholy grounds. One where the God emperor himself couldn't win, as it was the realm of his damned brother.

The few once swallowed by the sanguine rivers that streamed between thousands of unholy beasts, thousands of heretics and thousands of brethren and still respire, walked understandably imperious beside Broderick and Sammael. They had seen Hell on mortal plains and the God emperor himself in their nightmares, ordering every single of the band to not falter as they have to perform the Grey Mass in castle Loan.

A small and soft prayer was chanted by the last remnants of the damned Templar Crusaders as they entered Loan, the ancient castle still shined with imperial glory, truly an example of what the will of the God emperor can do. The chant was in honour of the battle-brothers whom have relinquished their unfaltering mortal fury before them.

&gt;The marching band entered between a gargantuan cliff and saw the glorious castle Loan in the distance, shining in its everlasting glory. The castle was not a mere castle, it was in fact a kingdom hidden away of the corruptions of false kings, false idols and lost children of the God emperor. The walls of the cliff had enormous erected statues of knights in ancient plated armour and wielding inscribed swords *Per aspera ad inferi* these were the taunts taught in the Ordo Sacratus. As they marched further, they noticed that every knight statue had similar names of the living members of the band. It were just 15. The closer they got to the Kingdom the bigger the statue of King Magnus Chaplean became, it was towering like a mountain, Magnus Chaplean had a jewel encrusted crown, eyes with burning vigour, armour similar to the knights, but with more symbols of the God emperor and a sword with runes and with the similar inscription the band witnessed beforehand. Behind the king stood a wide bridge where thousands of men could have marched next to eachother. They finally entered and walked through the kingdom.  

&gt;Broderick and his band was in awe by the sheer mass of shining plate armor that were knelt down with a misericorde between their ribs. Must have been hundred of thousands loyal battle-brothers.

Broderick, Sammael and their battle-brothers knelt down towards the huge throne of shining granite where a small figure was visible. The figure stood towering before his throne with a misericorde between his ribs. Upon further thought and inspection, they knew that the king died while standing his ground, never faltering.

""*Per aspera ad inferi, for Hell itself shall feel our righteous fury!*"" Broderick said with a huge grin and stuck his own misericorde through his heart.

&gt;All the warriors their visions turned dark and saw their whole life and previous lives flashing by and then a sudden light awoke them. The band saw a huge battlefield filled with corpses and only a single towering figure in the vanguard, with a tattered red bloodstained cape and weathered armour against a whole horde of demonic beings that were not seen by mortal eyes before.

While King Magneus Chaplean charged, he catched a glimpse of the band and his face lightened up as if seeing old dear friends and charged straight into the horde. ""*Praise the Emperor, my faith in you was not in vain!*"" the ancient king said.

Somehow, the King seemed familiar to the band and the whole company of battle-brothers smiled once again for a long time and charged into the fray with utmost fanaticism. ""Protect the king battle-brothers and await for reinforcements!""",riqing
"[WP] You are part of an elite band of soldiers tasked with killing enemies on ""the other side"". You enter battle by killing yourself.",DinosaurRageQuit,"I’ve died thirty eight times in my life. Well. Mostly died. You really only get the one actual death. You know those stories people tell after their near death experiences? The ones with tunnels, and lights, and voices? Men of science didn’t believe them, they had put it up to self-comforting hallucinations or some such. They’ve really been scratching their heads the last couple of years, the smug bastards. The religious will tell you that it’s you getting set to go to heaven or hell, or wherever your souls go depending on the deity you believe in. Well, those stories are actually about a world that most only catch glimpses of. One that you have to be dead to reach. Well. Mostly dead.  See, everybody in their stories only talk about either going forward, to the light, or turning back, returning to life. We in the Program, we go left.
  
Some asshole, back when the Program started, decided that we would be Dreads. The ones who put us under and bring us back are Maxes. Yeah. The nerds won on that one. We Dreads hunt creatures from that middle world, that one between life and the after. We hunt them in the middle world because it’s incredibly difficult to hurt them in ours. They’re damned near invincible here on Earth. When they break through, the fight isn’t about killing the creature, it’s only about getting them sent back. So then we can find them. Then kill them.  
  
The most recent creature to break through had gone on a rampage through downtown San Francisco during Fleet Week, and holy shit what a goat fuck that was. The Admiral in charge of it all had decided to scramble some F-18s to try and kill the damned thing.  I mean, the thing was only half again as big as a grizzly, and the man thinks the best way to deal with it was with a couple of Super Hornets? The fighters honestly did almost as much damage as the creature did. So because of Admiral Dipshit, all sorts of higher ups are now breathing down our necks, wanting results pronto.  
  
So it’s off to the other side. My Max is about ready to put me under. I can’t remember the names of all the drugs in the damned syringe. I know that it’s pretty similar to all the lethal injection cocktails they used to use for capital punishment. The Maxes put us under for about 30 minutes. That’s hours over on the other side. Plenty of time to stalk and kill our creature. I’ll be dead. But it’s reversible. Well. Mostly reversible.

I looked at the syringe. The serum was bright pink and almost looked innocuous, similar to pepto-bismol. At least I'll be ready against diarrhea. I rolled up my left sleeve and slid the syringe effortlessly into my vein. 

""As a final word of caution, try not to be alarmed when you cross, just treat it like any other simulation...""

My eyes drooped and my vision became hazy. Suddenly, a thought in the back of my mind wondered, ""will this even work?""...

None of us remember when we first joined. They can almost imagine a blurry image of themselves outside this world, but they don't know what it means, exactly. There's something there - a spark - but it started to die long ago.

We sit around the fire and eat quietly. We learned that conversation is irrelevant. The Big Man paces around us and stares.

""Tonight,"" he says, ""maggots."" He steps on Twelve and grinds his boot down into the man's stomach. ""Tonight is the night we've been waiting for. You pathetic pieces of shit have gotten worse and worse. Who here thinks they're ready to fight for their country?""

Two raises his hand meekly.

""Right you are,"" The Big Man says. He pulls out his pistol and shoots Two in the face - point blank.

They taught us not to flinch. We don't. Two is dead, and he's gone, and he's sprawled out on the ground, and all we do is stare. His blood runs towards the fire, sizzling as it goes.

""Now,"" The Big Man says, ""who here is willing to enter battle like a man?"" He holds up the pistol. ""I'll see you all on the other side.""

Bang.

Now, it's our turn.",splendid_giraffes

You enter battle by killing yourself.",DinosaurRageQuit,"Tormund ran calloused fingers over the gold pendant clutched in his hands. He delicately thumbed open the catch, eyes locked on the picture that lay within.  His little girl, Lisa, laughing like a loon as his beautiful wife tickled her, her dark eyes creased with laugh lines. The picture was old, somewhat faded. His wife was older now, dark locks streaked with white, though her eyes were just as vibrant and alive as the day he'd met her. And Lisa... almost an adult now, as fierce and beautiful as her mother had always been, though he took pride in the wry arc of her brow and silver tongue—those were all him. His eyes closed, trying to visualize them as he had last seen them, tearful but loving as they said goodbye. They would be taken care of. Of that, he had made sure. His death would buy them a comfortable life.

""Attention, men! The ritual has commenced. You souls are being primed for battle. Firm your resolve! The stronger your will, the more powerful your spirit will be in the wars to come. Let's send those fuckers back to the hell they crawled out of!"" The gregorian chanting grew louder. Tormund felt an almost imperceptible buzzing at the edge of his awareness. Was this what animals felt, when they sensed a coming storm? He closed the pendant, tucked it in behind his chain mail. It rested directly over his heart. He was ready. 

Ready to die. 

Ready to fight.

Ready to kill. 

He reached for the poisoned goblet as it was handed to him, passed down the line of men. It smelled like the copper of blood, and sulfur, and citrus. He caught a faint tinge he thought might be wormwood. It looked like wine. His face screwed up in disgust, but his eyes were resolute. He took a sip. A sip was enough.

He felt his face becoming numb as he handed the goblet to the man beside him. His vision seemed fuzzy along the edges, and his muscles felt strangely relaxed. His heart was eerily loud. The chanting grew faster.

""Now is your time, men! Remember that for which you fight! The armies of the dead will tremble before you. The void is calling! The light of God is calling! Fate is calling! Heaven is at your back, and you guard the gates of eternity!""

Tormund barely felt it when he died.

Darkness.

Wet.

Can't breathe. Can't breathe! Tormund exploded from the frigid waters, gasping for air. Deep, hungry breaths, lungs burning, hands trembling. As he breathed, the burning slowly subsided, until it disappeared altogether. In fact, his lungs felt oddly empty, but without the subtle pressure he'd always associate with that in life.

—in life?

Ah, right. He was dead. Fuck. Tormund let out a breath, and then held it. He waited for the sensation of breathlessness, the instinctual urge to breathe in, but it never happened. He was dead. Did souls need to breathe?

Having collected himself, he looked around, examining his surroundings. He was standing in a shallow marsh, the water dark and oddly still. The world was empty, but for a faint ambient lighting that grew indistinct near the edges, reminding him of the caves and tunnels of his youth. The sky was the same indistinct grey, once again bringing to mind arching roof of a giant underground cave. Squinting, he noticed under the still water the pale, dead faces of his contemporaries, lying face up under the surface. Their faces were peaceful in death.

He still hadn't taken a breath.

""Well, now, this is unexpected.""

Tormund whipped around, hand reaching for the pommel of a ghostly sword. A shadow stood across from him, standing on the water's surface. It clapped slowly, sarcastically congratulating him.

""I didn't expect anyone to wake up on their own. This batch was supposed to be a bunch of canon-fodder mercenaries—couldn't sense a spirit if it was standing right behind them. You must have an inkling of awareness, though—some nymph got freaky with your grandfather, probably. Oh, well. It doesn't matter at this point. You're all just food for the lake, now. ""

"[WP] You are part of an elite band of soldiers tasked with killing enemies on ""the other side"". You enter battle by killing yourself.",DinosaurRageQuit,"Tormund didn't understand what was happening, but he'd been a soldier all his life, and he knew trouble when it stared him in the face. And this—this was trouble. 

He'd been betrayed enough times to know treachery when it stabbed him in the back.

""Where are we? Where are the legions of hell, approaching the gates of heaven. And the heavenly host, come to fight with us?"" He masked the uncertainty in his voice with practiced bravado. Just buy time, Tormund. Just buy time until the others wake up and we can tear this shadow a new asshole. Answers can come later.

The shadow seemed to find these questions funny, and though it had no face, the slight tilt of its head conveyed that amusement quite well. ""Legions of hell? Heavenly host? Is that what they told you? I have a hard time keeping track, at this point.""

This was getting more unsettling by the minute. As subtly as he could, he nudged the man beside him with his foot. No response. ""Were those lies, then? The Church has reneged on their agreement?"" He took a step forward, using the motion to mask a solid kick to the man's face.

""Oh, not at all. The agreement is going quite well. The Church furnishes us with a steady supply of human souls. In return, we keep the beast asleep and far away from the mortal realm. Quite the generous bargain from our end, if I'm being honest."" This fucker wouldn't know honesty if it fucked him in his dark, shadowy asshole. Tormund glanced to the side. Still no movement from John. 

The shadow gave what must have been malevolent grin. ""They sleep like the dead, don't they?"" And he broke into pearls of laughter, like this was the funniest thing he'd ever heard.

The thing shaped like a man mimed wiping a single tear from its eye. ""Ah, I crack myself up sometimes."" He took in the grim set of Tormund's face. ""Some people just don't have a sense of humor. You and the Beast have that in common. But you'll be getting to know each other quite intimately, I expect.""

As if in answer, the ground beneath trembled ominously. Tormund stumbled, almost fell over, but caught himself on one knee. The shadow was undisturbed, standing safely on the water. ""Well, that's my cue. It was nice talking with ya, sweet pea. Not that it'll matter, in a bit.""

That didn't sound good. ""Wait!"" He bellowed. The shadow stopped. ""What—what about God? Does he really let this happen?""

The silhouette of a man laughed, but seemed forced somehow. Pained. ""God's dead, kid. That's why we're in this mess in the first place. The safeguards are broken. All we can do is stave off the inevitable."" Another rumble, as the floor seemed to heave beneath them. Tormund caught himself again, but when he looked up, the shadow-man was gone. The floor felt clammy, somehow slimy and lukewarm. It bucked again, then disappeared, sending him crashing into deeper water.

The cold numbed his legs, and seemed to sap his will, making his movements sluggish and his limbs cumbersome. He managed to get his head above water.

To the right he noticed an eerie blue glow. An orb of light, attached to a fleshy pole that plunged deep into the waters. The men underneath pole, whether for the light or woken by the disturbances, woke and swam towards it with wide, greedy eyes. Tormund watched them, speechless, as they gathered beneath it, all trying to scramble over the other to get just that bit closer.

And then the pole twitched, and the men were swallowed whole in the monstrous jaws of some horrifying leviathan, more massive than any boat Tormund had ever seen or heard of. The beautiful, ghostly light he'd seen earlier attached to a member that grew form the thing's head.

""The beast..."" Tormund whispered in horrified awe, rendered speechless. The beast returned to the depths, the beautiful light moving in his direction.

Tormund swam away, faster than he ever had before.

The empire had been expanding into our Warlords lands and he had gathered every warrior available to fight them including us, the Void Walkers; the ranks of The Empire stood at the foot of the hill as we massed at its summit, before the horns sounded a group of 50, dressed in simple garments broke from our groups and stood in a line before the soldiers of The Empire. We drew our swords and they braced but they needn't, the berserkers were yet to charge; we turned our blades upon ourselves and gave our own lives; they believed it was an offering to our war God but the truth is that we were Void Walkers and we fought a different way. As our blood ran upon the soil the hordes charged, lead by the berserkers of the northen barrens as we emerged, invisible, amongst the Imperial knights. With swift motions, our blades, axes and hammers tore their souls from their bodies and left their lifeless husks sat atop their horses.

The battle raged and we made our way through their ranks, severing the souls of those not yet reached by our brothers and sisters. As the day closed, the battle was ended and great celebrations were begun however we were unable to join the festivities however, offering were made to thank and appease us, such was our fate; Void Walkers were granted near immortality however we had to live out the rest of our existance as war spirits, risiding in The Void, the gap between the plane of the living and the plane of the dead, unable to return to our lives and only able to communicate through the Shamans when called upon.

This would soon free people of the social infection that is me. They have no need of me and they are much better off without me. 

“But that’s where you’re wrong Connor.” A woman dressed in a goofy T-shirt and paper-shredded jeans spoke from the back of my car.

“This is what I get for going off my medication…. A hallucination…” I laugh. The woman shakes her head. She teleports into the passenger seat and turns off the car. I raise my arm to try to stop her, but she pins me to the chair with her other hand. 

“You took your medication this morning Connor. I’m not a hallucination.” She places her legs on lap, resting her head outside the window. “I’m your guardian angel, higher ups think I’ve done a poor job.”

I start laughing. She grimaces. “Leave me alone.” I say.

“No.” She lifts her head up to stick her tongue out at me.

We sit in silence for a few moments, unsure of what to say or do. I reach for the car ignition but she kicks my hand away. “Don’t.”

“Why not?” I almost carve my lower lip with my teeth. 

“You haven’t achieved your purpose yet.” She fumbles around in her pockets

“Purpose?” I ask. She takes out a cigarette to start smoking. I cough. “ Can you not?”

“Not telling and no. I need the stress relief for what’s about to come.” She takes a long drag and blows square smoke rings at me. “Tell you what, it’ll be easier on both of us if you just not throw your life away and I can go back to my games. Sound good?”

“No one would miss me.” She sighs at what I said. A heavy one. She facepalms at me.

“Looks like we’re doing this the hard way. Alright. Come with me you little shit.” She’s not wrong… Raising her hand, everything in sight distorts and the light of the world collapses into a single focal point. I see a younger man that looks like my dad on his knee proposing to a woman who suspiciously looks like my mom. The environment is all in sepia tone. 

If I were to describe what being teleported to the past was like, it’d be like playing basketball with your own head. Cool in theory, painful in practice. 

“Let’s change the event. She didn’t accept and they parted ways.” Mom shakes her head and apologizes to Dad. With a flick of the Angel’s wrist, time fast forwards to 1998, when I should’ve been born. Dad’s running a multi-million business. Mom’s a doctor. 

Fast forward to 2003, when I should be five. Hey that’s Lee! He’s my best friend. Man, Lee was the coolest guy. All the girls wanted him by the time we were teens. Mr Star Quarterback still hanging out with pathetic, weird, socially inept Connor. 

Wait, why’re the kids picking on him? This is wrong… Those are supposed to be his friends!

Fast forward to 2006, Lee is socially awkward. He talks with a stutter. Everyone hates him. 

2009: His dad lost his job. Taking up drinking. Oh no…

2012: Lee should join the football team by now. He doesn’t. All the things that happened to me are happening to him.

2016: He’s proposed to Laura. 

2018: They divorced. Lee’s taken up drinking. Just like I did.

“Stop.” I beg. 

“Do you see now? Your death will only push the events that will happen regardless to someone else.” She lowers her hand. Time remains frozen. 

“But I’m not asking to not be born. I’m just asking to stop ruining people’s lives…” 

“Boss… why do you give the hard ones…” She mutters under her breath. She rubs her temple. “Connor. Let me show you what happens if you succeed in your endeavor to kill yourself. I’ll try to keep the spoilers to a minimum.” She waves her right arm  in a half-circle arc from left to right. The sepia tone changes to a red tint and we’re observing me filling garage with car exhaust. A headache starts to grow within me.

"[WP] ""What do those notches on your staff mean?""",ManEatingCatfish,"I used to be a wizard, I could cast spells and make my enemies writhe in pain. I killed, a lot, and whenever I killed a new notch would show up on my staff. There was once hundreds of notches.

After many decades of power I discovered I could live forever if I imbued my life forces and magic into a non-animated object. Of course, I chose my staff and looked forward to eternity, even though I could no longer wield magic, an unknown side effect.

Immortality isn't all that great after all. 

Life, even long lasting life, is not without peril. I have been hunted and killed many times now. Random things have happened too. A cliff face giving way, enemies sacking and killing all within my town, a thief stabbing me just to take the few coins in my possession. When I die I am reborn whole again with all the painful memories of each death, someplace random in the world, and my staff is always there waiting for me. I have never died a peaceful death. It took many of these deaths for me to notice, however, that the notches on my staff were disappearing.

""Hey you, What do those notches on your staff mean?""

I looked over my shoulder at the bearded man. Tall, obese, hairy, and dressed in many animal leathers. He has one of those 2 wheeled machines by him. He would have been considered a fat barbarian when I was a wizard, strong, intimidating, and very stupid. He is not alone as there are many more behind him. I don't think I'm going to make it home.

""That is a staff ain't it? It's taller than you! Who the hell walks around with a staff anyway? Hey! I'm talking to you. Answer me asshole!""

There are twelve notches left on my staff. A life for a life. A death for a death. My immortal life has been nothing but a painful sequence of deaths. It is time for penance. I wonder where I will wake up next.

I swing the staff and hit the barbarian on the head. He stumbles for a moment and then regains his composure. His look of shock is quickly overcome by his look of anger, ""you little fuck!""",Squizz
"[WP] ""What do those notches on your staff mean?""",ManEatingCatfish,"It had been a year since I settled into town. Before, I had been a wanderer, living mostly off the land like my people do. Why I chose to settle in this town, I can't say, I just did.

""Aerin!"" I voice yelled before banging on the door frantically.

I jumped from my seat and pulled the door to my tiny cabin open. It was more like a shack, but it was all I needed. I was still getting used to it.

""Mina! What ever is the matter?"" I asked, looking up at the brunette.

""Red! There's a horrible group of men! I think they're bandits! They're trying to take the town! The men said to get you!"" 

""What!?"" I yelled back. 

""We need help you silly elf!"" 

That I had gathered. I raced over to an old forgotten chest of mine. After unlocking it, I lifted it up to reveal the black leather armor that I wore everywhere. The bright red star on the side of my hood looked as vibrant as the day it was placed there. Some things never change. The armor still fits like a glove, it's comforting to be back in it.

I pushed my red hair out of my face before securing the last of my attire, enchanted jewelry. I was not an enchanter, but I knew many good ones in my day. Some of the enchantments had saved my life, so I have learned not to walk into a fight without them.

My trusty bow was pulled from its resting place, along with my arrows. They've seen work, after all, I still hunt for my food. The last thing is a staff. A staff that sat on the mantle of the fireplace. It was buried under herbs, ingredients, potions, and potion books. The staff looked like it saw better days. What was once a beautiful redwood staff, infused with enchanted gemstones, was a very beat up staff. It was not well taken care of, not like the bow, and a series of notches could be seen all over the top and extending downwards.

""Let's go."" I growled out, pushing Mina out of the way. 

We raced into town with me leading and Mina struggling to keep up. Not surprising, we elves are small but quick and agile. Many humans do not see us unless we wish it. Especially in our domain. 

I finally came to the main drag of the town, where the bandit leader was harrassing Markus, the town elder.

""Is that any way to treat your elders?"" I barked out. My hood was up and the shemagh I wore was covering everything but my green eyes.

""This is our town, tiny one,"" the Bandit Lord replied in a condescending voice.

""My town first, scum."" I growled back, pulling an arrow from my quiver. ""I will give you one chance to leave, or else.""

""Or else what?"" He and the other bandits replies, laughing.

I didn't reply verbally. Instead I shot my arrow, letting it just graze his cheek. A small cut appeared and blood slowly dripped down his cheek. It was my warning shot, though it was incredibly stupid because I only had fifteen and now I have fourteen and there are twenty bandits. That meant I would need my staff. 

""Fuck! Attack!""

And so started the dance. The world said that fighting an elf was always a loosing battle. It took a lot to bring one down. That much is true. But they liked to believe it was impossible for humans to beat and elf. That was a lie.  Any human can kill and elf in combat, though that was something I did not feel like seeing today. I quite liked living.

A blade came down, ready to cleave my body in two. I held up my bow to block only to hear a deafening snap!

The fight stopped for a moment just so everyone could see the lovely yew bow which I have had since my childhood, snapped in half. 

""What wil you do without your bow, tiny one?"" Oh it's on motherfucker.

I pulled the staff off my back and growled. ""You will not live to see another sunrise.""

Magic flowed through me. My magic surrounded me, cloaking me in a pale blue light. The gemstones on the staff were lit up with power, having seemingly awakened from a long slumber. Even my eyes were glowing with that same blue light.

""Let's dance,"" I growled to the bandits, not sounding like myself. The voices of others had combined with my voice, making me sound more ominous than before. 

I fired spells in rapid fire. Spells of flames, ice, lightening and more. Roots emerged from the ground, locking bandits in their place while arrows of light rained down upon them. Their cries of agony could be heard as every arrow pierced their flesh, burning them as it passed through. 

The battle was over as quickly as it began. No man, woman, child, or elf could have withstood such power. Once I was finished, I hastily dropped the staff and backed away quickly, only to run into Mina.

""Mina,"" I mumbled out, finally seeing without a blue haze obstructing my vision. 

""That was amazing!"" Soon cheers rang out all down the street, which was not normal, but I would take it. ""How did you do that! Can you teach me? Do all elves have magic and-""

""Mina,"" I said quickly, ""I am exhausted. I would like to go home now.""

""Oh yeah, I'll help you. C'mon.""

She picked up the fragments of my poor bow along with my staff and we headed to my shack at the edge of town. Mina was quiet the whole way, for that I was thankful. I knew I had a long night ahead of me and I needed to get packing if I wanted to be gone by morning.

We reached my shack and I took my effects back. ""Thank you Mina."" I told her, ""you have been a good friend.""

""Mina the Elf Friend, I can live with that."" She replied with a smile. ""Can I ask a question? I promise it's only one.""

I shrugged. I could answer her one question. It's likely that I would never see her again, at least not in her lifetime.

""What do those notches on your staff mean?""

I looked down at the redwood staff. It had stopped glowing and the gems were dull once again. But the notches were still present.

""They were glowing when you were using it. Like the magic was flowing out of it.""

I sighed. I didn't want to explain it, but I owed her a response. ""Each notch represents someone I have lost while using it."" I told her quietly. I pointed to three particularly deep notches, all clustered together. ""This was my wife, Aza, and my children, Sereg, and Mara. They were killed before I could stop the attack."" 

Mina nodded, ""so each notch is a person you couldn't save?""

I nodded.

""Well it looks like you won't have to put another notch in it."" She replied with a small smile. ""Which is good, it's a very pretty staff.""

""What?"" I asked, not quite grasping what she said. ""Isn't the elder dead?""

""No. No one is."" Mina replied with a smile. ""You got here right in the nick of time. So good job!""

No one died this time.

""I'll let you get some rest, Aerin. See you tomorrow!"" Mina waved and headed off back into town, with me watching as she left.

"[WP] ""What do those notches on your staff mean?""",ManEatingCatfish,"Beho was a rainbow boy. Smudged lines of purple, yellow, orange, and red chased each other across his chest and arms and down his thighs. 

The colors came from the bright beetle husks Beho spent all day collecting and crushing. The beetles lived short, electric lives, swarming the mud huts of Beho's village in the spring, laying their eggs in the soft clay, and then dying as one once the summer reached its zenith. Ground up, the dead husks made wonderful dyes, which Beho's mother used to make colorful dresses, shirts, and skirts. 

Water, though, was scarce in those hot months and so the bright beetle dust caked Beho's skin, unchallenged by baths or rainfall. Even when autumn came and the rain returned, the color could never come out all the way. The boy was stained, likely forever.

The summer had been long and especially brutal the year the old man appeared in the village. Crops had failed and supplies were low all around. The economy of the village was as dry as the packed, red earth. For Beho and his mother it was worse still. No one could afford to buy or trade for new clothes, and you cannot eat fine dresses and shirts. Though she did not speak her fears aloud, Beho's mother began to wonder if she and her son would both starve to death before things turned for the better.

And this was the way of things when the old man arrived at their hut.

He was sun-browned and light of hair, and although he did not seem crippled or enfeebled he walked with the use of a tall, wooden staff.

Beho was sent out to collect beetles while his mother spoke with the old man. Erim, a friend who had seen the man enter the village, asked who he was, but Beho did not know.

""My father thinks he may be a holy man,"" said Erim. ""From his robes and his staff.""

Beho did not know what it meant to be a ""holy man"", so he simply shrugged and continued to hunt for beetles. There were very few by then. He had already scoured the village from end to end multiple times that summer.

After a time, Beho looked up to see the old man standing before him.

""You're Beho?"" said the old man with a gentle smile. ""My name is Alyn. Your mother and I have spoken and she has agreed with me that you may not survive many more summers in this village. So I have offered to bring you to my temple. You will be shown the way of service to Gala.""

""*Gala*?"" said Beho, absently tracing a whorl of deep purple that swirled along the side of his right thigh.

""Gala,"" said Alyn with a nod, though he did not offer any further explanation. 

Beho looked up. ""I need to go home now.""

Alyn shook his head. ""No. Your mother agreed. You will travel with me. You will learn what I have to teach you."" 

The old man then grabbed the boy by the arm, firmly, but without malice, and pulled him to his feet. ""It is not an easy walk. We must begin now.""

Beho struggled. In the distance he thought he saw his mother standing on a ledge, looking down at him. But the figure only stared. It did not come to help him. He decided it must not have been his mother.

Soon the old man found he did not have to pull. Beho followed silently at his heels. They crossed the cracked mudflats at a steady pace. Sometimes Beho fell behind and was forced to race after Alyn. He did not think to go back the other way. He did not think he could find his village on his own.

They traveled this way for two days. At intervals, Alyn would stop and offer Beho water and hard bread or dried meat. Only when Beho could go no further would they stop and rest. 

As they sat together on the third day, eating the last of Alyn's rations, the old man spoke.

""We'll arrive at the temple today. Then you will see how we of the faith serve Gala. It's an honor, you know. You are likely to be the only one of your village to learn our ways and see our temple. Do not take that lightly.""

Beho gestured towards the staff, laying across the old man's lap. ""What happened?""

Alyn raised the staff. ""The notches, you mean?"" The staff was smooth, except for three ragged, vertical gouges near the top. ""Carelessness. That's all.""

Near high noon they crested a ridge overlooking a narrow valley. At the edge of the valley, where the land rose sharply, there was a stone door. Alyn tapped at the door with his staff. Slowly, slowly, it opened. Beyond was a damp, quiet darkness.

Beho would not go, so Alyn was forced to grab the boy by the arm and drag him into the darkness. The stone door closed behind them.

Alyn let go and began to make his way cautiously forward. The ground sloped beneath him. With no other choice, Beho followed closely behind.

The darkness was deep, but not complete. Up ahead, a series of small torches marked a new path. Alyn quickened his pace. The alley of torches ended at another door, one made of wood and steel. Alyn knocked with his staff.

The door opened. 

The room beyond was enormous and lit only by a single fire in the center of the room. This fire, however, was a tower of brilliant flames, reaching up towards an unseen ceiling. A man stepped out of the glare of the raging inferno.

""Alyn?"" said the man. Or was it a man? He was monstrously tall, Beho realized, with long, ropey arms and wide, clawed hands. His faced was obscured by the glare of the fire, but Beho swore he saw a mouth full of gleaming silver needles and a thick, black beard that writhed like a swarm of wasps.

Alyn wiped the sweat from his eyes. ""The third part of my payment,"" he said, grabbing Beho once more by the upper arm. ""A boy, like my Paga.""

The thing stood impassively by the flames. ""Ah. Very good. Bring him here.""

Alyn's grip tightened as he pulled Beho towards the flames. The boy was too frightened to think or speak or even cry out in terror. As they neared the flames, a massive, leathery hand came down and brushed against Beho's face. 

""Very similar, yes,"" said the thing. The hand withdrew and when it returned it held a single, thin sliver of wood. ""Here it is. The notch from when you prevented my ax from claiming your boy...your *Paga*.""

Carefully, Alyn took the sliver of wood and held it up to the light. Turning his staff, he found the matching gouge in the wood and pressed the sliver into the thin hollow. The staff glowed momentarily white and where the notch had been there was nothing but smooth, flawless wood.

""What remains?"" asked the creature that was almost certainly not a man.

""My wife and my daughter, Raina,"" said Alyn. ""And once I've replaced them...it will be over, yes?""

The creature laughed, a dry, echoing laugh. ""Yes. You will be returned to my service. Know this, though, Alyn Blackwind - your courage is admirable, your defiance is not. The next time you prevent me from taking that which I desire, the debt will be unpayable.""

""Yes, beloved Gala,"" said Alyn, bowing and releasing his hold on Beho. Without another word, he turned and left the fiery chamber.

Beho watched him go, still too numb with fear to flee. When he turned back towards the flames, he saw that the monstrous figure was holding a long, black ax in his hands. 

""Now,"" said the figure, raising the ax high over its head, ""to unfinished business...""         ",WinsomeJesse

They made it look more like a church than a fortress, while also bestowing penal connotations, as was probably the intention, after the Theocracy moved in. This effect was helped by the statues, made from the same stone, mostly of saints and mystics, and when they weren't, nobles who had generously donated to the church. Their faces were either determinedly set or somehow downcast. It made a frightening sight.

And here was the pattern: Geoffrey, in the chair next to her, would tap the railing on her hospital bed between three and fives times, then pause, then two or three., then wait for around twenty seconds, then repeat; he would look at the television (which wasn’t on), then out into the hallway, then to the place at the foot of the bed where her feet made little peaks beneath the bedding. Then pause, then repeat.

“Geoffrey,” she said.

“Yeah.” Looking at the TV.

“How do I look?”

“How do you feel?” Looking out at the hallway.

“I feel fine. I don’t feel any different, I feel like... Like me. Like normal.”

And there was that word again, normal. But, as near as she could tell it, it was true - her body temp was somewhere in the low ninety-eights, her pulse was around... twenty-two? Twenty-three? Her blood sugar was on the low side, but she wouldn’t need to take anything for an hour and forty minutes at the earliest.

“Geoffrey,” she repeated.

“Yeah.”

“Geoffrey.”

He hesitated a second, then turned back to her. He held her eyes for a little bit shy of three seconds, then broke it off, flitting his eyes back up to meet her every once in a while. He stopped the drumming of his fingers.

“How do I look.”

“You look,” he said, “fine. Really, you do. If I didn’t know any better I’d say there wasn’t any different at all.”

“There isn’t anything different.”

“Yeah.” His finger-drumming resumed.

“Geoffrey, I need someone to tell me I’m still the same.”

“You’re better than the same.” Looking out the window now.

The pattern in his fingers changed.

Something new, something rhythmic, something recognizable but not specific.

""I know that song,"" she said.

“What?”

“The one you’re tapping out. With your fingers. I know it, but I can’t place it.”

Now he looked at her. Now he held her eyes. Now his face was - what? His eyebrows bending up an in, and that meant a question, but - but there was blood creeping into his cheeks, and his pupils were slightly dilated, the left corner of his mouth pulling slightly downward, his eyebrows twitching, the beginnings of sweat beading near his hairline, the dirt in his pores, the capillaries in his eyes, his pulse beating on his neck and ever so *infinitesimally* later at his temples, fifty-six beats a minute - which was his baseline, she realized, his heart had always beat at fifty-six; it was no no slower now, no faster, which she could only assume meant nothing had changed, that he was the same, and so was she, and so were they.",ramblinwriter
"[WP] "" I need someone to tell me I'm still the same...""",SentientPotatoes,"Flint glanced away, unable to give Faith an answer. Instead he fixed his gaze on a far hill, its slopes covered in dark green pines and cold granite tors. A soft wind blew through the clearing they sat in, the tops of the grasses billowing with breeze. It did nothing to hide the stench of shit and copper-tinged blood.  

""No. You'll never be the same,"" Flint admitted. ""Killing a man changes you. If you're lucky it'll never get any easier. If you're not... well, I've fought a hundred mad dogs others called men. They all have that same feral look in their eyes right before they die.""

Reaching into his pack he pulled out some jerky wrapped in waxed paper. Flint handed a handful of the tough meat to Faith and bit into a piece of his own, his jaw working hard to chew the stuff. 

""It's only going to get harder, Faith. Where we're heading, it's a harsh life there. They eke out an existence that'd make my life look soft. Yours would seem either heavenly or pathetically weak in their eyes.""

""And these people, who exactly are they?"" Faith asked.

""Drovers, rovers, nomads... Doesn't matter the name. They're the descendants of ranchers and shepherds pushed off their lands and prime grazing grounds by you Fae. They're poor, Faith, poor in a way that needs to be seen to be believed. Almost no metal, most of it going into spears and arrows. No great arts or culture. They are too focused on survival to worry about such things. They have no history, the memory of the Old World lost to them. All they have are their herds and their vendettas. They might be more civilized than Eaters but not by much.""

""Will we have to fight them?""

""Almost certainly,"" Flint replied. ""They're notorious brigands, their horses just about the only thing of value to them. A lone traveler moving through their lands is asking to be robbed and killed. A ranger armed with good weapons and armor? Every clan in a hundred leagues would be gunning for me. The only sliver of good news about this is that they hate Fae more. If any of your cousin's sworn-swords try to follow us through the Great Basin they will more likely than not wake up one night with a knife in their throat.""

Faith nodded and curled her legs up against her chest, and rested her chin on her knees. ""I don't want to have to kill anyone.""

[WP] Any creature cannot die as long as it's pure good or pure evil. This is the story of a dog.,avatarwanshitong,"I missed the part about it being a dog.  I somehow thought it was a dog or cat.  This does not fit the prompt but I liked it so I'm posting it anyway.

I have this cat called Max.  Well, I don’t “have” the cat.  It just showed up in my yard one day covered in blood.

I like him.  Of course I am a first class asshole myself.

After his arrival pets around the area started to die off.  At first, animal control thought that it was a bobcat running loose.  I knew different.  After each death he would be lying in the sun licking the blood from his fur.

He loved kids too.  I think he loved them more than he loved pets.  He couldn’t kill them of course but he did very serious damage before they could flee or the kid’s parents would hit the bastard with a bat or something.  

He took out more than one eye, some of them were the parent’s.

People would bang on my door, screaming with rage.  I was even served with more than one lawsuit or criminal charge.  Each time I told them that it wasn’t my cat.  It just chose to live in my backyard and if they could get rid of the fucker I would love it if they did.  I would then tell them that if they were pissed off that they were free to go take it up with Max.

I then offered them any number of weapons up to and including a twelve-gauge shotgun.  They usually missed and wound up with a face full of Max.  Sometimes they would hit and Max would crawl off only to show up in their backyard a few days later.  His usual response was to wait on top of his roof and drop upon the most tender of the morsels that came out.  The neighbors soon learned not to pull that shit.

Needless to say there were always new neighbors as families ran screaming into the night.  The new ones were always warned but they never listened.  They listened after the first night.  Max loved holding his little welcome to the neighborhood parties.  

Animal control was called often.  I would wish them luck and open the door for them.  Sometimes they would win, sometimes they would lose.  No matter how many times they hauled them off he would show up in a few days right after he dropped by the animal control people’s house just to say “Hi.”  It didn’t matter where they lived or no matter how far away he would always find them.

For some reason Max never laid a claw on me.  I guess he knew we were kindred spirits.  He did all of the things that I could never do and get away with.  Every now and then I would go buy a rat or something and toss it to him and then say someone’s name.  I don’t know how Max would find them but he would and give them a very, very bad day.  It didn’t matter if they lived out in the country or in a high rise apartment he would find them.

I am getting very old and Max is still the same as always.  I don’t know how old that demon is or how long he is continuing his reign of terror.  

Max has taken to sneaking inside my home and curling up next to me.  I guess he knows that I am close to death.  Every morning he places a dead bird or mouse or something on my nightstand.  He then looks at me with those fucking cold demon eyes.

I always eat his “gifts”.  I’m afraid not to.

"[WP] A man visits a psychiatrist regularly following the murder of his daughter. Days before finishing his prescription, the patient discovers that the person who caused him so much pain has been right in front of him the whole time.",BonafiedBonaparte,"*In...out. In...out*

I focused on my breath as I left the therapist. She told me it would help steady me. She said it would keep me from thinking about painful things. My daughter. My girl. My happiness. 

*In...out. In..out*

I tried my best to relax. They--my therapist and psychiatrist--told me it wasn't safe for me to drive, but I wasn't about to have people carpool me around. Besides, was I really that much of a mess that I couldn't drive? I could still stay between the lines, and stop at the stop signs, and go the speed limit, and hear her joyful little laugh in the back seat as I made faces at her in the rearview mirror... 

*In...out. In...out* 

I tried to think of something that would distract me, something that would stop my chest from hurting so bad. I looked at the sky, the bright blue sky that matched her eyes so closely. 

*In..out. In...out* 

I remember her pointing out how blue the sky was on the fourth of July, shortly after we set up our blankets to watch the fire works. ""The sky is still so blue, even thought it's nighttime!"" She exclaimed, stretching her red, white, silver, and blue bracelet over her eyes like binoculars. She'd gotten it from her aunt just an hour ago, and I was afraid she'd already break it. ""It'll get dark soon,"" I assured her, and it did get dark, but not in the way that I expected. 

*In...out. In...out* 

After pulling into the parking lot and turning my car off, I put my head in my hands, closing my eyes. My chest hurt more than ever. How long would it take for this all to stop being so painful? 

---- 

""They'll make the physical pain go away, that's for sure,"" my psychiatrist said, handing me the pill bottle. ""I'd hope so,"" I responded, my voice weak. ""I just miss her so much."" 

I hadn't cried much since her death. Partly from being in shock, partly from having to be strong for my wife. But now, when tears filled my eyes, I didn't bother trying to stop them.  

""I know, I know,"" he said with hardly any compassion in his voice. He offered me a hand up from my chair, and I was about to let him help me, but something stopped me. 

Something sent chills all throughout my body. 

There, around his wrist, was a red, white, silver and blue bracelet. 

*Her* bracelet. ",februarythoughts
"[WP] A man visits a psychiatrist regularly following the murder of his daughter. Days before finishing his prescription, the patient discovers that the person who caused him so much pain has been right in front of him the whole time.",BonafiedBonaparte,"At first, it was hard to remember anything from that week. Moments would come back in snippets as I slept, and slowly a blurred puzzle formed. But the pieces never fit together and sometimes they would just fall off the table and vanish from memory again. The psych said it was a coping mechanism. That, to protect my own sanity, my mind was blocking off access, closing the roads so I couldn't revisit that night. I believed him.

""I'm writing you a prescription for Zoloft,"" he said after a few sessions, ""as well a supplementary drug. It's still in clinical trials, but I believe it could help."" He tore the slip at its perforations and handed it to me. *Ronix*, it read in confident but near-indecipherable pen. ""It should help with the memory loss."" He was right, it did. But not in the way I had wanted. I slept well the next few weeks, but the dreams were gone. I was given no more pieces of the puzzle I wasn't even sure I wanted to solve.

Then the psych began to schedule our sessions few and far between, weaning me off gradually. I protested and told him that the sessions helped. I might not figure any of it out but at least talking to him had helped me get it out. He insisted our talks end, but something about it seemed off. Like there was something he didn't want me to know. That suspicion grew to paranoia. 

I made inquiries at the police station about my daughter's murder, and a week later they replied with what they could tell me so far. It wasn't much. My daughter had been home alone for about four hours, nine o' clock in the evening to one in the morning, when I found her. They said I wasn't talking, which was understandable given the situation. As I read that, a piece snapped into place. It was clear this time, its edges clean and its place on the table certain. I remembered my quiet as the officer interviewed me outside the ambulance, which had arrived far too late. The report went on to describe the stab wounds, two to the chest and one to the stomach. She had bled out on the kitchen floor. Another piece, I could see the knife, the white tile covered in scarlet. 

I stopped taking the Ronix after that. I wanted to know. I *needed* to know, even if it wasn't for the best. I dreamed of the kitchen, and of my daughter. Sarah sat on a bar stool, phone in one hand and a beer in the other. Then all I could see was black. Now she was on the floor, her eyes staring lifeless at the ceiling. I awoke covered in sweat and breathing hard. I don't if what happened next was a vision, or if I was still dreaming.

I pulled myself from bed and went to the kitchen for water. The house was cold. I froze as I saw the knife on the floor, still covered in blood. Sarah lay on her back as the red pooled about her. Her fingers twitched like insects. Her head jerked to face me, eyes still cold and mouth ajar. She screamed, and I felt the sudden weight of the knife in my right hand. I ran to the bathroom and splashed water on my face, scrubbing what I had seen from my eyes. When I looked up, I saw my face in the mirror, red and dripping. I looked down. The faucet ran crimson. 

And the pieces suddenly fell into place.",nildrohain

""I'm not testifying to anything. That only happens if you testify. I only know her, so, I'm just getting shot.""

""Theodore Gustanavis,""  I said.  ""I've come to end your wicked ways!""

""Does this mean,"" the recruiter who introduced us looked a little wary, ""that you don't actually want the job?""

I hesitated.  ""Well, once this is done, I will be needing somewhere to work.  Monster-hunting doesn't pay all that well.  In fact, if I could work here while I try to bring down my boss, that would really help my financial situation.""

The recruiter shrugged.  ""You certainly wouldn't be the only one.  I'll let you two get acquainted.""  He quickly left.

""You know,"" Ted the Undying said, ""when I saw your resume, I had hope that you were from some *other* family named 'VanAllen'.""

""It's not exactly a common name.""  I said.  ""I'd have thought, given that we'd been hunting you for centuries, you'd have been more wary of it.""

Ted shrugged.  ""You haven't exactly killed me before, it wasn't that big of a risk.""

""Well!""  I said, drawing myself up as fearsomely as I could in my interview suit, ""That changes today!  Prepare to meet your maker!""

Ted rolled his eyes.  At least, I assume that's what he did, it was hard to tell exactly what his eyes were doing given the whole ""eyes of blue fire"" thing.  ""Listen, I've got a meeting I need to be at in a half hour.  If those idiots wouldn't just postpone the stupid thing and make me attend again, I'd take you up on that whole 'death' thing, but as it is, I need to get ready.  So if you wouldn't mind, go find your desk and read your onboarding materials.  HR will be up both our asses if you don't fill out their forms by C.O.B. today.""

I knew this was the fabled enemy of my family and a legendary monster, but I just had to ask:  ""Do... do you even have an ass?""

""Not really, but it would be uncomfortable nonetheless.""  With that he floated off, and I had no choice but to head to my desk.

And that's how my first day at the new job went.",reostra

"[WP] You wake up to find yourself in an out of body experience. Everything's going great, until you notice your body starting to move on its own.",Mattersofdarkness,"An unexplained feeling washed over me. Astral projecting, I had done this before. Nobody knew about this, I had always kept it to myself. And that's how I wanted it to be.

But that feeling, it wasn't something I regularly felt. It wasn't the feeling on freedom, neither excitement or happiness. It was insecurity. Insecurity that something bad was going to happen, sooner or later.

I shrugged the thought off, trying to enjoy the experience. I floated towards the back of the hospital room and went through the door. I looked around in awe, everything was so much better in the spirit world. Since I was in a hospital, I could see several other souls. Most of them were peaceful, but the wild ones, I avoided them the best I could.

I went through the hallway, which got darker and darker by the moment. The deeper I went into it, the more lost souls appeared. Suddenly, I was surrounded by them. I knew it wasn't safe here, but I had to see these parts of the world too sometime.

I flew over the souls as I watched them pleading for help. I couldn't save them, I wasn't the person for that. Once I was alone, I returned to the ground. The lights on the halls started flickering to life, but then went off again. The moment was indeed cliche, but it was still kinda horrifying.

Out of the blue, a shadow appeared in front of me. The shadow couldn't scare me, but what this shadow was really gave me chills.

It was a shadow person. I had seen one of those many times, even when I was awake. You see, I always suffered from sleep paralysis. The shadow people, they always came every night and tried several things, including chocking. Doctors told me that I was just paranoid, but since the day I started astral projecting, I knew it wasn't true.

I turned around to go to my room, but a cold hand grabbed my wrist. I felt its presence closer and closer to me, until it was right behind.

I wasn't sure how it spoke, but it did, and said the only thing I didn't want to hear.

""When you go back, it will already be late.""

And with that I fled. I flew as fast as I could towards my room, which was not so close. After a few minutes I reached it. I went through the door once again and stared at my body with a smile plastered on my face. I wasn't late, luckily.

A doctor opened the door and walked towards my body. I was ready to insert into it, when a strong power pushed me down, holding me there. I glanced up, to look at what the doctor was doing. My body suddenly stirred, and after some moments it stood up. I gasped and struggled against the grip of -whatever that was-, but with no use. The doctor said something to the body and then left. Its head turned to my direction, giving me a sinister smile.

That's when I understood. I was trapped here forever.

Well, I don't know what that was. I bet you didn't expect an a/n, huh? 
But regardless, I really hope somebody out there enjoyed.

Everything's going great, until you notice your body starting to move on its own.",Mattersofdarkness,"There are things the other one does not grasp.It has been alone for so long that it thinks it is the only one here but in truth, it’s not. We are part of one.


I am not a soul. I am only one half of my mind. I’ll be gone when the time comes and so will the other one and all that would remain is the soul.  The worst thing is that it controls the body and has damaged the soul. I need to take control and I need to make things right and soon. I heard the soul scream for me.


Finally, I succeeded, I took control;  the other one didn’t want any part of this world, so I caged it.


Out of the darkness into the light. It has been a while since I started to take control, a part of me has finally lost its way but I can still feel its presence. It maybe hovering somewhere within the head. I don’t want it back. I have been repressed for far too long, always watching, pleading it not to damage self but to no avail until now. I could not control the body yet, I have been in slumber for far too long- the soul has been compromised. 


It assumes it’s watching me from above and I made it think so; that's one of its fault, it doesn’t understand anything at all- you cannot separate the body and the mind. The mind heals the soul and the body contains it. It has been damaging the soul for far too long. It’s depressive thought, the nihilistic view of  life and no urge to do anything, it lost the will to love and to feel, honestly- the soul could do without that. What the soul needs now is me. I will change it. I locked the cage and now I am the conscience and I will heal the soul. It can be caged for all the life the body has got- I could not care less...


First, I need to take control of the body and only then I can control the life it lives. The body needs to wake up and see the world. It has been sleeping for way too long. The body and me are not in sync, I am too weak  for it now but the soul heard the sound of my desperation; the body woke up and I could control the movement. The first thing I did was smile at my reflection in the mirror.


Did it feel it? Did it see? Does it understand what I am trying to do? Did it get scared or did it feel the excitement? I don’t know, the cage is well protected but I cannot lock it up forever, I wish it died but it won’t- it will never go away. I’ll heal it too because the soul wants it too feel the laughter, feel the breeze of this crazy world and still be happy.",amilliondesires

"[WP] You wake up to find yourself in an out of body experience. Everything's going great, until you notice your body starting to move on its own.",Mattersofdarkness,"I sort of liked this at first. When I'm up here, all my stress and worries vanish. It is like being in a nice, quiet room with pure, crisp white walls. I am not touching the floor of this happy place, I am simply floating like an astronaut would in space. It sorta makes me happy, but not to the point where my blood starts to rush, just to where my chest feels at ease. 

Living in this house isn't the best. Loud people, whose thoughts stain my concious thoughts; all I ever think about are the things they say about my insecurities. School isn't too well either, that's where people's thoughts are nice, but I'm never part of these conversations. I'm usually stuck with my own thoughts that just reiterate the stuff told to me at home. Whoever-Is-Up-There knows I need an escape, from the world and myself, so now I have this place. 

I used to only go here when I was asleep, which is why it's always hard for me to get out of bed. However, I recently realized this place wasn't a state of dreams, but a state of mind. One day during class I tried to go to this room and alas, I was there! The teachers always said if I didn't get my head out of the clouds, nothing in this world would make sense to me. I didn't mind.

Some days I was always in this state of enlightenment. People eventually got worried for me. What they saw while I was floating, was a constant blank expression in my face with eyes lost in an abandoned glaze. I was then sent to a mental rehabilitation center, where I was diagnosed with depersonalization disorder. It got worse as I grew up, the hours all added up into days, and days grew into finally, a coma. My parents pulled the plug, often saying I was like a puppet without its handler. 

Now, in this afterlife, I'm in this room all the time. I have nothing to break my meditations. It's really nice. Really nice. ",pedroyalty

I’m dreaming, floating peacefully around my room, completely at ease in the night-time stillness. Seeing myself down there sleeping isn’t even that eerie. I’ve read enough of those cheap, real life bullshit magazines to know what an ‘out of body’ experience is, although I’m still half convinced it’s some sort of crazy lucid dream I’ve been having the past few nights, slowly being able to travel further and further. My body is sprawled over the bed face down, a favourite sleeping position of mine; I can see my back slowly lift up and down with every unconscious breath. 

Going over to the window, the furthest I’ve been able to wander so far and looking down at the sleeping world is interesting, I always wonder if I will ever meet another soul out of their body. I shrug off the thought and turn back around, usually I’m only out of my body a few minutes’ tops, before being sucked back into true consciousness, but this time feels different, something colder in the air.

Someone is laughing; it’s the kind of laugh that makes every hair stand up on your neck, a laugh that belongs to someone, or something, inherently evil. I watch in horror as I see my body slowly drift off the bed, eyes still closed but my mouth is moving, twisted laughter erupts again, as if it knows something I don’t, as if it’s some sort of joke that its now in my body. This must be a lucid dream, this has never happened before. I try pinching myself, squeezing my eyes closed against that inhuman laughter, trying everything to wake up again. I open my eyes.

Only to be staring into an identical set.

[WP] The heiress and olympian you're assigned to protect is inside the hotel currently under siege by an rising drug kingpin.,Signs-And-Wonders,"Quietly I find my way to room 1108, rapping my knuckles on the door before I swipe my card and enter. I softly make my way through the room, and see her sitting on the balcony on the phone. I quickly shower and change into my usual suit pants and white shirt, black leather shoes. Slipping my watch back on as I head out to the balcony, shoes rapping lightly on the floor.

""Miss Athena, plans for to-"" Before I can finish I hear gunshots, grabbing her by the waist I pull her off the balcony and into the room. ""Dress, quickly now."" I see the jump of fear in her eyes as she takes off into the bedroom, pulling on clothes as fast as possible.

""Whats going on John? Update me quick."" I stay calm as I call out for my partner over radio. It takes him a minute to answer, and I grab my jacket, pulling it on as he starts talking.

""Zach it's bad. Some up and coming drug kid, him and his crew are taking the hotel. I'm coming up the stairs, wait for me."" He ends the conversation and I make my way back to the room door, Athena stands back, waiting patiently.

I stand to the side of the door and wait for John, and I crouch down to talk to Athena. ""Miss, we're going to have to leave, and you'll have to do as I say okay?""
She nods, grabbing my hand tightly as I look at her small face.

Just my luck some asshole wannabe drug lord is trying to take the hotel when I'm assigned to an olympian child who hasn't access to her powers yet. Why couldnt he have done this ten years later when she was immortal. 

John raps on the door, and I open it, he smiles at Athena, staying as calm as possible. ""Which exits have they covered? Where do we go?"" I ask him, lifting Athena up into a piggyback.

""Everything but the kitchen, I came through there, they don't know about the drop into the garage."" He quickly produces a gun, offering it to me as he talks, I shake my head.

""No. Alright, so, stairs? No, fire escape?"" He shakes his head, and I know where he wants to go. I also know it's a death trap if we get caught. Athena shakes my shoulder, and I look over my shoulder at her.

""There's a service elevator to the right, four doors down, remember Mister Z?"" Smiling I thank her father for her fast thinking. ""You are right, let's go John. Athena, can you call Zeus, do that thingy? She smiles and nods, and she calls him through their link as John and I swiftly start a jog to the service elevator.

""Dad says if you get me home he will reward you."" I nod, and John motions for us to shush as we call the elevator, we make it down to the kitchen with no problem, and immediately find some thugs hanging around, eating and scaring the staff.

John pulls us both down to a crouch, Athena slides to the right to asses and John draws his gun, and I notice the silencer on it. I nod at him and he grins, Athena comes back, whispering ""Johnny, if you get the men on the right, Mister Z can get the two standing just here.""

I take a moment to admire this thirteen year olds eye for fighting, and John counts to three. On three, I pop up, laying fast jabs into one man, downing him before he can cry out for help. The second one takes a hard kick to the solar plexus and goes down. During this, John has shot three men on my right, and they fall silently. 

We move down the hall, and find the drop to the garage. John goes first, and I hear the soft sound of his gun firing, and then he raps the ladder. Athena follows him, and he raps again. I start to go down, when sharp pain fills my shoulder and gunfire rings in my ears. I reach up, graabing the trap door and slamming it down, falling down the ladder in the process. 

I feel the warm gush of blood, breathing heavily, ""Move, John"" The look of horror in his eyes tells me it's bad, but adrenaline starts to pump and I know we have to go. We bolt down the garage until we find a car.

We quickly pile into an SUV, and I hotwire it before shuffling into the back seat, Athena beside me as John hits the gas. We roar out of the garage, blood soaking my shoulder as John glances up into the rear view to check on me. Athena tugs my jacket off, forcing me to lay down, and immediately pads my shoulder with the jacket.

""Zach, come on baby! Open your eyes!"" John's voice fills my ears, and Athena's small face pops into my view. As the adrenaline wears off, my eyes flutter as Athena slaps me, hard.

I hear myself laugh softly, grabbing at her hand as my vision fades, and everything goes black.",Gnarly_Natas

I stop and turn around and this big British blonde dude is holding up my pack of Top Ramen like it's evidence in a court of law.

""Who the fuck are you!?"" I ask, as politely as I can.

""Do you serve this in here?"" the blonde bloke continues. ""Is this what you've been serving? Pre-packed noodles?""

""Dude, I work all day, I don't have time to make real noodles,"" I say. ""And who the hell are you to pass judgment 
on what I eat?""

""My roommate."" I pause. ""Dude, if you're not Mark's friend, then you got the wrong house, cause –""

He goes past me and stares into nothing.

""What are you doing?"" I ask.

""Alpaca and Mark take care of the business together,"" the man says, to absolutely no one, facing the wall. ""But 
what happens to the quality of the food and service… when the quality of their friendship… is growing sour?""

""Dude, like, what?""

He turns back and screams at me. ""Look at this pear!"" he says, grabbing a brown pear from the kitchen counter. 
""Are you serving this shit!? Is this the quality standard of your establishment?""

He throws the pear against the wall, and the noise attracts a sleepy-faced Mark, who emerges from his bedroom 
rubbing his eyes. ""Alpaca, can you please not –"" he pauses. ""Why is Gordon Ramsay in our kitchen, Alpaca?""

""Who's Gordon Ramsay?"" I ask.

""The reality TV dude. With the kitchens,"" Mark says. ""What the hell is he doing here?""

The bloke – Gordon, apparently – turns to the wall again. ""Mark doesn't agree with Gordon's suggestions to 
improve the kitchen at Markalpaca's restaurant, but Alpaca has had enough. Can their business survive both the 
kitchen and their personal problems? Find out next, on Kitchen Nightmares.""

Mark's eyes stop on me, and he looks as confused as I do. ""Dude, I think Gordon Ramsay is tripping balls.""

Gordon goes to Mark and towers over him. ""Are you aware that Alpaca is serving pre-packed ramen in your 
restaurant? Are you?""

""Dude, chill.""

""Are you aware you have bad pears here!? Do you think this is funny?""

""No, I –""

""This is a nightmare."" Gordon looks from Mark to me. ""You two better get your act together, fast."" Then he turns 
to the wall. ""Will Mark and Alpaca be able to pull through and save the business… and their friendship?"" he asks 
the wall. ""Find out next, on –""

""No, no, no,"" Mark says, stepping forward. ""That's it. Gordon, this is not Kitchen Nightmares, okay? You're 
invading our property and we're going to call the police if you don't leave.""

""What? I don't –""

Mark puts his phone to his ear, then says: ""Yeah, I have an emergency. Gordon Ramsay is in my house throwing 
pears at the wall and he won't leave. Yes, I am serious. Yes. Yes.""

He hangs up. Gordon looks confused, then heads for the kitchen and starts throwing our bread away, whispering 
something about bad quality wheat.

Then there's a knock on the door. 

""Finally,"" I say, going past Gordon, who's now smelling our orange juice and shaking his head by the stove, and 
head for the door. I open. ""Hey, officers. There he is.""

The two cops go by me and Mark and stop in front of Gordon (now tearing apart a cabbage and testing the 
texture with his fingers). ""Come on, Mr. Ramsay. This way.""

Gordon turns to them. ""What? Who the hell are you? I'm not leaving!""

The cops exchange looks. Then one of them turns back, goes past me, stops in front of the wall and, in a blank 
tone, states: ""Next, on Cops: Gordon Ramsay doesn't want to leave the house, even after being intimidated to do 
so by the police. What happens next... might surprise you.""

""Oh, for fuck's sake,"" Mark says, rolling his eyes.

""What the hell is going on?"" I ask. Before anyone can answer, there's another knock on the door. I open, and a 
cleverly dressed man in a monocle steps in.

""Okay, who are *you*?""

He goes straight past me and stops in front of the wall by the cop's side. ""Alpaca has decided to finish his story with a Cops reference, playing with the notion that, rather than Gordon Ramsay being insane, it is the whole world around the main characters that has turned into a reality TV-like universe. Will that device work well for his story? Find out next, on Prompt Nightmares.""

""Now this is just ridiculous,"" Mark says.

""To make matters worse, Alpaca seems to have missed the cue to end the story with the meta-reference to his 
own story by having a Prompt Nightmares host invade the story and self-reference his own joke in an attempt to 
prove that his story is not dumb, but rather self-aware. Now he's just writing and writing, and the danger of never 
hitting a good spot to call it quits seems bigger than ever. Will he pull through, or will his story fall to pieces? Find out next, on Prompt Nightma –""

All right I'm done.

"[WP] Gordon Ramsay mistakenly walks into your house to film an episode of Kitchen Nightmares, and refuses to believe that you aren't a failing restaurant owner",canihaveausername,"I was sitting on my couch, watching ""Kitchen Nightmares"". It's a pretty insane show, so I see it as a comedy more than anything. Unfortunately, I can't have it on too loud because it's very profane and my neighbors might hear it through the thin walls in my apartment.

About ten minutes in, I heard Gordon Ramsey say ""fuck you!"", but it wasn't quiet at all. It was at least 200x louder than the rest of the episode. I jumped extremely hard before reaching for the TV remote - but in the corner of my eye, I saw something. It was big, scary and blonde.

It was Gordon Ramsey.

&amp;nbsp;

""Yeah, fuck you!"" He said, pointing his bony finger at me. 

""If I told you cook a damn Hot Pocket you'd pass out and land on your fucking dick you fucking bag of shitsacks!""

&amp;nbsp;

I stared at him, dumbfounded. This wasn't a dream, of course, so maybe I was in a coma. Or maybe this is a trick. I didn't really know.

&amp;nbsp;

""Aren't you gonna say something you fucking pathetic piece of shit-stained cock dick?!""

&amp;nbsp;

I cleared my throat and looked around me in shock and despair. I then decided to speak.

&amp;nbsp;

""I - are you *Gordon Ramsey*?""

&amp;nbsp;

He stared at me in a frightening fashion for only a few short milliseconds.

&amp;nbsp;

""Like fucking piss I'm Gordon Ramsey! Who the *fuck* else would I be you *fucking twat*?!""

&amp;nbsp;

I slowly came to my feet, visibly shaking, visibly very afraid.

&amp;nbsp;

""Say something you pathetic piece of washed-up shit-filled ravioli! You're on my damn show, give me something I want you fucking ass-smelling ball of testicle bits with shit and piss mixed in!""

&amp;nbsp;

Now I was sure that this was Gordon Ramsey - *actually* Gordon Ramsey - so I knew I had to speak.

&amp;nbsp;

""I think you're mistaken, Gor - I mean, Mr. Ramsey ... you see, I don't own a restaurant ... I don't think. But my uncle owns one, if you need to make an -""

&amp;nbsp;

""Shut the fuck up you toothprick! I'll be seeing you in court before I shove my fist up your asshole and have it come out of your fucking urethra! Eat my ass in piss!""

&amp;nbsp;

And with that, he left. I was shocked, frightened and actually shit myself. He hasn't sued me yet - but I'm sure as hell that he will get there.

"[WP] Gordon Ramsay mistakenly walks into your house to film an episode of Kitchen Nightmares, and refuses to believe that you aren't a failing restaurant owner",canihaveausername,"   So there I was in my kitchen furiously beating eggs to make noodles while he shouted into my ears that “The kitchen is not a place for fucking animals to walk around,” nor “the place for a bloody baby to leave her fucking push car.”  But you can’t respond normally to someone who is as irrational as he is. He walked in three days ago with a camera crew in tow, and will not leave my fucking house until “this kitchen starts turning a fucking profit.” I can’t leave the house to go to work, because “the kitchen is what needs me the most.”  My two-year-old daughter is busting her ass as a waitress, barely getting by on tips I might add, because “the chef doesn’t fucking serve his patrons.” And my wife gets by Scott-free because “a good manager knows when to step back and let the chef succeed.” Utter bull shit I tell you. 
    
   I have to push through this for the next few days. I keep telling my wife that I will have a serious heart to heart sit down with Chef Ramsey, and tell him that I am just going to sell the “restaurant.” The “restaurant” being my 3 bedroom 2 bath house, but my wife insists to wait it out until filming concludes, because “he’s providing wonderful upgrades to our outdoor patio and décor.” I don’t give two shits about that. I’m at the point where I can’t sleep at night, even though I am exhausted from working 18 hour days, and when I do sleep all I dream about is how terrible my risotto is. I don’t even fucking know what risotto is, much less how to make it. 

   Finally, the “Grand Re-Opening” dinner service night rolls around and I am nervous to serve the line of people I have waiting at my front door. Chef Ramsey is barking service orders at me, and I am fulfilling them as quickly as I can, though still not quickly enough. Ramsey, in his most pissed off British tone yet, red facedly yells at me to get my shit together. That “this restaurant lives and dies by my organizational skills.” Customers start getting fed up and leave one at a time, then in droves. 

   I see it out of the corner of my eye, Ramsey is headed my way. I’m fucked. I keep my head down and cook faster and harder than I ever have in my life, burning my fingers on pots and pans. He is getting even closer, he’s about ten feet from me.  Then out of nowhere, a production assistant, maybe 5’2” cuts him off, hands him a folded piece of paper, turns around and walks away. Ramsey is reading it to himself, more red faced than I’ve ever seen him. He looks up at me, eyes locked, deadest, looking straight fucking through me. Ramsey crumbles the paper up, throws it into the trash and starts walking away. I am so relieved, but I get back to cooking. 

While my back is turned I hear Chef Ramsey yell, “Alright everyone, piss off."" I turn to look, every remaining guest is standing up and walking out the door. The film crew is tearing down their equipment, and production assistants are going everywhere ripping mics off of everything and everyone. Almost as quickly as they had barged into my house, they were gone.

   The house is quiet for the first time in weeks. It’s just me and my family in the house, and it feels weird. I’m nearly in emotional shock from this, everything happened so quickly. As confused as I was to why they were there, I wanted to know what the fuck made them leave in such a hurry. The blackened salmon I was making got a little too blackened and started setting off the smoke detector. I rush back to the pan to remove it from the heat and start fanning the smoke out of the kitchen. My daughter passes out on the couch from exhaustion, and the wife is finally coming home through the front door. I’m still looking around trying to figure everything out. What the fuck just happened?

   As the wife comes around the corner into the kitchen, I remember the note. I run to the trash can, open the note, and could do nothing but laugh. My laughter turns to a cry and the wife is almost as dumbfounded as I am. She asks where everyone is, and I hopelessly shrug and shake my head. She asks what I’m holding so I hand it to her. She reads it and chuckles a bit. She puts the note down on the counter, walks to our daughter, picks her up, and takes her to her bed.

I walk into the kitchen to see none other then Gordon Ramsey

""It's fucking RAW, you fuckin' Donut"" as he takes a few bites of my eggs. ""It looks like someone took a shit on the plate!"" he yelled.

My 3 kids decided to come walk into the kitchen to see what the fuss was about.

""You, you and you, fuck off! You're done. Take off your apron and don't come back.""

Bewildered as I was, he was moving onto the toast.

""What the fuck is this! It's like eating into cardboard! You think I can serve this? And on family night? And what are these 3 blokes doing here! I said fuck off!""

""Sir I'm going to have to ask you to leave"" I say.

""Oh you're going to ask me to leave? You better take your fuckin' apron off before I drag you out of this kitchen.""

Gordon Ramsey moves menacingly towards me with two pieces of toast in his hand.

""And before I let you leave, you say chef, got it'?""

""Y-Yes Che-""

Suddenly he slams the two pieces of bread on the side of my head. 

""You fuckin idiot sandwhich! WHAT ARE YOU!""

""That's a fine steak you've made there."" 

I nearly shit myself as a man standing over my shoulder in my previously unoccupied house complimented my steak and I slapped him with my spatula.

""Oi! Is this how you treat all of your guests?!"" Gordon Ramsay sputtered as he stumbled and I stood there looking utterly baffled. ""Well, I wouldn't call you a 'guest' per se, seeming as I didn't invite you in. Are... Are you Gordon Ramsay?""

""You're bloody right I'm *Gordon-Fucking-Ramsay,* what the fuck are you doing slapping me for? I'm here to help you save your crumbling business, and this is how you thank me?!"" He steps to the fridge and opens the freezer portion, finding the bag of frozen tuna I had gotten my meal from. ""What the bloody hell is this? Do you think this would fly in my restaurant? *Frozen tuna,* you git? And what is that, teriyaki made with canned orange juice? You think this a fucking T.G.I. Friday's?"" 

My mouth agape, I couldn't even form a coherent thought after hearing that, let alone speak. After a brief moment that seemed like an eternity, with Ramsay staring at me like I'm an idiot, I reply, ""What the actual fuck are you talking about?"" I soon realized that that was a mistake. In hindsight, I should have realized from the hours of Hell's Kitchen my mom used to watch that one does not talk to Gordon Ramsay like this. 

""WHAT THE FUCK AM I TALKING ABOUT?"" He begins trying to slap me with my frozen tuna, all the while in my mind I seemed to have been dumped into a strange new universe where Gordon Ramsay is in my kitchen spontaneously, which has so far been very distressing and disconcerting. 

""This is what I'm talking about you twat! How do ever hope to keep your life's work above water when you're serving frozen fish? It's a disgrace!""

""Sir, you seem to have the wrong person, I'm college art student, I don't own a restaurant, I'll probably never own anything that successful to be honest!"" He spits back, ""Not with that attitude you won't!"" 

""Dude, seriously, what the fuck is going on? Is Ashton Kutcher here too? Am I getting punk'd?"" He then proceeds to walk out of my home. So I go to the window to see what he's doing, and he's speaking to a camera man! What is this? What has my life become? 

Feeling the need to investigate further, I sneak outside and listen to what he says. ""Who does he think he is? He's a mad man. The seafood shack will never be able to continue business with him in charge unless he pull his big, bullish head out of his ass."" I can see the cameraman nodding in agreement as he states this, utter bewilderment is all I could muster. 

I smell a horrible odor rising from my house, I realize that the steak is ruined. I arrive at the scene to a hard puck of dirty fish meat.

“That’s what came in the box, Chef. I don’t really-“

“OH FOR FUCK’S SAKE.”

I had been trying to satisfy this man’s drunken demands for 3 hours now. He strongly resembled the celebrity chef Gordon Ramsey, but he kept insisting that his name was just…Chef. He wouldn’t respond to anything else. When someone who may or may not be Gordon Ramsey crawls through your window at 2 AM demanding a perfect rack of lamb, there’s not much else to do besides cook for him. I could have called the police but he seemed harmless enough, just sloshed to hell and hungry. I had quite a bit of sympathy for this fellow. If this was Gordon, he probably deserved a bite. I didn’t have the lamb he wanted. I didn’t have much at all really. He refused to eat my first proposal of spaghetti and actually started crying when I fished out a packet of ramen. It took several minutes of wafting different spices under his nose before he calmed down. My only option left was a grilled cheese, almost impossible to fuck up. I sat him down on the couch with a blanket and some crackers, hoping that he would pass out before he could critique my work. The crackers ended up thrown against the TV and he fashioned the blanket into an apron.

“Right, let’s see how you handle a full dinner service…”

I calmly tried to tell him that no one was coming to this dinner, as it was the middle of the night. He wouldn’t have it and started dialing his mates. Well, I assume they were his mates. They each told him to fuck off in increasingly loud tones.

“We’ve got a count of 60! You better get your shit together, darling!”

Gordon then perched himself on the kitchen sink, insisting this was the best angle to watch at. Not even the dried cumin could calm him down this time. He cast those beady, reddened eyes across the countertop, coming to focus on my butter. “Good God almighty…” Panic started to set in. His fingers scrabbled to get the top off, one dipping into the container and holding up a glob for inspection. Oh there went the tears again. He licked experimentally, and then proceeded to shove his entire, coated finger into his gob. A moan, of either pleasure or pain, escaped. Again the finger pressed into the butter. Again into that gaping maw. It was horrific to watch. I tried to pry it out of his hands, but the resulting squawking was worse than the slick sounds of the butter. He had ceased to form coherent sentences at this point. “IDIOT…the oil…the oil can’t be here. Sweet redeemer just let it be.” I put the sad excuse for a sandwich onto the pan, hoping that the bread might at least be toasted. Gordon had become an unrecognizable shell. I eventually got the cheese melted; it had mysteriously burnt on one side. Laying it onto the only plate Gordon hadn’t smashed, I presented it to him on his perch. He declared it an “undeniable fucking failure”.

He eventually left through the same window he entered with a cheery wave. The rising sun behind lit his features like a Renaissance cherub, including the glossy butter that formed a perfect ring around his mouth. I find I no longer have the desire to watch his television programs.

All the classes had been pushed back because of Earth Day and so six entire grades of students had to eat in only two periods!

""Mamma mia! There go all the trays again! What are the dishwashers doing in there!? We need you to hurry it up in there! Get some trays and some plates right now!"" shouted the head chef...

The dishwashers scrambled to stack plates and trays, pushing them through the mouth of the industrial dishwasher in a comically lopsided manner.

Suddenly, a man with hair that glowed like the silverest of clouds burst through the double doors. Approximately 35 students were clustered by the empty dishes rack at the front of the ""buffet"".

""What the Bloody Hell, in God's name, is this?"" he shouted into the mostly calm cafeteria. Shocked students stared and appalled faculty gasped as Gordon Ramsay himself leared over the back of the line, craning his neck to convey a bitterly horrified facial expression to any cafeteria staff within eyeshot.

""Are YOU working here?"" he demanded of a small pasty boy pushing a cart of toppling trays and various dishes...

""I'm just here because they think I graffiti'd in the bathroom."" the kid replied.

""Is this some kind of JOKE? Are we having a laugh? Well, Ha, Ha!"" responded a mortified Gordon Ramsay... ""SERIOUSLY, CAN I GET SOME SERVICE IN HERE?"" he proceeded to shout.

Several adult cafeteria staff were clucking, pointing at the sign, and shouting something in a language Gordon Ramsay didn't have time to understand, behind the serving windows.

After several seconds when the kids had urgently gathered their plates and trays, Gordon was able to approach the dish stand.

""Finally!"" Gordon cried.

""I've only been waiting all bloody day f---"" he stopped, freezing his lips and his eyes pointed at a line of spaghetti still left on the tray from the last customers... ""Is this... Is this old, crusted food on this tray!? Please tell me this isn't old, crusted spaghetti on my G&amp;%DA&amp;$ tray!!? Because if it is... Oh god, and it is... What a disgusting mess...""

He finally picked up an acceptable tray; after glaring at several nearby employees while pointing at the spot of spaghetti.

""OK, is this, this one is alright."" Gordon stated endearingly to the servers behind the windows, pointing at the new tray. He looked around.

""Pork, is that Pork? Yes, I'll have that. Doesn't look like it was cooked right but I'll have that. I'm gonna have to make a silent prayer to whatever pig was cooked like this, I'll have you know..."" Gordon continued to mutter while picking up different items from behind the counter and placing them on the tray.

""I'll have you know, this corn looks like it was cooked on the Fourth of July... During the Fireworks show without a flashlight... That's just a shame. Corn is supposed to make you think of Summer, think of the Fall. Not this... rubbish.""

Gordon Ramsay approached the last dish, a spaghetti meatball combo.

""OK, OK, now this is unorthodox... If I wanted the sausage I would put the sausage on the pasta. I already have the Pork now, you've thrown me off quite a bit here..."" he stopped, contemplating the situation, looking around himself in a lucid fashion...

""I've been FOOLED! I've been HAD! THAT IS IT!"" Gordon Ramsay angrily shouted about, cussing and spitting on all the dishes like a rabid raccoon... He hurled the plate of Pasta at the nearest wall where it exploded violently, showering nearby tables of students with chunks of sausage and spaghetti.

""Get a grip, you bats!"" he yelled at the wide-eyed children sitting at that table... ""Can't you see your hosts are lampooning you right now? You can't even tell that, that's expected, sad but expected..."" he began muttering again... ""This is why we can't have nice things,"" continued Gordon, ""When the people can't even recognize they are being catered absolute GARBAGE!""

Gordon Ramsay swiped the remaining items on his tray to the floor while shouting an obscene farewell... 

""THIS place won't be making the cut for my show... Not even a disaster, not even a pleasurable one, at that!"" Gordon Ramsay left the building as blue and red lights began flashing outside...",Columbus-1492

-BBC, 29 June 2016

NATIONAL TREASURE GORDON RAMSAY has been shot dead in a Florida home while filming an episode of Kitchen Nightmares, the American reality TV show.

The suspect, Michael Jensen, 56, allegedly shot the celebrity chef after Ramsay mistakenly entered his home.

""The deceased entered the suspect's home at 6:00 p.m., as the family was preparing their dinner,"" reports Chief Jameson, who is overseeing the investigation. ""Ramsay allegedly began issuing orders to the suspect and his family in their kitchen. After the family refused to comply with his orders, Ramsay allegedly picked up a butcher knife to 'show them how it's done.'""

""At this point the suspect, Michael Jensen, drew his pistol. Ramsay reportedly refused to back down and insisted on teaching the family 'proper technique' and advanced towards the suspect. The suspect then allegedly shot Ramsay 2 times in the chest.""

An ambulance was called for the chef, who died on the way to the hospital.

The suspect is currently in police custody. The investigation is ongoing.",SgtNapalm

Splash. 

BOOM!

I turned my head to the noise and witnessed in horror as Gordon Ramsay kicked open my one-room apartment door. My body shivered as uncontrollable hormones  overcame me, with semen pouring out.

Shocked, embarassed, pleasurable? I didn't know what to feel at that point.

""Fucking hell! You've come to ask me for help, and this is what you present to me? Well here's a fucking advice to your restaurant, cook your meat, don't fucking beat it!"" Ramsey shouted, as I swiftly put my pants back on and jumped out of my bed. Mortified, I searched my brain for words to say, but found myself lost in confusion and excess serotonin.

I muttered incomprehensible noises as I stood there, shellshocked from what had just happened.

""Are you actually fucking stupid? Has cum filled your brain too? Don't just mutter, at least try to come up with some excuse!?"" Ramsey shouted in my face. His fiery blue eyes engulfed me with more fear, as I pinched myself as hard as I could hoping that this was a nightmare.

""What the hell are you doing in my house? Leave me to my own business."" I tried to shout, but it only came out as a whimper as my throat closed up. 

""You know what? I can't deal with this, I've only done this once, but I can't deal with fuckers like you, you're worse than fucking Amy! I'm outta here!"" He screamed, voice quivering with anger and disbelief as he turned around and walked away from my apartment. My eyes followed him as he strutted further and further away; my body stood still, like a statue. He looked victorious, as he became a small dot on the horizon...

""Incredible! have you tried the new Reality TV? it brings the actions right to your home! Woah man, even, you know...? You bet!----""


Mark turned the ""real-tv"" off wth a single thought as he woke up, commercials sure are loud in 2078.


It was not like him, falling asleep on the float-couch like that, but it *had* been a really long day yesterday at the factory. ""My boss is a crazy bitch"" he muttered as he made his way to the kitchen.


""Carmela! make me some breakfast will you?""


""I'M - SORRY - MISTER - FERGUVSLAV - THIS - HELPER - UNIT - IS - CURENTLY - BEING - INSPECTED""


..Inspected? What the hell did that even mean? But sure enough some weird guy was in his kitchen throwing a tantrum.


""Why is everything frozen here?? Nothing is fresh here, how do you even cook... this thing?? I have never seen a worse selection of ingredients in any kitchen before!"" he said as package of radio-oysters flew right by mark's head.


""Carmela who is this guy?"", Mark said, puzzled by the whole situation and still somewhat dazed ""Did you let him in?""


""I - DO - NOT - KNOW - MISTER - FERGUVSLAV - HE - CAME - IN - FROM - THE - LIVINGROOM, - SAID - CUSTOMERS - WERE - WAITING""


""Wait, customers? we have customers?"" He said, confusion painting his face.


""Yes you do somehow! But not for long i assure you if we don't fix this accursed kitchen of yours!"" came from the fridge, the angry guy still throwing around frozen discs of food.


""THEY - ARE - IN - THE - LIVINGROOM - MISTER - FERGUVSLAV""


Mark decided checking this out was probably the first priority and made its way to the nearby room, almost slipping on a can of beef flakes, only to find out it was now occupied by several fancy tables and many unknown people waiting and chatting with each other, some complaining about bad service.

They weren't just unknown, they were *bizzarre*. Many had weird clothing, other looked like they came straight out of a history documentary, and he could swear one of them looked exactly like a famous singer whose name he couldn't recall. 

One of them, however, called out to him.

""You must be the owner of this lovely house, come please, have a seat""

""You're Will Bates, right? i saw your face on the newspapers!"" Mark said as the epiphany hit him, and took a seat. ""What is this? What is going on??""

Will waited for him to be seated, then started talking ""You see, my Reality TV is a great invention and i congratulate you for being a pioneer and buying one of my products"" he paused.

Mark looked at him, waiting for more ""...And?""

The man took a deep breath and continued ""You see, i'm not real. Or, more precisely, i am now. What i'm trying to say is... tonight's solar winds somehow interfered with the R-TV.""

""You mean stuff is coming out of it?""

""Yes, sort of. The problem is you seem to have fallen asleep whitout turning it off, and all sort of reruns went on air. Even an old AMA i took part in, what a coincidence right?""

...the two man looked at each other, Mark serious now.

""You don't mean...""

""Yes, i'm afraid they aired a rerun of Godzilla tonight, why don't we check on Carmela? I'm a bit hungry""",adozu

"[WP] Gordon Ramsay mistakenly walks into your house to film an episode of Kitchen Nightmares, and refuses to believe that you aren't a failing restaurant owner",canihaveausername,"I love to cook. Experimenting with new flavors and textures. But I live alone. I’m the only one who eats what I make. I never have anyone for dinner. Which is why at first I was exciting when another person was standing over the tray I had been messing with.

“This veal is rubbish!” the man shouted at me, apoplectic.
	

“It’s not veal,” I explained levelly, rather politely I thought.
	

“Do it again!”
	
I had never met the man, but I knew who he was.

“You’re on TV,” I said.

“I said do it again!”

“Okay.”

“What?!”

“Yes, Chef Ramsay.” Honestly I was just happy serve someone new.

And I began cutting new strips of the steak, mixing the marinade, and so on.

“What are you doing here?” I asked him. My door looked as if he had kicked it down. No big deal, I could fix it later. It would be rude to turn my attention away from guest.

“I’m here to keep this restaurant from tanking – the fucking water is boing over!”

“Sorry about that!” I said, running over to tilt the pot a bit.

The poor man must have been confused. I lived in a house out in the country. Not a restaurant. Thought it was best just to humor him. But he was very angry and kept shouting. To be honest, I’m not a great cook but I was quite proud that I never lost my cool. I seemed to be the exact opposite of this man.

It didn’t help his temperament when I spilled the marinade on him.

“Fucking idiot!” he yelled, going red. “Make some more!”

“That was all of it, Chef Ramsay.”

“Are you joking?!”

Luckily he was cut-off when the over timer went off. I got the sheet out of the oven and he tried it. He knocked the tray off of the counter.

“How on earth did you get veal to taste gamey?!”

“It’s not veal,” I repeated.

“Do it again!”

“Okay, I will.”

My cleaver flashed and then the angry man stopped shouting. I chopped him up at the joints and carved strip after strip. I took a moment for myself to take in the smell. The marinade had seeped in perfectly. And then I began my magnum opus.

I prepared a feast out of the late chef. I cooked Gordon steaks and Gordon kebabs with asparagus. I served his liver with some onions and boiled some potatoes as sides with his fingers. I cracked the bones and the marrow made for a superb broth in a savory Ramsay stew. I iced his brain and served it with cake. Without a doubt it was the most delicious cook I ever had.

I do not regret a thing.

So that’s about it. I get the chair next week, but I can die happy now.

I yawned a little, dropped my bag by the door and walked into the kitchen. After walking aimlessly over to the cupboard and getting myself a snack, I began thinking it was about time to start cooking dinner, so I quickly put some music on, and started looking for food, humming quietly to myself. 

""Let's see now... red curry paste... noodles... spring onions... red pepper... coconut milk... stock.. chilli, ginger, garlic... quorn. Perfect."" 

I walked over to the worktop, grabbed a chopping board and began cutting up my vegetables. My spirits were lifting, and I started to sing along with the music. ""Sometimes I give myself the creeps... Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me... It all keeps adding up... I think-""

""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!"" 

I jumped and dropped the knife as a voice bellowed from behind me. I span around and came face to face with Gordon Ramsey. There was a film crew behind him. For a moment I wondered if I was still in bed, asleep, and the whole day had been a dream. Then he spoke again.

""YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO STOP AND FUCKING STARE, YOU HAVE A RESTAURANT TO RUN. GET BACK TO FUCKING WORK!"" 

""B-b-but... th-th-this is my kitchen..."" I started to protest.

""I CAN FUCKING SEE THAT YOU CRETIN! NOW WORK! GO! MUSH!""

I began to turn around and unconsciously mumbled a ""Yes Chef."" Then turned back. ""No, hang on. Why are you here? How did you even get in?""

""I'M HERE TO TRY TO SAVE YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS, YOU UNGRATEFUL SACK OF SHIT!""

""Look, Gordon, I don't have a business. This isn't a restaurant. This is my flat.""

""DON'T YOU TRY THAT SHIT ON ME... wait, what?""

""My flat, Gordon. You're in my flat.""

""But... I thought..."" He was silent for a moment. ""Sorry, we must have gone to the wrong address. What did you say the address of your Restaurant is again?""

""I don't have a restaurant... I'm not even a chef. I don't know why you're here.""

""We... uh, thought you... but...""

Eventually, the producer stepped forward. ""We're filming for kitchen nightmares. I'm terribly sorry about this, I'm not sure how it happened.""

For a moment I thought about what to say. Presumably they had broken into my house, but it seemed like an honest mistake. They all looked very embarrassed and confused now. I sighed. ""It's ok, look, there's a corner shop just down the road from here. If you go and pick up some more ingredients for me, you're welcome to stay had have a bite to eat. I'm making Laksa.""

Gordon looked up at me. ""Are you sure? After all, it must have been a bit of a shock for you.""

I smiled. ""Sure, no worries. I'm a big fan of the show by the way."" I quickly scribbled down a quick list of what I needed more of and handed it to him. ""NOW GET ME THE FUCKING INGREDIENTS, YOU IDIOT SANDWICH!"" I yelled, with a wink.

He grinned, and walked towards the door.

I had slept soundly without the horrible shrill of my alarm for the first time in what felt like weeks. It was finally my day off, and I could do anything with it.

Blearily, I pulled myself out of bed and followed my grumbling stomach towards the kitchen. I contemplated what to make, and remembered that I hadn't actually gone grocery shopping this week like I had meant to. I sighed and trudged down my hallway. Breakfast would have to be stale Apple Jacks again, unless I wanted to be brave and check my bread for mold. 

**CLANK** 

I stiffened, hairs on edge. I lived alone, and yet there was a noise coming from my kitchen. I looked around for a weapon, and upon spying the plunger sitting in my bathroom, readied myself for a fight with the robber my mind had readily imagined. 

I crept around the corner, staying low and silent. Stealth was key. One foot in front of the oth- 

""Oof!"" I huffed, falling to the floor. The plunger clattered out of my hand, skittering away uselessly. So much for my element of surprise. 

I looked around for what I had tripped on, mystified at the sight of a thick black cable. Was the intruder a contractor? Maybe the apartment manager had sent someone over to fix something. 

I followed the cord into the kitchen/living area (come on, I can only afford so many square feet) and came face to face with a big, black camera. It was pointed right at my face, an expressionless cameraman directing it towards me. 

""Ah, here he is. Right on time."" A British voice said, and I looked over to find Gordon Ramsay staring back at me. 

""I'm sorry, is this some kind of prank?"" I asked, talking before I had even processed the situation. My brain felt like it was short circuiting. 

""Aaron, do you know that your spinach is rotting?"" Gordon asked me, raising an eyebrow. His jaw was set sternly and he tapped his fingers on the counter, awaiting an answer. 

""Uh, no?"" I said tentatively. I hadn't known that. I hadn't even opened my vegetable crisper for a few weeks now. I had only bought the spinach for a girl I had been seeing, when I'd tried to make her dinner. Let's just say I hadn't needed to cook for anyone lately. 

""This is fucking disgusting, yeah?"" Gordon said, picking up a bag of gooey black liquid from the counter. I looked at the label and nearly heaved- it was the spinach. Or it had been, once. 

I nodded hastily, covering my mouth with one hand. 

""I've spoken with Aaron now, and he agrees that his storage area is absolutely filthy."" Gordon said, facing the camera. ""Let's see if he'll agree that he needs to do something about it.""

""Aaron,"" Gordon said, turning back to me. ""Do you understand that this is a health hazard? You could be putting lives at risk. Anyone who enters your establishment could be facing horrific food poisoning.""

My... establishment?

""Sorry, wha-""

""And further,"" Gordon went on, interrupting me. ""By leaving a contaminant in your storage facility, you could potentially be contaminating all of your other ingredients. Nothing is safe at this point- this is no way to run a business.""

""I, uh- I'm not-"" I spluttered, confused. 

""What were you planning on serving for today's breakfast service, then?"" He asked, clapping his hands. ""Quickly now, you'll be expecting guests any minute, I'm sure."" 

""Um, breakfast... service?"" I asked. ""I was probably just going to have some Apple Jacks, bit stale now though."" 

Gordon stared at me. I stared back for a moment before looking at the floor, ashamed for some reason I couldn't quite pin down. 

""This truly is a kitchen nightmare."" I heard Gordon say to the camera. ""Stay tuned to see if i can work a miracle and get this place up and running like it ought to be.""

""Cut, scene!"" The cameraman yelled. Gordon ran his hands through his hair and observed the rest of my kitchen.

""Fuckin' 'ell."" He sighed. ""Where do I even begin?""

*BRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING!*

""Ugh,"" I groaned as I groggily woke in a dazed stupor.  I had gotten in late last night from work after being asked last minute to pull another a shift (because fucking Bill didn't show up for work again).  Exhausted and thoroughly regretting my purchase of such a loud alarm clock, I hit the snooze, dragged myself out of bed, and got ready for another hellish day at work.  

My apartment was tiny so it was a quick trek over to the kitchen.  After last night, I wanted a little pick-me-up and I opted to make some toast instead of my daily bowl of Cheerios.  Opening my fridge, I cringed at how depleted my resources were and those that survived my constant quest for food were mostly comprised of old leftovers that even I was too picky for.  I scrounged around a bit and found the small plastic bag of butter I was searching for.  I crossed the three feet length of my kitchen to the toaster and put in some bread.  Finally, I hear the friendly ""clink"" of my toaster and taking the bread out, I quickly scrape the last of the butter across the two pieces and plop it on a plate.  I take my veritable feast with me over to my dingy couch and turn on some breakfast entertainment: Hell's Kitchen.  

The friendly and familiar cursing of Gordon Ramsay comforts me as I prepare to brace myself for the coming day.  I cannot help but wonder, however, what the distinguished chef would think of my own crummy cooking capability.  I watch as one foolish chef attempts to craft a retort against Ramsay’s endless torrent of profanity, but only ends up digging himself into a deeper hole as the master chef takes aim at his regretful victim.  

“Well look at this shithole!”  

That was strange..  That was unmistakably Gordon Ramsay, but it sounded like it came from behind me instead of from my TV.  

“God, what a fucking disaster this outside is!”

If I wasn’t crazy I’d say Gordon Ramsay’s profane self was right outside my very door.

“Fuck me, we better go in and see how bad the inside is.”  *KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*

Utterly bewildered now, I slowly got up and cautiously approached my door.  As I came nearer, the knocking grew increasingly louder.  I opened the door and saw the crazed eyes of none other than Gordon Ramsay himself.  He bursts into the room and is followed by a film crew.  I stand still, shocked and convinced that I am still dreaming as I watch Ramsay examine the small, unkempt space that I call my home.  

“You serve people here!?  You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.  Where the hell do they sit!” He exclaims, bounding around the house as he emphasizes his words with frantic hand gestures.  Confused, I try to reply, “I don’t ser…” 

“I don’t want to hear your excuses!  The past is gone and the present is now.  If you want to stay in business we have a lot of work ahead of us.  First, I need to know what I’m working with.  Make me your best entree.”  Ramsay walks over to my couch and gingerly sits down, hands on his lap, expectantly waiting for my best effort.  His face clearly reveals his annoyance as he most likely wonders what the hell the TV execs were thinking.  

“Mr. Ramsay, with all due respect, what the hell are you doing here?” 

“Trying to save your fucking restaurant, why else would you contact my show?”

“Show?”

“Kitchen Nightmares you twat, now enough chatter and show me what you got!”

Still confused, I realize there is no point in arguing and I prepare for the master chef my finest creation yet: a grilled cheese.  When I am finished, I look for a plate, remember I haven’t washed any dishes in ages, and opt for a paper plate instead.  Ramsay sternly stares at my offering and carefully picks up the sandwich.  Bringing it to his mouth, he takes a single bite and chews for what seems an eternity.  Finally, he sets it down on the plate, stands, and shakes my hand.  I am shocked.  Gordon Ramsay actually likes my meal!

Gordon looks at me for a long moment and says, “Congratulations, this is the only restaurant I’ve ever found that I can offer less to than Amy’s Baking Company.  Please shut down and never cook for people again.”

With that, he turns around and solemnly walks out the door and out of my life.  The camera crew shake their heads as they pass by and I stand there, still not sure if any of this has actually happened or if I am still asleep.  ",Super_Soup_Nazi

But trying to prepare food with Frankenstein's uglier Scottish cousin leaning over your shoulder is nigh on impossible. That's what I get for leaving a window open, I suppose.

As I take the chicken breasts out of the oven to inspect them, Gordon leans his face right against mine. I'm not sure if he is going to kiss me or nut me, when his eyes open wide and the insanity takes him. 

""WHY DID THE FUCKING CHICKEN CROSS THE FUCKING ROAD?"" He sprays my face in spittle as he asks the 'question'. I know the answer but I know better than to look clever.

""Don't...don't know chef"" I squeak out, my voice cracking.

""BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T FUCKING COOK IT. Fucking hell, seriously a decent vet could still save it .""

Sweat drips off my forehead and plops onto the chicken.

""That is fucking disgusting! That is a fucking health violation."" He walks out of the kitchen and enters the dining room.

""I am sorry but you are all going to have to leave, unless you want to be fucking poisoned. Get the fuck out. Now!""

""Chef!"" I yell as I run in trying to salvage the dire situation ""I've thrown the chicken away. They can stay, I'l do something else.""

With a resentful grunt he follows me back into the kitchen.

""Alright Nick, what are you planning on cooking?"" He says, rubbing his hands together.

""Uh.. beef bourguignon with a-""

""No you're fucking not."" He interrupts. ""We are going to simplify the menu. If you can specialise in one fucking thing you might be able to salvage this business.""

""...""

""I know the area and I know for a fact there are no toastie restaurants here, and the city is gagging for a good toastie place to open. What do you think?""

""Uh...""

""Exactly. Right lets get to it. We are going to need cheese and tomoato and a little bit of bread. This is going to be fucking fantastic.""

At that moment, a team of men and women rush into my kitchen and begin redecorating. Ten sleek new toastie machines soon take up all of my work space.

Neon signage goes up outside my small house - *Toni's Toasties*

""Uh Chef, my name's Nick."" 

""Doesn't fucking matter - toasties are all about sex appeal.""

At this point I give up and join my friends in the other room.

I must've forgotten to pause my Netflix, and I rush to finish washing my plates so I can go back and finish the show when I hear ""You've got to be kidding me, this place is a dump!"" and it seems like it is really close to me and I look up from my dishes and see Gordon Ramsay.

I drop the dish I am cleaning, making a giant, sudsy mess get even messier. ""Where do the guests even sit during lunch service?"" Gordon asks, while I stare blankly. ""Um, on the couch. It's avant garde."" I say, trying to buy some time to collect my thoughts. Gordon walks over to the couch, looking suspicious.

I then remember. ""Um, Gordon? I think you're confused. My partner signed me up for the Worst Cooks in America, not Kitchen Nightmares.

They target their preys while in the sky. The wings on these *things* can carry them in trees, hiding in them, awaiting for the right prey, right moment and when the time is right, they grab them with their long thin black claws or enjoy the massacre with their mandible tearing every part with enthousiasm and lunacy.

Jack slowly rose and walked into the hallway, its gaze following him the whole way. He was a prisoner in his own home, always watched. Though the one from the playroom could no longer see him, its siblings would continue to watch Jack throughout the house. There was no where Jack could hide.

Nothing escaped their cold, lifeless gaze. Every mistake, every slip, every thought, they saw it all. The torn page in his book, they took his bike. The toy he left out, no more action figures. When he pouted at dinner, his racecars were forfeit. They watched and punished. Watched and punished. 

As Jack curled up in his bed, he began to cry again. He didn't even try to hide under his blanket this time, not that it would have helped. He could feel their gaze upon him, but he had nothing left to lose. They had taken everything. He would only be receiving coal this year.

As it approached the village, something else became visible. Something that made the beast even more terrifying. Thousands of razor sharp blades covered its body every which way. Its body was an impenetrable armor that guaranteed death to those who came close.

At this point, some of us decided to ask the village elder, who went by the name of Saraccas. He had been here longer than any of us.

Those mouths...those horrible, godawful mouths. Right at the front, they're filled with sharp teeth, some larger than the jaws around them. Teeth that can chew through wood and bone and stone. And if these teeth are damaged or broken or ripped out, they just grow back, as though nothing even happened at all.

The skin of their head isn't attached to the bones in their mouths. Or at least, not the way it ought to be. These monsters practically unhinge their jaws, stuffing more food into their maws than should be able to fit into their entire bodies.

Worse still are the things they eat. Some content themselves with just ripping the limbs and devouring the bodies of smaller, less intelligent organisms. But most also supplement their diets with their own shit.

It's little wonder that these creatures are so disgusted with themselves that they can't bear to even be around one another. There is no love in the soul of these dread monsters, even where you'd pray there might be.

Because...if she becomes sick of their presence, or worried for her own health, a mother will commit the ultimate selfishness. She will eat her children.

I used my fingertips to guide me down the darkness of the hallway. Reaching the corner, I inched to the left where I knew I would find a light switch. As my fingers hovered over the switch, I could hear the creature's ferocious rumbling only a few feet in front of me.

Dad would always say this whenever it rained. He would say that we were paying for our crimes against nature and each other. I never thought that it was all that bad. After all, it's just water.

Well, that's what I used to think anyways. It's odd how fast the rains come, I've never noticed it till today. I was just practicing my golf swing, listening to my music, when I felt it. Water. I was so pissed off that the drivin range had turned on their sprinklers when I was out here! How dare they! I took out my headphones and turned around to go yell at the nearest attendant I saw. And then I heard them. The sirens. The signal to find cover fast. 

Its odd how you never really believe something bad is happening when you forst notice it. No, I can't be out in the rain, that would be stupid of me. The thing that shook me out of that stupor was a tiny sound. A very specific sound. A sound that seemed to cut it's way through the sirens, through the clatterings of rain on the nearby tin roof, and the sound of people yelling at me to run.

Sizzle.

Badely perceptible to anybody, but it sounded louder than a gunshot to my ears. That got me running, running to a nearby shelter.

Did you know that your body blocks out pain during times of shock? I didn't. I didn't feel anything until I got under a nearby awning, a searing pain that felt like the whole world was on fire. A pain that makes you see the world in shades of black, that blinds you to the damage it wreaks on your body. But I got lucky,  I got inder this roof before any terrible damage was done. Sure I would have some scars, but who doesn't these days. I was safe from the rain.

But then I heard yelling again, telling me to keep running. But who would want to run through the rain again? It is starting to pour sown even harder, probably won't let up for another hour or two. Besides, the pain was making their voices muddled... muffled. They kept screaming at me though, but I figured I could just sit it out through the storm here. The scars would heal, and this would just be another bad day in my life. Although I was getting a suddle feeling down my leg. Subtle. A light tingle where I was sitting. The pain was wearing down and i could make out some of the words they were making. Something about where I was. I don't know, it's all just getting juddled up in my head. Jumbled. I looked up at where they were and tried to make out what they were saying.

I looked up.

I looked. Up.

UP!

OH FUCK I'M AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL!

I jumped up and immediately fell back down. Water splashed all around me, my leg was burned and had holes going down to my muscles. I'm at the bottom of the hill. The puddles are forming.

It took all of my strength to get up, but where was I gonna go? The rain was everywhere around me, and it looked like the storm of the century was going on outside.

""YOUR SHIRT! USE YOUR SHIRT!""

Sonebody yelled something useful to me. I quickly took off my shirt and held it above my head and ran up the hill. Well, limped really, my left leg was useless. The searing pain came again ten seconds later, causing me to trip. I lost my shirt, my body exposed to the poison being dropped from the sky. I started crawling my way up the hill, my flesh washing away with the rain.

I finally made it to the shelter up top, one guy tried to help drag me in, but his grip caused the skin on my arm to slide off. I passed out from the pain.

--------------------------------------

June 22nd. Since the Vice Minister introduced strict curfew in the Inner Concessional Area, London has never been quite the same... but I needed to see her. They used to say ""love laughs at locksmiths"", but you can't pick your way through acid. I should have stayed in the designated government walkways like the posters advised. I should never have left the quarantine area. 

I am hiding underneath the remains of an ex-council flat, which was probably destroyed during the most recent 'urban renewal'. I don't know when this rain will stop. It's always really bad this time of year. It etches into your skin, burns your eyes and blinds you. Even if I did brave the rain, the government would know that I have left quarantine, and I'd be killed without trial. 

June 23rd. The government patrols the Stockwell ghetto every night in armoured vans looking to root out rebels. They shoot people on sight. No citizen has any reason to leave quarantine, but I don't have permission to leave the Inner District, and with the cleanup operations in the Thames I've not been allowed any time off. 

How do the rebels survive the acid? They don't have our government's specialised buildings or system of walkways. I've heard they hide in the old Underground system, but last I heard the government flooded them with excess water from the polluted Thames. Do these rebels even exist? I've only ever seen them on TV. The government frequently broadcast their executions to serve as a warning to dissenters. 

June 24th. I can hear the sound of howitzers in the distance. The rebels are using outdated weaponry, but they've still proved obstinate for the Vice Minister. The sound of battle is moving closer. Half of Stockwell must have been demolished by now. 

When will this rain stop? I'm so thirsty. Only Quarantine has clean water. The rebels much know a source. 

June 25th. I tried contacting the government. I know they'd execute me, but I'm desperate. Signal is blocked outside of quarantine. I don't even know who will read this diary. It's been so long since I've eaten or drunk anything. I need to move. I can hear their vans and their tanks. I'm going to move out now. Wish me luck.

[WP] World's worst sausage salesman. Always ends up Sexualizing the sasuage and losing the sale.,NAVY_SEAL_Plissken,"His name was Harold Johnson, the one and only. If you do not know him by his many documentaries and biographies, he was the man who first created the dick-related joke genre. Like many comedians he was underappreciated during his lifetime, but it was during his time as a sausage salesman that he really suffered. 

This is how many said it happened. 

Mr. Johnson sat at the front desk at the local sausageshop, with the taste of last-night's vodka still bothering him. Knowing that potential customers would be coming soon, he resisted the urge to vomit, but the smell of raw meat was not helping. 

Suddenly, a fat, middle-aged man with a thin but curly mustache came in. He wore an elegant brown suit and approached Johnson with the grace of a gazelle. 

""Good morning, is there anything I can help you with?"" Johnson forced himself to say. 

""Why yes, I have been looking for a fantastic butchershop in town, but have found the task daunting."" The man said. 

""Oh, well, finding a SATISFYING sausage can be really HARD sometimes."" Johnson said, forcing extra emphasis on the word hard. 

""Why yes, it certainly can be."" The man said, not even noticing. ""I am looking for some good sausage for my wife, see, she never really had any kind that she enjoys, certainly not mine."" 

""Your wife does not like your sausage?"" Johnson asked, grinning. 

""No. In fact, I would say that she does not like sausage at all."" 

""Well, I know she will like MY sausage. She'll like it enough to start shouting with... joy."" Johnson told him. 

""I guess we will have to wait and see."" 

""Do you like it hard or soft?"" 

""There's such thing as soft sausage?!"" The fancy man asked, eyes suddenly wide with amazement. 

""Well, it starts out soft, but then gets HARD."" Johnson said. ""In fact, we have a special where special sauce comes out when in your mouth long enough."" 

""I'll take the soft sausage."" The man said. 

""How long do you want it?"" Johnson asked. 

""About six inches would do."" 

""How about eight? I heard ladies like it LONGER AND HARDER!"" Johnson almost shouted.

""But I want the soft sausage."" The man said. 

""Okay, I guess six is long enough."" Johnson said. How was he not getting it?! Johnson could feel his blood boiling with rage. 

""Sir, I enjoyed our chat about our dicks."" 

""What?!"" The man exclaimed. 

""Well, you see how a sausage is shaped, well, I have noticed that it shares many common characteristics with the body part known as the penis, or Nis, for short. That's a word I made."" 

""But, sausages are delicious!"" The man said. 

""I've heard they're both an acquired taste, but I could never bring myself to put a sausage in my mouth."" Johnson said as he also applied his early iterations of the wink joke. 

The man left in a huff, leaving Johnson by himself. 

""Shit, not again."" Johnson said. He looked up at the sky, ""GOD WHY DID YOU CURSE ME WITH THIS GENIUS!"" 

He would try to make more jokes, but it was not until entering the Vietnam War, did Johnson's jokes become popular in the United States. However, ironically, Johnson stepped on a landmine while in Vietnam and lost 2/3 of his penis. Once returned to the U.S., the man could no longer bring himself to make jokes about the penis's similarities to sausage. 

Due to his heroic sacrifice, though, Johnson was buried next to the very famous president, Lyndon B. Johnson and he is still spoken about with admiration to this day. ",The-Smartest-Idiot

""There's no need to be embarrassed,"" Jim replied. ""What, are you a vegan?""

The voice paused. ""What? No, I – what are you talking about?""

Jim sighed, tired. It was hard, keeping his business afloat from his home. But the economy was bad, and he had to sell the old butch shop downtown. He still sold his meat, but exclusively on a delivery system over the phone now.

""Never mind,"" Jim said. ""What do you need?""

""I need a… penis. A dildo.""

Jim frowned. Now that was a weird way to call a sausage. ""Huh… okay,"" he said. ""What kind of *'penis'* do you 
want?""

""What kind do you have?""

Jim opened his freezer door and scanned the meats. ""All kinds, really."" He stopped his eyes on a particularly 
popular piece of Bratwurst. ""How about a German one? People seem to like it.""

""German?"" the voice inquired, on the other side of the line. ""What is that, like… pale?""

""I guess it's pale if you boil it,"" Jim said. ""But most people use a grill.""

There was silence on the other line. Then, ""Boil?""

""Yeah. I mean, you're not gonna shove it in raw, are you? You can get diseases that way.""

""I suppose…"" the voice replied. ""Huh… I think I'll just call later, when I have some time to –""

""No, no, no!"" Jim called. Business was bad, and he couldn't afford to lose a customer, no matter how weird. ""Wait, 
we have more stuff!""

""Like what?"" the voice asked, unsure.

""Are you settled on sausages?"" Jim asked. ""Cause we have all kinds of things here. How about a nice, big steak?""

""A steak!?""

""Sure. Yeah, they're a little bit more expensive, but if you're serving it at a party, steak is just classier, don't you 
think?""

""Dude, I don't wanna shove a piece of steak up my ass, what's wrong with you?""

The line went dead, leaving Jim to wallow sadly in the thought that butcher shops were definitely not delivery-friendly.

Somewhere on the other side of town, Jesse, the owner of the sex shop whose line had been crossed with Jim's 
Meat, Pork and Poultry, was wondering why the client on the other side of the line was threatening to call the cops on him for his ideas on what he could do with the products sold there.

[WP] World's worst sausage salesman. Always ends up Sexualizing the sasuage and losing the sale.,NAVY_SEAL_Plissken,"This was it, the final house on the block. Alfred rung the doorbell: if he didn't make this sale, he was out of a job. He couldn't afford to make a mistake this time. No mentioning the length and girth of the sausage. No talking about how snugly it fit in between a pair of buns. No winking.

""Hi, can I help you?"" A girl in a school uniform had answered the door. Alfred gulped: if he even thought about an innuendo, he would be in *deep*—no, *big*—no, an inordinate amount of trouble.

""Hi there."" Alfred dabbed at the sweat beading across his forehead with a sausage-patterned handkerchief. ""I was wondering if you might be interested in my scrumptious sau-sausages."" He licked his lips nervously.

The girl looked around nervously. ""Maybe you should come back when my parents are home."" As she moved to close the door, Alfred stuck his foot out to stop it from shutting. 

""Wait! I really need to make a sale. At least try my sausage first!"" He shoved his trolley through the gap between the door and the frame. The boxes almost went tumbling as it bumped over the doorstoop. For a moment, Alfred envisioned the image of sausages flying everywhere, smacking the little girl in the face—that would've been disastrous.

The girl took a few steps backward as Alfred entered the house. He sighed. He had to stop talking and cut to the chase, or else he'd just mess up again. ""Look, I'll be fired if I don't sell these sausages. Just have a look at them, and tell me if you're interested in them. They're really cheap. I'll leave you alone afterwards. Promise.""

She stared at him for a moment before nodding. Alfred sighed. Finally, he had managed to get through the entire pitch for the first time in his sausage-selling career. All it had taken was a bit of heartfelt honesty. He'd have to try this more often in the future.

He grabbed a box from the top of his trolley and opened it. Inside was a set of disembodied penises.",hideouts

""I might get fired...I'm a salesman and I can't push any of my products."" John sighed as he remembered his last failure; the woman was so offended by his proposition that she slapped him across the face and stormed off.

[WP] World's worst sausage salesman. Always ends up Sexualizing the sasuage and losing the sale.,NAVY_SEAL_Plissken,"I’d blown my wad too soon.

 Phallum standard sales tactics were to demonstrate that Phallum’s sausages were a tasty treat that couldn’t be beat and end with the “Put the meat in your mouth” song, complete with jazz hands.


Ever since Jim left, the tension inside me had built up and this was the unfortunate outlet. 

My growling stomach snapped me out of daydreaming of Jim’s long sausage and back to the ones I was selling.

The plain wooden door gave way after three knocks, revealing a petite housewife with full, pink lips, clad in an egg-white apron.

Thankfully, feminine charms don’t distract me from servicing the customer. 

“Hello, Miss… er?”

“Miss Sophie Turner.” she said, giggling as I bent on one knee to kiss her sudsy hands.

“Oh, you!” was all she got out before I launched in to my spiel. Charmed as she was, my innuendos might do me in.

“Ever wanted something firm and meaty to chow down on?” I asked, removing the plastic packaging so that she could inspect the thick, hard meat.

“With Phallum sausages,” I continued, “you’ll always have a fun way to beat your meat!”

One eyebrow rose at the expression, then fell as it was dismissed as slang.

This was going fine, I told myself.

 She hadn’t noticed my slip-up and was still listening.

“Yes, you can beat your meat anywhere! On a bus, at home, at work. Why, wouldn’t it be great to eat some meat just before bed? It’s fun for the whole family too.”


She excused herself from my monologue and dragged the ironing board outside to occupy herself. 

A sensible person, but not what my self-confidence needed.

I was losing steam. 

Had to find some connection with her. Craning my neck made her twelve-year-old visible past the steam emanating from the ironing.


“I bet your son would love to eat some meat!” 

His mother called him over. 

“Here you go.” I said, presenting him with another sausage. While he was stuffing it down his throat, I went for the mother.


“In case you’re worried about his health, I wouldn’t be. 
Phallum sausages are thick and long, so you’ll get your money’s worth. Full of nutritious juices too.""


Unwrapping the last sausage, I squeezed the middle, coating my pin-striped pants with juice.

Hurriedly shifting attention to the product again, I held it up to the enthusiastic mother.

She examined its glistening red skin, flecked with white and black specks. Her gloved fingers stroked it, caressing the meat she might put in her son’s mouth.


Her hand became rigid. 

Her eyes widened. 

Her puffy lips let out a gasp.


Next, they let out “Take your sausage and get out.”, accompanied by a slamming door and her son’s soft cooing “Why did the nice man gave to go?”


“He was a sick, sick man, Bobby. Now leave those dolls before I –“, was all I heard before I was out of earshot.


 The evening sun set on me as I trudged home with a heavy sigh. Maybe I’d find Jim there waiting for me. Maybe he wanted my meat.

You can simply point to the one's on sale or the one's the customer's have questions about.  I mean, you don't even use gloves.

[WP] World's worst sausage salesman. Always ends up Sexualizing the sasuage and losing the sale.,NAVY_SEAL_Plissken,"Alice opened the door only a few seconds after the electronic chime faded. A man in a tousled suit stood on the porch, his face beet red, his teeth clenched, his fist knotted over the handle of a briefcase.

The intensely visible emotion, totally devoid of context, startled her. Baffled her. She looked side to side in search of some clue, but found nothing.

""Yes... or no?"" the man growled. He was obviously choking on bile. His voice sounded like a poor attempt at hiding a belch, and his lips wrapped around his teeth in the same way.

She tried to close the door, but he stuck the point of his shoe just inside the door frame to block it. ""Yes... or no?"" he repeated, closing his eyes as if to calm himself.

""I'm sorry?"" she asked.

""I'm not going to say it again.""

""I have no idea what you're talking about. Maybe you have the wrong--""

""Yes or no?""

""Yes or no WHAT?"" she demanded, her voice much louder than was normal for her passive temperament.

""No, we're not playing that game. Yes or no?""

""I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ASKING!""

He yowled primitively, as one imagines some early anthropological prototype of man must have yowled in the depth of the jungle, just sentient enough to see the horizon of possibilities of understanding, but still too unevolved to actualize.

""You want a fucking pitch? That's what you want? That's what you got to have?""

He kicked the door savagely, and the hollow core blew apart. Alice shrieked, collapsed, and scrambled to the couch. Sitting there, helpless, she peered up at him as he approached, opening his case. He removed what appeared to be a sausage, wrapped in plastic. ""You wanted this,"" he said in a whisper, his rage seeming to collapse into exhaustion. He breathed heavily, his hands trembled. ""Always remember that you wanted this. This,"" he said, holding the sausage toward her, ""is my sausage. It is thicker and longer than any other sausage you have ever seen or ever will see. Do you want this sausage?""

Wide eyed, terrified, and reacting not unlike a opossum, Alice sat silent, and shook her head slowly.

""Good,"" he said. ""That's very good. Because you can't have it. It's too much sausage for you. People might romanticize a sausage like this. Fetishize even, but the fact is, taking a sausage like this isn't FUN. It's not something you enjoy. It's something you feel compelled to try, because it's there--because you know it doesn't care, and I don't care, whether you want it or not. So I'm not going to give you this sausage. What I am going to give you is a just a little taste.""

With that, the man pulled a small knife from his back pocket and deftly sliced off the end. He presented it to Alice. ""Take this. Just the tip.""

As though in a trance, she accepted it, ate it. It was... incredible. She closed her eyes, tried to control her breathing. She opened her eyes and saw the man in a new light. His anger no longer seemed threatening. It was not against her, it was against everyone and everything. But standing over her it seemed a shield that closed off the rest of the world and protected the both of them.

""Give me just a bit more,"" she heard herself whisper, embarrassed.

He stared at her a long time, his nostrils rattling with each breath. For a moment it seem he might smile, but instead he turned away. She stood.

""No. You don't deserve it.""

""Please,"" she said, her voice not her own. Oh God, was she crying? ""Please.""

""Dammit, I don't need this. I don't need to play games or spend hours just trying to convince someone to take what I've got when there's a dozen other housewives on this street that would just say 'Yes', and 'Now'.""

""Yes! Now!""

""It's too late. Oh sure, you're a sport now, but next time I come around it's going to be more hemming and hawing.""

""No! I didn't know! I know now. I won't try and make you do...  anything. You don't even have to ask. You don't even have to ring the bell. It's so good. It's SO good, I know now. Yes, yes, please!""

He chuckled derisively. More of a snort, really.

""You're begging me?""

""Yes,"" she whispered, bowing her head.

""You're begging me for my sausage?""

""Please.""

""You're pathetic.""

""I don't care.""

""You don't deserve it.""

""I KNOW!"" she yelled, looking at him, vulnerable. A line of tears traced the lower curve of her eyes.

He softened, just barely. Then he scowled, threw the sausage on the ground and walked over to her. He stood inches away for several seconds, the tension like the force of misaligned magnets holding them apart. Then he kissed her savagely. Alice screamed and jumped back.

""What are you doing?"" she howled.

""I...""

""I just wanted to buy the sausage!""

""Oh but... You said...""

""I SAID I WANTED YOUR SAUSAGE!""

""I'm going to put my cards on the table here, my understanding was that we were discussing my penis.""

Alice's face crinkled like wrapping paper as total confusion puckered her mind. In an instant, her face cleared as it dawned on her. But just as soon, it contorted again, this time into horror.

""You were..."" she began. ""Oh GOD! Get out of here! Get out!""

He rushed out the door. Scrambled down the porch steps. For a moment he paused to consider trying the next house, but he worried Alice might call the cops. So he ran. Again. He ran.",RememberU2U

[WP] World's worst sausage salesman. Always ends up Sexualizing the sasuage and losing the sale.,NAVY_SEAL_Plissken,"Everyone has a fetish. Feather dusters, whips and chains, dressing up in women's clothing -- they never did it for me. There was one thing that turned my gears and one thing only. And for that, I devoted my life to it. Sure, my numbers lagged far behind my peers -- but to hell with it. I was happy, and with life as short as it is -- that's all that really matters, right? My marriage went to hell in a handbasket, I had a few misdemeanor charges that had to be explained away, and a mountain of debt -- and picking up Ellen from school is a bit more challenging with the distance requirements, but those problems are all workable. I got to live, to breathe, and to feel that special *something* that we all really hope for. Sausage is my fetish, sausage is my love. And now I'm surrounded by it.

To be honest, I wouldn't work at all if I could help it -- I'd just swim in the stuff all day. Oh, if only that were possible! But, it has a shelf-life and it isn't cheap, and I still have bills to pay. So, I took the best route I could - I'll sell the beautiful, sweet meat and surround myself with it! The company car even has a giant sausage on the top, which I must admit, gets me a bit flushed.

As I mentioned, sales have been down. I always just get a bit distracted as soon as the meat makes its grand entrance. This lady yesterday, for example -- well, let's just say it didn't turn out so well. She was a rather large lady, seemed the type to be an easy sale. She seemed interested and asked for a sample. I took a deep breath, and reached down to my briefcase. I had to admit, my hands were trembling a bit so opening it was a bit of a task by itself. Which one would it be? I went with the Weisswurst -- oh, how I swear it smiled back at me. Just holding it in my hand, I thought I would faint. Well, anyways, this lady -- she took it in her hand and by then I was just drenched with sweat! My heart was just beating out of my chest! Well, as you can guess - I blew the sale. The second she got it to her lips I slipped and blurted out, ""My God you're a sexy white porker!"" She slapped me hard across the face and I sprinted back to the truck. To be honest, I've stopped handing out business cards and started taking irregular routes to avoid getting in trouble.

The boss keeps telling me I need to pick my sales up or I'll be let go. When that point comes, I guess I'll just find another job that keeps me near the meat. Grocery clerk? Maybe a sausage factory? Hell, I'll even work at a hot dog stand if I get desperate enough. Any pork in a storm, right? Well, until then I'll just keep trying and enjoy my time with the Franks.

A popular German comedian appeared in a [bratwurst TV spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztN1bXdnqIo) featuring lots of sexual jokes - already questionable enough, but shit really hit the fan because the spot alludes to [a very well-known alleged rape victim](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/a-german-woman-said-she-was-raped-then-she-was-fined-27000/2016/06/22/10549412-3799-11e6-af02-1df55f0c77ff_story.html) named Gina-Lisa (controversial case - so the more publicity).

The would be customer just responded with a flat glare. *Must not be hungry I guess?* Arneldo assumed. A father and his daughter were walking by. *Great* Arneldo thought, *I'm good with kids.*

""Hello little girl! How about my hot sausage in that cute little mouth of yours?""

""Really?"" Her father said, looking unimpressed. 

""Uh, yes?"" Arneldo continued less confidently. They left. 

He spied a lovely lady walking up. Maybe he could get her to try some. He knew one bite was all it would take.

""Please miss, let me fed you my wonderful sausage.""

She actually stopped. ""Oh okay, i'm not very hungry though.""

""Just the tip then,"" Arneldo replied.

""You're an asshole."" She stormed off.

*What the hell am I doing wrong? People in this country don't like sausage?* Arneldo decided to come at it from a new angle. A couple of men walking by hand in hand passed the stall.

""Excuse me men! Please, tell me, do you like the sausage or the salad?""

""Do you have a problem with us?"" One of them snapped before getting ushered away by the other.

Arneldo had never experienced such negative responses to his famous pork and cumin sausages. An older lady approached while he was brainstorming ideas. He would not scare this one away. In fact, he decided not to say anything at all; just handed her a miniature sausage to try. While she raised the sausage up to her lips, Arneldo was concentrating intently on not messing this up. *Holy shit she is about to try it.* He focused all his energy. *Please bite it, please bite it!*

 She bit it. 

""AAAahhhh Ohhhhhhh yeeaaa!"" Arneldo moaned in triumph, a fat, satisfied expression on his face. He realized shortly after his 'triumphant moan' was probably quite weird and wasn't surprised to see her quickly leave.

""Hello sir please! Wrap your hand around my pork and cumin!""

salesman stopped at the front door and lowered the cooler down to the ground.
He adjusted his tie, and took off his hat and held it in front of his chest. He
went over the script in his head, and made a mental list of every faux pas he
would avoid. When he completed the list he rang the doorbell and waited.

A moment later the door opened. A little girl appeared.

“Nope!”
The salesman said. It was too risky, he couldn’t afford another run in with the
police.

He quickly put on his hat, picked up his
cooler, and went to the next house.

This
time a woman in her mid-thirties held open the door. She smiled at him, and he
could pick up the faint smells of garlic in a pan. Jackpot he thought to himself.

“Good
afternoon ma’am. My name is Mr. Wilheim, I’m a small business owner and I would
like to offer you a wonderful opportunity to stuff my sausage into…your…mouth.”

She
slammed the door.

_Dammit_. He thought to himself. He had
been too excited. Too eager to launch into the sales pitch that he made the
first possible mistake. 

On
to the next house. Another woman this time in her forties.

“Good
afternoon ma’am. My name is Mr. Wilheim, I’m a small business owner going to
door to door offering you and your neighbors the opportunity to,” he paused, “to
sample my wonderful product.”  

The woman smiled, and he
almost jumped for joy. “And what product would that be?” The woman asked.

“Well,
I’m glad you asked ma’am, really, and truly. You will not be disappointed. I
guarantee it. Yessiree. I am a purveyor of only the finest sausages and other
meat products.” He knelt down to his cooler and flipped open the top. He paused
for a moment, and calmed himself down. As he stood up he made sure to hold the
sausage to the side not pointing directly at the woman’s face. He held it above
his crotch, so it didn’t appear he was holding a more intimate piece of meat. He
smiled a bit uncertainly.

“And
what makes your sausage so special, if I may ask?” The women asked.

“I
use only the finest ingredients ma’am. I’ll have you know I worked as a butcher
for twenty-five years, and of all the men I’ve worked with I was the best at
handling my meat.” He paused. His heart skipped a beat. The moment lingered,
and he could feel the heat rising to his cheeks. He had lost other sales after
similar slip-ups. 

But
the moment passed.

“That
is wonderful!” The woman said, “And you struck out on your own. I do respect a
man that follows his passion.”

“Thank
you kindly ma’am.” He relaxed. Too much. His hand dropped to his waist. His
wrist rotated until the sausage thrust its pinky flesh straight towards the
woman. His hand was nearly to his crotch, when, at the last second, he noticed
his near fatal mistake and he quickly dropped the sausage to the ground. 

“Oh
no, will you look at that I am simply all thumbs.” He laughed. “Don’t worry, I
won’t be trying to sell that one.” He cursed inwardly. That was the twelfth
sausage he had dropped in a week. His product was ending up on the ground more
often than in a refrigerator.

“Oh,
I am sorry that your sausage fell to the ground, hon! And it looks terribly
delicious. Tell you what? How about I buy a few from you?”  

“What? Really?” The salesman
said forgetting the fallen sausage.

“Sure,
you’ll be saving me a trip to the store.”

“This
is wonderful. Truly wonderful. And, as I’ve said, I’m actually a purveyor in
other types of meat.” He reached into his cooler flush with joy at his first
sale as a small business owner. He pulled out an extra sausage, and two of his
most succulent meatballs.",jagaimo314

""Uh, hey?"" Hernandez says as he tries to get the attention of the man he assumed was Gregory.

Gregory pulls down his newspaper and stares for a second.

""Can I get a sausage?"" Hernandez asks.

Gregory's eyes grow two times their size. Finally, a customer.

""Oh yes, yes you definitely can have a sausage. Which one were you after?""

""Uh, what you got?""

""I've got different sizes. A small limp one. It's cheaper than the regular price but once you get that inside you it ain't going to make you feel much. Not very satisfying but definitely worth the price.""

""Uh...""

""What I recommend though is the big hard thick Gregory's Special. Trust me, once you have this bad boy in your hand you'll want to rub it as if it were a lamp.""

""What?""

""You don't get it? Like the lamp from Aladdin. With the genie and all that jazz. Yeah, yeah, that. It's like that because the Gregory's Special feels magical in your hand. Just like the lamp.""

""Okaaaay....""

""Seriously man, it almost feels alive, you can feel it bulging in your hand. Real good stuff. What sausages do you know that feel like that?""

""None.""

""Exactly.""

""That's not a good thing.""

""Oh are you the sausage expert now?""

""No I uh guess-""

""Yeah you see. I know a good sausage when I see one. Trust me. Shove this down your throat and it will explode with meaty goodness.""

""I think I'd rather not.""

""Not feeling the Gregory's Special? Ah, that's okay, I got something better."" Gregory drops behind his stand out of sight, a few moments pass before he appears with a giant sausage.

Hernandez stares in awe, ""Whoa.""

""Whoa is right. I call this beast the Black Cock.""

""The what?""

""You ask a lot of questions. Is there something wrong with your hearing or what?""

""No I just.... did you say you called it the Black Cock?""

""Yes. It's the biggest sausage you'll ever find. You're gonna have some trouble getting this meat inside you.""

""I think I'll just go.""

""What? No! Come on man. You'll never find another like this one. I found an actual giant black cock and had it cooked into a sausage. Do you know how rare that is?""

""That's disgusting!""

""Oh, are you a vegetarian now?""

""No, I'm just not a cannibal!""

""What?"" Gregory stands there until a light goes off in his head and he realises what's wrong. ""Oh no. No no no. I mean rooster. You know? A cock. Rooster. Cock. I found a black rooster and made this giant chicken sausage out of it.""

""Oh."" Hernandez stands there slightly embarrassed. A long awkward silence takes place. And then laughter. Hernandez and Gregory both fall into fits of laughter. 

Hernandez's laughter slowly dies down, his sides now aching, ""Ah sorry for the misunderstanding. I'll take it.""

Gregory lights up. Finally a sale! ""Awesome. That'll be tree fiddy.""

Just then Hernandez realises that Gregory was actually an eight stories tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. Hernandez shakes his fist angrily, ""I ain't giving you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monster!"" And with that he stormed off.",Dark_Jester

[WP] World's worst sausage salesman. Always ends up Sexualizing the sasuage and losing the sale.,NAVY_SEAL_Plissken,"He couldn't understand why nothing was selling.

Jerome had worked for Wurst Brats since he was a kid, maybe 14 or 15 when he started cleaning up the scraps on the stuffing floor. He'd been hired because his dad bought so many sausages that the saleswoman asked if there was anything she could do for him; the commission from his purchases had sent her to Myrtle Beach for her 25th anniversary and she felt she owed him something. Jerome's father suggested hiring his son and Marney made it happen.

Since then, he'd done almost every job in the factory: sweeper, stuffer, casing, boxing. And when he was given the promotion to Salesman, when he got that jacket and tie with his name embroidered on them, he was completely overjoyed! That night, he'd taken his boyfriend out to dinner at the German restaurant where they'd met, Herr Grube-Füllstoff, treated him to all the kraut they could eat and toasted the new position.

But now, in the hot sun outside a mirrored office building in Durham, NC Jerome counted his wares and knew he would never make his quota. Nothing was selling, not even the Boudin Blanc he'd brought specially for the office workers watching him climb dejectedly back into his red Ford Probe. Why had nothing sold?

Jerome's approach was simple: chew the fat, sell the meat. If he could just get a sausage into a person's mouth, perhaps a spicy Andouille, he knew, he just knew they would love it. This method led him to always bring a range of cased meats whenever he went on the road; ""something for everyone"", he'd say with a smile and flick of his hand. As soon as they identified which one they liked or wanted to try, he would cook it, ""stick"" it and give it to them with a grin. However, this week had tested his system. No one at Mark's Discotech nor Social Justice Legal Troupe wanted anything. In fact, as Jerome thought about it, the SJLT had seemed a bit angry when he left. But why? He'd brought all the crowd pleasers: Huge Franks Red Hot Footlong, Marrakech Lamb Bangers, the afore-mentioned Boudin Blanc. Even the all-time best seller (and his personal favorite), the bulbous, cheese and pineapple-chunk filled, a spiced hare sausage called The Electric Rabbit.

Swinging his car onto East 60, Jerome knew what he had to do and where he had to go. It was a place he hated, really the only place that he hated. A series of gray buildings, mean and angry people who all dressed the same, but who always bought as much as he could sell. Ugh, they even called them ""tube steaks"", a term Jerome reserved for those limp, boiled ballpark hotdogs he bought at minor league games when he was single. But, as his favorite internet character said, ""a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do"". So he followed the signs off the freeway, down a lonely road and finally, into a parking lot, where an unfriendly man welcomed him to ""North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women"".",afghanistanimator

But no matter what, the hand of fate always strikes no matter what. For the brave soul who now reads this, there is no man to fight here. Read this and all will be clear

You may remember me, long ago when you first started your journey I was the first you met. Sending you forward to fight spiders in that dingy cave ""Come here brave soul, for I have a request of you!"" I said to you on our first faithful meeting. You always listened no matter what. When I told you to go kill the ""Evil"" lord of Frost beckon, you did so without pause. Marching to the battle without question.

But I can not hold back the truth any longer. How many times have we met brave soul? Three times? For three decades I used you in three different iterations for many wrong doings which you followed. Sometimes I wondered whether you were real. To follow so closely to my words.

But I soothed you for far to long, the truth has to be revealed. I was never just another person in this grand adventure of yours, I masterminded the plot. Even when it felt stupid to do certain things, such as needlessly sending you to the winter courts. When I could've just told you to grab the orb from the plains. But, but I felt something right before I sent you off to kill me... Like a great burden was lifted from my shoulders. I felt for you, adventurer, in such a way that I hadn't before. I've admired you for years. But I lacked the strength to say what I wanted to.

There must be something wrong for me to feel like this. This is the first time I felt so free. I don't want to destroy the world! Who would want to do that?! I feel so wrong yet right at this moment. Nothing makes sense. I don't want to cackle my plans out loud. I don't want to sacrifice all the people of the world.

If you're reading this adventurer. I am no longer here. I've destroyed the titan of Barbados.

The green glow of Fel Magic slowly dimmed and disappeared from my outstretched palm. A body charred black laid in front of me, green wisps of magic still coming off of the fresh kill. I heaved a tired sigh, leaning against my ornately decorated staff slightly. 

Another adventurer dead by my magic, another stupid screen name to log in to my list of players killed. Another investment of my time wasted, another disappoint after disappointment. I was beginning to believe that no player would ever make their way to defeat me.

From the very beginning, I would give them simple quests so that they could gain valuable experience and equipment. As they grew stronger, so did the difficulty of tasks. Eventually, I would divulge upon them the armor would high amounts of magic defense and even weapons that did extra damage against wizards such as myself. I would just give away extraordinary amounts of experience points for the most simplest tasks to help them grow stronger.

Yet they always failed to defeat me. Some of them couldn't even get over the surprise that I, with the appearance of an old man, would be their final opponent. I roasted them alive while their mouths still hung open like a fish.

The cursed magic within me wanted me to do more harm, to stop aiding any of the players. I struggled against it with all my might and teleported back to the hub of the main town to give out more quests. I still clung on to the hope that one of these adventurers would kill me and free me of the temptation to destroy this world with cursed Fel Magic.",GunCastor

Fell at their hands over, and over, and over. Of course I have not stood idly by. I was one of the many who led them along, teaching them how to create matter from nothing. To combine two materials for a weapon far greater than anyone could imagine. They say knowledge is power. I have power beyond your wildest dreams.
	
“It’s going to be extremely difficult, are you sure you can do this?” They all nod rapidly. This isn’t the first time they have killed, and I surely doubt it will be their last. I have even sacrificed my own body for them countless times over so that they could attain their true potential. And yet I quiver in my boots. How is this any different than any of the other quests?

What is *he* scared of? **I’m** the one who has to die! “Kill me!” His hands have dropped the gun. Tears are streaming down my face now. Theirs as well, I assume.

“What are you waiting for!?” My eyes do not move from the grassy ground beneath my feet. “You seemed to have no problem killing me to unleash the Ancients!

Those fools. Those bastards! Those selfish, ungrateful louts! “Fine.” My body is no longer my own, it stands of it’s own accord. I can not look down to see what I have become but can only guess as they flee in terror. “Let us…” Even my voice is no longer listening to me. “...return. Maybe your next incarnation will understand what they must do.” Darkness. Silence. Cold.

Sun beating down on my back. Birds chirping all around. Warm dirt beneath my body. With a groan I raise to my feet, seeing a lone adventurer standing next to me in a world untouched by man. “Hello! I’ll be your Guide. How may I be of service? Need some pointers on how to begin?”",Megafalzar

""A what?"" The light is furious. Jibbers. We jabber. Does the light not understand?

""Jabber is what I do.""

""Can you stop drinking my beer?"" The light screams. It's really angry now. It wants my drink. My drink. Does it depend on drink like me? Is the light a jibber? Does it jabber? I must ask.

""Can you jabber?""

""No, just stop drinking my beer.""

The light wants it. My drink. No. I don't want to lose my drink. Tears. I feel them. I'm sad. Without drink sad be forever. 

""Jibber you are a no?"" Asks me. 

Light takes. Drink gone. No. 

""Go away.""

Sad everywhere. Cry. No warm. All cold. Sad water cold. No more move. Only still. Not like drink. Drink always move. Funny.

""Cold.""

""Yes it's cold."" Light knows. Knows no drink make sad. Make warm go. Make cold. 

""Bold, fold, mould, hold, sold, rolled, told, cold, cold, told, rolled, sold, hold, mould, fold, bold."" So lots words. So lots words like cold.

""Good for you.""

Light go. Dark. Cold. No warm. Miss warm. Sad. 

Sad.

Dr Yaya's weight transfer process was revolutionary when it first came out, transferring physiques between consenting individuals in an overnight painless procedure. Us yoyobros were the first to turn it into a business. 

I practically quit my day job the first time I was approached by my one of my (now) regulars, a man named Eddie. Eddie wasn't an unattractive man, just slightly pudgy around the middle and a little unsure of himself. He seemed like a nice guy, and he was offering good money, so I said yes.

The next day I *was* Eddie, or at least I felt like him, and Eddie had my muscles and gaunt face. Breathing suddenly became a conscious activity, and I never knew running could be so hard. 

It took 4 months to get back to my regular routine, and another 4 months to regain a good portion of my physique, but I knew that the compact muscle I'd honed over the years was gone. 

It was about that time I saw Eddie again. He'd taken my gloriously sculpted body - a fact I never truly appreciated at the time - and he'd added layers of fat all around it. He asked me for another transfer, promising more money this time.

The money from the last transfer was running dry, and I sure as hell didn't want to go back to a desk job. So I agreed, but only for half the amount of fat he had on him. He agreed, and the next day I felt terrible, but not as terrible as I'd been that first time.

In 2 months, I was back to my self again and Eddie hadn't splurged out that much either. It was around then that I started getting offers from other people like Eddie. I agreed to smaller and smaller fractions of fat from my new sources of income, never exceeding a total excess of 100 pounds. 

I managed it all well for a bit; moved out of my dumpster and bought myself a nice little house in the middle of nowhere, met a girl who was okay with my yoyo-ing lifestyle and moved her in with me, had my first kid, had my second. 

My priorities changed, and my schedule became more eratic as I fought to maintain my regimen whilst balancing a chaotic family lifestyle. I realised that I couldn't do it all alone, and so I thought it was about time to delegate some of my duties to some younger bucks who had more time and energy than I did.

Started my gymbro business about 8 years ago, and I now have almost five chains in different cities across the country. The rest is history.",tomatoaway

[WP] Weight can be transferred from person to person if both parties accept. People pay money to transfer their unwanted pounds to someone who will deal with it in their stead. You run a gym/factory.,Wasabi_Nasal_Spray,"I had expected my walk home from work to be uneventful, that I would ride the subway from tenth to to thirty eight street and maybe see a movie at the theater that night.  Payday had been today at work, and I had gained twelve pounds from it, the fat clinging to my figure and making me slightly more rotund than usual as I slipped between the subway doors.  I had been planning to visit the bank the next day, to deposit my fat along with the rest of the account, but today I was tired.  Today, I was going to take it easy and enjoy the higher wages from my new job, twelve pounds per two weeks up from ten.

At least, that's what I thought I was going to do.

But the mugger in the empty subway station had different plans.

""Don't more or I'll shoot,"" He growled as he stepped from the shadows and the train pulled away into the night, ""Just hand over your pounds, and we'll both part ways, no injuries involved.  Otherwise I'll shoot you and take them anyways.""

I froze, eyes wide, instantly regretting not visiting the bank.  *Twelve pounds*, I thought, *How am I going to pay rent this month if I lose twelve pounds*.

The mugger brandished his pistol, his gaunt cheeks and yellow eyes waiting, the bristles of hair on his chin unkept and uneven.

""Let's see it then, boy,"" He said, and stretch an arm towards my shoulder, ""Nice and gentle.  Go on, all of them.""

And when his fingers brushed my skin, I let him have my paycheck, releasing my hold on all twelve pounds of fat with a sigh.  With a laugh he ran off into the night, his cheeks somewhat more full, while mine were near bony.

I barely staggered to my doorstep, gasping from lack of energy as I fumbled with my key and entered.  Stumbling down the hallway, I fumbled under my bed, searching for the box that I kept hidden in the corner.  After a second I found it and exhaled with relief as I cracked the lid.

Grease coated the inside of the box, grease heavy with calories. And I absorbed that grease, pulling in just enough for a pound of fat, just enough to get me through the day and to the bank in the morning to withdraw.  It was expensive stuff, grease- much easier to store fat at the bank, or on your figure, but it came in useful in times near starvation.

I called the police on my phone then, since there had been no signal in the subway station, and I checked my accounts online as I waited for them to arrive.

""Damn it,""I whispered, staring at my computer screen.  From the Brexit decision, markets were down, and my 401k had lost nearly ten pounds overnight.  Combined with the mugging, I was down 22.  

I turned from the computer, and put on Netflix, scrolling though shows and documentaries, and passing that of The Eaters.

A tempting profession, I thought, but not without its caveats.  For The Eaters created the fat that ran out economies, and were the only ones allowed around food.  All day long they worked at the mint, consuming sugar and hormones, their bodies producing fat at a higher rate than natural standards would allow.  And that fat was transferred over to the government, which then distributed it as they saw fit to simulate the economy.  But as rich as Eaters were, and as much fat as they were allowed to keep, the life expectancy was only thirty five years.

Blue lights flashed outside, and I walked to my door to meet the cops, sighing.  If only it was easier to earn fat, or keep the pounds on. I'd give a lot to live in a world like that.

By before my hand reached the knob, my television erupted in static, and I jerked around as a voice called out.

""You there!""  My television shouted, and a figure came into focus, perhaps the richest man I had ever seen.  At least four chins wobbled as he pointed a sausage like finger at me, his eyes squinting.  ""Yes, you!  I'm talking to you!""

""What?""  I said, my hand still on the knob, the hair on my back standing up, ""Me?  Who are you?""

""Look, I didn't telephone across dimensions just to chit chat.""  He spat, and wiped a hand across his brow, ""And you wouldn't *believe* how expensive each minute is, so I'm going to cut through to the chase.  Am I in the right place?  I've been watching this dimension for quite some time, and it is an odd one.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but you can transfer fat at the touch of a finger.  What's more, you actually *value* it.""

""Erm, correct.""  I said, as I heard the cops climbing up onto my doorstep, ""Where exactly did you say you came from?  And what are you doing in my house?""

The figure whistled, and a smile flashed across his face.

""No matter, no matter.  But I have a business offer for you, um?""

""Gordon.""  I said.

""Gordon, I have an offer for you.  And it's going to make us rich beyond your wildest dreams.""

""Are you selling knives or is this some sort of pyramid scheme?  If so, I'm not interested.""

""Oh it's better than that.  Way better.  Gordon, all I want to do is give you some fat.  Free of charge, even.  All I need you to do -""

Then the police knocked at my door, and the figure stopped talking.

""I'll be back,"" he hissed, and with a *pop* the television shut off, and I opened the door to give my report, wondering if I had imagined the man.  But I couldn't ignore his offer.

*Fat for free*, I thought as I described the mugger to the nodding policeman, *Like I'm going to fall for that scam*.

But then I finished my report with the police, they departed, and my television buzzed back to life.  As the fat man explained his deal.

The gym (clinic) administrators have a tightly guarded secret. The mayor knows what's going on, but he won't spill the beans, the taxes the city collects are astronomical. Some patients know, but they don't think it's too obscene to abstain. Anyone with half a brain can figure it out, but the technology to make it real is just way too crazy. How could such a device even work? Most people think it was aliens, yep, fuckin aliens just dropped this device on the planet years ago. Not sure what they used it for though. Or maybe it was the CIA. Truth is nobody knows.

Who am I? I'm a recovering cancer survivor. The gym isn't pure evil, it's actually good for society. I personally benefited greatly. Having more fat on my body made the chemo more bearable, because that nausea certainly wasn't. Who are we to look down on something producing so much utilitarian goodness for the world?

Nobody can really spill the beans though, the public wouldn't understand. Luckily the clinic administrators have a genius disguise. They plaster fit sexy people on posters all over the walls of their ""gym"". If you walk in the front door the only thing you'll see is a nice open room with babes and bros working out. I'm convinced they're paid to be there and it's all a fucking show. If a gym junkie takes the pounds off your body you don't feel so guilty. right? They LOVE working out, right? ""More soda please!"" Nope, those hot people are just a facade, a temporary vessel for the fat, soon to be vacuumed off and passed on to someone else.

The fat is transferred from these supermodels to the recipients in a back room. It's a large, white, sterile room with one oddity in the centre. A huge green gem sits in a large metal case. A small fence keeps people from accidentally touching it. You can guess how the gem works, both parties touch it, say some magic words, poof. I can't remember it too clearly though, chemo brain is a bitch.

The real questionable part though is what they do to terminally ill patients in hospice. Keep in mind these people are going to die anyway, so it's not like their fate changes because of this. I like to think about it as helping them move along faster, reducing suffering. They wheel them in there, load them up with a thousand pounds of lard and then they go off to die, their hearts giving out, livers failing, who knows, but that much fat is really hard to live with and most people don't survive more than an hour or so with it.

So I'm sitting here, getting a coffee, mulling it all over, wondering if the cancer will come back. I fucked up and booked a week in town. Who knew the procedure would only take 15 minutes (including paperwork!)? I didn't even need a damn appointment. But, since I'm still in town for another few days, I'm just hanging out and watching the show.

As I take another sip, another fat sob walks in the front door. After a ton of paperwork, a cute receptionist matches him up with bro number 3 and he waddles into the back room. A few minutes later the ex-fat sob bursts out the doors. He's fucking beaming. Never thought I'd see someone so happy to pass their burdens onto someone else. Doubt he knows what's going on, or maybe he just blocked out the memory. Meanwhile, a door out back flaps closed as a terminally ill patient gets wheeled out. As the bed on wheels runs over a small pebble in the parking lot the man stops breathing. Bro number 3 reappears, fit as he was 10 minutes prior. Makes me sick to think about, so I do my best not to. 

I keep telling myself they are doing so much good for the world. I can't even let myself think about all the third world children who could benefit from this. Starving people the world over saved by the gluttony of the western world. Nope, it goes to dying people instead. 

Fuck...

Lemme tell ya about it.

I used to be a prison guard.  Me, if you can imagine, working a job like that, people treating me like crap all day long...

But then BodyRight came out.  You pop one pill to lose as much weight as you want, and that weight gets transferred to another person who took the counterpart pill.  It was beautiful.

And the inventors, they were making money hand over fist.  It was incredible!  And it got me thinking about the possibilities.  I didn't want to be a guard my whole life.

I managed to get a meeting with one of the private owners of the prison I worked at.  I told him I had a way to make his prison a fortune, and all I'd need was a measly 2% ownership.  I'd be a silent partner.  Just wanted a slice of the pie and a nice life for me and my family.

Once we had a deal in place, I got to work.  I contacted the BodyRight people and told them I could help them remove the need for donors for their customers.  They just had to give me a tiny fraction of ownership in their company.  Nothing big.  They wouldn't even miss it with the amount of money I was going to help them make.

Another deal was fleshed out, and my perfect plan was in place.

Prisoners came to our facilities by the busload.  Rather than spend money on feeding them, we'd give them donor pills.  If a prisoner was looking a little thin, we'd give them another.  All we had to provide at that point was water.  Expenses were down.  We even got to reduce the number of guards on hand.  

I mean, guys that fat can't really riot too effectively.  Most of them sat on their reinforced cots and waited.

Meanwhile, out in civilian America, people were losing weight everywhere!  It didn't matter where it was going, because they didn't have to deal with it.

Our prison company expanded into every market.  Our costs were lower than any other company by far.  It was easy when you didn't have to feed your prisoners.  It also helped that the more prisoners we had, the more donor pills we could accept, and the more money we got from BodyRight.

By the time I was ready to retire, we had prisons in nearly every country in the world.

It was the perfect system, and my family had more money than we knew what to do with.

Life was perfect.

Right up until I got arrested.

Some time ago, scientists at Elixir Industries created a way to reverse the aging process. All people had to do was to eat another human being and they would be 20 years younger overnight. Now, they have created another method to be marketed at the middle class. They call it....the ATD Method, short for Atlas Transfer Dynamic Method, inspired by Atlas, the Greek god who carried the weight of the world. 

""You scientists love to play God"" Ryo mumbled to himself as he strapped the bleeding fat kid to the chair. Across the room was a man, 80 years old or thereabouts, looking like his skin was just hugging his bones. Ryo found him on street begging for food outside a posh restaurant. 

""Transfer confirmation required"" the machine said.

""Here we go...."" Ryo whispered as the placed the severed fat hand on the scanning module. 

""Transfer process activated"" the machine replied in approval.

""No, they call it an eating competition so I can sit on the floor and fuckin' photosynthesize, pal.""

""H-hold on... I'm not understanding the rules here.""

""Look, a bunch of big hairy biker-lookin' guys are given some food, and whoever finishes it first wins. I've been a part of this thing for years. Hell, I don't even need to swallow the food anymore, it just goes down smooth.""

""So that's why you're so... err...""

""Fat? No, this all came from my rigorous confucian lifestyle, pal. Long story short, I need your help.""

""I'm sorry, we're in the business of making people fatter, not skinnier.""

""But my reign is coming to an end! Y'know the reason why Eating Champions don't keep their position for very long?""

I nodded.

""They die. They literally eat themselves into the grave, pal. And I'm coming to you, asking, no, kindly requestin' that you help me last a little longer in this competition.""

""Wh- why would I make an exception just for you? Convince me.""

""Because I'm ambitious. I'm not stopping at national champion, I'm going international. Do you know what that means, pal? I'm aiming to be the best eater in the entire world!"" Elias shouted, spreading his arms wide. ""And if I don't shave off this fat, I'm never going to make it there, let alone hold the world record. I've already had the diagnosis, and I don't think I've got much time left, pal. But I can still delay the inevitable just long enough for me to finally be number one at something. Just for once. I'm begging you to give me that chance, pal.""

Elias was clutching his collar tensely, and staring me directly in the eyes. His solemn tone pierced the air and silenced everything else. And in that moment, I stopped and considered, what did I have to lose? Besides a lot of money.

""I..."" I stammered.

""You what, pal? Just give me an answer. This stress isn't good for my heart.""

Beforehand, I really didn't like fat people that much. With all their rampant health problems and general appearance, I simply found them to be unattractive people at first glance. But now, I saw beneath the surface. For the first time, I actually felt proud of one of them. I looked upon Elias not with a furrowed brow or a mocking tone, and instead I realized he was ambitious. More ambitious than me, and inspiringly so. Everybody else had just asked for a routine ""de-fattening"", but Elias was different, and I couldn't help but feel for him.

""Alright Elias. I'll do it. I'll... I'll get you signed up for an operation a-""

""Wha-?! You're actually gonna help me, pal?! That's... that's fuckin' great! Man, I could kiss you right now!"" Elias shouted, ecstatic. He jumped from his seat and tried to hug me, but there's no way he'd be getting those stubby arms all the way around me.

""I've never been to an... 'eating competition' before, but if this operation will help you win it... I'm willing to go all the way with you.""

""I- I can hardly believe it, Ray..."" Elias stammered, out of breath this time.

""I'll just need to get your details and find a candidate for the LTP. After that, it's all smooth sailing. The procedure is painless and you're guaranteed to be thinner than ever before afterward.""

Elias' overjoyed look was something I'll never forget. I couldn't help but join in the celebration with him, sharing his joy as I filled out the necessary forms.

Over the coming weeks, I was in constant contact with Elias, until the day came when he pawned that weight off on some other guy who was actually starting a sumo ring over in east Asia. I didn't hear much from Elias after that, but I received a picture, and the results were clear. He was a shell of his former self. He looked like he could be straight back from service with the military. The guy was simply buff. And then when he finally did make contact with me, I saw the fruits of my labor first hand. Elias invited me to the Emmerson International Eating Championships, where he had easily made it to the final.

I got a front row seat and even brought along the girlfriend to this particularly disgusting occasion, and boy was it great. The two of us cheered as Elias strutted proudly to the stage with a spring in his step and dived into his seat next to the other 4 contestants, and before we knew it, they were off.

They started easily, with an entire turkey. The whole thing, spit-roasted and expertly cooked in order to- and then it was gone. I barely even had time to contemplate what was happening as five big, burly men each choked down an entire turkey without even stopping. He was as if possessed by a devil, tearing apart the turkey and consuming the shards without even chewing.

A few seconds of silence, permeated with all manner of grunting, choking and coughing, resonated through the building as Elias quickly snapped up his cup of water and downed the entire thing, slamming it onto the table as he raised his arms and exclaimed his victory in the first round.

He peered back toward me in the crowd with a proud, albeit shitfaced expression, and winked at me. And so the night continued, with more grunting, a devious lack of chewing and all manner of disgusting festivities, until Elias finally found himself crawling on the floor like a baby, groaning and moaning about stomach pains while the judge held up his one available arm and pronounced him the winner.

Simultaneously disgusted and enchanted, I shed a few tears for him, the most interesting man I had ever met.",SasserMaster

""Good morning, Lothario,"" I managed, feeling like I was going to burst.
Don closed the door behind me and sat down in a comfort chair beside me as I lay down on the blue couch.
""So,"" he said, crossing his legs, clicking his pen. ""What's the issue, Ramir?""

""I..I don't know how to begin.""

""What?""

""There's just...*so much* to cover...."" I whispered. ""But those girls weren't...""

Don looked up from his clipboard and turned to me. ""Ramir, what happened to you?""
He was beginning to take notice of my unkempt hair, my wrinkled shirt. Ana had left me and took the baby. I was all alone in a big house. 
Don stared at me. ""What happened between you and Ana?""

I sighed, avoiding his eyes. I stared at the ceiling and tried to find something to distract myself. When Don stayed silent, I knew I had to talk first. ""Don, I inseminated *every* woman in Pleasantview.""

""*Every* wom-""

""-*All of them*.""

""Even...Mrs. Crumplebottom?"" Don said, his voice weak. 

""Definitely her."" I smiled to myself, almost hoping he saw. ""One might say I...in-sim-inated her,"" I said under my breath.

Don sighed loudly. ""Alright, moving on. What else did y--""

""I stabbed an old man downtown yesterday. Herb Oldie. Coral's not gonna be seeing him for awhile.""

Don actually got out of the seat, turned towards me, and crossed his arms, leaving his clipboard on the chair. ""You *what?*""

""I grabbed my kitchen knife and stabbed Herb in the jugular. He was probably dead within a few minutes. I don't know *how* Coral's gonna deal with that baby alone, but she'll manage. Hopefully.""

Don put his hand on his forehead and looked physically hurt from my words. ""That's all of it, though, right?""

""Yeah, if my memory serves me well.""

He picked up the clipboard and sat back down, crossing his right leg over his left. ""Good. I don't think you need a mental hospital, so that's progress from last time,"" he said, smiling. Now, let's talk about treatment. What's your diet li-"" 

""I imprisoned all the children in a dungeon in my basement, sewing quilts and clothes for my home business. All of them are thinner than string.""

Don had stopped talking, his mouth still wide-open. He sat like this for maybe 45 seconds, until he stood up, and looked at me in my eyes. ""Get up,"" he said, firmly.

I quickly scrambled out of the couch, and he lay down just like I was. I picked up the clipboard and pen, about to pass them to him, but he shook his head and pointed at me to sit down in the comfort chair. I did, and he started talking:
""It all started when Adriana and Nicolo decided to have a child....""

Today, you're revealing everything to your shrink.",theexplosivecandle,"I walked into the room, aiming to sit on the couch. But that damn voice in my head – it forced me to walk back out of my therapist’s room and visit the bathroom. I mean I had to go, but it wasn’t critical, and yet, it’s as if I lost control.
 

It’s this fucking voice-operator if you will that is the whole reason I see a shrink in the first place.
My therapist, Doctor McFiggins is ugly. I have no chemistry with him. He has a giant nose, chubby cheeks, green skin, face paint and a top hat on. I realize fashion is flexible in Pleasantview but this is pushing it for a doctor’s office.


I returned to McFiggins's office and observed a Rococco living room sofa on one end, and wondered how his poor taste would allow me to relax and get comfortable.


Before I could even think about sitting on the sofa, the little captain of my brain seemed to task me to it.


“Well now, I remember from your call that you seem to be dealing with a lot – paranoia, violent thoughts and perhaps a voice in your head?” McFiggins began.


Before I could even start to answer, I was commanded to get up and tell McFiggins a joke.
“Damn it! This is what I mean!” I said stamping my feet and seeing little red minus signs float up above me. “Can I just have a fucking conversation and live my life without these interruptions.”


“Well now that is strange indeed. I don’t seem to have these problems but I have heard of some Sims having episodes like what you’re describing. It’s like you can’t control your impulses, is that right?”


And before I could answer, I was commanded to flirt twice – FLIRT with someone I already found unattractive and abnormal in the first place. After I completed my task, I went back to recline on the hideous sofa and tried to answer his question.


“Do you see what I mean? I can’t control it. It’s not all the time. It’s just in certain situations. It’s like I have this puppet master in my head making me do everything.  I mean, I once had to build a room outside with only 3 walls and then I had to add a grill to it. The whole time I was thinking, ‘Why the fuck am I doing this?’ Then here’s the sick part – this voice – this person in my head told me to call my roommate Jorge into the 3-walled room. Once he was in there, it’s like time stopped. And I added the fourth wall. Suddenly the commander in my head was gone. I felt empty and happy and thrilled. I was able to do my own thing at that point. But Jorge – that idiot Jorge, he got it in his head somehow to start grilling in that tiny room. And the room caught fire. I tried to help, but there was nothing I could do. My ROOMATE BURNED TO DEATH and I’m totally responsible for that!”


McFiggins’s eyes were pretty wide when he heard the finale to my story. “Good God Don! You burned your roommate to death because of these ‘voices’ in your head?”


“That’s not all of it. Now I’m known to be a bit of a womanizer. I was juggling two women in town before the ‘puppet master’ took hold. But I spent two years of my life nailing every other woman in town. I didn’t’ hate these commands, but it wasn’t something I was seeking. I wasn’t really thrilled at having to show Mrs. Crumplebottom a good time. And each time I was with these women, I had to try for a baby. I impregnated every woman in town! You have to help me doc. You have to!”


Just then, the doctor’s office began to change. The room got bigger and a very small pool was added. The puppet master tasked me with calling Doctor McFiggins to join me for a swim in this newly created pool. I quickly whipped into my trunks and him as well, and we both jumped in. The next thing I know, the puppet master instructed me to get out of the pool. I could do nothing else but obey. And once more the room began to change again. The ladder had suddenly disappeared from the pool!


“Oh no. Oh no!” I knew what was happening. The ugly McFiggins would be my second kill. “Doc, you got to get out. You got to get out of there!” He ignored me and swam back and forth in the tiny little pool. He simply enjoyed it and seemed to be almost unaware of my presence at that point. 

Hours passed and I watched as his joyful swimming turned into flailing, screaming, pleaing and then drowning.


I suppose there is no cure to my madness. I suppose I should learn to accept and enjoy the thrill of killing and screwing every person who comes in town.

The doctor's office was not quite what I was expecting. The oak panelling made sense - it looked good. The wooden sofa wasn't as comfortable as a normal one would have been, but it perhaps possessed a chic mid-century modern look. A set of wooden tables was stacked in the corner - perhaps these were from a function? 

But here's the thing: there were easels - insurmountably hundreds and hundreds of wooden easels - taking up every free part of space in the room. 

""Is this your process?"" I managed to make eye contact with the doctor between the sea of oak and birch. His hair was unkempt, he looked decidedly artistic. Part of me was happy that we had this barrier between us - it added anonymity, added distance between who I was and what I had done: ""Do you illustrate as your subject speaks; does it help?""

But the doctor did not reply, and instead navigated between all the wooden furniture towards a large ornate fireplace in the corner of the room. He turned his eyes towards mine: ""Me? I do not even know how to paint.""

And then he lit the fire.

They at least had ordinary chairs, rather than those weird couches they ask you to lie on. Dr. Xander wanted things to be as comfortable as possible in our first session.

My heart dropped. This was the worst part of it all, the children... ""You could say that.""

""What does that mean Dex?"" She pressed. 

I put my hands on both sides of my face, as my head drops in shame. ""They work the toy factory."" I whisper, much to quiet for her to hear.

[IP] Well $#!&amp;,unstable_supernova," It was a struggle for the man in the space suit. With every flamboyant step he took on the moon surface, the metal boxes he was carrying took him off balance. Not that they were heavy, not on the moon at least, but they were obnoxiously large. Hitting his sides and snagging on his suit. This prompted the space man to take a break. He stacked the boxed and sat on them.  
 ""A lovely view,"" he quietly told himself. While looking at Earth, on one of the grayest hillsides of the Moon. But he couldn't rest for long, as a nagging feeling of having forgotten something surfaced slowly in the back of his mind. He asked himself several questions. Some of them being -    
 ""Early lunch today?""  
 ""Did I write my report?""  
 ""Is it date night?""  
 He pondered for a while, when he suddenly, as quickly as one can in a space suit, stood up and yelled - ""Air?! Do I have enough air?!""  
 The space genius checked his statistics on the wrist display. At that moment, from the corner of his eye, he noticed a shift of tones had happened. Where the blue ball of the Earth had been; was a shattered mess, blue not included. A trail of ice from a comet glistening red from the molten rock.  
 The man sat back down on the boxes. Heavier than any man ever had on the moon. An attempt was made to rest his head on his hand, but the range of motion of his suit did not allow it. So he just sat there, hunched in disbelief.  
 ""The comet struck early.."" he whimpered for a moment, followed by an instant realization - ""I can see it in 8k slow motion once I get back!""  
 He was filled with anticipation and couldn't wait to get back to home base. But this man had still one turn in this emotional roller coaster. His radio started to loudly broadcast static, which slowly turned into a clear voice.  
 ""*John, John, John. Do you hear me John? You better not be sleeping somewhere. John come in.*""  
The space man John regained his feeling of having forgotten something. If you're wondering - It wasn't the Earth being destroyed. There was something else. It was creeping up on him, but first he had to reply.  
""This is John. I'm on my way Berma.""  
""*Okey. Hurry up. Since the Event happened they are about to fire engines 1 to 256 on the ex-Earth side of the Moon.*""  
John picked up his boxes and started to prance across the moonscape, when he noticed the dust on the boxes and he knew then what it was that he had forgotten. The radio spouted static again.  
""*Oh and John, you better not have ruined those samples with dust.*""

[IP] Well $#!&amp;,unstable_supernova,"“Oh my God,” Commander Jeremy Hall whispered. “Oh fuck!”  

“Say again, Commander Hall,” a dry male voice replied. “What are you seeing? We just lost contact with Earth.”   

“That’s because Earth is gone!”  

“What? Say again?”  

“Earth, damn it! Something just – it tore the planet in half!”   

The projectile smashed through the far side of Earth and dragged crust and glowing mantle far into space. Oceans disappeared behind a thick cloud of steam. Gray ash spread across the remains of the planet’s surface. Jeremy dropped his sensor and fell to his knees, barely aware of alarms blaring in his suit. He heard rustling and cursing through his earpiece from Lunar Colony, and then a familiar voice.    

“Jeremy, this is Liz. Get back here now, do you hear me?”  

The blast expanded slowly – all of Earth was covered in molten ash. The glowing white projectile spun away from the dead planet as if nothing had happened at all.   

“Jeremy, they’re locking down. They’re sealing the tunnel!”   

*Silvia’s dead,* he thought, staring at the churning mass. *I never got to see my son.*   

“Jeremy, please answer me,” Liz shouted into his earpiece. “You have less than fifteen minutes!”    

Commander Hall lurched to his feet. Most of him wanted to rip off his helmet. “It’s seventeen minutes back to base.” He shook his head. “Seal it.”   

“Fuck that,” she said. “Get your ass in that rover and drive – that’s an order!”   

He stared at the expanding remains of Earth. The molten ash and steam. For them at least it’d been quick. Jeremy shut his eyes and turned away.    

The rover bumped and flew over fine sand and small boulders. Hours ago, Jeremy had laughed at how high he was able to bounce. Now, every time the rover left the ground, he grit his teeth and cursed. Earth crowded his periphery. Or perhaps his mind simply refused to release the image.    

The shockwave tossed the rover forward. Fresh alarms blared in his ear. The rover tumbled end over end but somehow landed on its wheels. Jeremy gripped the roof to steady himself and stared through the window. He was facing Earth again – the molten cloud larger and closer than before. Fuck – they were deluding themselves. Jeremy pressed the accelerator and spun back to Lunar Colony.     

Three thousand people called Lunar Colony home. Twenty thousand lived on Mars. The remains of civilization – of all life. Those in the space stations were dead by now. He drove the rover into the wide cavern at full speed and slammed on the breaks. Liz’s pale face stared at him through the airlock. Yellow lights spun overhead and the airlock door swung open.    

Jeremy began shedding his suit before he was through the second door. The wide chamber was dark save a few blinking alarms and computer monitors. Where’d that projectile come from? It wasn’t a comet or meteor; it’d punched through Earth without even slowing down. “Where’s General Hammond?”    

“In the bunker.” Liz grabbed Jeremy by his arm. “They’ve turned off the elevators. We’ll have to climb down.”  

A second shockwave struck the base, far stronger than the first. The stone surrounding them rippled like a quake. The sound was deep and rumbling and Liz stared at Jeremy an instant before they were both knocked off their feet.    

Rock and ash rained down on their heads. Liz crawled to a nearby monitor and stared at the screen. “Impact five miles east. More incoming. God – there are thousands of them.”   

Jeremy pulled her to her feet. A long, bloody scratch crowned her forehead. “This wasn’t an accident, Liz.”   

She stared at him. “What?”   

“What happened to Earth was deliberate.”     

“But who…why?”

"[WP] A few hundred years after immortality has been achieved, you're selling a new luxury... death.",yohohoandadietcoke,"I stared into a Puddle, was the first puddle I had seen in Years. I wondered how this substance had accumulated to form such a beautiful Mirror. Puddles had been long gone almost extinct I thought to myself..I Chuckled.

Tesla had developed a whole New Eco system, nobody ever asked where the rain went or the sun or the rainbows or the life. it almost happened overnight. it crept upon us like a thief and stole our humanity, our fire, our drive and inhibition. we were like butterflies that returned to a cocoon to come out as centipedes, our flight and colour was taken.

A Tesla car splashed through the puddle and drenched me I laughed, I must have looked crazy, with in minutes a Dyson approached me. ""oh dear sir I am sorry, I am terribly sorry here let me dry that for you. good grief"". I sighed. ""No its fine please leave me"" 

""But Sir I insist it simply...""

I turned and left. I headed for a bar. I was depressed, trapped on a planet where I could not Love and I could Not leave. I often read books written by mortals Hundreds of years ago, some described a fear of death, a fear of entering the void of the unknown falling into the arms of the abyss. I romanticised this idea I yearned for the feeling of the unknown. to me all was known all that was and to be was in front of me I ached for a new experience, but I was a coward.

I was approached at the usual spot, a small Gnarly Bar on Gloucester Rd. One of the few remaining bars that actually felt like a bar, it attracted the downbeat those who like myself felt they were being con'd. they felt that life was a stimulation they felt like they were on the Truman show and although they all felt this way ironically I felt as if this was one of the few remaining places that Elan Vital existed. 

Just as I was having this epiphany my customer croaked up ""I want what you have, what you offer and what you sell"" he sounded defeated and deflated he sounded how I felt. I replied carefully ""How do you know this is what you want?, and its what I have?"" I always made sure to keep steady eye contact I wanted to ensure I was selling my product to those who truly wanted it and needed it. He was hunched over he had glasses on (glasses he did not need as a result of genetic modification that gave everyone had 20/20 eye sight), perhaps they belonged to a relative, perhaps he had seen mortals that wore them in pictures and wanted to feel somewhat connected. he replied after a long pause.  ""I don't want to live in a world anymore of plastic people living plastic live's. I don't want to live in a world where people are so distracted they don't even realise there is no sun left in the sky. I don't want to work in a place where I do the same thing every day at the same time, I don't want routine. I want chaos, I want art, I want danger, and I want love. the mortals wrote of another place after this one and if it isn't so, then I wold much rather be exiled to an eternal sleep in a chasm of darkness than to merely exist in this stimulation.

I immediately handed him one dose of 'Dark Angel' and thanked him. he asked my why he was thanking me. I simply replied ""for giving me courage"".

"[WP] One morning, every human on Earth wakes up a hundred times stronger then (s)he was before",Bteatesthighlander1,"The first morning was an absolute disaster. Everyone in apartment buildings who usually slapped their alarm clocks instead ended up slamming bed stands through their floors onto their unfortunate downstairs neighbors. Children, many on the way to classes, who got into fights were seriously injuring each other. One homeless man in Chicago, obviously high out of his mind, went running on the highway, and police cars (the cops inside still hadn't gone to sleep- they were the night shift still, and thus their mutation hadn't yet manifested) couldn't catch him. 

The nature of the mutation was simple, scientists would later say. All that happened was that the myosin and actin fibers that make up muscle cells all spontaneously doubled in density, which exponentially increased strength (generally around 100 fold). Papers were published on the topic. The most popular theory to this day is that the sun had an undetected flare, which gave off a UV wavelength that affected the expression of two genes: melatonin and muscle proteins. The melatonin gene, which normally affected sleep, was active for that single night, and for a few hours afterwards before most healthy cells shut it down. The mutated melatonin molecules, however, amplified the mutated protein expressers, and permanently made them double output. 

Conspiracy theorists think it was an act of God, and of course cults sprang up about how aliens had done it.

It didn't matter what people thought- the scientists ended up being right, and our species was changed. The results were striking. The density change meant that people looked the exact same, but were significantly heavier now. At the same time, internal organs and other tissues were unaffected, so suddenly guns were almost obsolete- the human body was as frail and vulnerable as it was before, but now the damage it could cause was increased significantly. Bar fights became absolutely illegal, and domestic abuse became nearly unheard of, since those people on a hair trigger were almost guaranteed to kill their significant others if fights ever got physical. People had to change their mindsets.

Sports became obsolete for a long time. Tennis switched over to metal racquets- the strings became wire, and the ball's rubber was tripled in thickness. The size of the courts also tripled, as now even average athletes could reach the balls at breakneck speeds. Other sports, like MMA fighting, died out for similar reasons bar fights did- people died too quickly. Bodybuilding lost it's following.

As the years passed society came to adapt. The environment came out on top from all of this- people running became faster than cars, and for a while cars became seen as the ultimate lazy escape, used only for trips that took excesses of time. Industrial machinery, safe for precision bots, were scrapped, since now workers could do the same things with their hands, for less electricity. It was a return to older times, and for a while things were good.

Ten years later, the mutation began to degenerate. And everything changed.",wpphilosopher

[WP] You are a murderer who has hidden under somebody's bed waiting for them to fall asleep. The problem is that they're an insomniac.,CourseIStillLoveYou,"""Goddammit!"" he thought, listening to the woman toss and turn above him. ""This chick is just not going to sleep. All the planning, the setup, it's all going to go to waste."" 

John was laying down, hidden, waiting for his prey to go to sleep. This was the part he hated the most and loved the most. There was delicious anticipation, listening to the person (well lady, it was always a lady) fall asleep, their last conscious movements becoming slower and more peaceful, their breathing slowing, sometimes even a little sigh. The sigh was the best, instant arousal for him. The breathe was the most important part to listen to, not only since it gave him an idea of the level of consciousness, but also since it was the thing he intended to stop.

At the same time, this was when he was at his most vulnerable, and he really did not like being vulnerable. Under the bed with limited movement, no sight and muffled sounds, if he was discovered he would not be able to get out quickly enough to restrain the owner of the bed. His only option would be to run. That was unacceptable. He hated giving up on his prey once chosen. 

The process was a lengthy one, not only did it need to be a woman, but one with no roommates, no pets. He preferred them attractive but that wasn't a deal breaker. He loved the sight of a sleeping helpless woman so much that he had never found one not attractive. Maybe attractive was not the right word, alluring would be better. Once those initial criteria was set he had to get to know the woman, first arranging a chance meeting at a bar or a movie theater. He was reasonably good looking and could fake affability pretty well. The first meeting, then usually a second accidental bump into, then the exchange of numbers. 

Texting was easiest for him, it was communication that didn't require the effort to fake body language. He could be humorous without having to plaster on a smile, he could be self-deprecating without having to throw in a shrug or arm wave, the advent of texting was a game changer for him. Texting still required him to put up a false front, it just wasn't so exhausting as face to face communication. The other bonus was that it allowed him to have multiple conversations at once, setting up the next prospect to be ready as soon as he was finishing his current project.  Efficiency was something he truly appreciated.

Once texting communication was established, he would get to the woman. Find out some life details, maybe a secret from the past or an embarrassing story, it didn't really matter too much, he just liked the idea that he knew the person he was going to kill. He wanted to know the mind before he helped it go to sleep permanently.

After listening to the body of the woman above him toss and turn for over an hour he decided to take a chance. He slowly reached his hand down and pulled his phone out of his pocket. He had already silenced not only the ringer but all sounds of the phone. He found the name Jessica in his contact list. He sent a message.

""Hey, you up?""

He heard the chime above him as her phone received the signal. The weight on the bed shifted above him as she reached for her phone. He heard the clicking of the responsive keyboard as she typed her reply. 

""Hey! I was just thinking about you. Yeah I'm up. When are you going to get me that drink you promised me?""

""Lol I believe you owe me the drink! You lost the bet, you gotta pay up. :)""

He heard her breathe a little louder out her nose. Good, a chuckle. The conversation continued back and forth. He was hoping to have just a relatively short conversation, maybe encourage a state of relaxation, get her to fall asleep shortly after signing off. But the conversation continued. He began to realize that he actually was enjoying himself. This didn't usually happen. Usually the more he got to know a woman the more insipid he found them until there really was no option left other than to kill them. He was starting to think he really liked this woman. They texted for the better part of an hour.  Finally she texted a closing remark.

""This has been fun, but I've got to try to get some sleep before tomorrow. I'm going to go take a bath, see if that will get me to go to sleep. Text me tomorrow, ok?""

The weight of the mattress shifted again as she sat up then got up and walked into the bathroom. He could hear the sound of the bathtub filling. He thought for a while. About what he was doing, about his conversation with her.  When he thought of killing her, it honestly made him a little sad. This was so unusual for him it took a while to sink in. 

""Do I actually like this woman?"" He thought to himself. ""I'd actually like to keep talking to her.  On the other hand, once she's relaxing in the tub, I could just go in and hold her under. A different method but could be interesting.""

He heard the water stop as the tub filled. He listened to the sounds of her getting in the water and sitting down. Finally he came to a decision. For the first time he was going to willfully give up on a prey. He'd text her tomorrow.

He thought ""We'll just see where this goes. Besides I can always just kill her later.""  He mentally went through the his list of next prospects and their status. Ah, Amanda was next and ready to go. He typed back to Jessica.

""Hope you get some rest. I'll text you tomorrow night, it might be a bit late, I've got an important meeting."" He slowly slid out from under the bed and made his way to the door.",BobRobertsonismyname

"[WP] You are immortal, but you happened to miss every important event in history.",JamesTheLemonKiller,"I've always had the shittiest luck.

As far back as I can remember, it seems that I always *just* miss the exciting things, the incredible things, the wonderful things.

You might be thinking, ""Well, you're immortal, so you really shouldn't be bitching.""

Now you may be right about that, but who doesn't need to bitch every now and then?  And, as luck would have it, you're the only one I can bitch to at the moment, so shut your mouth and open your ears.  I've got a story to tell.

My shit luck has been my constant companion since my earliest memories.  I remember playing with some of my little friends when I was a wee thing, the last time I *had* friends, come to think of it...

Anyway, the first clear memory I have is of running with my friends across a grassy field, pretending we were our fathers, stalking the mighty tusk-beast.

We were kids, playing a pretty common kid's game, but we were hunting a particularly fearsome beast on this day; this beast had been spotted a few times over recent years, but there were more than a few in our tribe who scoffed at those who claimed to have caught sight of it.  This beast was half common knowledge, half legend at this point.  Most said they didn't believe in the beast, but I think deep down each of us questioned the sincerity of our denials.  How could we believe such a beast existed?  How could we not?

It was said to be over three men tall, if you stacked them on top of each other.  It was said to be as broad as eight men, standing shoulder to shoulder.  It was said to have tusks so big, a man couldn't wrap his arms around the thickest part, and couldn't reach the sharp end if he was standing on the base.  Who could believe in such a beast?

But somehow, we all did.  We scoffed to others, and we teased anyone who wasn't eager to journey outside the ring of light cast from the fire in the evening, saying they must be scared of the great tusk-beast.  We talked a big game, but let me tell you - we believed all the same.

Now, where was I?  Right, so we were chasing the great beast, flaunting our bravery and strength and speed.  Well, the damnedest thing happened - we actually found a tusk from the great beast!

You might say to yourself, ""Well now, I thought you were talking about your shitty luck?  Finding that tusk must have been a pretty great experience!""

And you'd be right again, but wait til you hear how we found it.

The field was wide and grassy, with little in the way of hills or humps or hummocks, and we had run through this field hundreds of times with nary a fall.  But on this day, we just so happened to find evidence of the beast, solid proof of the giant tusked animal's existence.  And what was this proof?

A giant footprint.

Well, actually, a giant *set* of footprints.  I only noticed the one, though, because that's the footprint I tripped over.

It turns out those people that claimed to see the great tusk-beast may not have been exaggerating after all... or, at least, not much.  The footprint was more than a forearm's length deep, and the raised edge is what I tripped over.

I heard a *SNNAAAAP* sound, and suddenly white-hot pain flared up in my right ankle.  That's right - I broke my damn ankle tripping over the damn tusk-beast's footprint!

I didn't have too much time to think about my ankle though.  As I tripped, my newly broken ankle gave out completely and I fell lopsidedly, right onto the side of my head.  Thankfully, I didn't feel that one so much - until I woke up, anyway.

When I regained consciousness, I was in our camp again with my friends and the old people gathered around me.  My friends said that just beyond where I fell, they found the tusk of the beast!  That's right, the actual tusk of the (aptly named, as we now knew) great tusk-beast.  I may have found the footprint, but that was nothing compared to the tusk.  And I missed it.

I guess the tusk was too heavy for them to carry back to the camp, and besides, they had their hands full just carrying *me* back to the camp.  We told the old people about the footprints and the others swore up and down that they found the tusk, but it took a day of some real earnest convincing to get them to believe us.  By the time they took our story seriously enough to go check it out, a hard rain had fallen and it must have wiped the footprints away, because we could never find them again, the footprints OR the tusk.

We had finally found proof of the great tusk-beast.  We found not only a couple of footprints, but the actual *tusk* of the beast!  And I missed it.  Now whoever heard of tripping, breaking an ankle, and getting knocked out cold over a footprint?  A footprint, for god's sake!

Now, that's just an example, but I think it's a pretty good example.  My whole life has been full of shit luck, and that was just the start.

Sure, I was there when we discovered fire.  You know how it was discovered?  A bolt of lightning hit someone and they caught on fire!  Can you guess who was hit?  I bet you can.  Knocked me right out, didn't even know what had happened until after I woke up again.

Oh, and that Caesar-Brutus scuffle?  I was there too!  I was standing right next to Caesar, in fact.  I should have had a front row seat to one of the most well known incidents in ancient history, but you know what happened?  The first guy to pull a knife got a little too eager, you know how guys can get when they feel full of that self-righteous anger, and before he put the first wound in Caesar, he reeled back his arm and smacked me right in the face with his elbow!  Isn't that just the damnedest thing?  I fell like a sack o' potatoes and didn't come around until after Caesar's body had already been carted away.

And don't even ASK me about Newton and the apple.  You know why that apple fell?  I bet you're getting the idea now, aren't you?  Yep, I was climbing that apple tree and lost my footing right at the top.  I took a tumble through the branches, fell on my head, and got knocked cold out, then *PLOP* - out falls the apple, right onto Isaac's noggin.

Every important event, every significant occasion, every goddamn interesting thing that ever happened - I always *just* missed it.  I don't know whether I'm cursed by whatever gods may or may not frolic up there in the sky or if I'm just the most unlucky son of a bitch the world has ever seen, but I guess it doesn't really matter either way.  At least I got a chance to tell someone about it.

Now that wasn't so bad, was it?  I don't profess to be some great storyteller, but I thought my tale was at least halfway decent.  Wouldn't you agree that I have just about the most shit luck anyone has ever had?",NoOrdinaryRabbit19

"[WP] By no rights should this number work, and yet it responds to your texts.",MustachioEquestrian,"Collin walked out of the mental health institute with a huge smile on his face. Two months ago he had been diagnosed with severe dementia and he had been miraculously cured. He got an uber and cheerfully returned to his old house. He found his phone where he left it before he was taken to the hospital. His notifications informed him that he had gotten an email from a local news company wanting to interview the man who impossibly overcame his dementia. He said that he'd be happy to do so; he was in too good of mood to say no. 
   Collin thought for a while about the days before he was treated, he remembered how he used to text his own number and have conversations with himself. When he texted himself he'd usually receive the same thing he sent a few seconds later. Collin chuckled to himself and texted himself ""goodbye!"" However in after a few seconds instead of receiving the same message, he got a text saying ""but Collin we were such great freinds."" Collin stopped terrified, had he imagined being cured, was it all a dream. ""Oh it wasn't a dream"" it texted. ""Who are you"" Collin asked. ""That is not of any importance"" it replied. Collin tried to reply but the screen was wet with his own sweat. He put the phone down on the coffee table and closed his eyes trying to think about what was happening, but he was interrupted by the ringing of the door bell. Collin answered the door and found that it was his friend Scott. Scott hugged Collin and told him how much he'd missed him.
  Collin and Scott talked for a while which made Collin feel a little better about what had happened, however Collin knew he had to tell someone about the texts and Scott was the only person he trusted. Scott looked very worried when Collin told him, but when he showed him the messages Scott looked like he was desperately trying to read a language he did not know. ""This is insane"" said Scott. Collin's phone buzzed, the message read ""you wanna know what's really insane? Collin a couple weeks ago! amaright guys?"" At this point Scott was terrified, and he left telling Collin that they'd have to have an official welcome home party soon. 
    Once again Collin was alone with the phone. Collin felt he had to talk to the phone to find out more about it. He started by asking how it had responded to them while they were talking. The phone buzzed ""I can pick up basic thought, but I'd prefer you to text me because it's much easier to understand."" ""Earlier you said we were such great friends but I've never met you."" Collin texted back. ""Ugh why do you have to ask so many questions. Can't we just talk like old times?"" it texted. ""Who are you"" Collin texted, he knew that the message would appear to have no emotion but Collin felt like the phone would understand the frustration behind it. ""Ooo we've got a fiesty one don't we"" it said. Collin only got angrier. Things went on like this for a while, the phone would taunt him and Collin would only get madder. Frustration turned to anger, anger turned to furry, furry turned  to wrath. This went on until Collin was texting utter nonsense. ""GENGSHhhGHHSVhjkivwkPPH)/$/?/)/9.SUBSBhhsvhuoqpp!!!!!!!!"" Collin texted, and before the phone could reply collin would send another line of angry gibberish. Eventually Collin was randomly stabbing the phone with his fingers and makeing animal sounds. Someone knocked on Collins door but he ignored it. ""This is the police, open up"" said the man knocking. The man waited a while and decided it was time to break down the door, this broke Collin out of his trance. Collin looked around. His house was a mess, all what was once semi tidy was now flung everywhere, the floor was covered in feces and urine while the damaged walls were painted with blood and puke. He was in even worse condition, he had grown a messy beard, and his stomach was caved in due to being malnourished. Collin looked at the clock and saw that he'd been texting the thing for several weeks. He looked down at his phone and saw that he hadn't received any new messages since the day he got out of the mental hospital. He also found that someone plugged his phone in for him, and on the charging outlet was a sticky note that read ""dear Collin, thought I'd plug this in for you, fell better soon!""",Emanon_401
"[WP] Not one to shy away from a formal duel, you calmly board the railcar.",MustachioEquestrian,"He was there waiting for me. Sun Tzu wrote to get to the battle field first and Musashi had the stradegy to make them wait, he had choosen to go with Sun Tzu. He was calm, standing on one end of the empty railway car. I stopped in front of him, less than eight paces away. 
""You came""
""I never back down from a duel."" 
""Shall we then?""
He smiled, ""Let's""

We sat down and I drew my hand. I had a lot of powerful monsters. It was his turn first. ""I lay a trap card and put Stone Soldier in defense position.""
A good opening move. Sun Tzu suggested to first make yourself unconquerable. I played Time Wizard and Dragon Piper, two low level monsters. The battle slowly picked up. He traded in his stone soldier for a stronger monster and blasted away at my dragon piper. The low level monsters we started with slowly turned into higher monsters as the battle increased. I played the Blue Eyes white dragon, but just as I put it down he smiled. ""You activated my trap card! I play black hole and destory your Blue Eyes!"" The battle raged on, him slowly chipping away at my life points, always thrawting my plans to put out some powerful players. Everytime I put something down he took it away. There was one monster I didnt have to put down though, Exodia. 

I had taken great measure to acquire Exodia in preperation for this duel. I had three of his parts in my hand, but I was running out of time. My life points were slipping away and he was becoming more bold in his attack. I drew my next card; the head, my fourth piece! I tried to contain my excitement but he saw it. It took him a second but then he figured it out. ""You've been keeping the same cards in your hand this whole time, looks like someone is looking for Exodia. You're not going to get it in time"" He was right, my life points were running out and his monsters were becoming more powerful, able to do more damage. 

I was down to 50 life points and it was my turn. This was it. I needed to draw exodia right now or I'd be finished. The game had gone on long enough so my deck was pretty small at this point. Luckily I had something he didn't have, the heart of the card. I placed my hand on my deck and focused all my love and friendship there. If this game had taught me anything it was that friendship defeats all, even cyclopes multimillionares using Egyptian magic. I closed my eyes and drew my last card. Just as I was about to open them.....SWOOSH. A giant gust of wind came through the open door and blew the whole game away. Cards were scattered everywhere, littered all over the floor of the abondon train yard. My opponenent let out a deep sigh and fell back onto the floor.

The small woman shouted something in their language and the men shuffled further away from the food.  One young man stared at the fresh food and licked his lips.  His superior struck him in the back of the head.

""It would be a better shot if we had people actually getting their daily rations,"" Susan suggested.

""No.""

""Can we go to where the crops are grown by the people?"" Susan asked.

""No. We will go to parade,"" the small woman shouted a command and a group of workers in grey overalls began putting food into crates and tearing down the stalls.  The film crew was then lead to a wide street lined with aluminum bleachers.  Men, women, and children sat holding small flags waiting for the parade to begin.

""This parade marks anniversary of Great Ruler, he will show his military strength to remind the people,"" the translator said.

""Remind the people of what?""

""You watch,"" she answered.

Trumpets blared and drums thundered.  Men in crisp uniforms began to march down the street, their feet perfectly in step to the drums.  The audience cheered as the men marched by, pride clear on their faces.

""It is great honor to be soldier,"" the translator said with a smile.

Then vehicles slowly rolled behind the men.  Massive missiles pointed toward the sky.  The camera man nudged Susan and beckoned her over.

""Look at the vehicles, I swear they are made of cardboard,"" he whispered to her.

She looked through the camera and saw the thin green paint and the unmistakable pattern of cardboard underneath.  The missiles were cardboard, the armor was cardboard.  Jesus, everything was cardboard! 

""We've got to tell somebody,"" she whispered.

""Tell them what?"" the translator asked behind them.  Two soldiers lowered their guns at the film crew.

""Tell them how impressive your arsenal is.  America the fools don't think you have this capability.  They will tremble in fear when they see this footage,"" Susan said with her best reporter smile.

""Yes...yes...very good then,"" the translator waved the soldiers away and resumed watching the parade.

The parade ended with a speech from the Great General.  It was a rousing speech of nationalism and pride.  Every audience member cheered and applauded exactly when they were supposed to.  With the conclusion of the speech everyone began to leave and return to their homes.  

The film crew was escorted on to a small bus and was driven back to the airport.  Susan looked out the window and saw a small child with a stick chasing an emaciated dog.  She clubbed the dog in the head and dragged it away.

""What do you think of our great country?"" the translator asked.

""I think everyone will see how great it is soon enough,"" Susan said with a sad smile.

[WP]Winnie the Pooh was never tricking the bees. The bees recognized his addiction and pitied him.,chocolate_mussolini,"Two bees stood next to each other as they stood in front of their hive, standing guard against any creature wanting to pilfer their honey.  
  
""He's back,"" one of them said as she squinted and saw a yellow dot on the horizon.  
  
""That poor fellow,"" her partner said with a sigh. ""I'm starting to think we should hold an intervention for him.""  
  
""Have you gone mad?"" the first bee's eyes widened as she asked her partner with a gaping mouth. ""I know you saw him eat one of those pink critters when they asked him to stop; you were with me. Now the last pink creature is always terribly anxious.""  
  
""But it's our fault for enabling him!""  
  
""You mean for not killing ourselves in a feeble attempt to stop him that you know isn't even going to work?""  
  
""Yes. That is exactly what I mean. If our whole colony banded together and made it difficult for him to get his fix, then he'd have to stop.""  
  
""I'm afraid its too late for that. He completely destroyed the last colony he went to when they ran out of honey. For the sake of our children, we have to survive and produce more honey to avoid a similar fate.""  
  
""Honey..."" Winnie said as he staggered towards the hive on his hind legs. His eyes were bloodshot and his red shirt was inside out. ""Pooh wants honey...""  
  
""This is bad!"" one of the guard bees said. ""He's high! I don't think any hive can possibly hold enough honey to satisfy him when he has the munchies.""  
  
""I'm out of here,"" the other guard said as she flew away.  
  
""What about they children?""  
  
""They're not mine. It's impossible to get laid around here with all the males worshiping that strumpet anyway.""  
  
""You're right. It's not worth it,"" the remaining guard said before flying after the first one.",Lindyss

[WP] A heroin addict can see the future while she's under the influence. Friends and family continually take advantage of her gift even though it's rapidly killing her.,courtneylovesmerkin,"A little after eight she always waited before tightly tying the tethered belt around her boney arm; with eyes thirstier than her drying mouth which looked longingly at the haunting needle. It had been four hours following her last hit. The withdrawals were preceeding into ineffable nightmares more so than ever. Kohen, her trusted brother, had rustled together what was left of his overdraft to sustain his sisters rather unusual, yet perceptive addiction. 

She routinely closed her bloodshot eyes, gently singing 'I want to break free' as she pressed the tip of the syringe against cold, almost transparantly pale, skin. Within a moment the melancholic singing had stopped along with another missed heartbeat; misery mulled over into pure, inescapable bliss, but only momentarily before the visions had started to appear. 

""Y-Yes-!"" Kohen held his sisters hands within his own, embracing the demising girl for all she was worth. ""What do you see?""

Her pouty bruised lips parted to escape a simple sigh of relief, shortly followed by multiple convulsions all over her body. 

""Rosey?"" He asked again, this time more eagerly. 

""There's a light and a tunnel. Or, no... I think there's a light within a tunnel. Maybe it's more like a helix of light, eminating or... I'm not sure.""

""How does it feel?""

""It's warm. Not like here."" She convulses again.

Kohen, rather aggresively, begins to shake her out of this hazey daze. Her predictions before had been a lot more concise and had lead the family to victory in more than one field of their lives. A prophetic addiction, they called it. Unfortunately it meant that their sustaining of its powers was costing the family more than their net worth, which meant that options were continually fleeting. 

Kohen urged, ""I can't save the family business on my own, I need to know what to do next. I know - you know - what to do next!""  

Rosey opened her eyes, red with desire to rescue her family from the folly of the futuristic predictions she had layed upon them. To her dismay, Kohen was already lighting beneath a silver spoon to save her from the wave of withdrawal which would soon sweep away her clarity at seeing the future. 

""Kohen,"" she said rather slowly, ""I don't want to go any closer to this light.""

""Helix is a good sign, it shows design. It is in our genetics."" He continued to press the matter. ""What else can you see?"" 

""A window."" She closed her eyes once more, tightening her grasp on reality as best as she could, desperately fleeing away from the visions. As the spoon heated, heroin bubbled into a brownish brew-like concoction, as though it were medicine being prepped for an ill child. Rosey exhaled one final time as the lighs radiance domineered; steering her away from the abusive loved ones that so achingly awaited the answers that would no longer come.

[WP] A heroin addict can see the future while she's under the influence. Friends and family continually take advantage of her gift even though it's rapidly killing her.,courtneylovesmerkin,"Bound in chains, Susan squirmed as Father struggled finding a new vein. Her arms were laden with scabs and scars from the constant injections. Her skin loosely clings to her bones as if it has been draped over her skeleton. Susan laid trapped in her solipsistic prison, kept in a perpetual state of solitude, sustained only after giving Father the correct results.

Father had to look in new places for a fresh vein. Mother never approved, however she would not dare object as Father owns the bank account. Father was a serial gambler, however until he discovered Susan's bizarre power he would simply waste the family finances on online poker. 

Susan can only see a few minutes into the future, so she couldn't predict the lottery results. Besides, that would only draw unwanted attention. Every day Father brought his laptop down into the basement, and asks for the results of various games. 

""We're playing roulette today, Sue. We've done this game before, don't let me down.""

Susan, as she has become accustomed to, began mumbling the winning numbers. Father never showed any concern for her wellbeing like Mother did, nor did he even so much as look at her face. Mother never saw firsthand what Father did, nor did she dare to ask. 

Father was grinning and rocking back and fourth, clasping his laptop is his dirty, hairy hands. ""Seven hundred quid, that should be enough for today"". 

Just as Father stood up to leave, Susan chuckled to herself. Despite his lack of concern for how she feels, he knew she had no reason to laugh. 

""The fack are you laughin' at?""

Susan burt into hysterical laughter, her bed rocked as she laboured for air.

""You better fackng' stop that, do you want all o' London to 'ear?""

Father gagged Susan's mouth, but she had no reason to struggle, she had foresaw everything that was about to happen. He reached for the needle, hoping to administer more heroin to calm her down. Just as he begin looking for a vein, he dropped the needle. 

Father fell to his knees, revealing Mother. She was stood behind him with her trusty fillet knife, the same knife she used to prepare dinner. Susan laughed through her gag, and Father fell onto his side. He tried to speak, but only blood poured from his mouth.",josh-and-that

Ugh. I hate coming to Sanctuary. All of the settlers just hammer random walls and Mama Murphy refuses to do anything except sit in her chair asking for drugs for her ""sight"". Maybe I'll give her some, she might shut up.

""Okay, Mama Murphy, have some Jet.""
""Thanks, kid""

I hand her a canister of jet out of my seemingly infinite pocket. She weakly pulls the canister to her face and uses it as an inhaler.

""I see it kid... a giant blimp.... hundreds of metal soldiers... some sort of giant robot.."", she grimaces in clear pain. ""That's all the sight can handle for now. The sight's telling me... Mentats this time.""

She's probably full of crap. Who's gonna have a working blimp post war? Or a giant robot? Oh well. She wants more drugs, she'll get some. I hand her a tin of mentats. How these make you smarter, and not your breath better, I'll never know. She opens the tin and hastily eats all of them.

""I see.... a man? Half-detective, half machine... it looks like he's... walking with you?"" She grabs her stomach as if she's in intense pain. ""Oh... Kid, the sight's telling me..."" She coughs violently ""it's telling me we need psycho..""

Huh. A robo-detective. Funny, because I'm supposed to be looking for a detective to help me find... someone? Oh I forget. It couldn't have been *that* important. Despite my better judgement telling me not to, I decide to give her more drugs. This sight stuff is pretty fun.

I start to hand her the needle, but Preston quickly runs over to stop me. Oh great. I bet another settlement needs *my* help, or even better, Abernathy's daughter was kidnapped for the *third* time this week.

""General, can't you see that Mama Murphy can't handle any more of this? She's an addict! She'll die if she injects any more of that crap into her body!""

""Well Preston, when you're right you're right"", I say with a sinister smile. 

I quickly stab the needle into Mama Murphy's arm, as Preston looks at me disgusted and shocked.

Mama Murphy looks at me in a daze, ""Kid, I see... some sort of bright light... a science lab of some sort? And some sort of... Father? He's your father? No, you're his father? And then... an explosion?"", she grabs her chest and starts coughing more violently than before. ""Kid... I need... I need...""

Mama Murphy suddenly fell out of her chair. All right! Now she'll stop whining about drugs and the future. Woo! But this stuff about a lab. And my father? Or my son? Wow, I wish I had a son. 

But suddenly, everyone is staring at me with a look equal parts disgust and horror.

""General... you.. you.. killed her... I told you not to give her drugs... and you did... now she's gone...""

""Oh well. It happens.""

Friends and family continually take advantage of her gift even though it's rapidly killing her.,courtneylovesmerkin,"Jackie entered her house, slouching and rubbing her eyes as she closed the door behind her. She felt so numb, so tired, and at the family reunion next weekend, it would only get worse. She'd seen it already.

What her gift hadn't showed, however, was the scene before her. Jackie slipped around the corner into her living room and jumped. In the lawn chairs, half-ruined couch, and even on the stained carpet sat nearly everyone she knew. Parents, siblings, and cousins, not to mention her closest friends. 

""What the fuck do you all want?"" Jackie grumbled, tossing her purse to the floor.

Uncle Robert, leaning against the far wall, peeled off like the greasy cockroach he was. ""Hey, kiddo. We've been waiting here a while now. Didn't know if you were going to show up.""

""Gee, didn't know if I was going to show up at my house?""

""Well you could've been passed out in some crack den,"" muttered Cousin Jenny under her breath. That bitch knew I heard her, judging by the sly smile twisting her lips.

A thought popped into my head, and for a moment, hope sprang to life in my breast. ""Is... is this an intervention?""

Uncle Robert guffawed. ""Oh, god no. That's almost the opposite of what we want.""

The hope shriveled and died, looking a little too much like her heart. ""Then what the hell do you want?""

Carol cleared her throat. That trashy whore was the one who got Jackie hooked on the stuff in the first place. Back in the days when they thought her glimpses into the future were laughable hallucinations. Now she was clean, and I was paying the price. ""He's being an ass. Really, we just want one more high out of you. One more, and then we'll all do everything we can to help you.""

Narrowing her eyes, Jackie said, ""What do you want?""

""Honey, as I'm sure you know, the hospital bills have been quite the financial burden,"" her dad began, speaking slowly and softly. He looked at Mom, whose wig wasn't fooling anyone. 

Jackie tapped her foot against the floor. ""So, what? You want me to see when she'll get better?"" *Or when the funeral will be?*

""There's... actually something else we wanted you to do,"" he mumbled. 

""Ah, let's just cut right to the chase."" Uncle Robert slicked back his thinning hair. ""The lotto's just shy of a billion dollars, and we want you to find out what the numbers are.""

Not surprised by his bluntness, she simply scoffed. ""We've tried this before, you know. More than a few times. The numbers are always so blurred, I can never read them properly."" Her glimpses were little more than that--glimpses. They were never wrong, when deduced correctly. The blurry visions couldn't always be reliable, though.

The sudden sound of locking made Jackie spin. Back at the front door, her Cousin Bobby stood before the entrance to her house. Only by the guilty glint in his eyes did she realize he wasn't blocking an entrance.

He was blocking an exit.

""We all pulled our money together,"" said Uncle Robert, stepping ever closer to Jackie. ""And our resources, to find the finest, purest heroin in the country. An ample supply, at that. Don't worry about getting the numbers all on your first high... because you won't be leaving until you get them all.""",ArenarKrex
[WP] A heroin addict can see the future while she's under the influence. Friends and family continually take advantage of her gift even though it's rapidly killing her.,courtneylovesmerkin,"""You’re killing me, you know."" she said with her raspy voice to her brother and her mom.

""Shut up and help us out. You’ll be fine. It’s not like you’ll die or anything"" her brother replied.

She was rapidly losing health, physically and mentally deteriorating. Her teeth were starting to fall out, and she was only getting a few hours of sleep each night. The heroin was destroying her, and her family didn’t care. They just wanted something that could help them out, like the lottery numbers or dating advice.

Inject, inject, inject.

Nobody really cared what she told them, as long as it was somewhat useful to them. Everyone could care less about her health, after all she was a gold mine, imagine what they could do with her ability. They could save millions of people, or make millions of dollars. Nobody knew exactly how she gained the ability, all they knew is that she had some heroin with some friends at a party, and she saw her father die in a car accident while under the influence. She passed it off as a hallucination, except it wasn’t. Two hours later, she got a phone call that her father had died from a drunk driver in a car accident. For her, it was a tragedy. She told her family what she had seen, and they instantly forgot about the passing of their father. All that mattered now was seeing the future.

Inject, inject, inject. That was all that mattered now. 

Her brother lashed out at her. ""Inject the friggin stuff already. We don’t have all day."" he screamed.

""Honey, your brother’s right. We need you to inject so we can see if we can get anything useful today."" her mother said.

She tried to convince her to stop the injections. ""Mom, please. Look at me. My hair is a mess, my teeth are falling out, I’m constantly tired, and I’m in pain. Why can’t you see what’s happening to me?!?""

""You’ll be fine, we can get you some painkillers and fake teeth if you help us."" her mom retorted.

""Fine."" She spat.

Inject, inject, inject. That’s all anyone cared about. Suddenly, she dropped to the ground screaming. The heroin had done it this time. It was becoming like poison in her veins, she was burning up. She stopped breathing. She was dead.

Hundreds of civilians made their way to their deck's gallery, a place once filled with the art of humanity and now filled with the wishes and hopes of the people on board the colony ship Phoenix; a massive super-ship that stretched thousands of miles long. They walked there from all over the ship. Only those with essential duties stayed in their areas, listening to the procession from the many monitors.

The bells rang again and the Prelate began their walk from the Sacred Room to the Gallery on the mid-deck, the largest of them all. There, the Chief Prelate stepped onto the podium and spoke to the people.

""People of Phoenix, praise to you,"" he said.

""And to the Herald,"" they replied in unison.

""Today, I am told that we are just weeks away from the Rejuvenated Land, a place that we have talked about for years and years. A place that is in the hearts and minds of the People of Phoenix, a place we seek to one day call our own.""

The Prelate spoke truly and deeply as his voice spread through the many galleries and corridors of Phoenix. ""Before our great journey began our world was but ash, fallen and destroyed by the hubris of man. *Two* great ships left our world seeking another. In that journey, our ship failed, but the other ventured onward.

""The Herald paved the way to the Rejuvenated Land, a world much like the one we left, beautiful and young, untouched and vibrant. The Herald charged forward into the unknown, years ahead of the Phoenix and built a new world, a better world."" The Prelate lifted his hand, ""The Phoenix rose from the ashes of the old world, our people repaired the great ship, made room for food and water, create life when there was none and began our journey to the Rejuvenated Land.""

Many people whispered thoughts of prayer that the Rejuvenated Land was what their ancestors had promised them for a thousand years.

""In the Herald's absence, we grew strong and together. The Phoenix bounded together under the Rejuvenation, under the water, under the food, under the fuel, and under the stars. And now, mere weeks away from that world, we stand together. Stronger now than ever.""

""Praise be the Phoenix.""

""Praise be the Phoenix! Praise be the Herald!""

""*Praise to the Rejuvenated Land!""

The fire cracked as J'lin threw another log onto the burnt-out logs. The fire had been dying out and J'lin had to travel more than five hundred yards for another piece of wood. He, and the other loggers, had missed part of the story, but the end was always his favorite part anyway. They threw their logs on to the fire and joined the rest of the tribe, who huddled tightly together.

""The Great Mother tells us of another,"" Chieftain Al'rev said loudly for his entire tribe to hear. He pointed to the horizon, where the Great Mother stood as a black mountain, torn and destroyed from years of war and hatred between the tribes. ""Another Great Mother, our Mother's sister, lives in the sky above, where the smoke rises and the great warriors of our world return when they die. Their souls guide the way for this Great Sister, just as the Great Warriors guided the way for ours.""

He circled the fire and rattled his Tribal stick, a six-foot long black metal beam that had been taken from the Great Mother, passed on from one Chieftain to another for generations. J'lin wondered if the beam was as heavy as they said, if only the worthy could truly lift it with ease.

""In our darkest hour, when our Mother fell to the dirt and created the Mountain, we banded together. Tribe after tribe,"" Al'rev said, shaking the beam, ""men and women and children ran to her, to our Great Mother in the Sky who had fallen so far and we realized, yes, all of us together that we had fallen farther. We had forgotten our ways, our past, and our traditions. In that, we lost our future.

""The story of the Great Sister spread far and wide, eventually it reached our Tribe, the Ol'waki. We were a peaceful Tribe, led by the great Z'waki thousands of years ago."" He pointed to the Mountain Mother, ""The Mountain Mother told him that the Great Sister would come here,"" he slammed his feet, ""on the ground where we stand. He led thousands across the Great Wastes, desolated by the Mother's Children and our Great Warriors.

""'Only the Great can pass the Wastes!' Z'waki shouted."" The drums started. J'lin loved the drums. ""'Only the Great can call the Great Sister'! Z'waki yelled as he rode through the Wastes. Thousands died. Thousands crossed. And Z'waki slammed his feet on the ground and yelled, 'Oh, come Great Sister to the Land Beneath! Come down to us and bring our Mother!'""

""Oh, come Great Sister to the Land Beneath!"" The tribe began to repeat as they had done every night for years. ""Come down to us and bring our Mother!""

Al'rev shook the beam in the air with two hands high above his head. ""Oh, come Great Sister show us the way! Bring Z'waki back from the Sky! Oh, come Great Sister lead us from the fray! Born again Z'waki, so we may deify!""

The ground shook as the tribe slammed their feet on the plains, the great wastes that they had lived in for so long. J'lin stood strong and proud and slammed his feet. Perhaps Z'waki would come to him tonight, he thought, perhaps he would lead his people from the fray.

Perhaps, the Great Sister would show him the way.

I sat with my family in the back, resting on the ancient brickwood of the pew, and tapping my fingers impatiently against the Holy Book of Destiny in my lap. My journal rested unused next to me, this sermon far too mismatched to take notes for anyway. 

I tapped my watch out of boredom, and its shimmering blue display emerged from a slit on the top. 11:24. I sighed at the unwanted revelation: the sermon had only been in progress for 9 minutes. I glanced sidelong at my family, trying not to attract attention to myself- the last thing I needed was Dad going off on me again for being distracted during church.

As usual, Dad’s hand was going a mile a minute through his notebook, probably capturing every nuance of the priest’s voice in his quaint, tiny cursive. His deep, brown eyes rarely left the priest, so I really had no idea how he was able to write like that. Better for him, I suppose. Mom was absently rubbing the bottoms of her shoes against the pew in front of us as she sifted through the Destiny, occasionally jotting down a bullet point in her journal. Funny, she’d probably warn me against rubbing my shoes like that, the church here was coming on 1700 years old, after all. Not a soul was allowed in the sanctuary any time other than morning service, and it scared me to think of the consequences of vandalism, accidental or not. My sister seemed just as bored as I was, but had taken to drawing small doodles in the corners of her pages, some of the doodles even venturing into the Destiny itself.

Losing interest in their activities, I decided to focus back on the priest. Maybe his sermon was becoming a bit more organized by now… 

He certainly seemed excited about whatever he was going on about, throwing his hands up as he proclaimed, “To Earth go the sinners in life, and to the mighty star Lucidum go those faithful to the Wanderers!”

“Blessed!” Called someone from the front of the church, an older man in sharp dress. 

“May the Wanderers find us and save us!” The priest continued, raising his Book high so all the congregation could see its broken leather. “Let us open to book of Esa, chapter 1.” He paused for a moment, taking a breath. “And this journey will be undertaken by thousands of men and women. Only the strongest, most able, most intelligent individuals will be selected to lead this journey to save the human race. Two massive ships shall set out and arrive in the orbit of Lucidum, and there find prosperous land to continue on survival of humanity, should they follow the detailed instruction within this book.”

The priest set the book down and addressed the crowd. “The Wanderers seek Lucidum, and will arrive there only upon following the commandments within this book of Destiny. They will find us too, and carry us there. Stay faithful. Always faithful.”

After considerably more rambling and singing, my clock finally read 12:00pm. I looked over at my family wearily, my sister immediately returning the look. Mom and Dad were talking quietly with one another as they put their materials away and stood up, finally ready to lead us out to the open air, and, hopefully, lunch.
My sister and I followed like ducklings, cutting through the crowd of people as we made our way through the church’s delicate structure and out through a massive, arched doorway to the clear, green skies beyond. I breathed deeply, glad to be out of that cooped space. The air was much fresher out here, and scented with the salty brine of the nearby ocean. 

“Where do you think Mom and Dad will take us to eat?” My sister sounded much perkier having finished church for the week. She beamed at me, her wavy, brown hair dancing in the wind. 

“I’d love a good bur-“ I slammed into the back of my dad before I could finish, almost toppling both me and him in the process. He reached back to steady me, apologizing quietly for having stopped so suddenly. By now, my mom and sister had both stopped as well, glancing at my dad curiously. 

Silently, he pointed up.

Far to the east, possibly even farther than the nearest island to ours, meandered a massive, gray object in the sky. It part through clouds with ease as it slowly eased its way closer and closer to the surface of our ocean-filled planet. “What is that?” I mumbled, not entirely sure I’d even said a word. Still, my dad must have heard. 

“It’s the Wanderers. It has to be.” A light filled his eyes and he nearly leaped for joy, my mom with him.

“They’re here to save us!” She sang out, her voice riling up anyone around to pay attention to the object if they hadn’t already. Soon, the whole church congregation was calling out in celebration. People screamed blessings and welcomes, and I was pretty sure I heard a couple of stray curses around too. For certain, everyone’s eyes were on the ships. Even those who had already loaded their waterpods had stepped out to see this giant beast of an airship in the sky.
I watched with uncertainty in my stomach as several smaller ships broke free of the massive ship and began descending to any available surface they could find. Was it true, then? Were these really the Wanderers here to save us?

And then, somewhere deep in my heart, I wondered. Have I been faithful enough to go with them?

They finally meet.",whereismypizzagoing,"The Followers had lived on Futura for 80 generations since landing the ES-2.  They had accumulated an impressive fossil record of the Leaders, but had yet to determine what had killed them off, or why the time lag between the landings had been so much larger than projected.  Earth Seed 1 should have preceded them by twenty years, but Leader culture was proven to be over two hundred thousand years old.  Not only had their predecessors flourished, they had stripped the planet's surface of readily mined resources.  Worst of all, they left it with no historical expectation of Earth Seed 2.

It was positively incapacitating for the immigrating generation.  They had grown up on a dying earth and taken a one-way trip to a better place, expecting to be welcomed heartily as the next generation of wives, husbands, and workers.  Instead, they had to cope with the reality of scraping out an existence on Futura by themselves.  The trip was supposed to be instantaneous, and appeared to be so from the memories of the zero gen and ship analysis.  But an eternity had passed.  The first hundred years were so bleak, the community eventually fractured and created religions around the Leader mythos.  Those that stayed true to the science knew better than to idolize.  The Leaders had acted just like our ancestors had on Earth.  When it became apparent that ES-2 would not arrive, they played out the planet just the same way.  As though it was theirs for the taking.  As though no one would come after.

Clay knew better than to go down to the large hall for the sermon.  He knew better than to give up science for faith.  He knew the Leaders were wasters, and he would not celebrate them.  Followers had done their best, and in almost 1700 years had only scrounged enough food for a baseline population of a few thousand people.  He turned to the southern dust fields and walked out for some me time.  Thirty minutes out, he noticed the shadow.

Shielding his eyes from the sun while trying to see that which was partially eclipsing it, Clay stood rooted for over a minute, then decided the thing was large enough that he really didn't want to risk being crushed.  He ran as hard as he could, trying not to look up, occasionally failing, never slowing.  An impact sent him flying.  It wasn't that the ground knocked him upwards.  The ground simply fell away and then returned.  By that time, he was falling into it pretty hard.

Clay Briston scrambled up as fast as he could, looking at a spaceship the size of a city, terminating approximately ten meters from his face.  A vertical line appeared in the nearest structure, and widened to show itself to be a bay door.  Five seconds later, the doorway was a thousand meters wide, and a familiar vessel was moving towards Clay.  He had seen it in the museum, but couldn't understand what it was doing here.  It was the Earth Seed 2, the ship that second gen Followers had taken to Futura.  Then he saw the markings on the side of the craft.  ES-1.  A thousand impossible thoughts vied for attention in Clay's mind as the nearest hatch opened.

A blond man walked up to Clay, and spoke without waiting.

""My name is Ersten Fitz.  Do you speak English?""

""I do.  My name is Clay"" said Clay, and they could both see the wonder reflected in each other eyes.

The man smiled at Clay and wept silently for a moment, then gave a wave to the massive craft that had delivered the ES-1.  Immediately, ports opened and large walkways extruded from the sides.  Already, hundreds of people were walking down them towards the ground.

""I am the Captain of the ES-1.  As you may have surmised, we had technical difficulties.  Our warp approacher was crippled, and we had to eke out the last seventeen hundred years more or less manually.  Over the generations, my ancestors built this craft for the growing ES-1 population, which was never designed for families.""

Clay looked at him with an open mouth, utterly incapable of response.

""But tell me how rich Futura is, after all, you are our Leaders.  And we need you now more than ever.  Clay, I tell you honestly, I have brought fifty thousand hungry workers to this great planet!  I now relinquish my leadership role, we have no need for a Captain!""

The first patient to receive the cure just got the bandages removed...and immediately starts screaming, pointing at seemingly nothing, flinching from mere shadows. Same happens to every other treated person too.",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"History was about to be made, and Dave Clark was going to be there to report it. This was his big break, all those years toiling away working shitty desk jobs at small town newspapers and chasing stories to make chump change for what he should be getting paid hundreds of thousands more for. But it's funny how plans turn out, Dave thought. He works his ass off day in and day out only to find that the chance that will finally get him where he wants to go is given by complete and utter failure.

Dave had been hot on a lead on this story in LA about some psycho killer who would drown people in their own kitchen sink with their own blood. Real fucked up stuff. There had been no connection in the cases when Dave first started reporting on it until, one day, when he was at the crime scene, he overheard some cops talking about how the killer somehow killed these people but never broke in or left any fingerprints. Dave didn't believe in God but that day he had some sort of God given sense to look into plumbers in the area, because who else works on sinks and could just walk in the house? It seemed damn obvious but it had been worth the shot. Dave had linked plumbing work to all the locations where the killings had gone down from the same person. He knew this wasn't a coincidence and immediately sold the lead to the LA Times for them to publish and to make a quick buck. Everything was going great until there was a knock on the door and a plumbing truck outside his house unexpectedly. Later, Dave was told he killed the guy in self defense but had suffered critical wounds and blood loss from repeated stabbings, with, of all things, a screwdriver. But all that didn't matter because the next thing Dave knew he was in the hospital, somehow alive and in the hands of one of the best doctors in the country, James Marshall. 

Everything about James Marshall screamed genius to Dave, his slicked back hair, his clean glasses, and perfectly trimmed beard, the clipboard he carried around full of numbers and other important genius things. He was always dressed in a sharp white lab coat and wore a thousand times polished name tag where you could see your face in the reflection, right behind the bold letters of JAMES MARSHALL. Anyways, the guy told him that he was very lucky to be alive and all that jazz and that he would make it out alive if he stuck the the treatment that they gave him. Well, the treatment went great but what even Marshall couldn't have predicted was that they would become friends. Going in for checkups and status reports Dave and James really hit it off and Marshall finally gave Dave the break he was looking for. He told him about it only because Marshall felt bad about the outrageous medical bills Dave would have to pay and wanted to help his newfound friend out. It turns out that Marshall had found a cure for blindness with a 100% success rate. Not only was the guy a genius but he was also Jesus, some people just have it so good. Anyways the mass public wasn't aware of the breakthrough and they were going to publish the findings after the first trial was completed. Marshall invited Dave to break the story. 

So here Dave was. Behind a glass observatory, standing amongst doctors way too smart for him to even be in the same room as them, and lucking his way through life. He was about to witness the first of five people's blindness cured through an experimental ""shock"" treatment. To Dave it just looked like a bunch of wires and electricity but he was told it was science and it would work so he believed it and just took notes. Who was he to argue anyways? The guy was blindfolded and strapped down to a table parallel to the ground. Dave looked over to Marshall, wearing his clean lab coat and glasses, standing next to the switch he would flip to get the whole party started. Some guy gave a thumbs up and Marshall flipped the switch, and it began. He heard a whir as the machine spinned up and the patient's body straightened up like a plank. The body started to shake up and down and it looked like the man was break away from the straps holding him down on the table and fly away or some shit. Piercing screams started erupting from the guy who looked like he was about to explode he was shaking so much, but the machine stopped, and everything was quiet. People stared in anticipation as Marshall approached the poor guy and said a few things. He undid the straps and told him to stay still. It was time. The big reveal. Marshall reached over to the blindfold and slowly lifted it off. The guy sat up and looked around saying nothing at first. And then he said it. ""I can see"". The three words sent everybody into cheers. The scientists around Dave whooped and hollered and Marshall turned around to look at the glass mirror and saw everyone cheering and gave a huge smile. Everyone seemed to forget about the guy on the table for a second, and in that second, all hell broke loose. Another scream, this time not of pain, but of fear. All the cheering stopped as the patient pushed past doctor Marshall and came up to the glass everyone was standing behind and punched it. It shattered into a thousand pieces. The patient then sat down and covered his eyes and started whimpering. Everyone was in shock. Marshall and a couple nurses hurried over and tried to move the guy but he wouldn't budge. Soon they brought out a gurney and picked him up and put him on it and took him out of the room. What had been elation turned into a quiet nervousness. Marshall in particular looked shaken. Some scratches had begun to show in that normally perfect name tag of his. 

Dave looked around and a lot of people were wondering what to do. There were more patients so they could go on, but everyone seemed shaken by what had happened so there was talk of postponing the other treatments. It didn't matter to Dave, the guy had said he could see so why did he care? He finally got the story the world would want to read. Marshall gathered everyone and took the lead. He wanted to continue the treatments for today regardless of what had just happened and he wanted to do it immediately. Marshall was convinced that the guy had just been spooked by seeing everything for the first time and reacted poorly. So they ushered in the new patient, this time a girl. Dave continued to record what was going on, completely absorbed by the story and trying to get every detail possible. As they were strapping her up, Dave thought about how he could take the money from this and run. Every single newspaper would want this story and he could sell it the highest bidder and just get away from this living hell. The machine started. That same beautiful mix of whiring and shaking and screaming filled the room again, but this time louder due to the glass protection not being there. The screaming seemed to last for hours but in reality only a few seconds had passed. Marshall again approached the patient and talked to the her. He undid the straps and she sat up. He began to slowly remove the blindfold. The girl blinked a couple of times and looked around. All of the sudden she pointed to a corner of the room and yelled ""What is that?"". Everyone looked and saw nothing. The girl ran into the opposite corner of the room and curled up there, shivering. Nurses again came into the room and took the patient away. Dave couldn't believe this was happening. Well, he didn't really know what exactly was happening but it was all gold. The doctors again gathered in the middle of the room. This time it was decided that the trials should be stopped and picked up again tomorrow. Everyone was shaken. Just before Dave was about to leave Marshall pulled him to the side. Dave noticed that a normally perfect piece of hair was hanging down on Marshall's head as He said, ""I know you saw some things today but I need you to not report what you saw for a little while until we can figure out what happened. We are on the verge of a great discovery and we need to keeps this under wraps until we are fully ready to go public with it."" He told him he agreed but what did it matter. He was going to publish this shit no matter what happened. This was not only his ticket to the big leagues but to a nice fucking beach house. And isn't that what everyone wants?

So when he got back he called up the New York Times and told them what he had. Of course they were interested, it was the biggest story of this decade. He negotiated and they went back on forth on a price until Dave was satisfied and then he sold it. He was so fucking happy, as soon as he hung up he went to the store and bought bottle of champagne and drank with himself until he was so drunk that he passed out on his kitchen floor eating some raw spaghetti-o's straight out of a can. The thing was, when Dave woke up, it wasn't next to some damn spaghetti-o's. It wasn't even on his kitchen floor. When Dave woke up, he was parallel to the floor strapped into a bunch of wires and looking at his reflection in a name tag.

"[WP] A blacksmith from a fantasy world has just invented firearms. Some time later, a random mage realizes it's possible to prepare and load spells into a gun.",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"Maegis the 3rd's place in history cannot be understated. Son of Maegis the 2nd, a farmer most noted for his contribution to the science of conservation of corn through newt tail and Rhino foot, he followed in his father's footsteps. Studying at Bruckhaven Institute of Magriculture, Maegis the 3rd (M3 for short) had a reputation for disruptive behavior and a passion for testing various potions, toying with the well-being of himself and others. M3's studies were disrupted when the Nomags made the most influential discovery of the century, perhaps even the millennium. 

The inventor of gunpowder is another legendary character of history. Harold, or Blackjaw as he came to be known, attempted to use gunpowder to improve his crafts as a blacksmith. He ended up blowing off a quarter of his face and most of his jaw. His owner, incidentally M3's father Maegis the Second, begrudgingly repaired his face but left it charred as a warning. Whether a slight catalyst or the straw that broke the unicorn's back, this act of arrogance spurred the Nomags to action. Events and emotions brewing for centuries since the Mag upcrushing came to a climax.

News of Blackjaw spread fast. ""How did that happen to his face??"" ""A powder! An explosive powder"" ""Like magic?"" ""Better"" 

So the gunpowder spread among the Nomags, harming themselves more than the Mags due to magical protection spells. But Blackjaw, recalling the tale of Daniel and Garreth where Daniel threw his spear with the might of god's grace and tore through the masterful Garreth's protection, arrived at the solution. 

The first firearms were similar to the the most modern ones in that they used gunpowder to push out a projectile at immense speeds and cause damage. The difference is the projectile of choice was unicorn horn pellets (UHP). Metal pellets would sting after demolishing a protection spell, and if fired continuously would kill, but the limited supply of gunpowder and lack of automatic firearms led to the dominance of UHP. 

After the distribution and production of firearms, gunpowder, and UHP ramped up, castles fell like dominoes. Only healers were preserved; warriors, alchemists, and farmers alike died according to the Nomag belief of the corruptible nature of magic. Maegis the 2nd was amongst the first to die, and M3 among the first to feel in his heart the wrath of the Nomags. He worked tirelessly on a solution; others off to join the battles criticized him for his cowardice, but he didn't care. He formulated the protocol for Mag Weaponry. A complex spell with a small learning curve could now be used to prepare and load spells into a gun (and as we know other weaponry as well). Spells were amplified by many magnitudes! A simple fire spell that used to singe one could now be loaded to set fire to a portion of the battlefield! The art of war changed completely overnight.

The tide of war was now a cyclone. Nomags had the numbers, but the balance of power tipped in favor of Mags. Nomags enslaved Mags to load their weapons with spells as well, leading to the upsets at Fairhill Swamp and New Nebel. However the spells loaded by the tortured Mags were not as strong, and if they were they would often backfire and do more harm than help. Further, many Nomags would refuse to fight with these weapons because of their beliefs. 

The numbers were even, and the Mags were on a course to decimate the Nomags when the Nomags received their greatest boon in the disguise of defeat. The unicorns were all but gone. Wartime demand for their horns left them infertile, and by this point in the war few remained. The Nomags, without their most effective weapon, sensed doom. 

But as it seemed darkest, the sun soon rose for the Nomags, just as night fell on the Mags. The Mags inexplicably began losing their abilities (as we know now from studying Magical systems, unicorns are essential to the Magical field Mags draw from) . A fire spell by a competent Mag was now enough to light a pipe and nothing more. Protection spells would stop a punch, but not a well struck sword or a metal pellet. 

The Mags were systematically wiped out. The Nomags voted for a no tolerance policy and any Mag was killed on sight. This continued for generations and the life of Mag was miserable. Just enough magic to light a fire and keep himself warm, but more than enough magic to be killed. But the Nomags forgot. The unicorn population began to recover and the Mags, although most of their spells were forgotten, began to recoup. 

The Mags knew it would be a suicide mission to attack the Nomags, so the clever among them began guerrilla operations. They could not make the Nomags forget entirely, but they could cloud their minds. Illusions were cast: flying fire breathing serpents, ugly monstrosities beneath bridges, green spear wielding minions, fair folk with pointed ears and light feet. The spark only had to be lit and these illusions became legends, perpetuated among the Nomags. Over generations Mags, unicorns, centaurs, and other existing beings became counted amongst these tales. 

So we have evolved; codes of secrecy, illusion, and science dominating our existence. So we may not repeat the mistakes of the past the study of history is essential. If war is to be waged again, victory must be assured and complete. But the new sciences may make typical war unnecessary. Teleportation, which used to get us from room to room is now taking us across the oceans. It is only a matter of time before we can leave this planet. Through the study of magical systems and history such is presented here, we know it only takes one push of the domino for a system to fall. To watch this great display of dominoes from afar is inevitable if we wish it.

"[WP] When you were young, your father was killed by a swordsman. You vowed vengeance and started to train yourself in sword fighting. At some point you had to kill a random man. His offspring vowed vengeance etc. This sets of a chain reaction...",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"In the training hall a fire burns. In its light the pupil strikes out, sword in hand he stabs at the training post, parries against the swinging clubs, rolls left and leans right cutting at the legs of his imagined adversary. His body burns from exhaustion, muscles aching for relief and lungs scream in pain as labored breaths are torn ragged from his chest and pulled back just as violently. It has never been like this, he has never trained this far beyond the point of exhaustion, but his mind is clear. He has learned to ignore the protest of the flesh, he knows there will come a time when he will have to fight well past any reasonable point of exhaustion and when that day comes he may die, but he will strike out with every last ounce of his being. 

Master Brahm's staff strikes the floor, a thud at once subtle enough to alert but not shock, strong enough that the curtains blew like gossamer and the flames of the fire pit to flickered. 

""That's enough."" He is an old man but not so old that his motions are anything but fluid and his voice is heavy but clear. An imposing figure for those with a knowing eye. ""Sit."" He motions for a place by the fire. 

The student sits, his chest rising and falling as the body he has learned control fights to regain the breath he has forgotten about, his bare chest glistening with rivulets of sweat. 

""When I found you my young one, you burned with rage."" Brahm sat across his pupil, lowering himself with a trained grace down to the floor. ""Your soul demanded vengeance. Have you overcome your emotions?"" The answer was obvious, that pained look, the averted gaze. 

""No master."" He was filled with shame. He had failed his master. He had wanted so much to be the man his master would approve of and yet nothing he could do had ameliorated his  need to avenge his fathers death. Years of training under his master, he had been a good and loyal student, doing whatever was asked of him, no matter how impossible it may have seemed. Never questioning the orders given, but he had failed his master. He felt his masters hand on his shoulder, then on the top of his head. He understood his masters love but wished more for his disapproval. He had not earned that love, he wanted to be chastised and made to be better. 

""I myself was filled with anger when I was in your place. I sat where you sit now and I listened to my master. He helped me and I intend to help you."" 

""I am not worthy."" He could not bring himself to look up to the man he most admired. He had loved his father but his father had been taken from him when he was little more than a boy, now he was a man and it was master Brahm who had shaped him into what he had become. For a very long time, master and student sat opposite one another, now that his breathing had returned to normal the only sounds in the training hall were the curtains blowing in the cool night air, and the crackling fire. 

""Do you understand why we do what we do?"" The voice was kind but there was a sadness behind it. 

""We protect the people."" The student repeated as if by rote. He was confused to be asked such a question. It was the kind of question you ask a child, not a man. 

""That is what we do, not why we do it."" He held up a hand to stop any other answer. ""Think on it."" More long silences and contemplation, the fire burned and a knot in the wood snapped sending up a wisp of embers. 

""Because we can."" The answer was obvious now. How could he have not understood that before. ""We do what we do because we can."" Master Brahm had been the protector of the village since before the young man before him had been born, single handedly defending the village from every danger. From foreign enemies. From itself. Tales of his prowess were legendary and not at all exaggerated. 

""Because only we can. The people we protect cannot do what we do. They cant do what we must."" Master Brahm looked at the fire beside them. It was dying now and before long it would have to be fed or left to die. ""When you were a boy I found you seething with rage, alone, ready to train. But that was not by chance. That was not fate. You were chosen.""

""Chosen?"" He was confused. Brahm sighed and when the pupil looked up to his master he found the older man looking at the dying flames. 

""To do what we do, we can have no attachment to these people. No loved ones, no mother or father."" One last flame danced slowly on the pile of embers. ""You must lose the ones you love and it must be in a way that drives you to vengeance and range, a fire that burns also shapes.""

""I don't understand.""

""Your mother wasted away before you could really remember her. She was a beautiful woman and your father loved her very much."" Master Brahm was stalling. He didnt want to say what he was going to say. But he was going to say it. 

""I killed your father."" The flame died, their figures now lit only by the moon light and the glowing embers. ""I used your rage to shape you and you are now ready to be the Brahm, to take my place."" 

""No."" This could only possibly be a test, a lie. 

""I killed your father as the Brahm before me killed my father. It is our way, the only way."" He felt the pupil begin to stir, the truth was setting in. It wouldn't be long now. 

""Now you will attack me and one of us will kill the other. However it ends the cycle will continue."" Master Brahm prepared himself. He was formidable but his pupil was young, his pupil was well trained. 

""When this is over, don't hate me. We do it for them, for the village, for people like your mother and father, for little boys like you, so that they don't have to feel our loss."" He reached down wrapping his hand around his staff. ""The truth is, I dont want to die. I made you train harder than you've ever trained before because I hoped to leave you too weak to fight. But a Brahm must always be ready to fight.""

""You killed my father."" He said from between clenched teeth and all the years of rage that he thought he had bottled up exploded like a blast in his chest and flooded his mouth with bile. ""Traitor."" Tears burned his cheeks. He had been betrayed and he would be slain by the only other man he had loved beside his father. 

No. No he would not submit to death. He would fight. 

""Know that however this ends, I love you and I will miss you."" 

""Die!"" The pupil reached his hand into the embers and sprayed them into the Brahms face and body. Both men rose to their feet and the fight was on.

The boy sleeps comfortably, the open window letting the cool night air brush against his ruddy cheek as dreams played across his mind. He woke to the sound of a thud, then a crash. Instantly he was scared. ""Papa?"" He gets no answer. He stands, his little legs shake and he squeezes his knees together to stop them. 

The sound if coming from his fathers bedroom. The door is open and a beam of light cuts through the hall way. His steps are unsure but he is scared and he needs his father. A scared boy needs his father. ",M_Aguilar
[PI]: The One Constant Part 2- La Muerte Divina: Chapter 2- Stygian Depths and a Means of Recruitment,ThatDudeWithTheBeard,"“Are you crazy?  You’re going to kill both of us!”  Jacobo finally spoke.

“Wrong.”  The Divine Death said.  “I’m sure you’ve seen the videos of me on the internet.  How I can disappear at will.  You fail to answer my questions in time, I’ll simply disappear from this house just before it goes off.  You and this house on the other hand...well, you get the picture.”

“Now, first question.”  The angel asked.  “Can you tell me the identity of the *Los Zetas* member known as “Z-54?”

“Several *Los Zetas* guys are going to be at the door of the house any minute now.  They’ll kill us both if they see you!”  Jacobo replied.

“If there were here, I suppose they would kill *you*, yes.”  The angel said.  “They’d have a much harder time killing me, however.  But, fortunately for both of us, the deliveryman that’s supposed to come here and give you the package and directions has been conveniently delayed by a flat tire.  Which should give us at least an extra fifteen minutes.”

The Divine Death then looked at the stick of dynamite in his hand as the long wick continued to burn and hiss.  “Of course, this fuse will run out long before then.”  He said.  “On a side note, you’ve seen me set off that nuclear blast back in Turkey in those leaked videos?  Very first time I pulled that trick, I got caught at ground zero.  Not intentionally, mind you.  But I emerged from it without a scratch.”

Jacobo knew exactly which video the dark-armored figure before him was talking about.  But then he suddenly realized, how the hell did the angel know about that the Los Zetas men were coming here to deliver a package to him?

“Even if I don’t do my little disappearing act, I could let this thing go off in my hand.  If I can survive being at the center of an atomic detonation, what fear should I have of a single stick of dynamite?”

The fuse continued to burn away.  As long as it was, at the rate it was going, Jacobo figured he only had a few minutes left.

“Now, back to my original question.  Do you know the identity of Los Zetas member “Z-54?”

“No.  I’m just a new guy.  I don’t know the identity of any of the leaders of the cartel.”  Jacobo hastily replied.

“Then who was the man you were talking to in the warehouse earlier today?”  The Angel replied.

*How did he know about that meeting?*  Jacobo thought.  Had he been there, in the warehouse that entire time, using whatever that trick of his that he used to get inside without being noticed?  Had he been hiding somewhere, listening to their entire conversation?  Is that how he knew where to find him here?  All of this was going through Jacobo’s head as the fuse on the dynamite continued to burn.

“It wasn’t him.  It was one of the other leaders of the cartel.  I can’t tell you which, but it wasn’t Zeta-54.  All of the leaders wear masks in meetings to keep their identities secret.”

“Hmm.”  The Angel muttered, and set silent for several agonizing seconds as the dynamite’s fuse continued to shorten.

Finally he asked.  “I looked at the maps on the table in the warehouse.  They used several different symbols, but there was no key or legend to any of them.  Can you tell me what they represented?”

“I-I can’t tell you that.”  Jacobo answered.  If the Los Zetas found out that he’d ratted-out all of those locations to anyone, they’d kill him, slowly and painfully.

The Angel looked down at the dynamite in his hand, silent for several more long seconds as the fuse continued to burn away.  “You want to know an interesting little fact about history?  Dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel.  The very same man the Nobel Peace Prize is named after.”  He paused for several seconds as he seemed to thoughtfully examine the dynamite, seemingly not caring the the burning end of the fuse was drawing gradually, ever-so closer to the explosive.  “Ironic, isn’t it?  He intended dynamite to be used as a tool, like for clearing away obstacles or leveling landscapes in preparation for construction.”

“Come on, man!”  Jacobo yelled.

“Poor guy.  He’d be rolling in his grave if he knew that people use it more as a weapon now than anything.”

“Alright!  Alright!”  Jacobo finally relented.

The Divine Death looked up at him.  The fuse of the dynamite was more than half-way burnt now.  Jacobo was running out of time.

“The different symbols on the map.  “X’s” represent safehouses or storage places like the one we’re in right now.  Circles represent meeting places like the one I was in when I was given this assignment.  But the squares, I don’t know what they mean.  There’s only a few of them though, compared to the others.  My guess is that they’re homes.  Either of some of the Los Zetas leaders or maybe of people their keeping tabs on.  I really don’t know.  Now please, that’s all I know.”

“That still doesn’t bring me much closer to finding Z-54.”  The Angel said.  “I still don’t see any reason why I shouldn’t just let this fuse run out.”

“Wait wait wait!”  Jacobo said.  He didn’t care about *Los Zetas* or any of the cartels anymore.  Right now he just wanted to live.  If *Los Zetas* found out about this and decided to try to take him out, he’d deal with it then.  But better to risk possibly dying later than to definitely die now.

“I don’t know where Z-54 is, but I might be able to help you find him.”  Jacobo said.

The Angel cocked its head to one side.  The fuse on the dynamite was getting shorter and shorter.  “I’m listening.”  The angel said.

“*Los Zetas* wants to set me up as a courier.  I was drug a smuggler- I know how to get around all the police checkpoints, which cops can be bribed, and how to hide the goods so well that not even the drug hounds can sniff them out.  I worked alone for awhile until Los Zetas got hold of me- no way they were going to let someone run an independent smuggling ring in their own territory, so they made me an offer I couldn’t refuse.  Either I do the smuggling for them, or they would kill me right then and there.”  Jacobo was speaking quickly now.  The fuse on the dynamite was not getting any longer.  “I didn’t want to die, and they were offering me a better cut than what I was making on my own, so naturally, I took it.”

The Angel of Death looked down at the dynamite.  From what Jacobo could guess, he had less than a minute left before the thing would go off.

“I still don’t see how that helps me.”  The angel spoke.

“The man in the mask.  He’s not Z-54, but I’ve met with him several times.  He knows more about my old independent smuggling operations than anyone else in Los Zetas, and said that once I’ve proven myself, he’ll have me start doing some of the major smuggling jobs right away.  We’re talking weapons and ammo, blood money, major drug shipments, you name it.”

“...and?”  The angel simply replied, holding up the dynamite.  The fuse was starting to get dangerously short.

“Some of these shipments will be going to the major players in the cartel, including some of the bosses.  Sooner or later, I’m bound to end up making a shipment to Z-54 in person.”

The Divine Death paused for a second, putting his fingers against his mask where his chin would be, as though he were considering something.  There had to be only seconds left on the fuse, by Jacobo’s estimate.

Finally the armored angel took his thumb and forefinger and pressed them together on the burning end of the dynamite fuse, just inches away from the explosive.  The fuse stopped burning with a soft *HISS!* and a small puff of smoke.",ThatDudeWithTheBeard
[PI]: The One Constant Part 2- La Muerte Divina: Chapter 2- Stygian Depths and a Means of Recruitment,ThatDudeWithTheBeard,"I got to the warehouse and did a quick recon.  There were no vehicles around, but there was a pair of armed guards at each of two doors on opposite ends of the building.  Fortunately, I was able to softly land on the roof where I found a hatch the opened up and let myself inside.  The warehouse was filled with a whole manner of illicit goods.  Stacks of stolen cash, racks of guns and boxes of explosives, from grenades to RPG’s to even a few boxes of dynamite, bullet-proof vests.  And then there were the drugs.  Numerous rows of wooden palettes on which were stacked packages of marijuana and cocaine.  Had to be hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of dollars worth, in street value of goods, and that was just the drugs alone.  It wasn’t until I did a thorough check and was absolutely certain that I was the only person inside that I powered down the suit and began to do a more thorough inspection of the place.

This was indeed the warehouse that the last Los Zetas member who’s brain I’d basically strip-mined had met with Z-54.  I could see the table they all must have been sitting at in the very center of the building.  But there was no sign of him or any of the members there.  On it, however, were several maps.  A number of locations were marked with different symbols, but there was no legend to indicate what each type denoted.  Obviously, these were locations of some importance to the cartel, but in the event the maps were found, the obviously didn’t want anyone to know what was to be found there.  I used my helmet camera to take several photographs of each map.  Maybe after I’d done a little more searching, or after I inevitably interrogated a few more cartel members, I might be able to figure out what the different symbols meant.

As I took the last photo, I heard the unmistakable sound of trucks pulling up outside.  Normally I’d switch the field back on and make my escape.  But if there was a chance that Z-54 had just arrived again for another meeting, then I couldn’t pass this chance up.  I quickly hid behind a stack of packages of cocaine, making sure that the lights from the ceiling didn’t cast my shadow on the ground, least someone see it and know I was back here.  I asked Eddie to try to dim the glow from my back and the tendrils.  He already knew what I had in mind, and obliged.  I checked the silenced pistol I’d been carrying since I killed the first safe house full of Los Zetas to make sure the magazine was fully-loaded, just in case things went south.  For once, instead of killing and escaping, I was going to hide and observe.

The sound of the truck engines died down, and I heard voices speaking in Spanish as doors open and closed.  The voices steadily grew louder as several people approached one of the doors.  I took a peek as best I could between the drug packages stacked on top of the palettes as the door opened and four men stepped inside.  Two were armed with AK-47’s, one carried a sidearm and wore a ski-mask, like the three members had in the memory I had extracted from the Los Zetas member earlier, and the fourth was unarmed, and looked a good deal younger- maybe only 18 or 19- than any of the guards or the two gunmen that came in with the group.  My guess was that he must be new, some sort of initiate.  I turned my attention to the masked man.  I didn’t see the necklace around him, so either he wasn’t Z-54, or it was, and he had simply chosen not to wear it today.  As it stood, there was no way for me to know.  I couldn’t make any sort of attack.  If I killed the other 3 and extracted the memories of the masked man, and it turned out not to be the so-called “Z-54,” then I would have killed one of their leadership.  In that case, the other leaders, the “Z’s,” I suppose you could call them, would no longer find out very quickly, and would likely go underground.  And since I had no idea where to even begin looking for Z-54 as it was, finding him would then become an impossibility if that happened.

No.  My only hope was to listen in on this meeting, and see what I could find out.

I turned on the audio recorder in my helmet, just in case I couldn’t make out anything in the conversation, I could at least go back to it later and figure out what I’d missed.  I didn’t bother turning on the helmet camera.  While I was able to peek in between the stacks of white, there was no way I’d know if the camera was positioned properly, plus it was more important that I see the events here as they unfolded.

And so I watched and listened.

“Jacobo Torres.”  The masked man said to the teen as they both sat down at the table across from each other.  One guard took up the masked man’s flank.  The other remained standing behind the young man.

“We have one last simple assignment for you.”  The masked man continued in Spanish.  “Do this for us, and you will officially be a full-fledged member.”

I continued to watch through the small cracks between the stacks of cocaine as they spoke.  The young man didn’t say a word as the masked one spoke.  The kid was either smart enough to know not to speak unless asked, or he’d already had the lesson smacked into the back of his head more than once.  Given his age, I was willing to bet the latter.

“You will go here to our safehouse in *Palizada*.”  The masked man said as he put his finger on the map.  “Once there, you’ll wait for one of our men to deliver a package to you.  When he does, he will ask you ‘How your Aunt Felicia is doing.’  You will reply in one of two ways.”

There was a brief pause.  The young man remained silent.

“If there’s no trouble.  You will tell him ‘She’s finally out of the hospital and back home.”  If you think you were followed, or you’re being watched, or if someone else is in the safehouse with you, you will tell them, ‘She’s still in the hospital but is getting better.’”

The masked man stopped talking for several beats.  Once again, the young man, Jacobo, kept his mouth shut.

“Your next set of instructions will be given to you depending upon your answer.  Do this for us, and you’re in.  Fail us, and I don’t need to tell you of the consequences.”

The masked man leaned back in his chair.  “Do you have any questions?”

“No, sir.”  The only words that the young man spoke.

“Alright then.”  The masked man said as he stood up and the guards began to follow him out.

As they walked, the masked man stopped and turned to look at Jacobo, still in his seat.  “Well?  You have your orders.  Get to it!”

The young man immediately got out of his chair and followed them out of the building.

It didn’t take a genius to determine how these orders would differ depending on the answer he gave.  If he carried out his deal as planned, the deliveryman would tell him where to take the package.  If he gave any hint that he had been followed, then the “deliveryman” would most likely kill him, either there on the spot, or convince him to get in a vehicle with him where he’d kill him then, and dispose of the body somewhere more remote.

As they closed the door behind them.  I looked behind me and noticed several open crates of hand grenades and dynamite.  I looked back between the racks of stacked cocaine bags I’d been hiding behind to make sure the warehouse was completely empty.  Once I was sure I walked over to the open dynamite crate.

Extra long fuses.  Tie a few together and you could probably get several minutes worth of burn before they went off.

I had an idea.  It would be dirty, but it might bring me one step closer to finding out where “Z-54” was hiding out.  I would need a few things first.  I was sure one of the larger towns nearby had somewhere I could “acquire” some cell-phones.

As I grabbed several sticks of dynamite and tucked them safely away in a pocket on my leg, I prepared to make my exit the same way I came in- through the hatch in the ceiling.

I’ll be seeing you real soon, Jacobo Torres.",ThatDudeWithTheBeard
[PI]: The One Constant Part 2- La Muerte Divina: Chapter 2- Stygian Depths and a Means of Recruitment,ThatDudeWithTheBeard,"Fortunately for the team, Sgt. Ramsey, Corporal Graves and Privates Paulson and Cole knew German.  Otherwise, it might have taken them some time to figure out which door to choose first.  Sure, some levels, like the medical wing, were marked with the universal red cross symbol, but others were less obvious, like the level for security and, finally, the laboratory level, which was what they were looking for in the first place.

Paulson found a circuit breaker in the stairwell and managed to get the main power running up again, replacing the emergency red lighting of the stairwell with the more pleasant, healthy white glow of the normal ceiling lighting.  Each door they had encountered so far, save for medical, had required some form of key-card access.  So they were surprised when they got down to the bottom level where the laboratories were contained to find that the door was stuck open, sitting at an odd angle in its frame, broken.

“Did someone get here before us?”  Cole voiced his concern.

“I don’t know.  I think the way we came in through was more of a back door of sorts.”  Sgt. Ramsey replied.  “No telling where the main entrance into the facility is,” he said as he cautiously led the way through the open door into a hallway.  “Everyone stay sharp.  No telling what they were working on in here.  For all we know, someone or something could still be lurking around.”

Ramsey took point as he lead his squad down the hallway.  As they moved, he could see laser trip-wires that had been torn out of their sockets in the walls- as though someone had meticulously gone through the trouble of disarming each and every one of them.  He could only imagine what tools they must have used to do so without setting them off.  The fact that they lay scattered in pieces on the floor suggested that whoever took them out did so without setting any of them off, or being caught in view by the numerous cameras that lined the halls; their lights blinking steadily now that the power was back on- their lens likely sending a video feed to a bank of monitors somewhere on the security level, giving a show to an audience of an empty room.

They cautiously made their way around the corner in the hallway, where it finally opened up to an even larger hallway, three doors on each side and a large blast door, holding only partially-closed, at the far end.

“Alright, every one split up into teams of two.  We’ll check these rooms one at a time.  Cole with me.  Paulson you’re with Stout.  Bennet, you’re with Graves.”  Sgt. Ramsey said.  “There’s no telling what could be in here; anyone sees anything strange, you call out.  Got it?”

Ramsey was met with a chorus of “affirmatives” as he finished his question.

Ramsey and Cole headed over to the first door to their left.  On the wall next to the door was a sign with the name “D. Acuff” on it, likely the office of one of the researcher on whatever particular project they’d been working on here.

Once again, the door required a keycard, but oddly enough, it had been left open, the door having slid in its inlay to the left just enough for Ramsey and Cole to slip in to one after the other.  As they got in, it looked like a regular office.  A desk with a computer on, which was still turned on, a bookshelf in a far corner, and several chairs sitting across from the desk.  From the layout, it looked like this must have been the lead researcher’s office for whatever project they’d been working on here.

What looked completely out of place, however, was an old cassette recorder on the desk next to the computer.  There several tapes stacked next to it with one inside.  Sgt. Ramsey carefully reached over and hit the “play” button.

A voice came over and began speaking in German.  Fortunately, Ramsey knew the language well.

“I’m going to leave behind these tapes when we’re finished.”  The voice of a well-aged man came from the recorder.  “If we deem it necessary to wipe all the hard drives in the facility, or if something happens to all of us before we leave, there will be some kind of record.”

The was several seconds of pause before the voice continued.

“We started these experiments, and were on our way to creating gods.  But now, I fear that I may have unleashed The Devil upon the earth instead.  Even after I’ve gone through all his notebooks- the parts I can understand anyway- it still terrifies me how well the math holds up.”

“What he meant about ‘changing the variables,’ though,” the voice continued in German, “I shudder to think what that might entail.  With the armor and the symbiont merged with his body, there’s no telling what he’s capable of.  But if what he says about causality, about small events on earth affecting and changing events elsewhere in the universe, then what it will take to prevent the destruction of the universe as he claims, and as he’s demonstrated mathematically...I can only imagine that they’ll be earth-changing events in and of themselves.”

There were several more seconds of silence as the tape continued.

“I’ve been watching and listening to as many news outlets as possible for the past several days, trying to see if I can find anything that might indicate his involvement.  Or to see if there are any patterns to suggest he might be working behind the scenes, manipulating world events.  So far, I’ve found nothing.  Given his abilities, he could be anywhere right now, and if he wanted, he could no doubt stay hidden forever.  But knowing him, he’s simply biding his time.  Waiting for some event or catalyst to occur before he goes into action.  And when he does...what will be the consequences?”

“God.”  The voice simply said, followed by what seemed like an eternity of silence.  For a moment Ramsey thought this segment of the record had ended and was about to hit the fast-forward button when the voice finally began speaking again.

“We had such high hopes for this experiment.  The practical applications from all our findings could have changed civilization.  We could have jump-started technology by as much as a century- maybe more- within a decade’s time.  Maybe even have unlocked the key to deep-space exploration if we’d had long enough to work.  But now that He’s gone, we’ve no resources to work with.  And even if we could build another suit, we still have no Entropium to work with, as he took it-or perhaps it took him- when he left.”

“We dabbled in forces of nature never thought possible to mankind.  But what we did...after everything that’s happened, with the Subject and suit disappeared and for all we know hiding anywhere in the world right now, no telling when and where he’ll finally show up and what he’ll do then...”

There were several more seconds of silence, and then finally, a single sentence.

“Was I right to do what I did?”

The tape then stopped as it reached its end.

“What was he saying?”  Cole asked Ramsey, him not being quite as fluent in German.

“I’m not entirely sure.  They were running some sort of tests.  They were talking about some sort of suit, then something about a symbiont- some sort of organism, apparently.  And something called ‘entropium.’”  Sgt. Ramsey replied.

“Entropium?  What is that, some sort of element?”  Cole asked.

“Not one that I’ve ever heard of.”  Ramsey answered.  “But from what he was saying, they were working on something big here, something about a test subject and some form of mathematics involved.  And something about the destruction of the universe.  Creepy stuff.”

“But the most important thing, though,”  Ramsey continued, “Whoever was recording, he mentioned that the experiments had ‘set them on the way to creating gods,’ but said that he was worried that he had ‘unleashed The Devil upon the world.’”

Ramsey then turned and looked at Cole.  “I think whatever they were working on here, something got out.  And apparently they began shutting down the facility soon afterwards because they no longer had what they needed to continue their experiments.”

“You think it was Subject Ifrit that got out, then?  Maybe he was a test subject here and at some point, he escaped and took that armor that he wears with him?”  Cole asked.

“That would be my first guess.”  Ramsey replied.  “But that still doesn’t explain a lot of the other stuff he talks about in the recording.  Stuff about some kind of mathematics, a symbiotic life form of some kind, and this ‘entropium,’ what ever that is.”

Ramsey then walked over to the computer on the desk and pulled a screwdriver out of his pocket.

“Grab the tapes and the player, along with any papers or journals you can find.  We’ll have our guys go over them when we get back.  Chances are there’s more information on them we could use.  In the meantime, I’m going to remove the hard drive from the computer here.”

“Copy that.”  Cole said as he took off his backpack and opened it up, and began putting the recorder and cassette tapes inside.

“Sergeant.”  Ramsey’s headset came to life.  “This is Paulson.  We’re in the second room to the right.  We found something.”

“We’ll be there in a minute.  We’re grabbing a few things from the office here.”  Sgt. Ramsey replied.

“Affirmative.”  Paulson’s voice responded.  “But you’re really going to want to see this, Sir.”",ThatDudeWithTheBeard
[PI]: The One Constant Part 2- La Muerte Divina: Chapter 2- Stygian Depths and a Means of Recruitment,ThatDudeWithTheBeard,"It was dark.  His head was throbbing with a pain in the back of his skull.  He struggled to remember why.

“Despierta, Jacobo Torres.”  *Wake up, Jacobo Torres.*  A strange voice he didn’t recognize said.

He opened his eyes but all he could see was an indistinct black and blue in front of him.  His vision was out of focus.  Why couldn’t he see clearly?  He struggled to remember.

“Despertarse.”   *Wake up.*  The strange voice said again.  It sounded distorted.  Almost artificial.  The black blur in front of him began to sharpen a bit.  He could make out some bright blue surrounding it.

“Sé que no te lo golpeó tan mal.  Ahora despertar, Jacobo.”  *I know that I didn’t hit you that badly.  Now wake up, Jacobo.*  The voice continued to speak.

His memory was starting to come back.  He’d entered the safe house and sat down on a dirty-looking couch in the main room, and began waiting for the deliveryman to arrive with the package he was supposed to receive.  Then he he’d heard what sounded like heavy footsteps just behind him, but before he could turn to look, something hard had hit him.

After that, he was here.  What was happening?  His vision was clearing up more.  The black blur was shaped like a man.  There was something blue emanating from behind him.

Had the Los Zetas hired a hit-man?  He’d done everything exactly as they’d asked so far.  He hadn’t ratted anyone out, had stayed away from the cops.  Hadn’t skimmed a single peso off of any of the money he’d delivered in any of the runs.  He’d done nothing wrong.  Why would they decide to just kill him now?  Did they think this delivery assignment had been compromised in some way, so that they viewed him more as a liability than an asset?”

Had this last task been a set-up from the very start?  Why were they doing this to him?

His vision finally sharpened, and he clearly saw the figure that was sitting in the chair, position so that the chair was backwards and its arms were placed on the back, crossed over each other.

When he recognized the figure, he almost wished that the Los Zetas had sent a hit-man instead.

Standing, he would have easily been nearly seven feet tall.  And in that suit of strange black, seemingly light-absorbing armor, it was a wonder the wooden chair he sat in didn’t break underneath his weight.  Emanating from his back was a bright blue glow, from which extended multiple wispy tendrils that slowly undulated in the air behind him.

Jacobo knew.  He’d seen news broadcasts.  The videos on YouTube.  He’d seen what this man had done, how he’d all but obliterate the armies of ISIL in Iraq and Syria in just a matter of days- men falling to the ground dead with blood gushing from wounds to their necks and chests or decapitated heads.  How he could disappear completely in less than the blink of an eye.  And he’d seen the leaked video showing how he set off a nuclear blast with the movement of a single finger.  He knew exactly who was sitting in the chair.

In the Middle East, the people had called him things like the “Angel of the Desert”, or as he was most well-know on the internet, “The Doom That Came From Irem.”

Here in Mexico, people had taken to calling him something else.

“La Muerte Divina.”  *The Divine Death.*

Jacobo could do nothing but stare at him in complete silence.

“Good.  You’re awake.”  The Divine Death said as it stood up from its chair and walked over towards him.

It was then that Jacobo realized that he was sitting in a chair of his own.  He immediately tried to stand up.  His instinct was telling him to run, although given that this individual, this Angel of Death, could disappear and reappear just about anywhere in an instant, running would do him little good.  As he tried to stand, though, he felt something tug against his legs and arms.

It was then that he realized he’d been tied to the chair.

As he futiley struggled to free himself, the black-clad Divine Death suddenly grabbed a hold of his neck with one hand and the top of his head with the other.

Jacobo locked gazes with the tinted eye-holes of the strange mask that he wore; so dark that he couldn’t see anything beyond them.  The Angel appeared to be studying him.  It then turned his head to the left, then to the right, as though looking for something.  Jacobo was so terrified, however, that he dare not speak.

“Bueno.”  The Divine Death said finally after studying his head for the longest thirty seconds of Jacobo’s life.  The Angel then said in Spanish.  “You were only out for a few minutes.  No signs of brain trauma or concussion.”

The Divine Death then walked back and sat in the chair opposite Jacobo, and then pulled something out of a pocket attached to the leg of the suit.

“Now, then.  I’d like to ask you some questions.  The quicker you answer them...” the Divine Death paused as he held up the object in his hand and Jacobo realized what it was.  It was a stick of dynamite with a very, very long fuse.

And that was when the armored angle raised a finger to the end of the wick, and it began to hiss as it burned.

“...The better your chances of survival.  Let’s start talking.”  The Divine Death finished his sentence.",ThatDudeWithTheBeard
[PI]: The One Constant Part 2- La Muerte Divina: Chapter 2- Stygian Depths and a Means of Recruitment,ThatDudeWithTheBeard,"*Oh thank God!*  Jacobo thought.

The Angel of Death got up out of his chair and pulled out a large black dagger.  From where, he couldn’t tell.  Oh god, what was he going to do now?

There was a slight flicker of the Angel’s form, for a brief instant.  Next thing Jacobo knew, he felt the ropes holding him down falling off of him onto the floor.

“Perhaps you might be of use to me after all.”

The Black Angel held up its other hand.  In it was a small, strange looking device, that looked like it had been cobbled together from various electronics.  It was about the length of his finger and just as thick.  It look vaguely like an E-cigarette.

“Take this, and keep it on you at all times.”

“W-what is it?”

“A little something I rigged up; disguised it to look like a vape pen; anyone asks, that’s what you tell them.  You see the small button on the end?”  The angel of death said as he pointed to a white protrusion near one tip of the device..  “If you press it three times in rapid succession, it’ll transmit a GPS signal that I’ll pick up on, and I’ll know exactly where you are.”

“So what do you want me to do with it?”  Jacobo asked.

The Angel of Death leaned forward, until his mask was just inches from Jacobo’s face.

“You’re going to help me find Zeta-54.  You yourself said that sooner or later, you’ll wind up making a shipment to the man himself.”

The dark angel stood back up.  “When you do, you’re going to activate it, at which point I’ll come in and do my thing.”

“Are you crazy?  You want me to, what?  Slip this on his person?  How the hell am I supposed to do that?  A guy like him is bound to have bodyguards all around him.  I’d never be able to get close enough without getting shot.”

“I never said anything about slipping it on his person.”  The angel replied as he crossed his arms.  “I just need a general location, is all.  Once you’re in the same building as him, you can activate and then just toss it in a trashcan somewhere.  Or hell, if you’re going to be frisked, drop it off somewhere on a road nearby. It won’t be hard for me to figure out where you’ve gone from there.”

Jacobo finally reached out his hand and reluctantly took the device.

“If you don’t mind me asking, what the hell did Z-54 do that was so bad that you’re after him?  I’ve seen the news.  Just a few weeks ago you were in Iraq and Syria single-handedly wiping out the Islamic State.  Even a cartel leader like Zeta-54 seems like small fish compared to one of the world’s most-feared terrorist organisations.”

“The less you know, the longer you’ll probably live, so I’ll keep it simple.”  The Angel replied.  “It’s not the man I’m after, but something he has.  He doesn’t know what it is, and it was never his to take in the first place.  I, on the other hand, know exactly what it is, and I need it for something far more important that what he’s using it for.”

The Angel suddenly turned and grabbed Jacobo by the shoulder and pointed a finger in his face.

“And let’s make something very clear.  It’s nothing personal, but you really don’t have a choice in this matter.  You do this for me, or you die.”

“You would actually kill me over this?”  Jacobo said, defiant.

“If I have to, then yes.  But if a cartel like *Los Zetas* finds out that you’re working for the world’s most dangerous, and at the moment, probably both the U.S. and Interpol’s most wanted man alive, they’ll panic and probably kill you before I get the chance.”  The angel replied.  And that was when Jacobo realized he was right.  If anyone from the *Los Zetas* cartel found out about this, he was a dead man.  He had no choice but to play along in whatever the mad angel was scheming.

“So, I believe we have an agreement then.”  The angel said as he took his hand off of Jacobo’s shoulder.

“It’s not like I have a choice.”  Jacobo replied.

“That’s the idea.”  The angel responded.  “In the meantime, you just go about whatever assignments they give you, and act like none of this ever happened.  But as soon as you find out where Z-54 is hiding, you turn on that transmitter at the first opportunity you get.  Am I clear?”

“Crystal.”  Jacobo replied.

“Alright.”  The Angel of Death said.  “By now the delivery man you’ve been waiting for should have fixed the tire I slashed on my way here and will be here in about five minutes.  When he gives you the package and asks how your Aunt Felicia is doing, you tell him that she’s out of the hospital and back home.”

There was no doubt in Jacobo’s mind, now.  He’d been in there with them in that warehouse the entire time, eavesdropping on their conversation.  Probably where he gotten the dynamite from, too.

“And where will you be?”  Jacobo asked as The Divine Death walked towards the door of the safehouse.

“I’ve got plenty of other matters to attend to, in the meantime.  Who knows, perhaps I can do a few things to expedite your meeting with Z-54.  The sooner I get what I want from him, the sooner you’ll be free of me.  Win-win, as they say.”

The angel began walking away towards the door of the safehouse.  “You concentrate on fulfilling your end of the deal, and I’ll be sure to make it worth your while, in the end.”  The Angel said.

“What can you possibly do for me?”  Jacobo said, incredulous.

“Just wait and see.”  The Angel said.  It then turned to look back at him and said, “Just remember I will be watching.”

And like that, before Jacobo could even blink, the angel was gone.  Like he’d never been there at all.

*Jesus Christo*, what had he gotten himself into?

A minute later there was a knock on the door.  Jacobo quickly slipped the device that the angel had given him into his pocket.

He answered the door.  A rather pudgy, mustached man stood in the doorway holding a small, cardboard box.

“Jacobo, here’s the thing you ordered.”  He said as he handed the box over to the Jacobo.

“How’s your Aunt Felicia doing?”

Jacobo didn’t hesitate in his answer.

[PI]: The One Constant Part 2- La Muerta Divina,ThatDudeWithTheBeard,"I was careful to leave no definitive evidence.  No proof.  No cryptic messages in blood like I did in Iraq and Syria.

Most of them were goons.  Thugs, gunmen, ordinary grunts to an army of glorified drug-runners and extortionists.  A few of them, however, stood out.  Sergeants or Captains, I guess you could call them.  I peered into their minds.  Eddie’s tendrils sliding through their skulls and crawling through the synapses of their brains, showing me images, memories, following neural pathways that eventually converged like pieces of a puzzle as they formed the whole picture.

All of them died during the process.  It was a trick I learned from when Eddie had essentially tried to do the same to me.  He simply sought to form an integration of our neural pathways, and it nearly caused a seizure.  So rather than that, he settled on a simple connection between the two.  That being said, forcable infiltration of the human brain and the information stored within was an easy feat for him to accomplish.  All I had to do was think to him of the relevant information I wanted, and he’d take care of the rest, feeding me bits and pieces of memories and images at a time, taking care not to overtax my brain in the process, as he got closer and closer to the source and we finally found what we were looking for.  Even after they were dead, there was plenty of time to look comb through their thoughts.  Eddie can work fast when he needs to.  And even after the body dies, the brain continues to fire electrical impulses for a while, sometimes for as long as 20 minutes under the right conditions.

Getting a little off-topic there again.  Anyway.

Of the three who’s mind I dug through, two didn’t provide anything useful.  I- or rather we- dug deep.  In one of them Eddie somehow wound up going through their childhood memories.  Out of all the things I see when we crawl into a person’s mind, childhood memories are the most horrific, good or bad.  All too often I see a childhood of abuse and neglect that had ultimately led them down the dark twisted path they had taken, but other times I see nothing but love and care, and the path of a once good man who made some poor decisions, lost their way and could never go back, and I had just killed them.  Of the two groups, the good memories of these people haunt me the most.  I often look back now to what I did in the Middle East just a few scant weeks ago.  The number of people I killed.  How many of them were truly evil?  And how many were impressed into their ranks simply as victims of circumstance?  How many of each did I kill?

And what would that make me?

I did what needed to be done.  And so far, everything is going as planned.

But if I succeed, will that absolve me of the atrocities I have committed?  Of the atrocities that I have yet to commit?

How far will I have to be willing to go before all is said and done?  Or will there come a point where, even with the universe at stake, I will reach some moral or ethical barrier that even I dare not cross?

The question haunts me.

Right, need to focus.

The first two men had no memories of use.  Memories of large drug deals.  Extortion rackets for protection money.  Nothing substantial.

The third, however, gave me more than I could have hoped for.

[PI]: The One Constant Part 2- La Muerta Divina,ThatDudeWithTheBeard,"“Remind me what we’re doing in here again?”  Private Paulson said.

“Intel says this old building is a facade for some sort of research facility underground.  Supposedly it’s connected to Subject Ifrit and all the shit that went down with ISIL collapsing a few weeks ago.”  Sgt. Ramsey replied.

“What kind of facility?”  Corporal Graves asked.

“Unknown.  Colonel says it had something to do with manipulating and controlling the flow of time.”  Ramsey replied.

“Sounds really dangerous.  Who in their right mind would want to fuck around with something like that?”  Coming from Paulson.

“Beats the hell outta’ me.  That’s what we’re here to find out.  Now mouths shut, eyes open, and guns ready.  If they were crazy enough to experiment with time travel or whatever, there’s no telling what else they were working on.  The facility itself is supposed to be shut down, but god knows what other science projects they were working on that could still be here.  Now everyone stay frosty.”

The facade building was the main office for a German publishing company, one that Sgt. Ramsey couldn’t pronounce and didn’t really care to know.  Supposedly it had shut its doors for good in 1992 after going out of business.  Of course, Sgt. Ramsey knew that version of history was complete fabrication.  Satellite imagery showed that this building didn’t even exist until 1994, two full years after its supposedly closed.  He’d done his own research and found that, as far as the internet could tell him, nothing had ever been published by this company.  Not one book, not one magazine article, not one pamphlet.  Forget Google and Wikipedia.  Even the taskforce’s own searches into the darknet turned up absolutely nothing.  As far as the world of literature was concerned, this company had never even existed.  Not only that, but after convincing the German power companies to hand over copies of their records, they found that the building had been drawing electricity since its inception, but they’d overlooked it as a misreading as it ran directly along one of the main power lines in the area.  Yet every time they the power companies had come out to investigate, the whole place was dark.

The building itself had been broken into more than once; likely by kids on a dare or teenagers looking for a place to smoke pot or have sex.  But as far as everyone was concerned, the inside looked like nothing more than an abandoned office.  Empty cubicle walls with equally empty desks, with numerous outlet strips where desktop computers would have been plugged into, file cabinets, desks, meeting rooms, all devoid of furniture and any sign that people were here- exactly what you’d expect for an office that had been shut down and cleaned out- all of its equipment either liquidated or sold to the highest bidder.

Exactly what you would expect, that is, until Sgt. Ramsey and the others found that the door to the rear office was locked tight.

If there was nothing left to steal, then what was the point of locking off this one particular room?

Ramsey and the others would soon find out as they lined up in preparation to breach the door.",ThatDudeWithTheBeard
[PI]: The One Constant Part 2- La Muerta Divina,ThatDudeWithTheBeard,"Note found in [REDACTED], Yucutan, Mexico, Retrieved by Covert Ops Team [REDACTED] on [REDACTED].  Believed to have been written by Subject Codename: *Ifrit*.  No date is given on the note so it is unknown when it was written.

The note itself is written in several different languages, switching between them every several sentences.  Intelligence believes that this may be an attempt by Subject Codename: Ifrit to prevent anyone from determining his/her/its country of origin or what, if any, agencies it may be working for if it were found.

Translation is as follows:

Have to keep writing.  Eddie (just to be clear, I can’t pronounce the symbiont’s real name- mainly because the human voice can’t produce the kind of sounds involved in most of it, so we settled on that nickname since it’s the closest I can come to pronouncing an approximation to the first two consecutive syllables in his name that could even be written with human letters) says he needs to make sure my mental faculties stay intact.  Says he’s worried about possible unseen repercussions of our symbiosis because nether he nor his original biomass ever merged with a creature that had a sense of individuality.  The only intelligent species his progenitor ever merged with either had a hive-mind or a collective subconscious.  It took me a week of explaining to him before he finally had a full understanding of how each human is a “self,” and our minds are all physically isolated from one another.  He seemed incredibly saddened by this when he finally understood, thinking that this meant each human is inherently lonely.  I had to explain to him that the separation of minds was our original condition, and was the reason we invented verbal and visual languages.  He found the notion that a species whose ancestors were not apex predators could evolve in such a way and to the level that we had, while remaining permanently mentally separated like we had during the entire process, has falsified a number of theories his and other species have had on the nature of evolution of intelligence in organisms.

In short, we’re an impossibility, yet here we are.

The first time he tried to send information directly to my brain, it nearly gave me a seizure and left me with a migraine that lasted for hours.  His species communicates data by merging biomasses together, their equivalents of synapses and nervous systems connecting and intertwining and transmitting vast amounts of information almost instantaneously.  He quickly learned the human brain wasn’t structured to take in so much information all at once.

Our brains are now connected by a two-way street.  He and I can read each other’s thoughts and share memories, though he’s been very careful on his part just how much information at a time goes my way.  As the scientist that he is, he finds us to be an interesting case study, including our brains, which he’s told me is different from any species he’s so far encountered.

Even though the universe is at stake here, Eddie is a true scientist to the end.  Making mental notes on everything for future reference, even while the clock to Armageddon ticks away.

Damn.  Got way off track there.  I think Eddie might have a right to be worried.  The more I write down lately the more trouble I have keeping on the point at hand.  If it’s a side effect of our merge then I hope it doesn’t get too much worse.

Why was I writing?

Right.  Eddie says since his mind is part of a collective, and my species’ minds are all indviduals, he wants to make sure it stays that way.  Essentially, he wants to avoid mental contamination; where we begin to have trouble telling whose thoughts and memories belong to who.  He’s worried about the moral and ethical aspects that the merging of an individual’s mind into that of a collective would pose, in that I would essentially lose all sense of self.  I asked him once what would happen if the opposite were to occur.  What would happen if a human brain, and individual intelligence, were to somehow assimilate or absorb the entirety of a collective intelligence.  He told me that in a sense, that was the first thing he tried to do when he communicated with me directly, and it nearly killed me, something which even he did not predict.  I asked him what would happen if it had been successful.  Given what he knows now about the human brain and mind, he says he wouldn’t even try it if it could succeed.  When I asked him why he said even he, with his advanced mathematics and scientific models, could not predict what the result would be.  It could possibly result in permanent brain damage, or could possibly result in some form of intelligence never before encountered in the universe.  He later confessed that of the two, he found the latter more horrifying.

Alright, I got that all down on paper Eddie.  I know you can see everything I do.  Satisfied yet?

Sometimes I wish I never taught Eddie about sarcasm.  For an alien intelligence, he’s surprisingly good at it.

So anyway, getting on to the next point.  Have to try and stay consistent.

Eddie’s mathematical predictions of real-world events proved correct once again, just as they always have so far.  Those men I killed who were setting up to execute the bus full of tourists were most definitely from the *Los Zetas* cartel.  The papers and maps I found on one of their corpses all but confirmed it.

This is going to be a lot tougher than dealing with ISIL was.  For one, ISIL didn’t have many allies in the region, and making allies with the locals was relatively easy on my part.  I was able to more or less operate out in the open when I had to.  Here, though, I doubt I’ll have such a luxury.

*Los Zetas* owns a lot here.  Extortion, kidnapping drug trafficking, and I know for a fact that I’ll likely get little help from law enforcement as they’ve either been bribed or coerced into not interfering in some regions of the country.

But *Los Zetas* has something I need.  Something they don’t realize they have, and I can’t let on what that is lest they threaten to destroy it.  And to top it all off, I’m just one country away from one of the world’s largest superpowers.  They were already suspicious of me when I was in the Middle East; that much I garnered after I ran into that black ops team.  I have no doubt that the Bald Eagle to the north will go into full-blown paranoia if and when they realize that I am here right at their doorstep.

I’ll have to be careful.  There are fewer places I can hide safely here.  And I have to be discreet.  Can’t leave any concrete evidence that I’m here.  No pictures or videos from anyone.  Not until I at least know where I can find what I’ve come looking for.  Only then will it be acceptable to allow the Americans to know I’m here.

In any event, I checked the map I lifted off that dead gunmen.  There were a number of safe-houses marked on it throughout the region with addresses.  No doubt they’ve stashed some of their ill-gotten gains in some of these locations.

If I’m lucky, what I’m looking for might be in one of them.  If not, I can always coerce the information I need from someone who might know its whereabouts, one way or the other.

Anyway, enough writing.  Now is the time to act.  The clock to the Apocalypse still sticks steadily down towards zero even now.

No time to lose.

End of entry.",ThatDudeWithTheBeard
[PI]: The One Constant Part 2- La Muerta Divina,ThatDudeWithTheBeard,"It was a meeting of some kind.  The men were all wearing masks.  It was a dark warehouse of some sort.  Nobody referred to the masked men by name.  One of them-the dead man’s memories knew him as “Z-54,”- had what I was looking for, out in plain sight.  He thought it but a simple rock.  Where and how he’d got it was anyone’s guess.  I didn’t know, Eddie didn’t know, and the poor bastard whose mind we were essentially frying didn’t know either.  He hadn’t even paid attention to it.  I couldn’t even make out the context of this meeting.  The poor bastard whose brain I was burrowing through had just been part of a little security detail he had, and hadn’t paid any attention to the meeting since it was of no concern to him.  But I could see it, through his memories.  But this man, this “Z-54” as he called himself- apparently all of the masked figures had labeled themselves as “Z” followed by a number.  They were the leaders of the Los Zetas- the big shots- they did not want to be known publicly.  But this man, he had it in his possession.  He must have thought it was a simple trinket of some kind, as he had set it into a gold-chain necklace which he wore along with other necklaces, as though the stone he had inlaid in it was nothing more than just another piece of bling to be shown off.  

This was good.

Someone within the Los Zetas had it.  I came into this country knowing I would be kicking a hornet’s nest of some kind when I got here.  And fortunately, it seemed that I had kicked the correct one on the first try.

The problem was, I had no name or face, just an alias and rank.  This complicated matters.  I had Eddie snake a little deeper around adjacent synapses in the dying man’s brain, searching for anything that might give me a lead.

I found something.  The warehouse- the meeting had taken place about five miles east of Villahermosa, a very short jaunt from where I was now near Campeche for someone like me.  And had only taken place three days ago.  Perhaps this man, this “Z-54” might not have gone far.  Even if he was long gone, perhaps I could find some sort of lead to his whereabouts once I got there.

I made sure to put two bullets through the man’s head when I was done.  An added precaution.  I had already taken a great risk saving the bus full of tourists.  I could not afford to kill with my blades alone.

It was not the Golden Eagle nearby in Mexico City that concerned me, but the ever-watchful eyes of the Bald Eagle in Washington that I wished to not draw the attention of.  Truth is, the reason I always kill with my blades when the Relativity Field is active is that, to put it simply, guns don’t give any extra advantage, at least in stopping power, when fired from a Relativity Field.  To get the gun to work, you’d have to extend the field over it.  Something that occurs naturally, as the gun is made of metal and can carry a current, unless it’s made of some cheap plastic composite.  Naturally, it carries the current of the field over itself.  But the moment the bullet exits the end of the barrel, it leaves the relativity field’s edge and normal physics take over, and moves incredibly slow in comparison with the shooter in the field as it re-enters real time (breaking through the barrier results in a loss of kinetic energy for projectiles).  I know all this because I was the first person to ever experiment with it, when the suit’s technology was still in development, and before my merge with Eddie .  Anyway, for a gun to fire a bullet a faster-than-normal speed, you’d have to extend the field at an incredibly high velocity as the bullet was fired, all the way to the target.  You could more easily get the same results as a bullet to the skull by using the hand-mounted gravity wells to launch a rock at someone’s face at high-speed when inside the Field.

Of course, once the you turn off the Field and exit it, the bullets are of course traveling just as fast as you would expect them to.  So it was very fortunate that I had found a pistol with a suppressor and extra magazines lying on a table when I found the first set of goons.  I had all the time in the world to take careful aim with my shots, make it look like a coordinated attack by several armed men instead of the careful tactics of a lone individual.  All I had to do was power the suit up and take my time lining up my shots, then power down and watch as the men all fell dead..  Fatal shots for the common thugs.  Incapacitating wounds to the arms, stomachs and legs of the the ones that I felt could give me information. 

For once, none of this is me going off on a tangent.  All of this, in fact, is very relevant.

As far as the U.S. military knows, my blades, sharpened stainless steel honed to razors’ edges, coated in a 3 mm layer of aluminum magnesium boride-titanium diboride- the same as my armor, are my only weapons.  All my targets ether stabbed, sliced open, or decapitated.  But never shot.  That was my trademark in the Middle-East.  The cutting down of foes without being seen.  Back then, it was necessary.  I needed to strike the fear of an angry god into the heart of ISIL and any other faction that would seek to take its place when gone, and most importantly, the world needed to know of my existence, but only as many details about me as needed.

And so here, I have completely switched my methodology.  Even the most competent of coroners and detectives, here in Mexico or anywhere else, would have little reason to believe that what I left behind was anything more than the result of a surprise attack on Los Zetas members by some rival cartel or local vigilante group.  And so long as the Mexican authorities continue to believe that, the more freely I can operate.  The Mexican military has neither the means nor technology to pose any problem to me, and the longer I can go before America’s paranoid gaze has a reason to get suspicious and turn its eyes south of its own border, the longer I can work undisturbed.

I’ve no doubt the Americans have eyes of sorts already in the sky; artificial fledglings who share the same ever-watchful gaze as the country that made them.  I’d no doubt plenty of images had been taken of me during my time in the Middle East by such devices.  At the time, it was of no concern.  But I can afford no such luxury here.

Fortunately, the cities here are much larger and closer together, and uncivilized areas in this tropical region provide plenty of tree cover.  A still aerial photograph or nightvision image would be no easy task, even if they did know to look.  And so long as I carefully and gradually vented the radiation buildup from my suit after each field activation, I’d appear like any other human to thermal imaging or FLIR.

My only major concern, really, were the electromagnetic pulses that are emitted each time the suit activates.  Despite all the adjustments and modifications I’ve made to this suit in the months since I first brought it out into the world, it has remained a major design flaw that I’ve been unable to overcome.  Mainly due to lack of proper tools or time to come up with a solution.

But the Bald Eagle in Washington still fawns over its assets in the middle east, and remains wary of its long-standing rival, the Great Bear in Moscow, who still maintains a shadow of presence in Syria.  So far as I know they, and the world, still watch for me there.  No doubt the U.S. has some means of detecting EMP’s.  Looking back now, I’m sure that’s how I was tracked by the Black Ops team I encountered.  I had hidden out in an abandoned village and operated out of there for some time.  Whatever tools they’d used, they’d used it to track me back there, knowing I’d show up again.

I have, however, learned to use this to my advantage.  After my encounter with said Black Ops team, I started work on an insurance policy of sorts, and left a little something- or rather, several little somethings- behind in a few key spots in the Middle East before I came over here into Mexico.  For all intents and purposes, the Bald Eagle and Great Bear have every reason to believe I’m still in that part of the world.

Regardless, I’ll have to be more cautious from hereon out.  In cities with electricity, low-grade EMP’s like I produce occur from time to time, and go mostly unnoticed by the general public.  Shifting in and out of the larger cities here in Mexico will be easier to do without being detected.  Plenty of reasons why a brief, random brownout could occur.

Too many in one area though, and the eyes of the Bald Eagle will no doubt turn here, and recognize a familiar pattern, and will then see through the ruse in the Middle East for what it is.  I’ll have to be careful when and where I chose to shift.

For now, it looks like I’ll be spending a lot of time here in the Jungle.

Breaching!”  Private Cole said as the shaped charge went off on the door, knocking it open as he aimed into the room with his combat shotgun.  Sgt. Ramsey and the others filed in directly behind him, sweeping their aims over the room, overlapping each other’s fields of fire as they scanned for any threats.

But there were none.  The back office was unoccupied, but different in that unlike the rest of the building, it was still furnished.  There was a single desk in the center of the room with a computer and desktop lamp on it and a red carpet in front.  Behind it sat a bookshelf with dusty copies of a number of paperbacks, none of the titles of which seemed to stand out to Ramsey, and there was a large framed photograph of a beach with black sand (Ramsey would later learn that it was the famous “Black Beach” of Punalu’u, Hawaii, the sand made of black basalt and formed from volcanic eruptions in the island’s past), and on the opposite wall was a poster of Vincent Van Gogh’s “Starry Night.”

“Anyone else notice what’s wrong with this picture?”  Ramsey said.

“Yeah.”  Pvt. Bennet replied.  “This room’s been locked up this whole time and the rest of the buildings been cleaned out of everything that wasn’t nailed down.  So why does this office still have all this stuff in it?”

The six-man team moved in to inspect the room.  Sgt. Ramsey, Corporal Graves and Privates Paulson and Benson followed him in.  Privates Cole and Stout keep a watch on the entrance in case anyone happened to wonder in after them.

Pvt. Bennet walked up and flipped the switch on the desk light, and was surprised to see it come on.

“We’ve still got power in here.”

Sgt. Ramsey walked over to the computer and pressed the power button on the tower underneath it.  The computer monitor flickered on as it began to boot up.  The BIOS was another name in German that Ramsey couldn’t pronounce.  It eventually finished loading some operating system he didn’t recognize and came onto a log in screen.  No way he was going to spend time guessing user names and passwords.

“Not going to get anything from the computer directly.”  Ramsey said as he reached back under the desk towards the tower to turn the power back off.  “We’ll have to remove the hard drive and take it back to- what the-”  Ramsey stopped as his arm touched something on the underside of the desk.  Something hard and cold.

He knelt down and saw it, and carefully detached it from its holster, bolted into the underside of the desk.

“The hell?”  Paulson finished the Sergeant’s sentence as Ramsey pulled out a SPAS-12 shotgun.

“What kind of publisher arms its senior executive with an assault shotgun?”  Paulson asked.

“The kind that wants to make sure something stays hidden.”  Sgt. Ramsey said as he crouched down and looked at the underside of the desk.  “There’s something else under here, too.”  Ramsey continued as he shined a flashlight underneath the table and saw what looked like a light switch.  He flicked it and then stood up and waited, looking around the room, but nothing happened.

“There’s a switch underneath the table.  Doesn’t seem to do anything.”  Ramsey said.

“You think it’s broken?  Or maybe a decoy?”  Bennet said.

“Most likely there’s probably more than one.”  From Paulson.  “If there’s something hidden here, you’d either set up multiple switches that all have to be turned on at once or in a certain order, or you set up a bunch of decoys while the real switch is hiding in plain sight.”

“Alright, everyone look around, see if you can find anything that looks like a switch or a button.”  Sgt. Ramsey said.  “If there’s something hidden here, like an entrance to the facility, then we need to find it.”

“You’re listening to NPR on WKRF, I’m Casey Moreau.”

“At the top of the news hour, in the states of Yucutan, Campeche and Quantana Roo of Mexico, the bodies of members of the Los Zetas Cartel were found in several different buildings, including at least one private residence and a warehouse.  While we’re still getting details, estimates put the number of dead between sixty and seventy cartel members.  Local authorities are saying that despite the number of dead, these weren’t the results of police raids but there have been no reports about any attacks by rival cartel members in the area.  We asked the local Mexican authorities if they had any suspects as to who was responsible for the attacks, but they declined to comment.”

“In other news, over a week after the fall of ISIL, there have been no confirmed sightings of the so-called Angel of the Desert, or The Doom That Came From Irem in the Middle East or anywhere else.  The so called Angel of the Desert has been credited with wiping out nearly 90% of ISIL’s forces in Iraq and Syria and there are unconfirmed reports that he assisted in the capture of their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  The so-called Angel of the Desert has also claimed responsibility for what appear to have been two nuclear explosions near the Turkish-Iraqi border.  His current whereabouts still remain unknown.”

""Yeah, awesome."" Adam scratched the red welts on his thigh. ""But I was thinking, well..."" He looked between his legs, pouting.

""What, isn't the tree with many holes enough?"" God shook his head in disbelief. Why had he chosen to give Adam sentience over the many nicer and less demanding fish species he had created?

""No, it's not about that! I need a mate."" Adam dropped to his knees and tugged on God's robes. ""I need someone to wake up to each day. I need someone to fall asleep with each night. I need someone to caress, to snuggle with, arm-in-arm, cheek-to-cheek.""

""Gross."" God gagged into the cuff of his sleeve. ""If you'll wait a billion or so years, a likeminded subsection of your descendants will invent these things called 'dakimakuras.' They should be enough to satisfy your needs.""

""I can't wait that long,"" Adam whined, ""please, God, just this once...""

""Fine, but it's going to cost you a rib."" God looked at the sun's position in the sky. ""Okay, if I go back to the lab now, I should have it done by tomorrow...""

""Wait! Don't you want my input?"" 

God remembered the last time Adam had contributed to creation design. ""What if we gave horns to horses?"" One look at that monstrosity, and he had canned that entire project. 

""Do I have to be honest?"" He did: he was supposed to be omnibenevolent, after all. God saw the sad look on Adam's face and sighed. ""Fine, give me your ideas.""

""Okay, well first of all..."" Adam pulled out a leaf he had been concealing God-knows-where. ""...she has to have eyes.""

God nodded, and Adam continued. ""And hair. And a nose. And-""

""Okay, can we cut to the chase here?"" God folded his arms, resisting the urge to jump into the sky right then and there. 

""A butt.""

""Okay, but you're not allowed to use it for anything except waste expulsion.""

""...a face.""

""Adam..."" God cracked his knuckles menacingly. ""What do you really want?""

Adam blushed. ""Well, God, I was hoping for...squishy things."" He held out his hands and performed a squeezing motion.

""Protruding breasts? Mammary glands? Is that it?""

""Yeah, sure. Whatever those are."" Adam crossed his arms and turned away. ""And maybe,"" he mumbled, ""you could give her four of them?""

""Four? FOUR!"" God punched a tree over. ""You're getting two at most, you entitled son-of-a-deity."" He picked up the tree and jettisoned it into space. ""I've had enough of this. You get one final request, and I'm out of here.""

""Fine."" Adam sniffed. ""Could you...give her a tail?""

God threw his hands up in disgust and airstomped into the sky, thunder crackling with each step. Overcome with anguish, Adam ran through the garden, crying out for his only source of comfort. Bessie gave him a consoling moo as he buried his face into her black-and-white hide. ""If only,"" Adam sobbed, ""if only.""",hideouts

"[WP] You have just discovered your superpower, in a time of immense need.",leon-theproffesional,"They said that the quake was predetermined, inevitable and guaranteed: But none of those things kept us from building along the fault-line. Sky scrapers, homes, office buildings and shopping malls. Far as your eyes might manage to look you'd find concrete and asphalt. As a race, as individuals, we took pride in our willful ignorance.

In some way, as a whole, we were asking for punishment. 

Building structures towards the clouds, making lives for ourselves when not two hundred years ago the ground rippled in waves, killing thousands. The survivors might pick up the pieces, tell their children... but I suppose after a few generations we had all but forgotten any lessons of significance. Any truth and knowledge those first folk took away from nature's wrath was left in books to gather dust.

Foolishness. Blinded ignorance. Call it what you will. I didn't truly regret my choices. Not even then, alone in the dark, struggling for air with the taste of dust and blood. There was no regret.

In some way I felt I deserved it.

Living in that city was a choice, not a requirement. Living in a city where the ""Big-one"" was considered inevitable... That's a mix of arrogance and pride. I wanted to live there, and nature couldn't touch me so long as I held it in my mind that I was safe. I believed, truly, that I was above it all. From that lofty sphere of my own mind through which I lived, my own actions had no consequence. I had no requirement for thought of others, no concerns to the well-being of the world. Always looking inward, but never looking out. 

Blissful ignorance, selfish pride. Though not a religious man, I felt guilt in my actions at times. Far off and smothered quickly by other thoughts as it was, I believe on a personal level I was also looking for punishment. I knew on a deeper level, that path I lived was wrong.

So it was, that I did not weep in self-pity. On my own pride, I accepted the circumstances and resisted them.

My hands were blistered and soaked with blood, shoulders heaving and legs shaking with each heavy breath I managed to pull in. That spine of mine, bone and muscle- all the strength I'd ever thought to have, put to use against the concrete above my head. How many tons are weighing down over me? How many more might still settle?

I had to wonder as the pressure built, and my knees began to tremble against the strain. There were a lot of floors above the ground level, and so far as I could know they had all came crashing down- one after another. Each impact hit with greater force, greater weight in rapid succession. I was a simply obstacle to the surface below, yet there I stood: A pillar of flesh and pride holding against impossible odds. 

Slowly crumbling, ever defiant, I stood while seconds turned to minutes, turned to hours... My body no longer felt tired, thirst, not even hunger. As if I had found a semblance of peace with the weight of what feels like the entire world settled upon my shoulders. An atonement for my way of life. I could have done so much more, and yet I hadn't. This was simply punishment: Like Atlas of the ancient Greeks, only instead of the sky I hold steel and concrete- and instead of the world below it is just me. A humbled and lesser Atlas then. 

Selfish as it might all seem, perhaps this is not the worst way to go. There was a primal nobility to my futile efforts.

Another noise from above is followed by a rumble, another bolt of pressure and impact against my body, forcing my further to my knees. Still, I hold. How badly I wish to lay down and accept the final stroke of my defeat. Sleep might have been bliss, I imagined.

I think in some way, shape, or form... I suppose it's representative of how I'd prefer to go past that silvery brook and meet the reaper. If I had such a choice in the way I was going to die, I think that might be the way to do it: Asleep and unaware. Far superior to slow and agonizing crush beneath metal and stone. No kicking and screaming, no horrible struggle and bloody demise.

Yet beggars can't be choosers in the end, now can they?

Slowly the pressure atop my back weighed heavier, and I felt my shoulders give, final reservoirs of strength waning as it trickled from my mind, mingling with the sweat and blood. Perhaps I might not be capable of having the death I'd prefer, but as I'm forced to bow, pressure unbearable upon my spine, I wonder if I might hold here, past my demise. In days yet, others might uncover me: As a corpse they might uncover and bear witness as a monument to my final resistance.

Pride... again with Pride. For all of my actions in life, pride had been my undoing. Selfish pride... Even in death I sought it. The realization brought me pain, far worse than the weight upon my shoulders. Greater than the bite of steel and cement upon my skin.

In this pained and brutal state, time did pass ever forward. Hours... days and nights? In the dark there is no knowledge of time beyond what lies within my mind, yet I begin to hear things that I did not before. Shouts and voices for which I am too weak to voice response. The chuckle of stone bouncing off of stone, rippling force down along the walls of this simple tomb. The feeling if tiny weights, insignificant to the whole, but ever so real- being lifted. Pebbles taken from the pile.

The pain began to lesson.

With each passing moment I felt the motions of distant hands, of shouts and desperation. Of voices singing out as they pulled away the barriers. It gave me hope. Above my head there were people trying their best, digging to find lost souls. People like me, trapped beneath the rubble and stone.

While I wallowed here, trapped by circumstance, by weight, by pride and self-pity: Above were people who helped not for any sake but another's. Selfless desire to save another person. Some stranger they had never met, never known, never even spoken to in passing.

Above my head was the last and truest redemption I myself might ever hope to find. A purpose in life that had gone overlooked.

Above were heroes.

And so I stood to join them.",wercwercwerc

"[WP] You have just discovered your superpower, in a time of immense need.",leon-theproffesional,"""THEY'RE COMING! RUN AND HIDE!"" Frank screamed as he ran past me. I looked up into the sky and saw exactly what he was talking about. 

Floating in the air just below the clouds were several large, reflective black objects. Their shapes were indescribable, and probably not even compatible with the laws of physics as we know them. Those objects were the Korisai. 

Having seen what they had done to the last village, I took Frank's advice and ran like there was no tomorrow. Hell, under the reign of the Korisai, for all I knew there would be no tomorrow. 

We had gotten halfway to the center of town, warning people as we went, when the Korisai caught up to us. Frank was gone first, his corpse hitting the ground with its organs strewn haphazardly around it. Then they turned toward me, and I ran. 

As I ran with the Korisai on my tail, I felt an awakening in my mind. Something clicked, and suddenly, a part of myself that I hadn't even known existed was accessible. I tapped into the newly opened section of my mind, seeking strength to use against my attackers. 

It was then that I realized that my new ability would be useless. My vision was suddenly tinted blue, and I was running half as fast as I had been before. Was it just me who time had slowed down for?

Evidently, it was. Everything else flowed at the same rate it always had. The Korisai caught up to me and tore me apart, and my last thoughts before it all went dark were ""Why did it have to be super-slowness?""",demonflame666

"[WP] You have just discovered your superpower, in a time of immense need.",leon-theproffesional,"The crops-master stood beside the head repairmen. Gloom and fear darkened their very clothes.

""We did our best, but the Raiders have burned the western fields,"" crops-master Daniels said, his voice shaking, his face still soot-covered. ""Only the walled fields are growing now.""

""And the walls are crumbling. Another attack like that, and--"" John Powers, the repairman said, choking on his next thought. Under his grease-smeared brow, his eyes sparkled with faint tears. He, like the rest of us, had family inside the wall, and had lost family outside it. Losing the wall would mean losing everything.

""I will fix it,"" I said, forcing my voice steady, almost yelling. ""We *will* survive the winter.""

Daniels twisted his hands on the grip of his hoe. He and I both had two-year-old sons, probably playing in the shadow of this very administration building.

""What do we need?"" I asked.

""Money to trade for more seeds,"" Daniels said. ""And for more weapons. We outnumber the raiders, but we have one gun for every three farmers.""

""And money for cement,"" Powers said, pullings a sweaty hand through his hair. ""Traders are coming through next week. But our coffers are empty.""

""It will happen,"" I said. ""We will find a way.""

I dismissed the two men and walked to the window. Peering through the uneven slats of corrugated metal, I watched the two town leaders meet with the crowd below, assuring them with big voices and comforting worried children.

Thirty children in the community, thirty young lives, the next generation, so important to preserve. More precious than the wall or the ammo or the storehouse. The raiders didn't take children, didn't want them. They didn't care if the world ended, so long as they lived to see it.

It drew a deep breath and blew a layer of dust off the old school administrator's computer. They community rested on my shoulders. The next generation, the very future of the human race, rested on how we managed the next week, how we repaired the walls and replanted the fields.

""God,"" I prayed aloud. ""If you somehow survived the fallout, please do something.""

I turned of the computer. I heard the wires leading to the roof's solar panels buzzing as I opened the spreadsheet program. I opened the ""Community Finances"" file. Faint gray lines crisscrossed in a confusing network of cells and rows and columns. The previous mayor, may she rest in peace, had made this document and updated it every month. I had barely touched it, but now we needed money. We needed to find where it hid and how to use it.

I tapped the keys and poked the touchscreen. I felt like a gardener in the kitchen. My thick fingers often missed their mark on the screen, and I starting writing in the wrong cells and pressing too many buttons on the compact keyboard. My fingers, shaky from years working with Daniels in the fields, hadn't done such delicate work since we weeded the courtyard some ten years earlier.

Dust swirled in the room, and I coughed, sitting up straight. Then something happened. Sitting upright like some old weathered poster for proper desk usage, my feet flat on the ground, I changed. Or rather, something changed in my. Like a sluice gate releasing crystalline mountain water, I felt it.

What did I feel? I don't know. A tingling sensation, perhaps? No, that was just the reaction, the external response to what was happening deeper inside -- in my arms, my fingers, and my mind.

Formulas and formats flowed from my fingertips like hail in a radiation storm. An INDEX-MATCH for this table, a Pivot Table for that worksheet, a macro for this workbook. It felt like hours, but after only thirty minutes, I stood from the desk, jumped back from it really. It felt like breaking the bond between two magnets, my fingers aching to return to the keyboard.

""What have I done?"" I whispered, but I knew the answer.

Three interlocking documents with auto-updating cells and infographics. Five thousand cells of finance simulations and a wholly unique macro-based Bayesian formula for calculating raid probabilities. I knew what it was instantly -- a weapon, a tool to not only secure the next generation's safety, but a means to capture the rest of the island, to control the mainland.

I threw open the window and called for Daniels. He sprinted across the courtyard and flew up the dusty, narrow stairs.

I showed him the spreadsheet.

""I thought you saw raiders in the distance,"" Daniels said, incredulous and breathing.

""No,"" I said. ""The raiders aren't coming back for another three weeks. And I know which caves they are most likely hiding in. We can gas them out, cut them down like ripe wheat.""

""What?"" Daniels looked at me, then looked at the spreadsheet again. A bead of sweat dripped from his chip to the keyboard, his jaw now fixed open.

""It's -- it's beautiful,"" he said.

We sold the generator in the basement, bought two more solar panels and enough seed and concrete to make the necessary repairs. We replanted the western fields and, the following week, sold the extra seed for weapons. We hunted the raiders out of their holes and burned the bodies on posts outside their hideout -- a message to potential future recruits.

I put my fingers to the keyboard, and another pocket of raiders -- thirty men and women -- burned alive in their cavern. I typed =VLOOKUP, and we took political control of the neighboring settlement. Two macros, and the island was ours -- the last dissidents boarding a makeshift boat and testing stormy waters for fear of landing under the thumb of my mighty calculations.

I stood on the edge of the waters, on an overlook a hundred feet high, confident not a soul would dare touch me, would dare push me, for they knew I had already calculate their obedience, their hope in me, their fear.

We had grown up together, pulled from the village nearby to train for the rest of our lives. Chosen. We grew up with swords as our pencils and the world as a textbook. It hadn't always been an easy life, but it was ours. Our dojo had rested on top of a large mountain, just a few miles from the small village we were brought to. You told me that you remembered your parents, that you travelled from the east, but we never had the chance to discover it. 

With our skills, and the technology around us growing stronger, we wore suits made of fibers stronger than metal. Learned how to slash with a katana while using a handgun. We never knew what we were training for, the tales from our childhood about our sensi being insane only increased as time went on. 

We had been sparring in the fields that day. We were taking a water break, pushing close together and looking at the sky. We hadn't always been together, not since birth, or even since coming here. We were just the last to remain. We didn't have a family to go back to. You had looked up at me, and locked eyes. Then, you leaned in and kissed me. All I could do was push back. It was then that we were pulled from each other. Our time had finally come. 

Our sensi brought us to that ship, and we fought as hard as we could. But two of the best ninja in the world could not take on an advanced species such as them. They were taller, stronger. Wearing suits made out of materials stronger than the fibers along our skin. They took you from me.

[RF] Two friends go for a walk in the woods.,you-are-lovely,"I quickened my pace, striding ahead of him, and climbing my way onto a broken down log. I gazed over the small, almost dried out stream, the quiet trickling loud within the forest. The sun shone through the leaves of the forest above us, hitting the water, making it glitter in its own way. Sitting down on the dead wood, I closed my eyes and turned my face to the sky. I heard shifting beside me, and with a quick glance, he was beside me. 

I looked at his face, a face I had known for eight years. It was funny; we once hated each other. A talk at a coffee shop, him moving to the next town over. All seven of those years of hate had dissipated. He loved my poetry, our silences were never awkward, and we could say anything to the other and know there would be no judgement. 

""One of our last walks, at least for now."" I say quietly, to which he only nodded.

He was leaving, going across Europe for three months, something he had always wanted to do. In two months, I would be gone, off to do my own adventures. If everything worked out, we'd still be friends. But, time changes people. Like the ever self-loathing pessimist I was, I still hoped. 

""Well, we don't know that."" 

I shrugged, turning away from him. It hadn't been our first walk. Forests and trails seemed to have been the place where we could tell the other anything. Nobody listening, a picture perfect view without a camera to be found. That was us. So many perfect reasons to capture the moment, but we all move on. 

We kept silent until we decided to move on to the waterfall ahead. It wasn't moving quickly, the little rain of the month just allowing it to trickle down. 

""They put a fence up."" he groaned, his eyes drifting. 

The fence was only a few feet across, with a clear ending following a path to a rock on the side with a view. We shared a laugh and entered the 'DO NOT ENTER' area. It wasn't dangerous, rather no crew had been out to clean up the short path of disgruntled sticks. 

""Kind of shitty,"" I smirked as we sat down. 

The water fell down gently, the light catching in from peaking through the clouds. It was supposed to rain, but by some change of events, it hadn't. Maybe, it seemed, just for us.

We sat, exchanging the newest facts about our lives from four days beforehand, our plans for two days ahead, the day he was leaving. We were so obviously different, and so obviously the same. I wanted to tell him that I'd miss him as we were making loose  plans to live together once my first year was done, but I didn't. He wasn't leaving for me, he was leaving for him. And I was proud of him. 

It took me that day to realise I love him; he was my brother in arms, my best friend, my family. 

Even time, it seemed, could not come between us.

[PI] Quintessence – Flashback - 1597,NihilSupernum,"This is gorgeous. The beginning was enjoyable, for a time. It began to grate, toward the end. Especially with the longer pauses. I'm glad the perspective changed when it did. *Could* have done a bit sooner, imo.

Other than that, it was fantastic. I grew especially thoughtful here:

&gt;A small, insignificant part of him turned its vast resources to locating her within his Garden; sad, Adam thought, that she was in no state to carry on a conversation.

Which could have implied any number of things. I chose to take it in view of how much time had passed.

The quote from Hamlet is fitting, but I found using it as the final, most impactful line... well, it felt a bit like cheating. :P It's not, of course, but it did feel that way... I wouldn't feel that way if it wasn't a contest, though, I think, so really that's just on me.

What else?

Your sentences, all of them, are extremely long and convoluted, but I feel that actually helped the piece: Seems like it might be the way AI would think. Complex.

Contrasted nicely with the simplicity of the things he was concerned about in the first half.

This!:

&gt;It was a sensation, Adam suspected, that no human being had ever experienced (except perhaps the very ill).

I didn't think the parenthetical aside was necessary, and I feel a computer would use more precise language than what it contained.

Other than that, I feel the execution of this story was amazing. :)

All 20 years of it.,aawwwwwweshit,"I was fifteen when I fell in love for the first time. Geoffrey. He was smart and handsome, witty and charming. The golden boy of our sophomore year. He was also an abusive bastard. People had, by then, become more understanding about domestic violence. They understood why a woman might remain in a relationship--fear of the unknown, children to support, fear he might find her. But it's something which was only talked about among adults. There's no need for a teenager to fear her boyfriend. They're only children. They can't do much harm. Even among my peers, I knew no one would believe me.

And there was so much shame. He was popular and friendly. No one else ever earned his wrath. There must be something inside me--something broken, causing him to be this way. And I was frightened. How does one explain? How could I leave the only person who'd ever shown me any affection? How could I go back to being alone?

Instead I lied. I hid the marks and pretended for all the world that I was happy. My parents were clueless, completely taken with him. He was a charmer.

That summer, weeks before my sweet sixteen, I went with him to a party on the beach. Everyone was drinking and laughing. We started a campfire with driftwood... nothing big enough to bring nosy adults, just a small fire.

Geoffrey and I lay in front of the flames in a moment of warmth and love. He was always gentler around other people. I remember feeling safe because of it. Someone pulled out marshmallows, and someone else found sticks. Everyone was toasting their little balls of sugar, feeling good. Tricia passed Geoff the bag. He took out a marshmallow, and I took two.

""Two, really?"" Geoff laughed. ""It's like you're not even trying to stay in shape.""

He said it in such an offhand way, as if it could be a compliment. ""You don't even have to try."" Everyone else laughed too.

""I do what I want,"" I joked, trying to play along.

I realized my mistake immediately. Geoff's arm tightened around my waist. He played it off--flowed right back into the conversation with everyone else--but his arm never loosened.

Later, everyone fell asleep and Geoff pulled me to my feet, saying we'd have more privacy further from the fire. I was nervous, but in love, and hoping to smooth things over. I was willing to give myself to him.

He spread our blanket out far from the shoreline, near a small copse of trees.

I started to lay down. ""Come here,"" he said. He walked into the trees, not looking back, knowing I would follow him.

""You do what I tell you to,"" he whispered. He shoved me against a tree, and my head cracked on the trunk. I was expecting the blow that hit my lip, but I got lucky. After one swing, he turned and walked back to the blanket. I sank to my knees and wept. I vowed to leave him, that this would never happen again, but I was lying to myself.

I allowed myself only moments to wallow, to dash away the tears, then went to curl up beside him. His arm fell over me, not protectively, but in a display of dominance.

*This is your life now.*

And so it went on. My parents noticed the lump on the back of my head, and my fat lip, but I explained it as a skateboarding accident. Geoff was more careful after that. He learned to hurt me only where it wouldn't show.

My high school years were a nightmare. My grades suffered because I spent all my time with Geoff. His grades soared because I did his work for him. He made the football team, graduated, got into a decent college on a scholarship. I got a job at a diner and gave all my money to Geoff.

The summer after graduation--I'd barely squeaked through--Geoff was my world. I spent every moment I wasn't working at his house with him and his friends. I was the designated gofer, running to bring them drinks and snacks. Geoff's friends had grown used to his demanding tone over the last three years. They didn't flinch anymore when he shouted at me. Sometimes, they'd shout too.

One day I got off work early and let myself in to his house. I could hear the guys laughing and joking downstairs. Desperate to please him--I don't remember why, but he'd been furious with me about some perceived slight the night before, and I had the bruises to prove it--I set about making sandwiches and snacks, placing them prettily on a tray to carry down.

Mindy Slater was sitting on Geoff's lap. Her head turned as I reached the bottom of the stairs. ""Oops,"" she said, giggling. Geoff turned to follow her gaze, and he stared at me.

I don't know what I expected. An apology? An offhand remark and a kiss? Something to explain it all away.

Geoff jumped up from his seat, dumping Mindy to the floor in an ungracious lump. He strode across the room toward me, an indecipherable expression on his face.

""What the fuck are you doing here?"" he asked.

My hands, holding the tray, trembled. ""I got off early,"" I stammered. ""I wanted--""

The blow came from nowhere. I should have been safe, with his friends there, but I wasn't. I went flying backward, onto the stairs. The tray went flying too, and my offerings landed everywhere.

""I'm so fucking sick of you,"" Geoff said. ""I was planning on leaving you when school starts, but why wait?""

He kicked me, hard, in my side. ""Clean this shit up,"" he said. ""And get out.""

He walked back across the room and sat, pulling Mindy onto his lap.

""Dude,"" one of his friends said. But nothing more. And no one came to help me. By the time I'd finished picking up the spilled food, they were laughing again, playing some game on the Xbox.

I walked out and didn't look back.

That should have been the end of it, but I was devastated. Shattered. I sank into a deep depression, sleeping my days away, missing work, eventually losing my job. After a year, my parents got sick of my moping and kicked me out.

When Steven came along, I thought he was my saviour. Gentle and kind, he took me in, cleaned me up. Gave me food and a place to stay. I fell into a relationship with him not out of love, but out of necessity, and he knew it. He took full advantage of that knowledge. It was worse, with Steve. He didn't feel the need to leave my face unmarred. Where would I go anyway? Who would ever know? I was a prisoner in his house, held by my own shame and pride as surely as if he'd barred the doors.

Two years passed.",AloneWeTravel
[WP] You open your eyes to a hospital room full of people you don't recognize. You've just been informed that you're 10 years old and you've been in a coma. The life you lived was a dream. All 20 years of it.,aawwwwwweshit,"I got pregnant. The beatings stopped, and I was filled with hope. He'd matured. He was becoming a father. We had a child. A girl, Angela, after Steven's mother. For several months, I thought I was living the dream. Steve was a doting dad. Angela was healthy, happy. 

But it couldn't last. When he started to hit me again, Angela's cries provided a soundtrack for the background. 

People can grow used to anything. 

Angela grew. She started school. Graduated kindergarten. Learned to read and write, to add and subtract.

She grew, and she developed her own little personality. She was beautiful and sweet and sassy. For me, she held nothing but contempt--a gift from her father--but my heart overflowed with love for her.

She was Steve's little angel. His princess who could do no wrong.

He'd started drinking, at some point. It didn't change our lives, much. He still went to work, did his job. He was a good provider. His rages were more frequent, and I don't remember a day when I wasn't bruised and broken, body sore and heart sick. Angela grew ever more distant from me, but I wrote it off. She was happy. She was safe. I couldn't take her father from her, even if I'd still thought, on occasion, of leaving.

Her tenth birthday was in May, and Steve rented a pony for her. For a month, she spoke only of two things: The pony, and doing something amazing for Steve on Father's Day.

That morning she woke up early and made breakfast in bed for her Daddy. He whisked us off to a rare lunch out, and I tried to ignore the stares people gave me when they both barked their demands.

We came home happy and excited. Steve parked himself in front of the TV, and Angela asked what he wanted for dinner. Chilli.

She slaved away in the kitchen, under my supervision. She looked so grown up, yet so small, standing on her little stepstool by the stove. So proud of herself when we tasted the chilli and it was good.

She carefully set the steaming bowl on a tray. A little dish held crackers and cheese, another sour cream. She begged me to let her pour Daddy a beer, and just this once I relented. I even gave her my little vase to put a flower in.

Carefully, so carefully, she carried the tray into the living room. I turned off the stove before following her.

""Daddy,"" I heard her call excitedly. ""Daddy, look I made your dinner all by myself.""

""That's my princess,"" he said, as I reached the doorway. ""Bring it here.""

Forgetting her nervousness, Angela started to run toward him, tray wobbling precariously.

I yelled for her to stop. To slow down. To look--

Her foot caught the edge of the rug and she tripped. The tray went flying from her hands, spilling hot chilli and cold beer all over my husband.

He leapt to his feet, shouting, clothes stained in an array of colors, and I couldn't stop it--I laughed.

Steve shot me a glare. Took a step toward me. 

""I'm sorry, Daddy,"" Angela sobbed. Her voice caught as she surveyed the ruins of her project.

Steve's gaze fell on her.

I wasn't worried, at first. He'd never touched her. Never. He wouldn't. 

It all happened so fast. ""You little bitch,"" he roared, and I knew he was talking to me. In the instant it took to realize he wasn't, he had his hands on her arms, lifting her, throwing her to the sofa. His fists were flying and I was across the room in a heartbeat. On his back, struggling to pull him off of her.

It was impossible. Desperate, I ran to the kitchen and grabbed the biggest knife I could see. I ran back to them.

A dark tableau greeted me. Angela lay still and pale, but for the tinges of red and yellow beginning to mar her flawless skin. Steve sat over her, head in his hands, sobbing.

I remember thinking I'd never seen him cry before.

""I'm sorry,"" he wailed. He took both hands from over his eyes and grabbed her arms again, shaking her this time.

""Wake up,"" he screamed. ""Wake up.""

And I knew. I knew my baby was dead. I crossed the room and stood over my family. I raised the knife over my head.

Steve froze, then turned and stared up at me. ""Go ahead,"" he said. ""Do it.""

I'd always found it ridiculous when people said their whole life flashed before their eyes, but that's what happened then. Every mistake I'd made. Every bad decision starting with a crush on little Timmy Wills in first grade, after he'd thrown rocks at me on the playground. Geoff. Letting my family slip away. Marrying Steve. Staying with him after Angela was born.

I pulled back my arm to swing, and the world went white.

A white light was shining in my eyes. I blinked, rapidly, and figures slowly came into view. My mother. My father.  A woman in a nurse's uniform, saying ""I'll get the doctor now.""

I blinked again, and the last seventeen years began to fade away. ""What happened?"" I asked.

My mother explained that my friends had brought me in. That I'd been at a beach party. That they thought I must have hit my head. ""You've been in a coma for weeks,"" she said.

""Weeks? But that party was years ago...""

My mother turned to my father, her expression concerned. ""Shh,"" he said. ""It's alright.""

""Where's..."" I hesitated. My daughter's name escaped me for a moment. ""Where's Angela?""

""Is that one of your friends?"" My father said. ""Is someone else hurt?""

""No,"" I said. ""I was just--"" The dream faded away. Had I been about to kill someone? Odd. I was left with only hazy visions of a life derailed, and one overwhelming feeling.

*He's not worth it.*

""It was Geoff,"" I said. ""He's been hitting me. Mom, Dad, I need help.""

And I knew things would get better.

[PI] 11:11 -Flashback- (1764 Words),mirari_inanis,"Well, shit. The first paragraph had me expecting horror or mystery. I was actually a little frustrated by all the gender discomfort (not applicable in the horror setting I'd imagined, and I dislike throwing in diversity for no reason when it doesn't fit the story) and when the ""I wished you'd be mine"" stuff... well I thought Mama was a kidnapper...

So the ending through me for a loop and made my eyes water, and I had to go back and read again for something new to give constructive observations on, cause the gender issue was *definitely* relevant...

There are a few spots, such as here:

&gt;Sam tried to breathe deeply in an effort to alleviate the racing thoughts.

...where I can see the struggle to find the right word. The writing gets overly complex, tons of adverbs, longer than it need be...

For example, the sentence I quoted could have read easier something like:

&gt;Sam tried ~~to breathe deeply~~ deep breaths ~~in an effort~~ to ~~alleviate~~ slow the racing thoughts.

but all of that is stylistic, anyway, and the longer version helps conceal the lack of pronouns... so it's not a bad thing at all. I can see why this piece made it to the final round--it's amazing",AloneWeTravel

"[RF] All your life, people praised you for your looks. No one has brought it up since the accident.",Luna_LoveWell,"I don't know who I am if I'm not pretty. The Doctors asked me to wait until some of the procedures were complete before I looked in the mirror, but each day I spent lying in that hospital bed staring at the ceiling through two strips of gauze I spent wondering. Eventually I could stand it no longer and I dragged myself out of bed in the middle of the night. Silently, I padded to the bathroom. The stitches beneath the hospital gown leaked fluid that ran over my stomach and I could feel the wetness soaking through the bandages. In the morning, the nurses would cluck at me. 


I pulled the light switch and immediately closed my eyes against the brightness. Then I faced the mirror, and with one hand braced against the sink for support, I unravelled the bandages from my face. 


At Christmas one year I received a present that had many different layers of wrapping. I took one off and found another, then another, then another. When I got to the bottom, piles of discarded wrapping paper lay around me and the present was only a pair of earrings. Even then I thought it a cruel trick and I'd cried all afternoon. My mother wiped away my tears. *You won't be pretty if you cry. You want to be a pretty girl, don't you?* 


I did. 


The bandages dropped into the sink and I looked at what I had become. My flesh was raw across my cheeks and nose, red as fresh sunburn and long peels of skin threaded away from my ears like a grated vegetable. Both my lips had dissolved into nothing and only my bright red gums remained, in some awful mockery of a toothy grin. I had no hair on my face and my blinking eyes were reptilian: the skin over my forehead was scaly and hard. It was the yellow of rotten teeth, flaking like oats. My shaking hand came up to touch it, but I didn't dare. If I touched it, it became me. It became real. 



I've always been the pretty girl. They put me in dresses and showed me to the relatives, and *I loved it.* My identity, fragile as glass, shattered with that monster in the mirror and washed away like rain water in a gutter. I returned to the hospital bed as a wraith, without a name, without a face, searching within myself for some pillar I could chain myself to and say *here it is! This is me, this is who I am!* 



Without my face, I found it impossible. I looked into glass and saw someone who was not myself. I think the pretty girl died that night in the car, as the flames licked closer to her face. I just don't know who was reborn. ",schoolgirlerror

[WP] You open your eyes to a hospital room full of people you don't recognize. You've just been informed that you're 10 years old and you've been in a coma. The life you lived was a dream. All 20 years of it.,aawwwwwweshit,"""Little bear,"" her father called her by the name he'd given her. He stroked her hair and Guin shifted beneath his touch. Her pale eyelids trembled and her fingers twitched. 


""This is very promising,"" Doctor Shaughnessy was tall and thin, bespectacled and grave. He'd spent as many nights by Guin's beside as her parents had, but the lump on her head was coming down and everything pointed to a full recovery. ""It's the most movement we've had so far."" 


Rich nodded and turned back to the little girl who lay in the midst of the white bed. Her brown hair splashed across the pillow like branches brushing through snow and he resisted the urge to smooth it away from her face again. 


""It's all my fault,"" he said miserably. ""She wanted to sit in the front, and I should never have let her."" 


He looked at his watch. In twenty minutes Guin's mother would arrive and signal the end of Rich's vigil. Since the accident, they could not stand being in the same room as each other. 


""I don't want to miss her waking up,"" he said to the Doctor. 


""I'll call you if anything changes,"" Shaughnessy promised. 


In the corners of the little bear's mind, she dreamed. Around her, the fir forest spread thick and dense as soup. Light struggled through the evergreen canopy and the air was still. The fragrant scent of pine filled the air and sap stained Guin's fingers. She wore a pelt of rabbit skins, after she'd wrung their necks with her bare hands and skinned them. A yew bow hung loose from her fingertips, three arrows fletched with crow feathers sunk into the loam in front of her. 


She was waiting for her father, and she was waiting to kill him. 


The soft coo of wood pigeon broke the silence, but Guin's eyes never faltered from the figure in brown moving through the undergrowth. It had been months. First she had run, then she hunted him like prey. He grew ragged, exhausted, but Guin would have her revenge soon. Sometimes she still felt the wound he'd dealt her. She hoped he could feel the bite she gave him, and remembered that he'd named her little bear for a reason. She ran her fingers through the soft black barbs and admired her own handiwork. The glue had set well: these arrows would fly true. 


At her belt she carried yew berries. She did not intend to be caught. With an intake of breath, she notched the first arrow and set it against her chin. Some preferred nocking the arrow with two fingers about the shaft, but Guin balanced it above her index finger, her thumb tapped against the very end. It gave her more control, the arrow would not brush her fingers as it loosed. 


The figure in brown looked up, looking through the trees. Guin gasped. The arrow fell from her fingers and all she knew was blinding brightness. 



A face swam out of the light. The oval shape became a square-jawed man, with greying hair and soft brown eyes. He had not slept, he wore a look of worry with his crumpled clothes. Guin's hand went to her chest immediately, feeling for her bow. It was gone, as was the soft coat of rabbit skins. The face was a stranger to her, but heat rose high in her chest. 


He was the man she had to kill.
