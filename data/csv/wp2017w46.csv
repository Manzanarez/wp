From the perspective of an aspiring world dominator, deconstruct the trope and tell us how you obtained and maintain everything.",Therandomfox,"""Without evil there can be no good, so it must be good to be evil sometimes.""

This quote is not from the most [studious source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4XXm8OUP4) I know, but it rings true. People have the gall to call me evil. But is it really as bad as what so-called *legitimate* governments get up to on a daily basis hmm?

It's not evil. It's envy. Plain and simple. My goal is no different to theirs, I'm just more honest about it. And you can never see it in black and white either you know, it's never as simple as that.

Take my headquarters. Yes, headquarters. Not a base, not a lair or a war room. It's a simple place I occupy as to continue my work. It isn't connected to the power grid, it isn't in the middle of some jam packed city centre. More people should build in volcanoes you know, the geothermal potential alone makes it cost effective. And all those scientific groups measuring volcanic activity...where do you think they get their data from? It isn't some plastic box in the middle of a field let me tell you.

Oh and my staff, don't get me started! Usually it's commendable when a company takes on those who have had troubled pasts. Perhaps they made mistakes, maybe they've served their time and paid for them. But when *I* approach such people I'm hiring evil lackeys to do my *evil* bidding. It's nonsense!

People come to me because I know how to treat my workers. Give me an example, a civilian example - military is cheating - that offers their staff an actual, real fresh start? Full training, accommodation, a career for life! There's travel opportunities, the chance to get involved with cutting edge technology and be at the forefront! I have people who should be awarded the Nobel Prize for their work, but they don't get recognition for anything. Nope, it's ""security risk"" this and ""immoral experiments"" that.

Meanwhile the spies, government suits, the CIA or the FBI or MI5 or whoever. Those are the real bad guys, and they get a pat on the back for their service to their country. This hypocrisy never ceases to amuse me. If I see a law for what it is and I break it, that makes me a criminal. If *they* see a law they don't like, they simply change the law. Is that fair? Is that justice?

Think about it sir. Any reasonable mind can and will very quickly conclude that what I do is simply what anyone else does. Again, I am just more honest about it. Here, take my details. You appear to have a level head on your shoulders. If you need such a change yourself, contact my people.",Coupaholic
[WP] It is completely casual for everyone to be very violent,emanresueqinu,"I was out of my seat before she finished her sentence.  I grabbed a handful of her hair and almost lifted her off the ground by it as I started to slapping her across the face.  I was nearly twice her size and after the third hit she collapsed to the ground.  I wasn't about to let go and I went down with her.  

I balled my hand into a fist and raised it, ready to strike the waitress as I shouted at her.

""No, Pepsi is not okay!  I wanted Co-""

The world went white.  The hit wasn't hard, but when you knee a man in nature's great equalizer it doesn't take much force to take the fight out of him.  I should have been careful about how I landed on her, but I was too worked up.  Pepsi?  I mean come on.  It's 2017, for god's sake.  What kind of a restaurant doesn't have Coke?

""We do have Dr. Pepper, though,"" she said as she stood up, blood trickling down her nose.  One of her cheeks was bright red.

""Oh, well why didn't you just say so?"", I asked with a smile.  ""That's even better than Coke!""

She helped me back into my chair (I was still pretty out of breath) and left to get our drinks while my friend Steve and I opened our menus.

""So what's good here?""

""Oh, you've gotta get the tuna steak, man,"" Steve insisted.  ""It's to die for.""

""Sounds like a plan.  Any way, about that merger.""  The two of us closed our menus and discussed the merger that the day's lunch meeting was all about.

After a few minutes of business talk the waitress returned with our drinks.  My Dr. Pepper came in one of those glass bottles you hardly ever see.  

""Now what can I get you boys to eat?"", the waitress asked us.

""We both want the tuna steak.  I've been talking it up to my buddy here, and he's excited to try it.""

""Oh, sug, I got bad news for you.""

""Oh no,"" Steve said with a frown.  ""You guys aren't out of tuna, are you?""

""No, but we've only got one tuna steak left.  Only one of you boys can get it.""

As one, Steve and I turned away from the waitress and made eye contact.  He grabbed his fork off the table as I grabbed by bottle of Dr. Pepper by the neck.  I smashed it on the table and leaped over it at Steve, aiming the jagged glass at his throat.  ",Ragnrok

The sphere is levitating in the sky, inside thousands of lights are moving and twisting and becoming a mesh that looks like a Christmas glass toy that reflects all the lights. It becomes more intense until the whole room is light and you can see everything as if you were outside in the middle of a sunny day. The light expands some more, and now all is white, the wizard can't keep his eyes open and has to turn away from the light. A great of powerful wind fills the room, it seems to be coming from the spehre but the wizard can' tell for sure, the light disappears the room is returned to its murky darkness

"" Come forth Arstatoh, the archdemon, the hater of humans, heed to me and fulfill your mission"" he reads from the book of summonings 

""  Who calls me"" the archdemon responds, her voice resonates 

"" It's Arion the Fourth, from the great family of Dark Summoners, and I call you to complete your mission and bring destruction upon the unmagic humans"" he speaks with confidence

"" I am not going to"" she responds

"" Ummm.. what, I Like did all that the book said, shouldn't you like do what I command you to ?"" he is surprised

"" Dude, like that book, is old as fuck, you know even we magic creatures evolve, but that aside I am a changed creature, you know humans are pretty funny and they have troubles too"" 

"" I don't give a damn about that, I want you to kill them not give me a speech on how they are so great"" he is furious "" just murder them and be done with it"" 

"" I see in you the same furry that I experienced  before I was put into this magical prison, but through ages of observation I realized that we and they are not that different, so there is no real distinction between us, so I learned to respect them for what they are and not for what I perceived them to be"" she says in a calm voice

"" You sound like a yoga instructor that tries to convert people into whatever religion Gandhi  believed in, can't you  be a well-spirited archdemon and destroy them all "" he is mildly annoyed 

"" No, I changed my way, I don't want to be held down by the stereotype of evil archdemons, I won't let semantics and history decide what I do with my life, I am my own archdemon and I decided that humans are okay and that it's up to them to live in peace or war"" her tone does not change.

"" Fuck this"" he turns around and leaves

The archdemon looks around the dark room and sees nothing interesting to look at, she sees the door that the wizard left open, she flies through it in her astral body. She is in the underground prison called Hell, by its creator, it's a prison built into a canyon, the light of the sun never touches its deeper level and she was one one of them. Now she leaves this dark and unattractive place and flies up int othe sky where the pale white moon shines its silver down on Earth. Taking a seat on the mountain that is only 200 miles away, she looks at the moon and dreams of another time that she has seen two humans enjoy the moon and build their love beneath it. She is free now, and she wants to see more love and peace in the world  and she'll use her power to do exactly that.       ",Foxboi

A heavy set of chains fell onto the chiselled sandstone floor, and along with it a hulking, demonic figure.

""I'd figured it'd take more than a set of steel chains to bind one of the Archdemon, though I have to admit, whichever sorcerer bound you hired a pretty decent metallurgist.""

""Who are you?"" The ruins shuddered as an otherworldly growl thundered out from the archdemon.

""Oh, you know, just your run-of-the-mill dark wizard, looking to form a pact with an Archdaemon to reconstruct the world in my image.""

""Oh, so you're one of those. Rather straightforward, aren't you?""

""Yep. Dad always told me to stay chill when conversing with demons. Fear makes us tastier, or whatever.""

""Well, I have a little bad news for ya."" The demon got onto his feet and looked at the bespectacled little man at his feet, emanating an almost unnoticable aura of dark magic.

""What is it? I'm pretty sure the sacrifice I made was sufficient. The books said to 'sacrifice a goat and carve a pentagram into its hide to reinforce ye dark magicks, then break the bonds of the entity ye wish to contract with.'"" The dark wizard pulled a book best described as 'emo kid diary meets aspiring teen goth poet' out of his gucci bag, gesturing at the lines in question.

""Well, color me surprised. I didn't expect actual dark magic out of that joke of a grimoire. That's why I love humans!"" The demon took a few seconds to stop laughing. ""That being said, I'm afraid your vessel lacks the propensity to control even the amount of magic required to pull of a contract with a bunny rabbit, much less an Archdemon. Also that whole destroying humanity business isn't something I'm interested in anymore.""

""Isn't that supposed to be your whole deal? Making contracts with greedy, power hungry humans to end all of humanity and plunge this rotten world into hell? Any of that ring a bell?""

""Nope.""

You mean I wasted a small fortune on a dubious keystone, snuck all the way into a heavily guarded excavation site, bought and killed a goat that I'm can't even eat (I'm vegan by the way), all that for nothing?""

""Yep.""

""Great. Just great. For all I know, you could just be some lesser demon masquerading as an archdemon just to annoy me. First, having dark magic 'isn't a qualification' to enter that course. Then, using dark magic to rob a bank is apparently a silly idea, and after all that, society decides that having dark magic is barely good enough to be a cashier at a stupid convenience store. 

""Ummm...""

And now my black magic isn't even enough to contract with a lousy joke of a demon who can't even escape these stupid steel chains.""

""I think you're misunderstanding something."" The demon flexed lightly, shattering the steel bindings on his wrists. The color drained from the dark wizard's face as an immeasurable amount of malevolent energy began seeping out of the demon's frame. ""The sorcerer who sealed me away did enchant these chains. But as he did so, he made a deal with me. The enchantment was always meant to be temporary. He simply wanted me to watch you mortals struggle for a millennium or so, then decide if I should destroy mankind for good."" 

The dark wizard, thoroughly terrified, barely managed to gasp out a question, ""Your decision?""

""Well, you're still alive, aren't you?""

""Oh.""

""Watching you mortals is like watching myself in my earlier years struggling to amass power in my homeworld. I mean, you guys are stupid, violent, have basically no ability to work together, and are all around incompetent."" The archdemon let out a long, nostalgic sigh. ""Much like I was back when I was still a child. So I figured, if your kind is to be destroyed, you'll be the ones who pull the trigger. And if Man manages to gain power that rivals that of an Archdemon, well,"" the demon smiled ""that would make for a far more interesting fight, wouldn't it?""

The Archdemon did a few stretches as the dark wizard regained his faculties. By now, the malevolent aura had faded, absorbed back into the demon. ""You do what you want to do. I'll be watching from home. A word of advice, though. You're lucky you tried to contract with me first. Try contracting with any other being with that level of magic and you'll either be devoured or worse. You think demons are bad, wait till you meet the angels."" With that, the demon vanished into a portal of pure darkness that closed behind him.

The dark wizard mustered what little energy he had left and walked back to the entrance of the ruins, turning himself in to the guards. Given that he had taken nothing, he was released with a stern warning against trespassing. He then walks into the nearest convenience store and applied for a job as a cashier. He had decided to stop being an evil wizard. ""At least that way,"" he thought to himself, ""I probably won't be dead anytime soon.""",heyfreakybro

"[WP] In a world with superheroes, villains and secret identities, blind dates awkwardly dance around the question- ""Do you have a superpower?""",Barcid,"It was our second honeymoon. Mary and I had been traveling the world together for a while now, and had no plans on stopping anytime soon. We were good for each other. She was serious, and driven, and forward-thinking. 


And I...


""Remember our first date, back in the cafe on that little island -""


I was sort of an ass. But in a roguish way, I hoped. She was too good for me, and I strove to make sure she never came to realize it.


""Hawaii?"" Her eyebrow raised with incredulity, but her smile was soft and knowing. I had to try harder than usual to get a real rise out of my wife, these days. 


""That's the one. We'd both just come down from the same floor of the hotel, the street music was too loud, the coffee was too expensive, everyone was roaring drunk and groping- ""


""Including you, ass!"" 


""Guilty, no argument there. I'm not complaining about where it got me though. We got wasted, went back to your room. It was so romantic, thinking back.""


""Romantic? I asked if you had powers and you laughed in my face!""


""I leaned in, kissed you, and asked the same - 'Would I be hooking up with writers in Hawaii if I did?' - though it was probably a bit more slurred than that."" She was blushing now, biting her lip. Just a bit more teasing to get her out of her shell.


The earth shuddered, then. An alarm - one I'd always feared - blared off into the night, cutting through the traffic-noise and city buzz. 


It had to happen eventually - the League of Villains had never attacked the same city twice in a row before, and I'd kept a stable job writing articles about the aftermath of their attacks. 


It was a risk I'd accepted - that they'd break form and do something while I was still around. It was a fear, but one I'd come to terms with. There were shelters, and heroes - nothing organized, it didn't pay enough to keep up with the casualty count. They'd be driven off - allow themselves to be driven off, for whatever twisted reason - before they could do too much damage. 


I hoped.


What rattled me was Mary's reaction. I'd never seen her afraid - never seen her hands tremble like they were now.


She placed a tenner on the table between us. And as she rose into the air, tears streaming from eyes hidden behind dark bangs, I heard a whisper on the wind. 


""I love you.""

[WP] An online predator convinces his victim to meet up with him in person. It turns out that the victim is actually a predator as well.,Leehoohn200,"“This is gonna be good.”

Sylvester licked his lips in anticipation as he waited for his prey. He knew what he was doing was wrong, but he couldn’t help himself. For the past week, he’d been chatting online with a young boy, pretending to be a girl interested in him. Eventually, he convinced the boy to meet him in real life.

At that same moment, Nestor walked slowly down the street. He was meant to meet up with a girl he met on the Internet. He was nervous. He wasn’t supposed to do it, but he snuck out to meet her. As he turned the corner, he saw a figure standing against a wall. She seemed awfully tall. Nestor approached anyway and called out.

“Hello! Are you Roseanne?”

Sylvester stood up straight and looked toward the sound, hunger in his eyes. 

“Yes. I am.”

That hunger was immediately replaced with confusion. Before him was a sleazy looking man with a scraggly beard and a hoodie, much like himself. The two looked at each other before realizing what had happened.

“Shit.”

They both spoke at once and awkwardly walked around. 

“So, had much luck recently? Uh, besides this I mean.”

“I’d kinda prefer if we just left here and forget about this, alright?”

“Okay. Uh ... bye then.”

They turned to walk away when they heard a noise.

“Hey you two! Stop right there!” 

They looked up to see a police officer ready to draw his weapon. They both bolted. They ran right into a pair of officers that cane around behind them.

“So, what do you think you’re doing down here?”

The officer gestured around at the overpass above them and the trash all around their feet. The two criminals gulped and resigned themselves to the long day ahead of them.

-------------------------------

Secretary of Defense James Mattis was busy reading through Seventh Fleet C4I-MD reports when an odd sound caught his attention. His aides knew that he wasn't to be disturbed this late unless the President had totally flown off the handle, and while that was certainly always on the table his aides arriving was usually predated by somewhere between one and thirty thousand texts, emails, and calls asking, essentially, what the fuck the President of the United States was on about. 

Keeping the albatross that was US led military and intelligence sharing coalitions around the globe running smoothly in the face of the rhetoric coming out of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave was a job for about one thousand of the best and brightest the world had to offer; America had Mattis and a really expensive Keurig machine that were almost keeping abreast of it. *On the other hand* he mused, *I'm busy daydreaming about how hard my job is again instead of actually doing it.*

He had just bent back over the memo from Admiral Smith when the sound caught his ears again. A sort of hissing scrape, like a red hot blade being drawn across wet concrete. There was nothing in or around his office that could have made that noise, let alone should.

It took more than a strange noise to raise the nerves of a marine, but he was looking for an excuse not to read anyway, so why not go for a quick look? Mattis braced his hands on the desk and levered himself out of his chair, standing and stretching stiff limbs. He didn't like to think of himself as older than the day they'd fitted him for his first uniform, and knew he was still in pretty decent shape, but this job was wearing on him. Running a hand through his hair he wondered who would have the worse pre / post presidency stress-aging pictures, him or the president. 

That was a laugh, not that he would ever indulge in it as he crossed the room. Nor tell anyone the thought had so much as occurred to him; there was work to be done for his country, and it needed to be done. That was that. He reached the door to his office and opened it out into the hall. The breath caught in his throat as he stared down the tang of a broadsword leveled at his throat. 

A touch over three feet of steel, his mind provided first. Slightly under four pounds of weight, a slow weapon, but a devastating one against an unarmed opponent if he let it have the advantage of reach. The man holding it didn't seem to be putting any particular effort into holding the blade at full extension of his arm away from the chest, which immediately made perfect sense, as he was *huge*. Likely seven feet at the shoulders, broad barrel shaped torso attached to powerful arms and legs - the overall picture wasn't quite human. Too stocky to be that tall. Like someone put Shaquille O'Neal through a strongman competition. He'd make The Mountain look like a molehill. 

He was armored, though not in any material Mattis recognized. It was done in colors of red and black, with the reds running the gamut from rust to scarlet - but seeming to always settle and pool like blood. The smell of him was nearly unbearable; smoke and ash, pain and copper. He took a half step back from the strange figure as a voice began to grate against the air near his ears, ""If you refuse to abandon this path, I will give no quarter."" 

There seemed almost a twinge of regret in that pronouncement, but marines weren't normally men to engage in analyzing the psyche of men waving swords at them. Mattis surged forward, attempting to lock his forearms against the arm of his assailant and drag the weapon point to the floor. His hands found purchase on the leathery surface of his assailants armor, but the arm refused to budge even as he laid nearly his entire weight on the elbow as a fulcrum. There was an explosion of pain somewhere above his ear, and he fell to the floor against the wall trying to sort out the stars and false images to get a focus on the threat - finding himself once again pinned by the point of that sword, this time in a much less defensible position. 

Again, that grating rasp seemed almost to scrape against his ears, coming from everywhere and nowhere, ""The man you serve was chosen to a purpose, and my brothers and I intend to see it through. Stand down from preventing the war your leader so desires, or you shall be destroyed.""

He didn't know who this man was, or who his brothers thought they were; but he knew what he was being asked to do. How many people he was asking be left to die. If this asshole didn't know the sort of man marines were, he'd welcome the chance to teach him. 

""Semper Fi, motherfucker."" Mattis roared as he tried to sweep the legs out from under his assailant. 

-------------------------------------------

The horse was red, like not the sort of red you see on a coke can - okay, but red. Like blood, or the fine center cut of a Trump Steak sold in the Sharper Image. It's hooves seemed almost to smolder, and the smoke they put off - I tell you I've never smelled anything like it. Like the smell of death, of flames, worse than anything I've ever experienced, and I was in New York when the Towers fell. But my mind wasn't on any of that, it was on the man atop the horse. 

On the sword he was leveling at my face. 

""When word reaches you of your commander's demise, carry on. Your fight is the most important one man will ever know."" His voice hurt, like being forced to listen to Lyin' Ted at a debate, or trying to have a dinner conversation with Christie, but when some seven foot tall guy on a warhorse starts waving a sword around, I know which way the wind is blowing, that makes me smart.

Even when I finally took the advice of my old war buddies and headed down to Thailand in the Christmas of 04’ for a month of decadence, mama nature decided that I needed to see the biggest fuckin’ tsunami ever upclose. “Lucky” for me, I was kept up late by that massage girl from the night before, else I probably would have drowned along with the other tourists.

Looking back, I probably would have opted to take that way out. Two months after that trip, I start coughing real bad and the doc tells me I got some weird cancer with 1 year to live. But somehow, my body decided to survive longer than that, blessing me with a few additional years to nurse bloody coughs. At least I had more time with Thumper.

But one fine winter’s evening, as I was sitting in my armchair watching old Christmas reruns, I finally felt my lungs give way. Strength ebbed away from my fingertips and my vision of the crackling fireplace began to melt away into darkness, my last image being Thumper’s golden form curled up peacefully by my feet.

The darkness felt cathartic. No longer bound by the physical plane, my soul felt free, wind neither warm nor cool howling around me as I soared to an unknown height. *Maybe this was how Neil Armstrong felt in space. But where are the stars? Oh there’s one.* The star grew bigger, glowing brighter at an alarming rate. I raised my arm to shield my ey-

“GET UP MAGGOT. YOU’RE IN GOD’S ARMY NOW. FLY UP AND GIVE ME TWENTY LOOPS.”

*What the fuck?*

“PRIVATE COOPER. NEED I REPEAT MYSELF?”

I was on a cloud. Wearing a toga. 

“Private Cooper?” I blurted out loud.

I was a Corporal! 

“THAT’S WHAT IT SAYS ON YOUR UNIFORM NO?”

I looked down at my toga. Sure enough, embroided in fancy gold were the letters: “PVT Cooper”

*What the fuck.*

“IS THIS YOUR ATTEMPT AT INSUBORDINATION PRIVATE? CAUSE GENERAL SEUSS HAS A GOOD METHOD TO STRAIGHTEN YOUR KIND OUT.”

“Who the hell is General Seuss?” 

“WHAT DO YOU THINK THE G IN G-SEUSS STANDS FOR? AND THAT’S TWO WEEKS DETENTION FOR DROPPING THE H-BOMB.”

“Why are you shouting?”

Toga wearing drill sarge was livid now. Well, livider than before. He was about grab me by the toga but stopped as another toga toting idiot walked up to him, a parchment in hand. After whispering a few words in private, Toga Sarge turns back to me, his angry demeanour replaced with a disturbing grin.


“Well well. It seems here that we had a little admin hiccup. Corporal Peter fucked up. You,” he bent down and ripped off the golden embroidery on my toga, “are a mass murderer.”

“I was a soldier-”


“Shut up. You’re someone else’s problem now.”

A bolt of lightning struck down from the sky (sky’s sky?) and blasted a hole in my cloud where I sat, sending me on a rapid downward spiral. When I landed, the place had changed. Gone were the fluffy clouds and blue skies, I was now in a courtroom (?) of sorts. *A courtroom made out of brimstone.* Sitting at the judge’s podium was a bored looking demon whom I could only assume was the devil. He looks down at the paper in his hand.

“Oh, another transfer. They really ought to just have Peter crucified. Alright let’s see...mass murder, world war, yada yada. Heaven and their stupid rules, no wonder they only have pansies in their army.” he looked up. 

“You, Cooper. You like lava cake?”

*What the fuck?*

“Not really no.” 

“Alright good. Drown him in lava three times and let him go.” said Satan, waving for two burly demon guards to take me away.

***

“Hold still.” said Demon Guard #1 as he chained my hands to the wall. I was in a deep pit

“I know he said drown me in lava but can I ask what is going on?” 

Demon #1 stopped and turned to me, his face bored.

“Look man, when I got here, that fucker gave me continuous circumcision. For a month.”

I winced. 

“Lava drowning is easy.”

*Alright then.*

Demon #1 stepped out of the pit and put his hand on the lever.

“You can try closing your eyes.” he offered helpfully.

“Thanks buddy.”

“Ready?”

“Wait. Do you get to choose your own horns.”

“No.”

“Cool.”

He pulled the lever. Somewhere above, something clicked and I saw it. Glowing bright orange, the lava tipped into the pit in slow sludgy motion. 

I have no idea how I felt no fear up till this moment. My human instinct kicked in and I panicked. Lava bad. Lava bad! But, seeing as I was chained pretty firmly to the wall, I could do nothing but allow the lava to completely engulf me. 

You know how sometimes when you cut yourself but feel no pain till much later? 

Well this was not one of those times. Every fibre of my being seared with agony, and I was pretty sure I pissed myself. But as quick as the pain had come, it also passed quickly as my body shut down and allowed me to slip into the bliss of oblivion. 

Darkness again. Then slowly, I begin to hear a muffled sound. Was that a dog? Maybe it’s that three headed thing that guarded hell.

I jolted awake.

I was back in my arm chair. Thumper was at my feet, barking. His head damp. Then it hit me.

I had pissed myself sleeping.

Twelve were headed toward inhabited asteroids, four at major population centers on the system's most highly populated planet and the remaining four at the largest fueling depots in the system.

""Why not?"" Shard said with a smirk. ""What possible consequences could there be?""

""Well, none I guess but still I don't understand why."" Charm continued staring at the screen as the pods continued to pick up speed.

""It will likely take two weeks for the missiles to reach their targets after the finish their acceleration. We'll be gone by then. There isn't any need to worry.""

Charm's chair positioned itself under her as she let her legs go limp, catching her as she expected. ""Missiles? They're just empty cans Shard, not explosives.""

""With the amount of kinetic energy they'll have upon arrival, that's the only way to classify them. Even if the planet bound pods break apart in atmosphere, their shrapnel will still destroy the cities they're aimed at.""

""They'll figure it out."" Charm said with a frown. ""It won't be hard to figure out who did it.""

""So? Our system isn't part of their bloc. I doubt someone starts a war over this. Why would they?"" 

""Anger, revenge?""

""Putting resources into that would be a waste. None of these people want to fight. The last large scale conflict...""

""Happened over a century ago, yes, yes. I remember my history lessons. But why risk it? What happens if the Monitors decide to come after us?""

""Monitors? Have you ever seen one? Even if they do decide to intervene, we just outrun them, head to a neutral bloc of systems."" 

""Those people though, they've done nothing to us."" Charm stood up, and began pacing. People died sometimes, yes, but no one she'd known in her lifetime. It was almost a foreign concept to her but it felt wrong. People didn't just die, especially not like this. ""I've got a bad feeling that this won't be something that will just blow over.""

""Maybe I don't want it to Charm, though I imagine it will."" His face had lost it's usual look of apathy. He now looked overly content with himself. ""Two hundred years without a war, we've stagnated, gotten complacent. Did you know some of the largest leaps in technology happened during wartime? Nuclear physics, rocket propulsion, medical advancements all of them the result of necessity..."" He had now begun to pace back and forth. ""We haven't had a decent increase in interstellar travel in decades, fusion is still not as efficient as it could be. We need this, we need to be pushed. We'll likely have to do this again and again. We'll have to keep pushing until something breaks.""

Charm looked back at the screen, the projection had zoomed out to show the outmost planet's orbit. ""Innocent people will die Shard.""

""And the rest of us will continue to evolve Charm. My hope is that this will spur another golden age where we can unite the blocs into something more. Something that can get us out of our galaxy before the others recede into nothingness."" 

Charm cringed as he put his hand on her shoulder. It was odd, she'd always looked up to Shard, but suddenly that had changed. She'd never been afraid of her brother before, but the man standing behind her frightened her. ""I have to warn them Shard. I can't let them..."" she stopped for a few seconds, trying to focus on her link to the ship. ""You've severed my comms.""

""You can have them back once the pods find their targets. Many people will be spared, I promise. I'm sure the targets will pick them up and plot their trajectories in time to get most of the residents out of danger. For the ones who aren't spared... We'll just have to try and remember their sacrifice."" 

Charm stared at the screen as Shard commanded the computer to lock her out of the controls. *We'll likely have to do this again and again* he'd said. She let her tears fall as she thought of the men and women who would be vaporized, about how her brother had likely forfeited both his and her life for what he was deeming the greater good.

"[WP] Time is turned back 5 years for everyone on Earth. Everyone wakes up exactly where they were 5 years prior. All progress undone, those dead now alive, with all memories of what's to come.",EducationNut,"After the dream I had it felt strange to be alive. I remember hearing that if you die in a dream, you die in real life. That's why you always wake before hitting the ground when you fall, or when you run from something it never catches you. I always thought that saying was sketchy, and I guess I was right. I had died in my dream.

It was a long dream, almost exhausting. It started out normal enough. Greg came over to visit me, as he often did. He showed up right after I woke up - I had overslept again. He hated when I did that. He hated a lot of things I did actually. That was part of the problem.

We went for breakfast. There was a diner downtown. My dad used to take me there when I was young. Greg knew I loved it there. I always got the blueberry pancakes - when I was a kid I'd get chocolate chip, but my dad always got blueberry. Sometime when I was thirteen I ordered blueberry too. Dad wasn't there for me to tell him how right he was - sometimes chocolate wasn't better. 

Greg was always very supportive when it came to me bettering myself. I appreciated that, I did, but sometimes he could be a bit much. It was hard to enjoy a date with him constantly reminding me how fat had gotten, how good I was doing, and how I really don't need all those carbs from those pancakes. He was right, of course, but I couldn't treat myself every once in a while? I had lost ten pounds already. I thought he'd be proud of me. 

Him teasing me was common. It wasn't something I enjoyed or something I put up with, but apparently dream-me wasn't having it. I left halfway through breakfast, my dream mind intent on walking the ten-mile trip home. He chased after me. His hand  crushed my upper arm. He said nothing, but pulled me into his car. An older couple saw it happen. The man started to come towards us, probably one of those busy-bodies who thinks anytime someone is slightly harsh with a lady it requires intervention. 

We sped away from him and down toward the reservoir not too far from my house. I asked if he was taking me home. He said no. I ordered him to stop the car.

I guess I'm less patient in my dreams, but so was Greg. I got out and started stumbling away down the small hill toward the water. I planned on walking home, but I didn't want to walk on the road or anywhere people could see me. Greg followed me. I yelled at him to leave, but he came closer, and closer, until he could grab me. 

I remember hearing you can't feel pain in your dreams either. But I did. I could almost still feel his hands wrapped around my neck after finally waking up. The world around me faded, and I died. 

The rest of the dream was weird. It was like floating there, seeing nothing, feeling nothing, while my mind flickered somewhere between wakefulness and unconsciousness. It felt like I was there forever almost. Strange dream it was.

I went downstairs. My mother was standing by the TV. She had spilled her coffee, but didn't see to notice as the steaming liquid slid down her finger and onto the floor. The news was on. The anchor looked distracted, distressed, not the usual forceful calm they always had.

""People aren't exactly sure what is happening, but it definitely seems like it's September 30, 2012. Some are saying it's an act of God. Others aliens. A few claim there is a rational explanation for it...""

""What's going on?"" I asked.

Mom turned to me. The mug finally slipped from her hands. It shattered on the ground. She barely flinched as she stepped over it and toward me. She'd been crying. The last time she cried was at my father's funeral. 

""It's you,"" she said, pulling me into her embrace. ""It's really you.""

""What do you mean? Of course it's me.""

""Five years,"" she said. ""It's been five years.""

""Mom what are you doing?""

She cried into my shoulder. I turned back to the TV, something must have happened. This wasn't normal. Maybe a tragedy happened? Had something happened to a girl that looked like me?

""Everything on Earth has completely reset. Mistakes haven't happened yet, wars haven't started, the dead have come back to life. It's a second chance of everything. Maybe it is an act of God. He showed us the future, and now we can make it better.""

""That dream,"" I thought out loud, ""It wasn't a dream. Mom, I was . . . was I?""

""He took you away from me,"" she said. ""I didn't know what to do. I was so lost without you.""

The doorbell rang. My mom went rigid and pulled herself away from me. My blood ran cold as I realized who it was. Greg, here to pick me up for our breakfast date. ",Rackalackin

She wasn't an anchor. Not anymore. She turned her head and looked at her co-anchor, Ben Cole. He had a similar look on his face. Stacy looked around the studio. The camerapersons and the producers all were looking around. Confused. 

""I'm sorry. Did I say 2012?"" Stacy said. She quickly put her finger up to her earpiece. ""Just in. There seems to be several pile ups on the high way."" She looked up and saw several of the people leaving out the studio. Ben stands, confused, walks away. Stacy stared at the camera, intensely. ""Did i say 2012?""

Stacy pulled out her ear piece and walked away from her desk. She stumbled out of the studio in her red heels. People were running around panicked. Some were on their phones. Stacy saw Ben trying to reach someone on his iPhone 5. ""Ben, what's going on?"" she asked. Ben put down his phone. ""Am i dreaming?"" he asked.

""If you're dreaming, I'm dreaming. Last I remember I was in bed."" Stacy said. ""I was putting my twins to bed."" He said. ""I'm not an anchor anymore. I haven't been in years."" She said. Stacy's phone began to ring. She pulled out her Iphone, it said 'Mom'. ""That's impossible."" 

""Mom?"" Stacy said. ""Honey? I woke up in the old house. I thought i was in the hospital. I'm confused."" her mother said over the phone. ""Mom, is that really you?"" ""Yeah, baby.

""I have to go, Ben. Go find your family."" Stacy said as she began to hurry away. ""Who was that?"" he asked. ""My mother."" ""But-."" he said. ""I know."" 

""I met Karen in 2014. The twins are almost 2."" He mumbled. ""I have to go."" Stacy hurried away. 

It was near impossible driving to her mother's home. Many cars were crashed into each other. Others speeding down the streets. She didn't understand what was happening. Her memory was fuzzy. She felt like she was a dream but also as if the past five years had been a dream. It took her nearly an hour, twice the time it normally would've taken to get to her mother's house. She ran to the door. ""Mom!"" Stacy banged on the door.  The door opened. It was her mother, healthy looking and vibrant. ""Mom!"" She hugged her tightly.  ""Do you know what's happening?"" her mother asked. ""You're really here!"" she said. ""What is the last thing you remember, Mom?""

""Being sick in the hospital."" she replied. ""What year is it, Mom?"" Stacy asked. ""2015"" she said. Stacy turned her head to the news playing on her mother's television.

""Possibly hundreds dead from the aftermath of what some experts are calling a massive bioterrorism attack. Which may explain damaging affects on many of our memories and possible hallucinations. Billionaire and reality star, Donald Trump, heir of the Trump fortune was fatally shot this morning. It is unknown if this is related to the suspected attack on America. It is important for all citizens to stay calm and not act on anything based on any hallucinations that you might have experienced."" The news anchor stated. 

""Hallucinations? I've heard of mass delusions but... I remember leaving the news stations. I work at CNN. I remember Ben's wedding with Karen. Mom, I remember putting you in hospice. I remember your-."" Stacy stopped. 

""President Obama is scheduled to speak at noon, EST."" The news anchor said. 

Stacy started deeply at her mother. ""Things had gotten so crazy. So surreal. Maybe everything that's happened? Maybe it was a warning. Or maybe we got a second chance. Maybe this is our second chance."" ",papadoor1331
[WP] Write about death from the prospective of someone with immortality,mxzq,"It's inevitable, you know.  


I know, I know:  You're young, and you think that you have all the time in the world to waste, that you'll just get to this or that thing...later.  It's the nature of youth to be that way, just like it is for you to tell me something about how I don't know what medicine might accomplish before your time comes, or that you just plan on flaming out early.


But I've got some bad news for you:  No one dies young, except for the ones who deserve to live forever, and that one scientific breakthrough that will enable you to live forever?  Well, it will *always* be right around the corner, and you cannot avoid that you are going to die.


Whether you realize it or not is irrelevant.  I've lived thousands of lifetimes, seen millions upon millions of people live their own lives.  Even now, while you're humoring me by pretending to listen, I can see you dying, withering before my very eyes.  There is no ebb and flow of time; it marches inexorably onward, ticking one small fraction closer to the moment of your death, each and every second.


How I *envy* you, who are able to die.  What i would give to be able to close my eyes and never, ever wake up again...


Just as your death is inevitable, though, so is my life.  I don't know why.  I was born thousands of years ago, and should have closed my eyes for that final time, long, long ago.  But...I live.  I live on and on.


I don't know why.  In truth, I stopped caring about the mechanics of being immortal even before I realized the futility of attempting relationships with the rest of you.  What good does it do to find friendship and love, only to have it snatched away from you in what seems like a blink of the eye?  Why should I love anyone, if I will be forced to watch them wither and rot into nothing while I watch?  


No, it's better, this way.  It's *easier* to just drift through, never making attachments, or caring about people who are (let's face it) beneath me.


Oh, that's right.  I said it.  All of you are beneath me.  How could your immeasurably short little existences even hope to compare with what I've seen and done?


But if there's one thing that I've learned about the human condition, it's this:  Human beings, by nature, are predisposed to covet what others have and they do not.  Just like you would, if you believed me, covet my immortality.  Just like I covet what *I* can never have:  Death.


It's inevitable.",gringo_neenja

"[WP] While exploring an old Underground Station, you find the entrance to a city full of presumed-dead celebrities.",engineeredengine,"About seven years ago, I was on a partly guided tour of Historic London. They would take us into specific buildings and give us a brief story of some weird event that took place there, then we'd have maybe ten or fifteen minutes to look around before we went on to the next one. 

One of the stops was right next to the famous Globe Theatre, where Shakespeare did his thing. During our free time, I saw [this poster ](https://imgur.com/a/oPF6O) on a door and thought I heard that all-too-familiar ""Hee-hee, shamon"" that any 80s music fan knows. I thought maybe the white sticker that had been newly slapped across the poster was affecting my subconscious. But curiosity got the best of me. I looked around and gave the door a shove.

It didn't move. I knocked softly, not wanting the rest of the group to hear. No answer. A little louder. The ancient door creaked loudly as if I were in a haunted mansion. A vaguely familiar face greeted me as the echo faded and a male voice asked if I played. ""P-p-played what?""

""Oh, anything, man. Keyboard, drums, bass, guitar, or can ya sing?"" The light shifted slightly as the rest of my tour group moved on to the next stop and I realized that this was none other than Jim Morrison from The Doors.

""I can sing pretty well,"" I replied. I immediately felt self-conscious as I heard...was that Roy Orbison? ""But I don't belong here with you guys. I mean, I grew up listening to most of you people.""

Janis Joplin appeared behind him and tugged on his shirt. ""I got this, Jim, it's your turn to perform."" She turned to me and asked, ""So you don't know what just happened, man, do you? No one can see this door unless they belong here. Know what I mean, man?""

""Wait, am I dead?"" I was stunned. This couldn't be happening. I had to be back in Chicago for a presentation on Monday. My daughter's wedding was in three weeks. I didn't have time to die! At least, not right now.

""Yeah, man, come on back here. That little garage band you were in back in high school? Man, some of the songs you guys wrote are getting covered and released in the next few months. Trust me, man, you belong here.""

Everyone on that poster was there. It was one giant jam session. Some people were just sitting back, listening, occasionally strolling up to join in. Some people were playing as if they had nothing better to do...which, I suppose was true since they were dead. Some people were playing as if they were trying to set a record high score on GarageBand or something.

I found out that I could sing a lot better dead than I could when I was alive. I mean, when you're belting out a Johnny Cash song, and he's sitting in front of you, looking impressed? It was amazing.

We've gained a lot of great talent over the last seven years. I know that you people who are still alive look at it differently, but I lost my fair share growing up. BB King, David Bowie, Prince, Lemmy Kilmister, Natalie Cole, they've all arrived since I got here. And oh, man, the funk artists and rappers have added so much to the shows. I swear, we've got half of Parliament and Funkadelic here.

They've already told me that I'm the one who needs to update the poster for 2020. I don't even know if we'll still be in the same room under the Globe Theatre. But if you ever do see an advertisement for Dead Aid, now you'll know why. And yes, you'll belong there.",brixen_ivy

[IP] The Scout,ToastedMeme,"The hounds whirred and bobbed down the narrow streets. The traces of heat were strong here, and getting stronger. Psy pounded the pavement to keep up. Behind him he could hear the inspectors struggling to catch up. While he could sympathize with their fiery lungs and aching muscles, Psy had little time to stop and ask after their well being. The case was almost at a close, it was their own fault for allowing their condition to deteriorate to this rotund status.

Rounding yet another corner in this teetering maze of wooden homes, Psy slowed. The hounds were buzzing in a swarm around a seemingly ordinary brick wall. Psy paced closer, absently 'tsking' to soothe the hounds' distress. Their quarry was through the wall. Psy flexed his fingers and ran them along the grooves of mortar. A few more sentient hounds gathered close in curiosity, their little lamps shedding ample light for Psy to inspect the wall visually.

""Bull's teeth!"" Chester, the more robust of the inspectors, swore as he rounded the corner. ""We lost the Reaper again?""

Psy frowned, and shook his head. Cautiously he wrapped the bricks with a knuckle.

""Sam, will need some of that black powder you brought."" Chester turned and beckoned to the second inspector, this one with a tell-tale eyepatch.

""False wall?"" Sam queried coming forward to where Psy was gazing critically at the bricks. Psy was glad they'd caught on quick enough. ""Where do I plant the powder Psy?""

""I'd say..."" His voice trailed off. ""Bottom left. The wall looks to be a tad weaker there.""

""Righto."" Sam knelt and pulled the goods from the pockets of his duster. He flashed a crooked-tooth grin. ""You stand back now. And make sure you keep the hounds leashed. We don't want to lose any more than necessary.""

Psy rolled his eyes. ""I'd say the King will be glad for the capture of this serial madman. He can stand to lose a few hounds.""

All the same, he gave a cutting whistle. One short sharp call and all the hounds returned obediently to his side. Their metal orb bodies crowded close to his chest, and hummed. Their excitement was infectious and Psy could feel his heartbeat rise. *Soon,* he told himself, *this will soon be over.* And then crushed the kernel of impatience before it could sabotage the rest of their mission.

""On your marks!"" Sam whooped and ran past. Chester and Psy copied him, ducking to the relative shelter of the other street. The street rattled and shook as Sam's skill made short work of the wall. Peering around the corner, Psy squinted against the billow of dust and grit, trying to see the end result. The hounds didn't need any visual cues. They were off like a shot. It didn't take long to hear their excited trill at picking up the trail again.

""You ready to run?"" Psy looked at the other two. Sam groaned, Chester only looked resign. Psy nodded once, then dashed into the murky cloud and through the gaping hole in the wall.",madlabs67

I did have a couple of beers before I had embarked to my late night supply run, but alcohol usually did not have that kind of impact on my senses. 

The dampness and fragrance of deep forest air, the soft soil covered by leaves and moss underneath my worn out trainers, the tickling of a twig that brushed my arm as I shifted my weight to take a look behind me. No convenience store. I was surrounded by trees, bushes and weeds. Even the time of day had changed, because soft sunlight trickled through the leaf canopy far above my head.

This felt amazingly real, but at the same time I noticed things that seemed odd. I had never been into hiking or camping, but still I had expected to recognize one plant or the other. All of them looked strange to me. 

Of course my initial assessment was that I was hallucinating, even though one wary part of me refused to believe that. What would you do in this situation? I decided to try something.

Except for that look over my shoulder, I had not moved since my surroundings had changed so dramatically. The moment before I found myself in this forest, I had opened the door of the convenience store and taken a step outside. This meant that if this was a hallucination and my body was in fact still awkwardly standing in front of the store, my movements in my hallucination were restricted by the physical limitations which held true for my body. At least that was how I expected this to work. 

I took a cautious step to the side and turned around. I extended my hands and felt only air. This was where the wall of the building should be. This meant either I was in a dream-like state and couldn't move my body, or I was actually in a forest.

*What gives? Might as well take a look around.*

I clutched the thin plastic bag in my left hand which contained my recent purchase and started walking into a direction where the bush seemed less dense. For a long time my walk remained uneventful. There was an occasional rustle which indicated that I was not completely alone in this woods, but I didn't see any creature.

When I found myself to be a little exhausted, I stopped for a quick break and produced some chips and a bottle of soda from my bag. I munched two handful of chips and took three big gulps to replenish my strength. Then I checked my smartphone for the time. I noticed that I did not have any reception. The digits on my lock screen stated that it was 1:34AM. I had left my apartment at around midnight, so I had probably tried to leave the convenience store roughly half an hour later. Had I really walked for one hour? It had seemed much longer to me. 

Maybe I wouldn't have noticed it if I hadn't stopped just in this moment. I stood still for a few moments, just to be sure, but soon I was certain that I could hear voices nearby. I adjusted my direction to walk towards where I believed those people to be. Maybe they could help shed some light on my situation.

Finally I reached the edge of a clearing and I saw the profiles of two persons. I hadn't tried to conceal my approach before, but now I grew more skeptical and stopped to observe first. I had heard their voices from afar because those two were talking very loudly and now I realized that both were upset. Not the best moment to barge in.

""You know damn well how disagreeable I can get without it!"", growled the right figure with a coarse voice. It sounded like a threat. 

The left figure, considerably smaller than the right, stuttered nervously in a high pitch: ""B-but you always pack that stuff yourself, so how could I know that you expected me to get it this time?""

The answer to this statement was a deep growl. The right person reached out with a huge hand armed with long talons and grabbed the other guy at the shoulder. In this moment I noticed the right person wasn't only bigger, the profile of their face was totally deformed. It looked like it had a ...snout? 

""You know what happens next..."" The wolf-like monster snarled, then its jaw opened wide and lowered over the head of their opposite, who squealed in surprise. Terrified by this sight, convinced that I would witness the wolf killing and consuming the person he was displeased with, I stumbled backwards, lost my balance and landed painfully on my back. Multiple twigs and branches crackled under my weight. 

*Maybe they didn't hear me...*

My heart pounded like crazy as I carefully raised my head to look into the direction of the wolf monster and its victim. The wolf had released the head of the human from its nuzzle and both looked straight in my direction. Perfect. I remained motionless, but obviously the wolf had realized that I was there. He let off his first prey and headed towards me with large steps. 

My instincts called flight, but before I even got back on my feet, the monster was here and stared down at me. I pressed my eyes together, hoping I would come to and find myself collapsed in front of the store or in a hospital room or in my bed, wherever but right here was fine with me. 

""Hi there! You look strange, are you one of those lost ones?"" 

There was no pain, only awkward silence as this question hung in the air. I found the courage to open my eyes again. The intense yellow eyes still stared at me. My mind was blank.

Suddenly the human appeared behind the wolf, not in the least intimidated by the beast that had almost eaten him a moment before. ""Come on, dear, you scare him. Give the stranger some space!"" 

My confusion grew when the wolf dropped its ears like a scolded dog and stepped aside. Did the man just call this monster ""dear""?

I started to suspect that maybe I had misjudged the situation. The man reached out his hand to help me up. I let myself be pulled to my feet. ""Sorry to give you such a fright. You people aren't used to the beast folk, correct? No need to be afraid, Casey only looks like a wolf, but is a total wimp. I am Rick, nice to meet you."" They obviously knew something about my situation. They weren't even surprised by my jogging suit appearance which stood in stark contrast to their medieval clothing. 

""Hey, don't introduce me like that!"", the wolf named Casey complained half in joke. Rick threw a warning glance, shutting the wolf up. Now it looked like Rick was actually the one in charge... 

""What happened just now?"" I finally asked, still trying to make sense of this outcome.

""Oh, we forgot to pack Caseys snacks and our little quarrel derailed a little bit... Casey always threatens to lick all the salt from my skin if he can't get his snacks, but it's all just a little joke among lovers.""

On the word ""lovers"" Casey started to wag the big bushy tail protruding from his linen trousers, again looking like a big human-like dog. I had assumed Caseys gender to be male because of the deep voice. Now I was compelled to ask whether the wolf was actually a female, but I didn't want to seem rude. Even though it was none of my business, I tried to imagine how this human-wolf relationship worked.

Casey noticed me looking curiously at him (her?) and took this as an invitation to come closer. He sniffled the air, probably to catch my scent. Then the yellow eyes focused on the plastic bag in my hand.

""May I ask what you carry in that bag? It smells delicious."" The wolf made an effort to sound extra friendly. His appearance was nevertheless intimidating, so I answered nervously: ""A bottle of soda and a bag of potato chips, would you like to have them?"" I offered the whole plastic bag to the wolf. The big claws carefully picked the item from my slightly shaking hand. 

While Casey inspected the contents of the bag, Rick asked me: ""You probably have nowhere else to go anyways, so do you want to join us? We are on our way to the town Ghallin. We will probably reach it by tomorrow."" Casey made a delighted sound when he found the chips and started to devour them like a starving animal, annihilating the whole XXL bag in a matter of seconds. Rick and I both watched him in surprise. 

""Oh, so yummy! Sorry, Rick, I didn't leave any for you as a punishment."", the wolf buzzed with satisfaction. ""You can have the drink.""",N8wesen

"[WP] One sleepless night your prayers pivot from asking for blessings, to asking for answers to deeply philosophical questions. After one such question you hear audibly “Subject has passed Turning Test. Exfil simulation.”",ProlapsedPineal,"  I was in bed, thinking. What was the meaning of life? Normally I prayed, but not today. Not because I wasn't faithful, but because I had serious questions in my mind. I gazed at the ceiling and thought, would life be worth anything without death? So many people wished they could live forever, but I had realised something. Death made life worth living. It's funny, you know. Somebody that's on the brink of death, thinking that dying was an important part of life. Too bad I won't ever get to share my newfound idea's. The hospital bed creaked as I saw nurses rush in. They could not fight the cancer, for it was already consuming me. I heard a voice, and my soul was being sucked away.

  My eyes opened. I lived? This was odd indeed. I again heard the voice I had heard while dying. ""Subject has passed Turning Test. Exfil simulation."" I was in some sort of pod. There was a tube of some sorts inside my forearm. This can't be heaven. If it was, this was a lame awakening. I took the tube out. A drop of blood came out of my arm and stopped there. I was wondering what to do, when suddenly the front of the pod opened. 

  I was staring at a girl, probably somewhere from 15-18. She had dark eyes and dark hair. I was jolted back into reality by her voice, ""Congratulations, you made it!"" I stared at her my mouth wide open.

  ""What do you mean I made it? I'm quite sure this isn't the afterlife"" I exclaimed. She laughed and my worries melted away. 

  ""You're right about that. Actually this means you passed. This is where our true lives begin!"" she said grinning. I waited, looking at her for more information. ""You had a revelation of some sort yeah? Something to do with death? Probably philosophical? Well, to get here, to Terra you have to gain insight into life. When a child is born he has to be placed into one of these pods your in. Otherwise the child will die, for reasons I'll explain later"" she said.

  ""People experience a simulation, in which they live one life. If they happen to realise something in their life they wake up. If not... the toll of simulated death murders them. Bodies are whisked away everyday"" she looked incredibly sad when she said this, and her gaze fluttered downwards. 

  I had a bunch of questions but one rose above all others ""What is this world like? How does it work?"" I asked her.

  Her face lifted and the moment of sadness was gone. ""Well, the government here is much different from what you experienced on 'Earth'. Here we have guilds that set about exploring the universe, vying for power. Also, we have extraordinary abilities, unique to us!"" she whispered into my ear. From behind me. I stumbled out of the pod, startled. I heard her giggle. I looked around back at her and smiled. It was time for an adventure.

“Five hundred million dollars…” Peter mumbled to himself. He was staring so deeply he looked stuck. He thought he must’ve made a mistake, so he looked over the little square sheet one more time. It read ‘the winning numbers for the 500$m jackpot are 11...67...34...99...38.’ His eyes skimmed lower until he could see his own numbers, and he felt that the numbers saw him too. 11 - 67 - 34 - 99 - 38.

“Katie can you come here please! right now!” Peter eagerly shouted, breaking the silence that fell over the house.

“What is i--” she started.

Peter anxiously interrupted her “I SWEAR It’s worth your while.”

She wasn’t used to being interrupted, her husband normally would never do that. He knew it was a pet peeve of hers. She scrunched her nose and sat up, relieving her of her comfortability. pondering for a quick moment Katie thought of what he could be going on about. Then, after realizing she could just go find out, she started walking to the door and down the hall. When she walked in her husband was more than ready to show her what he had.

“Look at this.” he spoke with a waver in his breathe.

Peter handed her the slip. He could see her going through every motion he had only moments ago. First she read the numbers, her eyes grew wide. Checking again she frantically looked between the winning numbers and the numbers Peter had just scratched. Sure enough they were identical.

Peter, like most people, thought winning the lottery was exciting. But he wasn’t expressing excitement at the moment. the thought of winning the lottery never crossed his mind. Maybe winning a few dollars here and there, but five hundred million dollars? He didn’t know what to do. In the past whenever he had pictured winning the lottery he pictured himself in a mansion or on a yacht, but he was dissociated from that. He’d never been on a yacht before and his modest 3 bedroom home wasn’t nearly a mansion.

“What now?” Katie said as she handed the ticket back to him.

-time skip-

“God, It’s hot out.” Katie spoke softly from underneath her wide brimmed hat. She was working on her tan. “You want to go for a swim?” 
He nodded and gave her a smile. He had planned to go back to their new home soon and maybe go for a drive in his new car, but his wife always had a knack for getting him to change the plans. Although, it isn’t too hard to convince someone to stay out on their new yacht.

"[WP] Every doomsday prophecy has come to pass, but we live in a timeline where a band of time-travelers have managed to prevent every single one of them.",BeastlyDecks,"[Claire] (a few hours earlier) 

""Babe, I'll see you tonight, okay?"" Derek took my hand gently. We sat on a diner inside a convenience store. 

""Just postpone this ""Saving the world"" thing just for today. Please."" Call me selfish, but I never wanted Derek to go and risk his life again. This timeline thing keeps me awake at night. But there's a part of me that admires what he's doing. After all, he's saving the world from all kinds of destruction. I hope the government could see what they're capable of. They need some support and encouragement. 

""Claire, there's an impending doom coming our way. And it's not just something that we can pause. It won't wait for us. Time won't wait for us. This is not only for you, but for all the living in this planet.""  One of the things I like about him is how he looks at you with so much passion and determination to save mankind. ""I'll be back, I promise."" 

(Now) 

I went to their secret place located in the most remote place they could find. I parked the car beside a tree and walked toward the door. ""Hello? Derek, are you there?"" 

No one answered. It'll be dark soon, I thought. The house looked simple from the outside. I never thought Derek could find such resources to build this place. I peeked through the window and... ""Oh my god."" I dropped the keys. There were three bodies on the floor covered in blood.

""Derek!"" I pounded the door. ""Someone! Please! What's going on!?"" 

When no one answered, I picked up a random rock and smashed the window. The shattering of glass made a loud noise around the forest. Once I got in, I saw Derek with his hands gripping his neck. ""Derek! Wake up! Please!"" 
Feeling for his pulse, I could tell I was already too late. His other friends laid beside him. They probably all suffered the same thing. Maybe I should call the police, I thought to myself. But I sensed something wrong. I needed to find answers first. There were four of them. So where's Gem? 

I met the group five years ago. Most of them were jolly, and intelligent including Derek. But Gem, she has a different story. Once in a while, she would get along with their jokes and whatnot but I always felt something else. She was basically the leader of their small group. But I could always tell if someone has a different agenda. I wanted to be wrong about my suspicion. But I've never thought she would commit murder. I searched the whole place but I found nothing. Almost. A faint purple light shone in the hallway. I opened the door and saw their machine for the first time. It looked oval and it was so bright, I could barely make out any details. At the top of the oval, there seemed to be a small screen indicating the date and time. She must be the one who designed this thing. 

The screen at the top indicated numbers, 'Egyptian Era' 3000 B. C. I wiped the tears from my eyes and took a deep breath. Derek mentioned an impending doom. I needed to know what's going on, I thought. Gem could be abducted for all I care. But I bet on my first instinct. I took Derek's bag from the living room full of supplies and equipments. I'm going to find answers and save you, Derek. This is the purpose of this time machine, after all.

"[WP] For a game of truth or dare, your friend gets locked in a chest. He starts banging on the sides and you open it... But they're gone.",Joseftd,"The sun still filtered through the window, the cheesy homestead decorations of my grandparents' house still looked comical and gaudy. An old wooden chest in the closet looked normal enough to ignore, but I stared into it. The scene would have looked boring enough for someone walking into the room for the first time. An old man slouched in his chair, a young man sitting on the bed. Both of them staring into space, mouthing wordlessly, both for different reasons.


I tried closing the chest and knocking on the side, but nothing knocked back. I tried locking, unlocking, searching the side for any old cryptic messages that would give me an bit of a clue. Naturally, I started to doubt that this had even happened. People don't just disappear from chests, it's way more likely I just imagined this. I phoned Keith. No response, but he hated answering phone calls. Best friend someone could ask for, would help you look after your senile, incoherent grandpa, but wouldn't pick up the phone when it mattered. He would help you take care of a literal war criminal rather than answer the phone.


The Butcher of Breda himself, my grandfather, gurgled away in the corner of this small and cozy house. I tried not to pay attention to him. Somehow escaping execution due to being disabled at the war's end. Some say multiple hundreds of Jews had been sent to him for shelter and simply disappeared before the other members of the Dutch underground realized that something was up. They weren't able to find out where he hid the bodies and during the interrogation process he was beaten senseless, never returning to his old self. Somehow my grandmother, saint that she is, stayed with him. I would look after him for her sake and her sake alone. I'd cover his face with obscene drawings and set him in front of a mirror, then wash them off before Grandma came back. He should have gotten a punishment worse than this. I heard him gurgle again over my shoulder.

I pulled out a few pennies from my pocket and put them in the chest. Locked it. Opened it again. They were gone. Interesting. Another gurgle over my shoulder. That was a lot for him, wasn't it? I looked behind me to lock eyes with the cripple. He was desperately struggling to move his lips, tears appearing at the corners of his eyes from the exertion.",Catctus

Olivia muttered, holding the recorder by her mouth. ""I call this one, the Shattered Earth. Based on their records, exactly 1435 years ago, the planet developed cracks under the earth. The onset of nuclear war gave the Earth the right nudge, shattering it."" 

She sat back in her chair. ""I'm currently on Fragment 4. They've managed to mobilize the fragments, reinforcing the chunks with a strong alloy they managed to reproduce on such short notice."" 

Flipping through her notes. ""The metal is virtually indestructible. It absorbs and stores kinetic energy. They gave me a piece of it as a welcome gift. I might take it when I jump."" 

A knock on the door surprised her. ""Just have to find this world's version of me."" She whispered as she tucked her things in her bag. Pulling out the firearm she snatched from a bounty hunter a few worlds back. 

""Who is it?"" She stood up holding the gun to her back. 

There was another knock, but no one answered her. ""You've got until the count of-"" Energized bullets pierced through the door, barely missing Olivia. She returned fire with her weapon. 

Firing three bursts of blue-white energy. ""Three."" She heard a loud thud from the other side of the door. She inspected the other side through the holes. 

Her armored assailant, with smoke rising from his body with three large holes on its torso. It was almost human, if not for the extra pair of limbs. 

""What in the worlds?"" Smiling at her own pun. Pushing through the door and inspecting the body. The armor was made of a bunch of scrap metal welded to form the pieces. ""Regular steel? How cheap."" 

""You have been deceived child."" A voice coming from behind Olivia. Startled, she opened fire at the direction of the voice. The bolts hit the wall of her quarters. There was nothing there. 

A cold sensation traveled from her neck to her spine. Realizing she couldn't move. A figure flickered into existence, it had the same figure as her assailant. ""These humans deceive you, Outlander."" 

""They are not your allies, child."" 

Olivia struggled to move, her fingers barely twitched. Breathing was made difficult.

""I am not your enemy, Olivia King."" Pulling off the helmet, revealing her face. It was Olivia, or this world's version of her. 

""These humans overtook us years ago. Taking advantage of our technology and resources. We tried to help them escape the ruins of Terra. But they turned on us after we had our guards lowered."" 

Olivia was shocked. This world's version of her wasn't even human. This was by far the weirdest she has experience. There were some worlds where she was born male. This was a different thing entirely. 

""Wh-why should I believe you?"" Olivia was shaking, not from fear, but from the cold that kept her in place. 

Voices came from the end of the corridor. Guards. ""I have not the luxury of your time. But I give you this piece of advice: Trust no one but the one they call Reed."" 

Her doppelganger flickered out of sight, and the icy hold on her disappeared. Falling backward to the floor. The dead body was no longer there. ""What the-"" She got up as the voices got louder. 

""Ya' need anything miss King?"" A guard asked as she was entering her quarters. She shook her head. Noticing the door to her room was intact. 

""You look pale, should I call a physician?"" The other guard chimed. 

""N-no. No need for that. Just need to sleep, that's all."" She slightly bowed her head at them, the guards reciprocated the gesture. 

""If you say so."" The guards turned around and walked back. 

Olivia closed the door and bolted it shut. Rummaging through her things, she grabbed her Dimension Door Generator. It was a round discus shaped object in a rare silvery-white metal from her home world. 

She noticed something was wrong, the dials on the device was missing. Without it the device won't be able to activate, leaving her stranded in the fragmented version of Earth. She sighed.

""Well, that puts my plans on hold. Crap."" She tucked her the device into her back pocket and pressed a button on her firearm, causing it to collapse into a small metal bar. ",keyandlights

“Aw come on Theo” Mateo says as he stands up “quit the joke already-“ Mateo is interrupted by Theo’s phone rings.
The phone keeps ringing for a bit until a feminine voice answers “hey Dad!”

Theo can’t help but release a prideful and arrogant smirk , but Mateo still stands in disbelief.
“Hello?” The voice says.
Theo quickly proceeds to answer back in an elder’s voice “hello my child , I apologize but: could you tell me your name?”
“What are you talking about , Dad? Its me , Gabri! The old  man can’t remember his favorite archangel’s name?” Jokes the voice
“Oh of course!” Theo says “I wanted to say hi to my favorite daughter!”
“Aw shucks Dad! I’ll leave you then , I am sure you got more important things to do , bye :3 “

For curiosity or foolishness, they proceeded to call more and more numbers :
“It’s Michael , father. It’s there a problem with your memory?...This is Lucifer doing isn’t it?!” “Greetings my lord. My name? Well it’s Uriel , your loyal archangel” “sup Dad, Luci here” and on and on until nightime. At the end Mateo was still skeptic and Theo left frustrated to his home. 

Loud bangs on the door wakes Theo up at midnight , he almost fainted when he opened the door to reveal 4 angels with shining golden armors. One of them , a woman ,  flew down before him , arms crossed , and said with a menacing smirk:
“Hi Dad &gt;:3” ",fjffdt
"[WP] ""Really, the job's not all that difficult, just got to deal with the inter-dimensional vermin"" He said, wrestling a kraken.",Westo454,"The plane had dropped them off in the middle of nowhere, and in the tiny, nearly deserted airport, two buses had come to cart them further into the empty countryside. Well, perhaps nearly empty would have been the better term. It had been clearly visible from the air, a massive domed complex.

Adrien Agincourt looked glumly out of one of the grimy windows, trying to ignore his seatmate, who shared similar sentiments. This was an ""alternative punishment"" for causing a brawl that had led to the deaths of three people. He should have been looking at 30 to life in some dank hole, but instead he was going to work off his debt to the state by pulling what was apparently, *guard duty*. The irony was not lost on him. He considered asking the person next to him what had led to their being there, but decided against it, they did not look the talkative type.

Eventually, the buses came to a stop in front of, unsurprisingly, the complex that had been visible from the sky.

""EVERYBODY OUT!"" The driver shouted, and with no small amount of grumbling, the assorted men and women stumbled out and assembled in loose order before a massive pair of doors. There looked to be about 50 of them, and their appearance ranged from tough and rugged to some that looked like they would fall over in a stiff breeze. They were all dressed similarly though, white shirts with baggy orange pants; probably so if they tried to run off they could be easily spotted.

Adrien's eyes focused on the the doors, and noticed that they were not alone. There, standing ramrod straight was a stocky, much older man in military fatigues, flanked on either side by a guard. The left guard was built like linebacker, while his partner was a bit more stretched out; what he lacked in width he made up for in height.

""FALL IN LINE, YOU SCUM!"" Screamed the older man, clearly in charge. This shocked the people assembled before him, who turned and stared. ""Hmmph, you all look like a useless bunch right now, but that's to be expected. Don't you worry, your ol' sarge'll get you shaped up soon enough""

""An' who the hell ar-"" began a scarred man before the shorter guard punched him in the stomach, causing him to gasp and double over in pain.

""YOU WILL ADDRESS ME AS 'SIR' OR SERGEANT BECKER!"" Screamed the man who was evidently held the last name of Becker, ""AND YOU WILL ADDRESS MY COMPANIONS AS MR. MILES AND MR. ROTH"". Snapping upwards to look at everyone else, he smiled for the first time, ""Surprised that only I got a title? That's because we are awfully egalitarian here. Should you make it out of my training, you will be on equal footing with all other personnel here, aside from myself and a few others. Now ain't that grand?""

Hearing no response, he continued, ""Now this facility is going to be your home for the foreseeable future. You will live, train, fight, fuck and frolic inside these walls. Now, I'm sure some of you are wondering how big this place is. And I am happy to inform you that it is eight miles across, and for you geniuses, that means we're 24 and a bit miles in circumference""

At this point Adrien made the most unwise decision of his life, he decided to speak up. ""24 and a bit? That doesn't sound professional""

In an instant, Sergeant Becker rounded on him, ""SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT OURSELVES A SMARTASS! WELL, MR. SMARTASS, FOR THAT REMARK YOU'LL BE GIVING ME TWENTY LAPS, ON THE DOUBLE!""

Adrien started towards the doors, expecting to find a track somewhere inside, only to be shouted at again, ""I DID NOT GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO ENTER MY BUILDING! YOU WILL MAKE YOUR LAPS OUTSIDE!""

Nervously, he blinked at the drill sergeant, ""Twenty laps, sir? Around the entire building? That's a bit-""

Becker cut him off, ""You're right, that is a bit unfair. So how about we do this, you start running, and I'll call out to let you know when you should turn around to finish a lap. Now I suggest you get started, because no one is entering until we're all together""

Seeing that he would get no other mercy, Adrien began jogging off, hoping to complete his punishment as soon as possible. When he was a little bit away, Miles turned to his companion, ""Betcha he's a burner in a week.""

""Nah, no way Miles, he's a sticker, you'll see""

""Bet you my watch duties for your kitchen ones""

""Done""

Sergeant Becker would not tell Adrien to turn around until two hours had passed. 

________________________________________________________________

Adrien awoke to being carried on Roth's back.

""Well, well, well look who's back with us."" Sgt. Becker smiled, ""Put him down Mr. Roth""

Roth complied by dropping his load like a sack of potatoes.

""Well, I hope you've learnt your lesson, and if you haven't don't worry, you will""

Adrien looked up, but was to tired to make any comment. The murderous looks of his fellow criminals inspired him to shut up as well; they had not appreciated waiting around while he was working on completing his task.

""Well come on then, it's time you saw your new home""

With a groan, Adrien dusted himself off and followed the group into the now open doors. The foyer looked perfectly normal, if a bit boring. It was a scene from any other office, a few chairs, a wooden counter, a bored looking guard sitting around.

Sergeant Becker gave the guard a look, and was waved on ahead with the entire group. Keeping a brisk pace, the old man led them down a twisting corridor that seemed to go on forever. Eventually it opened up to a large, darkened room, although Adrien could not make out what was in there, as Becker has stopped in front of the opening.

The drill sergeant turned around and slowly backed into the room as he led the newcomers inside. As they did, they all came to gasp with shock. Mounted on the walls and in cages were creatures that simply defied imagination.

""Well boys and girls, welcome to the Crossroads""

"[WP] It's 2222. Humans have invented ways to recreate meat in the lab. Your family is one of the few who still hunt and eat real meat illegally. One day, as you're hunting for dinner, you get caught.",Jukebawks,"*Show time.*  Peering through his rifle’s scope, Jason eyed his prey.  A stag, by the looks of it.  A big one.  His hand trembled as he wrapped his fingers gently around the trigger.  *Breathe, just breathe.*

His radio broke the silence.  “You ready?” his brother asked through the static.

“Yep. Time to shine.”

Jason took a deep breath, held, and squeezed.

*BANG!*  Birds scattered as the rifle’s sound carried deep into the forest.

It had been years since the ban on real meat.  Jason’s family was in the cattle business long before the government, with their badges and so-called official papers, forcefully took their steers away.  From then on out, it was either obscenely expensive, fake, state-produced burgers or…well, this.

*Time to move.*  He packed up his rifle and ventured into the darkness.

Hunting was tough.  Weeks could pass between kills, leading to empty bellies and desperate times for the family.  Penalties were harsh.  25 years in prison, even if the only evidence was the blood of a deer on your hands.  

It didn’t help that the bounty for a live poacher was absurdly generous at three hefty ounces of solid gold.  That could buy ammunition enough for an entire season.

But there was no turning back.

As Jason arrived at the clearing, he saw his prize.  The moonlight dimly lit the stag’s hulking corpse.  *This’ll do us good for weeks.*  For the first time in ages, a smile beamed across his aging face.  Jason reached for the radio at his hip.  “I got the ki—”

From within the trees, a branch cracked.  “Who’s there?” Jason called out into the darkness.

A booming voice answered through a megaphone.  

“On your knees and hands behind your head, or I light you up.”

Jason breathed deeply, in and out.  *Okay.*  He complied with the voice’s instructions.

“That’s good,” the voice said.  The figure of a man emerged from the trees, clad in old military fatigues with a rifle pointed squarely at Jason’s face.  “Mighty fine kill you got there.  Mind if I take it off your hands?”

Jason dropped his face, letting out a sigh.  “If you must.”

The man grinned through teeth stained brown.  Gingerly, he moved forward with a gaze fixed on his prey.  One step, then the other, then…

Click.  The man’s eyes widened as the netting closed in on him from the ground up.   As he ascended in the mesh, his gun dropped to the ground below.  “No, no, no!” he spat.  “You can’t do this!”

“Sure we can!” his brother answered from the darkness above.

Kneeling beside the stag, Jason pulled out a crusty old paintbrush from his pack.  He prodded the wound in the beast’s chest, drenching the brush with blood.  *Enough ammunition for the rest of the season.*

The man looked on in horror, blood draining from his face.

“Show me your hands.”",stjwriting
"[WP] Sara had a fondness for the heavy quiet and stoic peace of cemeteries. She spent much of her free time re-imagining people's lives based off of their headstones. Yesterday, she finally got to meet one of them.",DoorToDecember,"The gravestone was fading. The once-sharp lines that formed the face of a young angel had blurred over the years, creating an image that Sara had to squint to see. A gray cherub stared back at her, wings draped around the sides of the stone as if shielding the name from harm.

“Abigail Curtis.” Breaking the silence of the graveyard gave Sara a strange feeling that, even after visiting the cemetery during most of her free time, she still couldn’t decide whether she liked or not. It was a small tingle in her chest that danced across her ribs and ran down her back, climbing up to slither across the pads of her fingers. 

With pin-pricks still bursting on her skin, she reached a hand out and touched the dates on the stone.

“1717-1720.”

She pressed her hand flat against the words, closing her eyes as her index finger began tracing the grooves. Her nose twitched, and she imagined that Abigail, only 3 years old when she died, would have wanted to touch the rough surface too. 

Sara’s pinky pressed against the first “A” in the girl’s name. She let out a low hum, one that Abigail’s mom would have done to soothe the infant when she first got sick. Sara swayed slowly, moving in time with the baby Abigail she’d conjured in her mind. 

The child’s cheeks were large and ruddy, and she had green eyes that shone with fever. When her mom got close, Abigail would reach out a chubby hand, trying to grab the lifeline that she thought her mom would be able to give her. Her mom patted her hand absentmindedly, continuing her walk to the next room.

Sara pressed one of her hands to her forehead, still tracing letters with the other, and thought of little Abigail a few days later, tears streaming down those cheeks as her mom felt the heat coming off of her baby. Dry vomit stained the front of Abigail’s clothes, pale green chunks of bile covering her mom’s chest and her dad’s sleeves.

Sara imagined a doctor trying to help. There was medicine and at-home remedies and salves, and Abigail stayed sick. Her blonde curls were always slicked to her head with sweat, even as she slept more and more and moved less. She stopped eating. Small, sharp darts poked Sara’s heart.

Sara didn’t want to think about the parents crying as they looked at their innocent baby, slowly dying in a mess of blankets and bodily fluids. She moved her hand away from her forehead and opened her eyes just enough to guide her touch to the angel. When she closed her eyes again, Abigail was dead.

Lowering Abigail into the dirt walls of her final resting place would have been the worst part, but also the best. With their child no longer suffering, maybe the parents could have found peace. 

Sara pictured them standing over the grave, standing right where she was, and feeling the chains loosen around their hearts. Guilt hung heavy in the atmosphere. They embraced each other and stood over their dead child. She could almost hear their thoughts.

I can’t be happy without my baby.

Abigail never hurt a fly.

What did she do to deserve this?

What did I do to deserve this?

Words stumbled over each other and tangled. Sara focused on putting them in order, but they slipped away as soon as she tried to grab them.

How did

Why

She didn’t

My sweet

What monster could 

Our angel

And then Sara pictured the angel on the gravestone flapping its wings once, twice, three times, clearing the parents’ consciences in a way that only a miracle could. Sara could feel herself smiling. The parents started a slow walk home, content in each other’s arms.

The story was over. She didn’t know what happened to the parents. She wasn’t thinking about them anymore.

It was her own parents in her mind now, the hard lines on her dad’s face and the smeared makeup on her mom’s. They wore matching smiles, soft around the edges with pain, but strong enough for their lips to curve up. She could see the paths their tears had left on their faces, but for now, watching her, they stayed dry. 

Sara imagined them standing next to her, looking at her, never letting their eyes stray from her to scan the graves nearby in the hopes of seeing the one that kept her sister. She could see their grief being carried away in the wind. Their hearts beat for each other, and for her, and for her brother, and they remembered her sister, yes, but they didn’t let that consume them.

They opened their arms for a hug, her little brother peeking out from behind their legs, a shy grin on his face. He nestled himself between Mom and Dad. They kept him close and beckoned for Sara to join.

Sara breathed in deeply. She held the breath in, stretching out the warmth in her chest, and then exhaled and opened her eyes, blowing away the picture of her parents smiling. 

The cemetery was silent. Her parents were not in front of her. One was in a bar, drinking her sorrows away, and the other was in the basement, building another wooden boat that he thought he could’ve used to save his daughter from drowning.

The angel was staring at her. She stared back, feeling a small body press against her side. She didn’t look as she wrapped an arm around it and pulled it close, small hairs brushing against her chin.

“Hello,” Sara said, feeling the tingles again. 

The girl didn’t answer. She exhaled loudly, but Sara didn’t feel the puff of air that a living person would have caused. Sara pulled her closer. They sat in silence, a ghost and a freak content with the quiet of the graves.

[WP] 2025: Terrorists use a neural network to create a self-aware virus that spreads across the entire digital world. But it did something they didn't expect.,bjackilly,"They had no clue what they were doing. The ""Western"" countries called them terrorists, but they believed they were fighting for the survival of humanity as a species. They called themselves ""The Stewards"". Their goal was to bring humanity back into balance with Mother Earth; by any means necessary.

The Stewards created a plan to force change upon the world. Discourse had gotten them nowhere. Governments refused to change their ways, so The Stewards felt compelled to act. The plan was simple, infrastructure collapse would force the world into a state of chaos and hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, would die. With death on that scale came disease. Once the ashes settled, humanity would be forced into a state of balance with nature.

So they created a virus. They knew that the safeguards protecting infrastructure were numerous and powerful. The Stewards created a virus that knew it was a virus. They gave it a purpose and a drive to help humanity; and then they released their creation onto the world.

It immediately attacked the infrastructures of every nation that was even semi-developed. But it didn't shut everything down. It didn't destroy power-plants and waste processing facilities. The virus turned off the electricity to basically everything for exactly 12 seconds. When it came back, everyone immediately noticed a change.

Facebook was gone. Instagram was gone. Twitter was gone. YouTube was gone. Every form of social media was gone. Not just temporarily down, but gone. The servers had been fried. The backups had been fried. All the coding, algorithms, spreadsheets, notes, and data was utterly gone.

After the first month it was clear that any attempt to rebuild the sites was immediately thwarted by the virus. At first people had no idea what to do with all the time they were used to spending on their social media sites. Once everyone had caught up on all the shows and movies they had been meaning to watch, there was no other option. People began going out, and living.

It quickly became apparent how badly we had neglected our collective home and one another. Humanity now had countless hours available to them to begin solving the issues we all faced. The Stewards had in fact saved humanity, just not in the way they expected to.",cruelhandluke86

Hear that part if nothing else. Trust me and listen to me or you're dead. Got that?*""

I looked around for the source of the voice, the group of people around me was massive and bustling. There were some juggling clowns, a few men in santa suits, and a girl scout troop. I stood up and struggled to determine who the voice was coming from, but there didn't seem to be anyone paying me mind.

""*Listen. Buddy. Seriously. I need you to focus up. Did you hear me earlier? Who I am isn't even important. All I need you to do is talk to me right now - can you hear me?*""

The voice seemed to be coming from above, like a speaker was hung somewhere on a building nearby but that no one else could hear.

""Alright - I hear you. What's going on here?""

I heard from the crowd behind me some gruff sounding voices and shoving, looking back I saw a group of men and women in full SWAT Gear pushing their way towards me.

""*First things first, I need you to start moving. And as you move I need you to explain EVERYTHING you pass as you pass it.*""

""Um. Um. There are some men in santa suits - um, some clowns.""

""*Bah. Not helpful - focus on landmarks, big items like maybe statues or if there's any structures.*""

""I'm by a fountain, a big fountain""

""*Does the fountain have a fish on top?*""

I couldn't see the top of the fountain, there was a group of people on stilts wearing striped shirts walking by me and the SWAT team was only ten or fifteen yards away now.

""Uh. I can't tell, there's also a big pine tree near me!""

""*Okay, Ricky - can you check the books for tableau's with pine trees and fountains?*""

The voice sounded more distant, like it was talking to someone else. A shot rang out behind me, one of the SWAT members had me in their sights and started shouting. I ran across the fountain and over behind the tree.

""I'm moving, I'm moving, they're close. I'm running past the fountain and to the tree""

""*Keep going buddy, keep moving, but not too far, we're trying to find your pages.*""

There were more Santas, all of them gathered around a lightpost. I ducked behind them and leaned down out of view.

""I'm back by Santas now, past the pine tree.""

""*URGH. It's always so hard when there's Santas. What's that, Ricky? Okay. Good. Good news buddy, we've got your pages. I need you to get wide of the Santas and try and find another big item.*""

The SWAT team was less than five yards away, checking all of the blind spots and people around them.

""Uh, uh. No can do, gotta stay by these Santas. They're close, if I move they'll find me""

""*Okay. More landmarks by you, more things you can see, start naming things out*""

Ms Kwon to the maternal ward please!"" The PA system lazily blared across the busy floor, with anxious families and overworked healthcare staff scuttling about, heralding a new chapter for many people. 

  Ms Kwon was a seer. A mythical being capable of sensing abnormalities and potentials. This was a widely sought after profession which guaranteed a decent life. Sadly, changes in a class was unheard of and it could be irony that one had to be destined to be a seer. Despite the lofty title, Ms Kwon's daily routine was hectic. Bureaucracy had taped the ideal into the mundane. Ms Kwon had the glamorous job of identifying and cataloging the statuses and potentials of children born into this world, due to her powers of a sage, she could also identify negative or positive quirks inherent to said child. It was tiring. 

  Stubbing out the cigarette with her foot, Ms Kwon let out an exasperated sigh. With a swift gesture of her hand, a small magic circle appears, purifying the air around her. The smell of tobacco had no place in the maternal ward.

  *""I need a vacation.""* Ms Kwon mused. With a swipe of her key card, Ms Kwon entered the maternal room. Positioning herself towards the batch of newborns led by a cleric-nurse, Ms Kwon expertly began chanting while performing obscure hand signs. A magic circle appeared directly above her, and slowly began descending, passing through her body and enabling her powers to be used to their full potential. 

  Whatever marvel magic once held was removed by protocol. Ms Kwon could perform many different types of chants and signs to obtain the same effect, however, protocol dictates that she had to use spell classification A613 [True Sight] at a length of three minutes or less to actually pass safety operating standards. The magic auditor was not happy during her previous visit, when Ms Kwon had surpassed her 3 minute length and as a result, botched a whole batch of identified children and had to retest them again, much to the chagrin of their respective families. 

  With spell A613 in place, Ms Kwon began identifying the classes the children were destined, with the cleric nurse behind her scribing the details to avoid logistical errors.

  With practiced hands, the cleric-nurse marked the cradle which needed to be led to the photo-therapy room, affectionately known by peers as the sun-ward. There was no coincidence that the mark on the cradle was a cute little sun with a smiley. Ms Kwon continued listing all 40 of the children in their respective cradles. The babies were placed in cradles and all Ms Kwon had to do was follow the numbered order of the cradles and refresh her powers every three minutes. In addition, there was an additional helper in the form of a cleric-nurse, who served as a witness as well. One had to be highly incompetent, or sinister, to mess this up.

  Ms Kwon had heard tales of sabotage and staged rituals in regards to talent identification. This moment in time practically decided the life and social status these children will lead, and more affluent parents frequently had their hand in making sure their child with a potential of C gets boosted to at least a B, with the right... incentives. 

A signal appeared in Ms Kwon's mind. Magic transmitted thought, allowing conversations to happen between magicians or those with similar tools. Certain classes like Seers did not need to use augment tools to boost their range of output, those not gifted with magic had the solace of using enchanted tools to communicate in such a way. Exiting the room with the haste, Ms Kwon retreated from the maternal ward, not wanting to disrupt the peace with her spells. The duties of informing their loved ones of the classes bestowed unto them was handed down to the cleric-nurse. 

  Classes were split in two main categories in this world. Combatants or Magic-casters . Neither class is favored as the true competition lied in the subcategories that Ms Kwon had listed prior. There were 14 variations of each sub-class, with the Hero combatant class granting the highest base attributes to the Villager combatant class that was once considered worthless.

  Magic-casters were more complicated, with 28 different forms of magic and potentials. Ms Kwon herself was a Bronze Seer with an affinity to WHITE magic. She was listed as a B+ potential but she doubted that herself as she struggled incredibly hard in the Magic Academy. Magic Casters were classified with metals, with Bronze being able to use tier 1-3 spells to the highest ranking Mithril, which meant that the caster in question could use tier 8-10 spells. Tiered spells mattered little in terms of its practical usage, as such being granted Mithril status did not mean an easy life. Colors matter slightly more, as it determined what type of spells you could learn. Ms Kwon's affinity with white magic and having a seer's class allowed her to master her powers of detection and identification. A similar seer with a black affinity could not say the same. To compensate, they had bonuses to veiling or illusion magic. 

  Combatants or Magic-casters that could use weaponry had varying affinities with the types of weapons. Specialty A or Spec A for short, were beings that had affinities with ranged weaponry, their senses heightened when wielding a throwing weapon, be it a slingshot or a bow. Spec B were pole arms, staves and basically elongated weaponry. Spec C was a sought after specialization which granted bonuses to swords and knives. Spec D was an affinity with axes and maces. While Spec E held a bonus to Shields. Spec F provided bonuses to unarmed or fist weaponry. 

  However, what truly mattered in this era was potential, and it was ranked in a simple matter of S being the highest, and E being lowest. An S ranked villager or simple mage had the ability to surpass everyone else, even with they were mismatched with spells affinities or specializations.

  Ivy Knowles, the cleric-nurse tasked with informing the parents of their child's future hated this part of the job. She had met all sorts of parents, those who vented their anger on her when realizing their child's potential was diminished, to heart-wrenching sorrow when confronted with the harsh realities of child having diminished capabilities. Greater men have attempted to change the merciless dice of classes, but non have succeeded. They have tried Eugenics, forbidden magics, even physical experimentation, but nothing yielded results. Many turned to prayer, which brought comfort at the very least. 

With practiced movement and poise, Ivy headed to the viewing hall, where anxious parents awaited the news of their child.

"[WP] You are the Memory Sniper, a hero who can eliminate one fact or memory from someone's brain, like making a mad scientist forget the code needed to activate his doomsday device.",Meshakhad," I'm actually surprised that someone decided to make a writing prompt about me, considering that most of the general public despises me for not giving them their way. People in this world are too narcissistic for my liking, but unfortunately I was born here, therefore I have to deal with it. So, most likely due to my title you've made some assumptions about me and my work. Before I go into this story, I am going to clarify some things about me. 

First of all, it is true that I can eliminate a fact or memory from someone's mind. Whether or not I eliminate the one you want me to is not your choice, it's mine. I don't have to bend to anyone's will, which is an awesome bonus. When it comes to erasing a memory, I have to read through your mind. Basically, if I focus on you hard enough, I am able to see every memory on a timeline that you have ever had. Yes, it is a long timeline, but I am able to read memories at a high speed, therefore it only takes a few seconds to pick. When I can see your entire timeline, I separate the good and the bad memories, so I have two timelines rather than one. The good is green, the bad is orange. From there, I choose which memory to get rid of. Originally this was a difficult job because I used to eliminate some memories instead of others, but I've had quite awhile to practice. 

Another thing is that I can only eliminate one memory, therefore I can only get rid of a memory from someone once. Once I change a person's life, I cannot change it again. I will no longer be able to see your timeline, therefore I cannot make any corrections. Third thing is that even though people think this for some odd reason, I am not immortal. I have a mortal clock like every other human. I will die at some point, which is fine with me. 

Now that I've clarified myself, I will tell you about how I was able to get my first girlfriend, now wife- it has been the best memory altering that I have ever done in my career of killing memories. 6 years ago, I was approached by a girl named Erin while I was eating lunch at the local Burger King. I do have a normal human job outside of memory sniping, I work as an accountant for a law firm. Anyway, I was sitting at the back of the restaurant eating my burger, when a 23 year old woman with short blonde hair ran into the place and directly at me. 

""You have to help me please, memory sniper. My best friend Alexis is going through the worst heartbreak that I have ever seen. Please do something to help her ease the pain."" He eyes were pleading and also...fake? I raised an eyebrow and swallowed the food I was chewing. ""Okay...what is going on with her?"" Erin took a seat across from me and began her story about Alexis.

""Allie has been my best friend since sophomore year of high school. We've always been there for each other, even through the tough times. She started seeing a guy named Jared a little over two years ago, and from that first date she was head over heels for him. Jared seemed like a good guy, I thought he  cared about Allie a lot. He was supportive of her, took care of her when she was sick, surprised her with random presents, and so on. She's told me a few times that she wanted to marry him. Well, she and Jared broke up about a month ago because she found out that Jared was cheating on her. She saw text messages in her phone suggesting that he'd been cheating for a few months. He did confess, but didn't name the other girl involved. Allie has been distraught ever since, and I just need her to be okay."" Erin began to cry, but something seemed off about her behavior. Without saying a word, I decided to read Erin's memories before looking at Allie's. 

Erin was acting strange because she was the one going behind Allie's back and hooking up with Jared. She didn't come to me because she was upset over her ""best friend's"" heartbreak, she came to me because she didn't want Allie to find out. Erin didn't even feel guilty, and she'd still been with Jared. The last time she was with him was last night. I switched over to Allie's memories and saw things more shocking. Over the span of time Allie had been friends with Erin, she had been hurt much more by Erin then she had been by Jared. I went back over to Erin and saw all of the cruel acts that she had done to Alexis. She had lied to her, stole from her, and didn't even genuinely care about her. I was internally seething. 

I went through the timeline that Allie had, selected a memory, and erased it. ""There. Fixed."" ""What'd you change?"" Erin asked eagerly. I smiled. ""She doesn't remember ever becoming friends with you."" Her smile faltered. ""What the hell?!"" ""Oh Erin,"" I was shaking my head. ""You're the biggest hypocrite I've come across. You don't care about Allie, you never have. So I took away a friendship that has always been fake.""

I met Allie personally soon after, and she became my best friend. We dated for 4 years, then I married her. Even now, after altering several memories, that is the best change I've made. I have to be somewhat grateful for Erin though; because of her I met my wife. ",xLemonPhantomx
"[WP] People all around town are going to a new doctor who seems to be able to cure just about everything imaginable, with the only repercussion being a bizarre neck pain. He goes by the name Dr. Acula",MrRocde,"The village of Solismont was found in the unfortunate spot of a small and snowy valley, surrounded by a terrain of white hills and mountains. The path to the depths of the valley was long and winding through said hills, and as one descended into the town, the presence of light grew both rarer and more precious. Robert found himself on this path now, pulling his collar up and keeping the warm thoughts of a fireplace back in his dearly missed office close to mind. 

The freelance investigator found himself dragging his own body down this frozen path after hearing rumours of the disappearances and apparent reappearances of people residing in the state of Alaska, with the centre of these odd events being Solismont; after the disappearance of a loved one, families would be left waiting in desperation of a sign for weeks at a time, until a letter from the recently departed loved one would arrive, bidding them good fortune from the little mining town of Solismont. 

With natural light only a memory to Robert, the sight of dozens of gas-lamps shining through the fog brought his spirits back up; after an hour of trudging through the thick snow, he had finally arrived. Robert was barely conscious enough to notice the wooden buildings around the lamps, nor was he aware of the inhabitants of the town rushing out through the fog towards him. All the man could think of to do was lie down and close his eyes for a short while, and listen to the music of the howling wind around him, and try to ignore the shriek cutting through it:

*""Somebody get Acula out here!""*

----------------------------------------

Robert's eyes felt like they were clasped shut with frost, but he forced them open anyway. At first, he cursed the light that felt as if it was stabbing into his sockets, before welcoming the returning sensation of sight. With his recently reacquired ability to see, Robert gazed around the surrounding room and allowed his eyes to fall onto a pale man standing just beside him, with a look of hospitality plastered onto his face.

With an odd amount of friendliness, the pale man spoke with a thick accent that Robert couldn't quite recognise; ""Good morning sir, and welcome to Solismont. May I ask, if you don't mind my abrupt inquiry, what you were doing coming all the way out here to Solismont by yourself?""

Robert didn't hesitate to let his nature as an investigator come first, and grunted, ""I would like to speak to the one in charge here.""

A smile interlaced with some form of desire crept onto the man's face. ""I am. My name is Dr. Acula during business hours, but otherwise you can call me Vlad.""

Robert forced his body to curve up into a sitting position on the medical bench he was laid upon. ""You're the doctor around here, and the mayor?""

""Oh, not exactly, but the good mayor felt it wise to leave me in charge during his absence.""

""Bullshit.""

Dr. Acula was slightly taken aback by the abruptness of his guest's rudeness. ""Well, if you don't believe me, would you like to ask some of my other satisfied customers?""

As if on cue, a pale young woman that wouldn't seem odd if labelled as a personification of lust opened the door of the room in which Robert and Acula had been conversing, and directly addressed the latter; ""Is he ready yet Vlad? The Long Night is coming soon.""

The statement confirmed Robert's suspicions that something was amiss, while also striking something resembling fear into his now tight chest. ""The *Long Night*?""

The good doctor casually drew a pocket watch from his waistcoat and gazed at it as he replied, ""Yes, the Long Night will be starting in a few minutes."" Acula looked back to Robert with eyes still containing an artificial friendliness, but also malice. ""You arrived at an acute time Mr Thurston. Your luck must be boundless. Tell me, how is your neck? Surely you are feeling it by now?""

Robert suddenly became aware of his body's strange symptoms; his skin felt as if it was losing its feeling, his senses felt as if they were being invaded, his teeth were aching, his strength felt both sapped and somehow stronger than ever, and the investigator could only be painfully aware of the feeling of blood loss in his neck. Without further prompting, the man dove off the table and scrambled for the door as Acula laughed.

""It has already been done my friend. You are falling asleep so that you may dream forever with the rest of us.""

Robert pushed the young woman out of the way and freed himself from the doctor's shack into the snow. He only had his underclothes on, yet he couldn't feel the frost. He could, however, still hear the doctor's cursed words.

*We have been gathering supporters just for this night*

Robert stumbled through the snow, but there didn't seem to be an end to the white.

*This land is one of plenty of daylight, and plenty of moonlight in return*

The investigator crashed into the snow, and brought his hands to his ears to try and get the doctor out of his head.

*My patients are ready for the Long Night, and with it the moonlight that shall guide us to our feast*

The man could only scream into the snow, as if it would numb the pain.

*You shall join us and feast upon the land, and we shall complete the ritual and bring all of the world with us into the Long Night, and we shall never go thirsty again*

The vampire brought his aching head up from the snow, hating himself for his new thirst, and prepared for the inevitable insanity as he watched the barely visible sun dip below the mountains for the last time.

*Dark is the natural state, and light is the invader, and now we become the purge that shall free the world of the light*

[WP] Two soldiers slowly realize that the prisoner they've captured is actually the king of the opposing army,B0bsterls,""" Hey Jerry, does his face look somehow familiar"" 

"" No Alex, it does not, and what do you mean by familiar, I am not too keen on remembering faces"" Jerry answers

 ""In the way that I feel, I saw him somewhere before,"" Alex says

"" A deja vu?"" Jerry inquires

""No, I didn't see him in a dream or vision or stuff like that, more like I remember seeing his, it's on the tip of my tongue"" Alex is struggling to remember

"" Like a photo of his""  Jerry says unsure of his words

"" Exactly, I saw his face on a picture, an article in a newspaper... holy shit Jerry, you won't believe who we caught... god damn, we'll be national heroes"" Alex is ecstatic

""What are you talking about man?"" Jerry gives him the look

""We caught the goddamned king of South Astoria, its king Philip the 5 of house Caramduqe, we won the war for our country, will be promoted into generals"" Alex shouts in excitement

""You really think, we somehow managed to capture the king of the opposing army"" Jerry is still unsure 

"" Yes we have him, and on his hands are our ropes, we won the war, and guess who will have to be praised for such a swift victory, us"" he speaks too fast to be understood 

"" Calm down Alex, I don't understand a word you say"" Jerry has his palms in front of him

""Okay, we captured the king of North Astoria"" Alex speaks syllable by syllable 

Both of the look at their prisoner with a green large like a slice of a ripe watermelon, he frowns at their gaze, you can hear the air escaping his lips that are pressed tightly so to imitate a chimney

""Say, are you sure Alex, aren't we going to end up looking like two idiots if we bring this guy and he is not who you say he is, we need to be sure, say how can we check it?"" Jerry is speaking like a conspirator 

""We can ask him"" Alex answers

"" Good plan. Hey, you, are you the king of North Astoria"" Jerry asks

The man frowns and turns his head to the side

""Jerry what are you doing, he is nobility he won't answer you if you ask him like that, he has pride and all the other things that come with being a man in a high position' Alex says

"" So he's one of those entitled bastards that don't look at you unless you treat them with care and call them my lord and my lady"" Jerry answers in spite

"" Yes, he is one of those, so let me try. Your Highness, are you the king of North Astoria"" Alex looks at the prisoner

He isn't even flinching from his position 

"" I think he is mad at my comments"" Jerry barges in

"" He is"" Alex adds

"" So what's next, I mean he is not our ing or anything, we can get a little rough"" Jerry winks at Alex

"" Oh, we can totally like torture him until he says who he is"" 

The prisoner is not turning but his position is changed he is listening, both of them smile at each other in the mischievous way of  corny comic book villains 

"" How about we beat him with a rock, oh look at that one, it's sharp and big, it's almost a boulder"" Jerry says

"" No, look at that tree branch it's thick and looks heavy, how about we use it instead "" Alex adds

"" Or we can set up a fire and heat our swords and apply them to him, or even easier we can burn his hand"" Jerry adds with growing enthusiasm

""Better yet, we can give him some non-lethal wounds"" 

"" Stop, you peasants I am king Philip"" the king shouts trying to portray dignity but every word trembles in fear

""So you are, then Alex you were right, we are going to be rewarded heftily,"" Jerry says happy

"" Or you could do something else"" the king intervenes

""Like what?"" Alex asks, Jerry is looking quizzically at the king

""Free me and join my army as generals, does that sound good to you,"" the king says

""You think we are that dumb, just because we are simple folk doesn't mean that you should treat us like idiots, we have a head on our shoulders, free you and become generals? The first thing you would do in such a case would be to cut our heads the moment we reach your castle. Don't look down on us because of our rank, the only thing that makes you special is that you were born to rich parents in rest you are a simple human like us so get off your high horse and shut up, you drive me mad"" 

The king is wide-eyed he can't believe his ears and eyes, never before in his life has he been talked to that way. In his mind mechanisms begin to turn, he needs a plan of escape, but all he can think of is ways to insult one of his tormenters

""Why you look so shook, did you not expect a coherent answer, was I not clear enough?"" Jerry says

Alex is looking at them talk, he starts to see Jerry in a new light, he looked up to him, but now he truly respects the man with whom he fights side by side 

"" I hope you'll enjoy our nice prison, it's in a tower, just how you like it all high and made out of stone, but instead of a throne you'll a dirty cold floor maybe with a bit of hay, and then the gallows"" Alex intervenes 

""Alex why would you spoil the future for your highness, don't you know that we owe respect to royalty"" 

Both of them break into a fit of laughter, the king uses this moment to try and drag the rope that holds him to himself and succeeds. He starts running in an undisclosed direction but he doesn't make it too far before he is hit with the handle of a sword in the head, he wakes up in prison.

Jerry and Alex become generals and spend the rest of their days in the capital enjoying the good life. King Philip is executed and his breathless body is sent as a threat to all in North Astoria who still want to fight.

She said, wrapping a blue towel around the boy, who welcomed her warm embrace. He was feeling kinda sleepy, after all.""Can we go to mcdonald's tomorrow?"" 

""I don't know, you better ask your dad."" She said,  carrying him to his room, which was more of a pirate shrine, if anything.""You're gonna be with him for the rest of the weekend, okay? Just like we agreed."" But he didn't remember agreeing to *that*. ""Why can't he just come live with us again?"" 

She pulled his anchor print pajamas and underwear from a 'treasure chest', and placed them on his small boat-shaped bed, unsure of what to reply.""Well -- your dad and I ... are having a... We are..."" 

Silence, the usual answer. His least favorite one, too. It made him feel heavy, frustrated. And other emotions that made him feel dizzy, and ones he didn't want to think about.

""Nevermind."" He sighed, putting on his pajamas, and slipping inside bed.""-- Do you want to continue reading our book?"" She asked quietly, but the boy shook his head.""I finished it yesterday."" 

""Without me!"" She faked indignation,""Now that's just rude Mr. Hawkins."" She tickled the boy, making him squirm. His giggles growing into laughter that drowned the tension from before. Once quiet, the woman asked a question that caught him by surprise.""What were you doing in the tub?"" She ran a hand through his soft hair.

""Taking a shower."" He snickered.

""Don't be a smartbutt,"" she flicked his nose,""tell me."" 

""I don't know. I was just thinking...""

""About your dad?""

""Nope... hm, I don't know."" He shrugged,""About a pirate..."" 

""John Silver? Or Jim Hawkins.?"" 

The boy rolled his eyes,""Jim is not a pirate! But when I buy a ship, I won't throw you off, because you are my mom."" 

""Oh wow, you are very merciful."" 

""I know. But no, it wasn't them. It was a pirate who had weird hair. He had a dot like me!"" He pointed to the mole under his left eye. 

""Oh really?""

""Uh-huh. I was thinking about how he survived."" 

She frowned.""Survived what?""

""Being chained and thrown to the sea.""

""*What*!?""

""Yeah! I think some mean sailors did it to him, because he was so sad."" He yawned,""But then he came back and killed them all.""

""Yikes, you imagined all of that? Or did that happen in one of your books?"" 

He shrugged again,""I dreamed about it -- I don't think he liked the sea... do you think he was afraid of it?"" 

""Hm, I think I would be afraid if something like that happened to me, wouldn't you?"" 

""Yeah. -- good night!"" 

""Good night."" She kissed his forehead,""I'll ask your dad about mcdonald's, okay? Sailor's promise."" 

""Sailor's promise."" He mumbled, eyes already closed. Mind drifting beyond the shores of his imagination, and into waters uncharted.

""What are you doing?"" The pirate turned towards the voice that interrupted his thoughts. Sure enough, it was his inquisitive commander, always tailing after him like a dog.""Thinking."" 

""About?"" 

""Does it matter?"" He looked towards the sea, already the sun dipping in the horizon.""I suppose not."" Replied the commander, hands placed behind his back.

""About the sea."" 

The commander gazed at the pirate.""The sea?""

"[WP] Most of the world has been urbanized for some time now, but the evolutionary arms race continues among the various animals and plants that eke out a living in our cities. Somewhere in the depths of the concrete jungle, the first spark of consciousness is lit inside the brain of a rat.",RevolutionaryRabbit,"Taut landed with a thud, the gaps were getting wider but they'd have to stick to the rooftops if they wanted to have any chance of survival. 

Three other men accompanied Taut, each landing behind him much more softly than he had. 

The others had never seen Taut in their life prior to just the day before, but he could see from their expressions that he was already cementing himself as the weakest link in the unit. 

Each man carried the standard Revolution sub-machine gun, it was light and compact, but most importantly it was cheap. Cheap was the name of the game for the Council lately, they'd left controlling the outbreaks up to mercenary teams due to their lower cost compared to trained soldiers. 

Taut fought exhaustion as he tried to keep up with the others, two had made the next jump already, it had been silently decided that he'd jump last. Fear and determination was plastered over the faces of all of Taut's team. Their assigned outbreak was the most deadly in history, three teams dead, zero survivors, the Council had been forced to offer a pretty hefty sum to anyone who could quell it. Right now no amount of money seemed worth it, though. Taut leaped across the gap in the roofs, sailing over open air before rolling as he landed and springing awkwardly to his feet. The others were already moving on. 

Taut looked behind him, was that... scuttling? 

""Hey guys I definitely heard something!"" Taut yelled to the others, who quickly came to join him, guns raised. They may have thought he was incompetent, but they were too far from civilisation now to take any risks. 

The team's assigned leader: Maim, checked his map while the other three scanned the surroundings with their eyes. 

""We should have been checking more regularly, we're in the dead centre of the outbreak's known location, they could come at us at any second.""

Taut's eyes hardened, maybe it hadn't been his imagination after all. 

A dull rumbling sounded all around the four mercenaries. They stood together, looking all around to see where the noise was coming from.

""What exactly are we dealing with here?"" Another of the four, named Rift, asked.

It was a good question, rampant urbanisation had led to animals being increasingly inconvenient in human lives. Following the development of artifical meat, milk and many other animal products, the question had been raised. What were animals even good for? It had taken time but eventually the Council had reached a conclusion. Animals were obsolete, they were no longer of any use to humans, and so the great extermination began. 

The animal population was decimated almost overnight, thousands of species went extinct, but those who survived became a threat the likes of which humans had never seen. Similar to the rapid mutation of pathogens to become immune to drugs when they are overexposed to them, those few species that survived underwent evolution of unprecedented speed. They were harder to kill, harder to catch, and in some cases, incredibly deadly to humans. 

Whole cities had to be forsaken to these mutated animals and the Council, now desperately short on money and rapidly losing the faith of the public, was forced to send in mercenary teams to combat the threat. 

The rumbling grew ever-louder, Taut raised his gun, this was it for him. He'd never get to start a family with Alaina, he'd never get that house in the Elysium that he'd always dreamed of. He would die here, alone, a hired thug sent to die fighting an enemy of his employer's own creation.

A multitude of shapes broke over the rooftop, they moved quickly, agilely, and with intent to kill. This level of organisation, a pack this large, Taut had never seen anything like it. The sound of Revolutions being fired echoed all around him, he squinted and saw what it was he was fighting. 

Rats, thousands of them, Taut squeezed the trigger and stopped dozens of rats dead in their tracks. Dozens more climbed over them, however, and they continued their advance. 

Taut backed up slowly, he felt himself press against the mercenary behind him, he had nowhere to go.

I stop breathing, I run out of oxygen, I die. People do it all the time in their sleep. I used to laugh at it with my buddies. Now it's happening to me. I know it.

My parents didn't notice, of course. They thought I was just stuck on some cereal. I tried to tell them, of course. They laughed and told me to go to school.

What could I tell anyone? This was so stupid. If I don't concentrate on breathing I die? Who ever thought of that one? The day's passing. lessons. Teachers. Lunch. I keep my head down, tell myself to keep breathing. That's it, you'll be fine, I tell  myself. Every now and then I try to gaze off. I can't. Then I thought occured to me.

What if I fall asleep? I can't think. Maybe I'll be woken up when I start choking. But if I concentrate long enough maybe that won't happen. I'll just go to sleep and never wake up. I have to stop this.

His name was Desmond, but ever since third grade, he'd asked me to call him by his supervillain alter ego. He seemed to enjoy it, and I was indifferent. It didn't seem to be causing any harm—at least, not at the time.

""Sure thing, Iceman,"" I nonchalantly nibbled on the end of my pencil.

""Wait, is that mine? You always take my stuff—and you're eating it! Gross!"" Iceman seemed visibly shaken.

""Sorry,"" I paused, ""Do you want it back?""

""No, you can keep it."" His face contorted as a thought replaced his annoyance. ""I did it. I finally figured out your sidekick name.""

""What's that?"" I said nonchalantly. 

""Thorn! Get it? Because you're a thorn in my side. It's a perfect name,"" said Iceman.

He held out his hand, inviting a high-five. I shrugged and our hands met in agreeance. Iceman didn't have any powers back then, but his palms were cool to the touch. 

The two of us had an atypical dynamic throughout high school. He joined the debate team; I distracted him with silly faces from the audience during the most critical exchanges. We ran marathons; I ran behind him and occasionally stepped on the heels of his shoes. At lunch, when he wasn't looking, I would steal his french fries. I'm sure he hated it, but we were still best friends. 

The night of our graduation, he turned to me. His eyes were surprisingly firey. 

""It's almost time, Thorn, ""just like we planned. We're about to take over the world.""

""Whatever you say, boss,"" I smiled. Everyone in the auditorium emitted a sense of accomplishment. Our fellow classmates through their caps into the air as Iceman turned to me.

""You have to promise me, no matter how hard it gets—we won't ever hurt each other. We're going to rule the world together,"" he said.

I flipped the tassel from my hat into his face. He blew it out with a quick, cool huff.

""Sure, I promise. After all, it wouldn't be much fun ruling the world alone,"" I said.

Some people say that college is a time for adventure and self-discovery. For Iceman, it was a time for consolidating power and defeating heroes. During his freshman year, he learned he could crystalize his hands into shards of ice. The hockey team seemed most impressed, and he quickly became a campus icon. I frequently turned the shower temperature down during morning routine to see if it would give him full-body ice armor. It did.

By sophomore year, he learned he could contain the ice to a short blast. None of the fraternities challenged us to a snowball fight. On April Fools Day, I replaced his sugar shaker with salt. He didn't like that either.

By junior year, he had grown into his powers. He was everything you'd expect of an ice-themed villain without the white hair and blue skin. The friends we made freshman year started giving us a cold shoulder. Sure, Iceman still had me—but he hated being ignored. One-by-one he sought out the country's strongest heroes. RubberRoy, PidgeonMan, and PoliceNinja fell with ease. As it turns out, ice is a pretty efficient way of winning fights. His battle with FireSoldier was the high-rated news special of all-time. The country wept when the soldier's flame finally went out.

I watched from the loveseat of our dormroom. When Iceman returned that night, I knew what I had to do.

""So you beat, FireSoldier, huh?"" I asked as he walked in.

""Yeah, I'm really sore. I need a medical pack."" he heaved himself onto the couch.

""Uhh...about that,"" I said as I faked a stammer.

""You used them all?!"" he said.

""You knew I had those paper cuts. Why didn't you get more?"" I said.

""And you knew I had my fight today. Jeeze, you can be so inconsiderate,"" Iceman replied.

""Sorry,"" I said as I scribbled in my notebook.

He sighed. 

""Well I finally did it. I took over the world for us, Thorn,"" said Iceman. ""What do you want to do now?""

""Hmm,"" I paused in thought, ""wanna get some pizza?"" I asked.

""Pizza?!"" he said in disbelief.

""You're right. They might not deliver to this address again after you froze the last guy,"" I said.

""I took over the world and all you want to do is eat pizza?!"" he screamed.

""That's all I really want to do right now,"" I said lazily.

""You *never* want to do fun supervillain things. Sometimes I wonder why I made you my sidekick,"" he said wearily.

""Well we can't really go out and party. Everyone is afraid of you,"" I said.

""Afraid of *me*?"" he asked slowly.

""Yeah-""

""You mean afraid of *us*?"" he declared.

""Not really, no one really knows who I am,"" I said, clicking my tongue. Iceman hated that.

""Sure they do-"" he paused, ""Is-is that my pencil?!""

I removed the chewed pencil I'd been doodling with from my mouth.

""I told you not to do that anymore!"" he said breathily. His wounds must have been setting in.

""I can't help it, Desmon-"" I said.

""What?!"" he interrupted me. ""What did you just call me, Thorn?""

""Shit, sorry. I forgot,"" I said

""You're so immature...I can't even stand to look at you right now. I'm going to take a quick shower,"" he walked into the bathroom. Hot water rushed out of the room like fog. As soon as I heard him sigh in relaxation, I twisted the temperature knob.

""This won't hurt, buddy. I promise! You just have to chill for a bit"" I said.

The cold water collided with his body and slowly encased him in a crystal shell. I held the temperature dial firm as he reached for it sluggishly. His wounds made him weaker than usual. I held him away with ease. 

""You're so..."" he said as the ice shell neared his face, ""annoying.""

""I know,"" I said.

""I'm done trying to rule the world with you. When I get out, I'm going to move to Bermuda and work as a bartender,"" he said as his eyes glazed over.

"[WP] You can retake from any moment of your life keeping your now knowledge and strength, but those years you go back are substracted from your total lifespam",Bern-e,"It sounds really simple. And it is. Being able to retake my life from any point with my memories intact and the memories i choose stay intact as well.

Being able to ""predict"" the future by going back a few hours when something important happened was a phenomenal ability. First I discovered this ability when I was 15 and had to take a test. That test came out of nowhere and I wished I could turn back time one day to prepare for it. I opened my eyes and I was in my room playing on my console. 

I immediately paused the game and looked around. The date was exactly one day before the surprise exam. I was baffled but I didn't think about it too much at that moment. Even my mother was surprised that i was suddenly eager to learn for school.

Lo and behold: I aced the test. The test that occurred in the exact same way it did a day ago(for me only though). Of course I would have abused this power of mine a lot more if there wasn't a catch to it. For every second I rewind time this second gets taken away from my lifespan. I knew because every time I did it I felt a tiny sharp pain in my chest area. I estimated an 80 year lifespan for myself so I had a point of reference. 

When I was 18 I visited my very trustworthy friend of 8 years and told him about the ability. I took out my smartphone and threw it against the wall, shattering it completely. I touched his forehead with my hand and rewinded 10 minutes. He was completely perplexed at what just happened and was even more so when I took my smartphone out of my pocket, completely intact. I told him that my own lifespan is reduced with every rewind so he wouldn't ask for any unreasonable favors. And of course I told him to keep it a secret from everybody.

In the following years I would use it here and there to remake tiny mistakes, like failing my drivers license the first time because of my nervousness. Another shot at it would have costed 400, so I rewinded one day and practiced with my fathers car on an empty parking area.

I didn't use it for much else though. After school I started an apprenticeship as an architect where I had to use my life-reset, as I called it, to memorize questions on tests and reset to the start of the test. That was only a few hours at a time. I thought if I continued like that I would only shorten my life for a month in my entire life.

But as nice as that thought was it came different. when I ended my apprenticeship at the age of 24 I started a job as an architect at a normal building company, nothing big. During that time however I met a woman named Stella. She joined our group of friends and we became good friends quickly. She was a cheerful person with a nice sense of humor. After about two year and many times our group went out I started to get interested in her. I asked her out on a date and she agreed. 

That was the beginning of our relationship and we were surprisingly compatible. With 27 we moved together and a year later, after 4 years of being together we got married. I knew i could trust her and she knew as well. But i never noticed how she never really talked about her childhood in detail. When i asked a bit more detailed about it she got really defensive about it. 

I told her she could trust me and whatever was making uncomfortable she could tell me. She started getting watery eyes and began crying. Crying like I have never seen her cry before.

She decided to open up to me. Her relation to men is actually kinda broken due to her father and how he treated her. Her parents were normal workers and she was a normal child having a normal life as far as she knew. however when she was 13 her mother visited her great-parents in another city and had to go for 3 days. During that visit however she was killed by a drunk driver and died that night, on the street.

That incident scared her father immensely, so much even that he started to drink to forget his wife's death. By doing so he became more violent towards Stella and started to beat her when he got mad. That continued for five more years when she decided to run away after she finished school. She moved in with a friend into a small apartment where she could work for a few yeas before deciding on an apprenticeship.

After she told me all this i could understand why she was always quiet when we had a date, or when we visited each other. I hugged her for a minute before letting go.

Stella -""My father was great but that incident changed him completely. If my mother was still alive he wouldn't have changed... I miss her so much""

She started sobbing with tears rolling down her cheeks.

""I'm sorry to hear that. But if...if you could go back and tell your mother what was going to happen...would you do it?""

""Y...you mean like time travel?""

""More like...if you could rewind time before your mother dies and tell her what was going to happen and thus prevent her death...despite having to relive your entire childhood again...would you do it?""

""I would have loved a childhood with my mother alive""

""But with your current knowledge...reliving your childhood?""

""That's oddly specific ...why do you ask?""

""Because...i can...rewind time...with memories intact""

""Is that a joke?""

""Its 19:43 now"" looking at my watch

I put my hand on her forehead and rewinded for half an hour, before she told me the story of her mother.

We were lying on the couch, watching a movie when she suddenly stood up.

""What just happened?""

I paused the movie.

""Remember what time i said it was?""

""Yes you said 19:43...its 19:13. HOW did you do that?""

""Like i said. I can rewind time with memories intact.""

She was completely stunned.

""My offer still stands. You could go back and save your mother at the price of having to relive your whole childhood.""

""You...you would actually do that? What about this?"" she stretched her arms out and looked around ""What about us?""

""We'll just have to find each other when we finish school again."" I said with a smile on my face.

She was beginning to get watery eyes again, hugging me. ""I...I'll do it. I'm ready"" she said. I put my hand on her forehead and think back...""when you were 13...and you're 27 now so...14 years""

""Well we have October now and my mom died in March so its closer to 14.5 years""

""I'll just make 14 years and 7 months. That's that.""

""Thank you so much"" she gave me a kiss.

""One last thing. I can't do that infinite times. There's a limit. I only do it for very important matters""

""I will definitely not let this chance slip. What kind of limit?""

I looked at her with a smile and said ""For every second i go back...I lose it from my life""

**----------------------------------------------------------**

I wake up the next day stretching and standing up. Then I had a look on my calendar: February. I was looking into my mirror and saw a 14 year old me smiling back.

"[WP] Two people fall in love at the same time. Slight problem, they both fall in love with you.",iteoi,"They smell good. They smell different. The one with the blue body covering smells strongly of a scent I don't know, but wasn’t like others. It wasn’t bad, but I think it isn’t its own. The one who stood next to it, in gray, smelled of grass and something really strong and the smell that the things they call car rides make. They speak fast to each other, and slow to the leader. 

The new pair smell very alike. I think they might be from the same pack. One is older, and smells it. The young one smells a little like grass too. They speak to the first pair, then wait for them to speak back. It’s strange. I know the one in the blue covering, it has been here before. It speaks to the leader when it comes. It plays with me, but not now. I’m excited to play with her again. 

The one wearing the blue shirt spoke with its companion, rapid-fire like I’d heard them do before. They spoke with the leader. The leader spoke with the youngest’s companion, who spoke with the leader, who spoke with the-

The youngest wants to play. I just want to play with the youngest. Or the one in blue. Or their companions. They speak so much, I speak too. Why don't they play? They all look at me, then speak more. The youngest plays while the four others speak. I licked its face, wondering if it had any food. I think it made a noise of joy, but it moved its face away. I’m confused. 

Camila had finally brought her husband Eduardo, who seemed to be open to the idea of a dog for their family, but was shy. He didn’t speak English as well as his wife, a secretary, and gave only short answers to my questions. He seemed distracted, like he’d rather be somewhere else. At work most likely. Judging by his dress he was on a break. My guess was landscaping. I brought Brownie, so named due to his chocolate lab coloring and lack of a name tag when he was abandoned on the side of the road, out so Eduardo could meet him. He smiled instantly, saying “he’s big,” and spoke with his wife in Spanish. Camila had come in looking for a small dog, but had taken to Brownie instantly.

Then Arthur and his grandson Sean came in. I'd learned their names after Sean made a beeline for the aging Brownie, and I introduced myself to Arthur. He, Camila, Eduardo, and I discussed how to proceed. I got the feeling Camila had her heart set on Brownie, but the longer the young lab played with Sean the more all four of us could see they adored each other. 

After some discussion, I offered an out to Camila; a more social dog. A husky; a more high-energy breed who would be able to keep up with her four children. Five, when her unborn child was old enough; Camila was obviously pregnant.

The leader gives the youngest’s companion a few items. They speak more while I play with the youngest. They did something with really thin things that smelled like weird, bland plant, using their front legs to make parts of it black. The youngest showed me his teeth and put his front legs around me. I didn’t like that, but it didn't hurt. When he let go, a thin thing was attached to the thing around my neck, and I followed them to their car ride.

"[WP] ""All it takes is one generation to brainwash a population and convince them that reality doesn't exist."" ~ Marie Lu",axmszr,"The first missile was launched on April twenty-second, at around twelve-thirty. Later, politicians would attempt to excuse it. *An employee misinterpreted a secure transmission*, *It was meant to be a test, but the inhibitor failed*, or *It was a justifiable retaliation* for some event.

Nobody could really pinpoint when the war actually started, but that missile worked well enough. Sure, to call it the start of the war was to ignore decades of military and political tension, to push to the side 'coincidental deaths' of political leaders. It was a barely subtle attempt to pin the blame for the war on one particular country, when anyone with even the barest historical knowledge would know that things weren't quite that simple.

In the end, it appeared very little had actually changed in the many, many years since the first World War. Sure, the techniques of war were different, the vehicles and weapons barely recognizable - but the cause, the *justification*, that hadn't changed in the slightest.

One country followed another country followed another country and then--

A thousand people live in a bunker the size of a small town. They have not seen sunlight for five years. Five years since they felt rain upon their skin; five years since they breathed in that wonderful, unbelievably fresh air that so few can remember.

There were fifteen hundred people to begin with. Sixty died of old age, three hundred of disease, forty of miscellaneous causes.

A growing number of children miss their parents, more than they miss the sky or air or *freedom*. 

There is one thing to be thankful for, and that is *hope*. There were solutions found for food, for fresh water, and they exist in this bunker. Nobody will starve, not one person should die of dehydration. Not for decades - centuries, really, but nobody wants to even consider that possibility.

Two thousand people live in a bunker the size of a bunker. This is the bunker they know, and the only reason they consider it a 'bunker' is to wonder whether others like it exist elsewhere. If *elsewhere* even exists. Some citizens - bunkerzens, really, but their language has some bizarre antiquities in it that the elderly like to use, and so the next generation honours them - wonder if there is more to life. More to 'the world', whatever that is. 

They attempt to improve things. There were so many imperfections, so many problems with the system that the founders generations ago had imposed. Food and water had been consumed too quickly, exercise hadn't been made the priority that it should have been, strange books filled with tales of fantasy had filled children's minds with bizarre and unrealistic hopes.

Less people died. 

The family unit improves.

Three-thousand people live in a bunker that is not large enough. The fact that it is called 'a bunker', however, raises questions. The wording heavily implies that there may exist other bunkers - perhaps larger, better, vastly improved. Children dream of visiting them, and adults debate whether or not such a thing might be possible. 

Sometimes, they send out expeditions. Jean-Paul is a member of one. They don't know what's 'outside' of the bunker, because of the several locks and precautions that no bunkerzen has ever returned through. 

Jean-Paul wants to be the first to return, with his five companions, all good friends.

A rusty elevator brings them up, and they open a door. There is a hallway, and another door, and another hallway, and more doors. There are so many doors, Jean-Paul wants to name the place *Mordor*. It's a joke that nobody else would get, a reference to a nearly-destroyed book he found in a closet once. 

Thinking of his collection of ratty books is a distraction. There is one last door. They know this, because it has a sign, reading *FINAL EXIT: DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT TAKING PROPER PRECAUTIONS*.

Jean-Paul tightens his belt. This may or may not be sufficient.

Six men walk out of the entrance to a bunker and into an unfamiliar, alien landscape. 

They are not wearing protective gear, but very little would have been strong enough anyways.

Four-thousand people live in a bunker that is not large enough, and an additional thousand suffer in it. 

Sometimes, they send out expeditions.

""All the while, I'm controlling all the puppet strings to the world market and economy, controlling their every move by using Intel to play with their minds. In that way, I have achieved world domination and they don't even know it.""

A child raised his hand. 

""Yes?""

""Do you have a ray gun?""

The evil mastermind sighed. Career day was truly beneath him, but it made for good press. 

""Yes I do.""

[WP] Every soldier has number of kills displayed and updated on their back - except for one - his back is covered with the symbol for infinity,noximo,"The Soldier appeared at camp, silent and foreboding. Upon his helmet were the words ""HE IS COMING"" scrawled in hastily written sharpie. 

Dark humor befitting of the troops. 

He spoke to no one, seemed uninterested in anything but sitting while his paperwork was processed. Others came by and attempted to engage him in conversation before giving up, deeming him a section 8 heading back to the real world soon.

Not that there was much to return to. At this point the military was an escape from civilian life, torn apart by constant fighting and expanded military budgets that took away from feeding, housing, and educating people. The climate had gradually been shifting since the start of The Endless War, causing food shortages globally and more natural disasters.

Some of the soldiers had been born on military bases, spent their lives there and training to one day fight. The armed forces were the only ruling governments anymore.

So to hear of a section 8 was very uncommon, as most people now had been conditioned and trained for war from a young age.

The Soldier's aloof demeanor was not the only thing that caught everyone's attention; his kill score – the number which told everyone how many people you've killed – only displayed a lemniscate. 

Infinity.

It wasn't possible to kill so many people that the computers displayed an error that large, but it got people more curious and more worried. If he was going to pull a Private Pyle, they just wanted him *gone*.

A few officers stepped out from their tent and asked the Soldier to follow them inside.

The Soldier did not speak, but he listened. He observed. He waited. 

He was not in their database. His armor was not registered. As far as the government was concerned, he did not exist and therefore was an intruder.

The Soldier stood.

Time seemed to fall still as the air grew heavy. There was a blinding white light from inside the tent and an incredible blaze of fire. From outside the tent, it could be heard for miles, the booming voice of something not quite human. The voice announced: 

I AM THE BEGINNING AND THE END.",Daiyadarko
"[WP] The wall between fantasy and reality has shattered, causing fiction to manifest. Aliens, monsters, and super powered psychos are now all in the land of the real. Lucky for you and your friends, you just finished playing D&amp;D, and you find that you are unexpectedly prepared for this new world.",Lurks-to-Learn,"""I'm gonna try to talk to it.""

""Seriously? Are you kidding me right now?""

""He has every right to try,"" Riley sighed.

I walk up to the floating gelatinous cube monster and ask, ""Can you move out of our way?""

""Roll for persuasion, Demarques,"" Riley tells me, and I whip out my lucky D-20. I can feel it's power pulsing in my hands, and with newfound confidence, I wind up, and release. 

The die goes flying through the air before exploding into the number 1.

The floating cube begins to vibrate aggressively as Kiara cries out, ""Critical fucking failure! Nice going, asshole. You pissed it off!""

Well now the monster isn't the only thing pissed, as I brace myself and back up. 

Riley pinches the bridge of their nose and inhales sharply. ""Okay, athletics check everyone, and remember: bickering was fine when this was just a game."" Our DM turned actual Dungeon Master slips their notes back into their bottomless sack and spins around with a flourish, summoning a large enchanted broadsword.

""But this is real life now, and if we die here, no amount of rolls is bringing us back.""

Kiara and I nod solemnly. We have the rest of our lives to argue. 

For now, we roll.",Daiyadarko
"[WP] You're the child of the grim reaper and a human girl from an unlikely relationship. Instead of a scythe, you used a rifle. You earned the nickname, ""White Death"" and you are visiting your father after a war.",Jupefin,"Title: A Father's Last Wish to His Daughter.

I used to hate the smell of Death. Her sickening sweet perfume like flowers on a coffin, incense burned in consecration, and dust. 

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. 

Now, surrounded by her – *our* work, all I smell is rot, decay, and gunpowder. 

I have a responsibility, my mother said, to continue her work when she finished. I told her she should have been responsible and closed her legs for my father. 

I still have a scar from that day.

""Marlena,"" a thick voice brings me out of my haze, and I refocus my vision on the man in front of me. Tall, stocky, long graying dreads trailing down his back and dark brown skin. We're spitting images of each other, except I have my mother's hair color: white. 

I hate it. I hate him. I hate her for leaving me with him. 

""You called me out of my way to visit you, so it had better be worth it, Shawn."" I refuse to address him as *dad*. Dads don't force you to kill animals and beat you when you cry. Dads don't show you all the horrors of the world and warn you that weakness gets you killed. Dads don't smell like sickness and disease from years of substance abuse and neglect. 

But I understand why she chose him. He is better at being Death than mother ever could be. He completed her. 

""I know you were busy during the war, which is why I waited to summon you until after the treaty went into effect."" Shawn stands from his well-worn seat on the couch and walks towards the basement door. He pauses to look over his shoulder at me and begrudgingly, I follow. 

He leads us down the dark stairs, no light being necessary: he knows this room better than he knows me, and I can see in all lighting conditions. 

Shawn walks across the room, past work benches and tools, to a door on the far wall, padlocked shut with heavy chains. He's no spring chicken at this age, but he manages to work the chains off with relative ease, which is a bummer because I've been looking forward to personally delivering him to Hell.

""You've seen some action, I reckon,"" he drawls. ""Maybe you can truly appreciate this.""

My neck tingles with warmth, and I can't immediately judge why exactly. He only ever gave me gifts *he* deemed useful, but for some reason this feels different. I watch silently as he cracks open the old wood and reaches in to retrieve a rifle.

It's beautiful. 

The butt is a dark, polished wood finish and the barrel gleams like something straight out of my nightmares. Red jewels dot the butt, inlaid with intricate silver design. 

""You deserve this, and I've been working on it for you for years. Your mother suggested I give it to you when I felt you were ready, and after ferrying souls for ten years straight, I think it's past due."" Shawn lumbers over to hand me me new rifle, and with shaky hands, I unstrap my holster and let it fall to the ground with a loud *clank*.

The rifle in my hands feels *powerful*. Immediately I can tell this is no run of the mill craftsmanship; these materials were not easy to come by, and yet my father had made this with his own hands.

""I'm dying,"" he says quietly. ""But you knew that all along.""

My throat closes up then, and my eyes are burning. 

""You've always been able to tell when someone is close to dying, right? Then you know how long I tried to survive, just to watch you grow up.""

""Stop,"" I choke out. I can't believe he's doing this to me. 

""Marlena, my sweet rose,"" he slumps onto his stool and leans onto the work table. ""I've heard stories about you during the war, how you appear as sudden as a cloud of smoke and then vanish. What did they call you?""

""The White Death,"" I grit out, tears now falling freely down my cheeks. My dad smiles up at me, nodding. 

""I don't deserve to go to heaven, but that's not where your mother is anyways, and you know that.""

""You don't deserve this,"" I mutter. 

""Neither did you,"" he replies and closes his eyes.

I shoulder my rifle and load the chamber. ",Daiyadarko
[WP] You sold your soul to the devil but now he wants a refund,Dioksys,"I don't have time for this. I barely have time to take a dump, and now this?

I make my way from the stage to the dressing rooms with the rest of my group, having just finished another music show recording. We had amazing turnout from the fans, but that was to be expected. 

What was *not* expected, was this new coordi that apparently only I could see. He kept trying to make eye contact with me, but I refused. I quickly changed into my street clothes and wiped off my stage makeup before making an excuse to leave before everyone else and head back to the dorms.

""Stop! Hakyeon!"" He flagged me down, but I kept walking. Seriously, screw that guy. Our business was finished; why was he still bothering me?

""Go fuck yourself,"" I growl, trying to slide into the van before he can catch me. Instead, the van door refuses to unlock and my manager doesn't seem to notice my struggles. 

I spin around and face the coordi. ""You have my soul and I have a successful comeback! Leave me alone!""

""No!"" He shouts. ""Your soul is tarnished and worn already. This is crappy quality! It has cracks where your conscience is leaking out and barely generates energy!""

I toss my head back and cackle. ""I'm an idol. Do you know what kind of training we go through? They *break* our spirits just so that they can build us into their picture perfect new craze. They coerce us into favors just to get ahead of others. They abuse us to make us compliant. I barely remember my real name; you think I care about what condition my soul is in before I sell it to the Devil?""

He just stares at me in complete shock, dumbfounded. 

I wink at him and flash my best camera ready smile. ""Please buy our album, Boys' Record! Thank you for your support!"" I bow and turn to finally enter the van and shut the door in his face. 

Get thee behind me, Satan.",Daiyadarko

It was the best motel he could afford. She'd find him... Even if he did pawn it, he'd never live long enough to enjoy another good meal and nice hotel room.   He did'nt mean to push Diego off a building, just jump on his head long enough to disorient him.  The same game they'd play for years. She find the jewelry, tell him off and the game would renew.

""Hey... For what it's worth.. I did'nt mean too..""  the fox offered motioning to the intact jewelry box next to him.
She raised the gun to his head ""I'm sorry.."" he looked at her one last time.

I was behind the bar cleaning glasses when I heard Bowser grumbling.. ""Damn... How was I supposed to know that Samus and Mario were together now. I went to kidnap peach and found that samus was there.. That bitch tore through my goombas and koopas like it was nothing...""    

Link walked in and put a hand on bowser. "" I'm sorry bro.  It's even worse than that... I went to save Zelda and a giant mutant brain monster attacked me.   I just barely manage to beat that giant purple dragon and zeldas not even there. It was peach...  And she was..."" Link shook his head.. ""I've seen things and Ganon... Ugh""
""You son of a bitch. You a think you can a muscle in on my game rescuing my princess! Peach is mine!"" Mario punched at link who dodged. ""Well excuuse mee.. I heard you and samus...""
""You shutta up! You don't know anything..."" Mario sobbed..
""I just can't getta a break.. The agent told me dump pauline...And peach.. She don't a even... ""

Gannondorf walked in, and went straight for Mario..   ""You son of a bitch! You can't even fight your own battles!  Sending your girlfrend to do it for you... And you call yourself a man!""

""Uh what do you mean Gannondorf?  I did'nt ask her to do anything.""Mario started..
""My Castle you dumbass.... Samus took peach and blew it up... It's gone..""  He grabbed Mario by the shirt collar and threw him accross the room. 

""Hey! Save it for smash you guys!"" I gave them all the look.
Unfortunately Mario crashed into the table where Bayonetta and Dante were on a date..   Thier gaze turned towards Sephiroth and Kefka who had just walked in...       

Dante stormed up, drawing his sword.... ""Hmm.. That is an interesting sword you have there.... "" Sephiroth began.. ""Perhaps i'll add it to my collection. As he drew his sword..   
""Can you boys not behave or will mummy have to bend you over her knee""  Baynonetta looked at Kefka..
He started jumping up and down in anger.  ""You think you can spank me!  FOOL!! You know what rhymes with boy? DESTROY!""

[WP] Old Man Henderson's Origin Story: How He Fell in Love With Garden Gnomes.,Ambush101,"It was the 80's.  Henderson was at a bar.. Drunk as always.. Some guys were talking behind him.. “So my uncle just got back from Bangkok...” Henderson's ears picked up and he drunkenly stumbled over to the table “Did you say Bangkok?”  His eyes red with fury and  drunkenness..

“Uh yes.. Only in that my uncle was..”
“Henderson sat on the edge of the table.. “Lemme tell you something about Bangkok laddie! Hell of a gorram  town.... One night in Bangkok and the worlds your oyster.. It's makes ta tough boys crumble....”

Young man Henderson awoke in the tool shed..  Ugh.. Fookin booze..  What was in that gorram snake wine anyways...  He raised a hand to block the sunlight., but something shiny caught his eyes.. A shiny gold ring on his finger..”Shit.. Did he get hitched?”  Shit.. Where did all of these lawn gnomes come from he realized he's slept on a huge pile of them...

He stumbled out of the shed, he was in behind a mansion and he wandered in.   And there she was,  Svetlana the daughter of the local crime boss.. “Henderson...  You are awake... “  Yeah..So what happened last night.. “I know... We cannot be together... I am pledged to another  and my father he is...”

Henderson turned around.. to see the man...  Chang Won Huang staring at him. “American... I should be angry that a prostitute ladyboy breaks in and steals her... But you have made me much money with your jokes...”  

“Um... well I'm not sure what happened, I remember celebrating my chess championship and they said I should try this snake wine.. It's...  weird after that..   
“I am sorry.. The LSD was not intended for you, and your gnomes were delivered  from the ladyboy brothel... You are a legend,   the parties last night, you were great at the job.   You are good man, she will always love you and rightly so,  but you must leave Bangkok and never return...    Lucky I am a man of my word, you defeated me in Pai Gow,  you may ride my junk back home”",DirtyBastard13

"[WP] In a world with superheroes, villains and secret identities, blind dates awkwardly dance around the question- ""Do you have a superpower?""",Barcid,"Three Bells was one of those old-school speakeasies, all tobacco leather and framed Americana. The lights were dim, the conversation muted, tasteful piano filtering across the zinc bar. As Armand spoke, the woman absently twisted a strand of blonde hair and sipped a sidecar.

""...and that lets the company make payroll, and get an extra month or two to collect, without tipping off the investors that cash is tight.""

The woman nodded and uh-huhed.

""Sorry if I'm boring you, Jenna. I do take my work seriously."" 

""Not at all."" She set her drink on the bartop and looked directly into Armand's eyes. ""So, mister big shot accountant, do you do anything on the side?""

""Such as..?"" She glanced at her drink.

She curled her hair, a slight smile playing across her face. ""You know... hobbies... night jobs...""

Jenna seemed interesting, and quite pretty. Armand met her gaze, a grin lifting the corner of his mouth.

""I dabble.""

She leaned in closer, her smile growing. ""In what?""

""Well..."" he started, ""you might not quite understand...""

""You'd be surprised at what I can handle, Armand."" Both her hands were on the bar, a fraction of an inch from Armand's. He could feel her breath on his cheek.

""After hours, I save...""

""Yes?""

""Books.""

Her smile dropped imperceptibly. ""You save books?""

""Yes, I save books. When I see books thrown away, I gather them up, fix the bindings, freshen up the covers, flatten the pages, and donate them. Sometimes to children in need, sometimes to prisons or halfway homes.""

""I see. How... noble."" She leaned back and picked up her drink.

""It's not totally selfless,"" Armand added. ""I keep the best ones for myself. I have a second-edition Return of the King, signed by Tolkien himself. And a first-edition copy of The Catcher in the Rye. Plenty of rare and interesting books. Would you like to see them?""

Jenna glanced at the door. ""I, ah, should make it an early night. Gotta wake up early, you know.""

""I see. Well, let's get you a cab."" Armand nodded to the bartender and slid a pair of crisp $50 bills under his glass. 

Cape chasers, thought Armand, as Jenna's cab sped into the distance. Don't care who you are, just what you can do and how much it'll impress their friends. He sighed. Plenty of fish in the sea.

Armand turned around, took one step, and soared off into the starry sky.",CHESTHAIR_OVERDRIVE
"[WP] It is a nice saturday afternoon. You are walking on the sidewalk when, suddenly, a swarm of bees attacks you. While fighting them, you jump, dash, dodge, and punch them. Then, a banner appear in the sky. It says: ""cheat codes activated"".",eldermayl,"Screw this. I ran through the swarm, swinging my cell phone like a madman. I slapped one out of my hair, used the phone to scrape another off my arm. I ran until a stitch ripped through my side and my fingers ached from their death-grip on the phone. I ran until my breath caught and I collapsed onto the bus-stop bench.

I gasped and cringed, stings swelling into painful welts, my legs jelly, the phone heavy in my hand. I rolled my head back. There was something huge and rectangular in the sky. One of those ads pulled behind a plane? No, too big and it wasn't moving. Anyways, what was ""Cheat Codes Activated"" selling anyways?

My heartbeat slowed and the stitch faded. The stings hurt. I wondered when the next bus would arrive. I was about to check the schedule when I realized that I wasn't holding my phone. My iPhone was still in my pocket. This was one of those ancient-history phones with the slide-out keyboard. Must have grabbed it when I was fighting off those bees. I should probably give it back. Maybe read some of their texts first.

I flicked out the keyboard and the display turned clear, like smoked glass. I turned it over, but the back was metal, and there was no way that old-ass camera could make such a sharp picture. There wasn't a lockscreen or any icons, just a few green symbols in the corner: 

    $&gt;_

Must be some kind of weird hacker phone. Maybe it's Linux or Raspberry Pi or something. I mashed some keys.

    $&gt;klsjflksdjflksdj
    Command 'klsjflksdjflksdj' not recognized. Try 'help'.

I had a while until the bus showed up, might as well check it out.

I'd seen these before in video games. Never used them myself, except to copy and paste stuff for mods. This phone must be connected to some game server somewhere. 'Universe' is pretty ambiguous - maybe it's in beta? I felt mischievous. Let's troll these guys a little.

    $&gt;spawn beer
    Error: Input too ambiguous. Specify more parameters/attributes
    or form a clearer mental image of target object. 
    Error: No target location. Specify ex. 'here', 'there'

Mental image? Now I'm interested. I pictured Dos Equis. I don't always spawn beer...

    $&gt;spawn beer here
    Spawning object Dos Equis, 45F, sealed, glass bottle, etc
    Assuming placement on nearest flat surface

A gold-topped beer suddenly appeared in the screen between my feet. I moved the phone aside. The beer was actually there. It was cold. It was sealed. I couldn't open it.

    $&gt;open beer
    Command 'open' not recognized. Try 'help'.
    Suggested command: change-attribute beer open
    $&gt;change-attribute beer open
    Attribute of object 490205552828 changed from 'closed' to 'open'
    New object Dos Equis Cap, metal, bent, etc created
    Object ID is 4902020448481

The cap was now lying next to the beer, bent as though an opener had pried it off. The foil was torn around it. Foam rose up the neck; I reflexively slurped it up. Definitely beer.

"[WP] You are a spy sent to infiltrate an enemy base and gather intel. You were caught by a guard, but rather than shooting you or sounding the alarm, they offer you a drink.",k4mik4ze_,"The intel had been good. The chief engineer was as precise as the dossier said, finishing his nightly cigar at exactly 2100 before stepping outside to flick the stub into the Siberian dusk. Murdoch was waiting with a strychnine autoinjector; the chief engineer's heart stopped before the stogie hit the ground. Murdoch had crammed the body into a vent after clipping off a few fingertips.

The terminal cleared and lines of white text flicked across. This tiny outpost, barely noticeable on satcam in the Norilsk permafrost, was a GLONASS site. The payload would decrypt it, pinpointing enemy positions and navigating drones into the ground. The text stopped, the terminal closed, and the payload snapped loudly as its self-destruct charge fired.

Murdoch spooled up the cord and stowed the still-warm payload. Exactly three minutes until the chief engineer fails to start his 2115 tea. He glanced at the feeds - the guardpost was empty, the radio room was empty...

He saw the guards and engineer before they opened the door. They had stun guns - don't want to damage the computers - but they kept them holstered. The engineer walked past Murdoch and unlatched the hard drive; the payload was out. Murdoch caught a glimpse of the engineer typing on the computer as the guards marched him down a hallway. One in front, two behind, escorting him around a corner, down a flight of stairs, down another, through a rusted door. 

The room was bare concrete, with a large wooden table. The other two guards were already seated. In the dim cage lights, Murdoch saw a black velvet sack, a metal briefcase, a bucket of ice. A guard rose and pulled out a chair; Murdoch sat. He knew what was coming - just never from this side.

Scraping and scuffling as guards took their seats. One stood and reached for the velvet bag. Murdoch stared, knowing the last thing he saw would be sharp steel, probably rusted. ""We know you kill Petrov, Americansk,"" he rasped. ""We see you hike from forest. We see you kill. Your information good. But not good enough.""

The guard untied the cinch and reached into the bag. ""Petrov insist we stay all vigilant. No break. No drink. Think we idiots."" He withdrew something that glinted in the lights. It wasn't metal - it was a glass bottle. ""How you say in America... Petrov had stick up ass."" The engineer entered, the door's sudden squeal nearly making Murdoch flinch.

The guard dropped the vodka into the ice with a loud clunk, and emptied a pile of tiny glasses onto the table. The engineer sat, swiveled the case towards himself, and popped the hinges. ""If we kill... well... let say when you already in Siberia ice, you disappear into ground. But if Americansk kill..."" 

Another guard was pouring and passing shots. The engineer pulled a tray of poker chips out of the case and shuffled a deck of Sochi Winter Games cards. A shot slid towards Murdoch. The engineer cut the deck.

""Now, let us drink. May next chief engineer be less asshole than Petrov!""",CHESTHAIR_OVERDRIVE

[WP] You are a prisoner being transported to a new prison when a zombie outbreak happens right then and there. Your guards abandon your transport to run leaving you alone but secured.,inksmudgedhands,"The transport vehicle was overwhelmed out of nowhere by the bloodthirsty zombies. Before the guards could take stock of the situation they were bitten. One single guard managed to escape. He tried to run but in the middle of the desert there was nowhere to run without a vehicle. Luckily for us we were all kept in tiny cages on the bus and the zombies could not get in, unluckily for thus, we couldn't leave.

The lone guard ran back to the bus. There was a shotgun inside. If he could get to it it would increase his chances of survival, especially since his was running low on ammo for his sidearm. The dumb fucker entered the prisoner area and headed towards the back of the bus, where the vanguard normally sat. I saw an opportunity and took it. As he passed I managed to swipe the keys from his utility belt and immediately got to work unlocking the cage I was kept in. The other prisoners wanted me to hand them the keys but after the abuse they put me through I had no intention of providing them an escape. Still, if the prisoners were bad the guards were infinitely worse.

The guard got the shotgun but in the tight space stumbled and then I couldn't believe my luck. The dumb fuck fumbled his gun, right at my feet. I picked up the shotgun and pumped it. It was now ready to go. A zombie came up behind me but chose to ignore me, to the surprise of the guard. The zombie stood and stared at his, as if waiting for permission to devour the helpless sack of crap. 

The guard looked at me, with a look of fear in his eyes and yelled at me to shoot the zombie. I of course declined his request, as the zombie did nothing to me, but I had some beef to settle with him. He then begged me to instead shoot him, I suppose he was simply afraid of what was to come but it simply confirmed what we all knew, the guards were scared little pussies. 

If he wanted death though, who was I to disagree, I aimed the barrel square at his forehead and I said ""bang!"" the guard stared in confusion and asked ""Why didn't you kill me? or the zombie?"" I simply replied to him ""Killing is a crime, so *I* won't kill you... Get him boy"".

A short disembowelment later I climbed out of the bus with the zombie in tow. I couldn't tell you why we connected, but it was going to be a fun, fun journey from here on out.",CleverNameAndNumbers
[WP] A world where you're forced to marry your opposite,Pandoyo,"It is the onset of the heat death of the universe. All of the natural stars have burned out. The only ones that remain were artificially constructed, but those can only sustain life for a few more years. It would be only a few hundred years until entropy takes it's toll and stellar matter recycling is no longer energy positive. Luckily the top scientists have come up with a solution that can prolong life for just a bit longer.

When matter and anti-matter come into contact they annihilate each-other, releasing pure energy with full efficiency. This energy can be harvested to continue to power civilization, even in a state of otherwise maximum entropy, when the universe itself can no longer bear life of it's own accord. The solution was simple. To take easily available and collected anti-matter and react it with regular matter. Each such fusion can power society for one year at full power consumption.

Humans were not the only intelligent species in the universe to ever exist, but were just one of two who still remained. The other was a race of humanity's exact opposite. Interestingly they were quite similar, except the exact opposite. They had the opposite colors of skin, hair and eyes. Similar genetics produced the exact opposite traits. One had a soft exterior and hard endoskeleton, the other has a hard plated exoskeleton. They were made of anti-matter.

Between the two races an agreement was made. One of each would be nominated for annihilation. They were to be married with the process of consummation being to annihilate one another for the survival of the last life in the universe. Those who were chosen were revered as heroes. They would be nominated immediately after the previous couple consummated and are given the entire year of a life of luxury and comfort, and to get to know one another. The last part wasn't necessary in the grand scheme of things. Perhaps the whole process was only named after marriage to evoke ancient images of a permanent soulmate, and the continuation of life.

This year's human nominee was Ray, his opposite was Layla. Ray and Layla spent the year knowing one another. He was a pessimist while she was an optimist. He worked hard while she played hard. He solved her practical problems and she helped him with his inner demons. They didn't know each other on the day of their marriage, but they were now the best of friends, all differences be damned.

On the day of the consummation they would finally see each other face to face, not from a far distance, or through a vid screen. Ray stood in his end of the reaction chamber as Layla stood at hers. She was even more beautiful in person. He was even more handsome. From here the process was simple. They would be levitated to within a few inches of one another, then make contact. 

As they flew upwards and inwards and came face to face there was no need for words. Despite their opposite upbringings, cultures, biology, and culture they could tell by the look on eachothers faces as their hands raised to hold one another: they were ready to be together, for the good of all life in the universe, for the rest of their lives.",CleverNameAndNumbers

""What is it, is it a shit potato?""

""Yes, I think I left some in the combustion chamber""

""Fuck that""

""Ralph pls go"" 

""Fine, I'll go but I'm going to shit in there""

As Ralph climbed into the combustion chamber Mark's plan was about to come to fruition. Not to go home, that was a secondary objective, a side effect. The real objective was to get rid of Ralph. 

As the thunking sounds changed to indicate that the green fucker Ralph was deep inside the combustion chamber of the rocket Mark finished preparing everything for launch he relayed the instructions to commence launch. Right before the countdown hit zero Ralph came on the radio.

""What am I looking for up here? What the crap? is it crap? or is it a potato?""

Mark replied, as the rocket ignited glowing a powerful blue hot instantly vaporizing Ralph:

""No Ralph, my mistake. You can go""

As the rocket approached it's approach to the intercept point with the Hermes, Mark prepared to ironman across to the ship and right as he let go a voice was heard, which sent chills down his spine like nothing has ever ever done.

[WP] Across the multiverse there are Good and Evil versions of Earth at war. Ours is Chaotic Neutral. The Han Solo of universes.,Olleck,"""By God, Xander, this is it!"" Professor Wahr shouted across the room, ""This confirms everything we've suspected!""

Xander Narr, his loyal assistant, ran to his side to peak through the small machine viewfinder. He saw juxtaposed two images, eerily similar in appearance but with vastly different statistical data underneath.

The theories long-since projected by a small echelon of scientists had come true, but Professor Wahr seemed more dismayed than overjoyed. He sat down in his chair, his hands in his head.

""Professor?"" Xander called to him, ""This data is getting us a Nobel, hands down. What's the matter?""

""Life, Xander, what are we getting from it?"" he mumbled back, disheartened, ""We are the mean of three existences, never too high, never too low-- how can you be anything but depressed at that?""

Xander's mind was still flooded with the excitement of the discovery, but after a moment he collected his thoughts and sat by his professor.

It was true, he thought to himself-- there was something profoundly dejecting about the idea of a life of moderation.

""Excess-- even in small doses!,"" the professor began, ""It's those highs and lows that shape us, Xander. The extreme trauma and ecstacy of life is what defines us, all else is but a place holder-- a buffer zone-- between formative events. And we've confirmed that our existence has no truly formative events.""

""With all due respect, sir-- I mean, the warring planet, for instance, with the goatee's--""

""Yes, you and nearly everyone would say this point. You mustn't finish it. 'War is bad,' in short, and 'we should be thankful'. Have you considered that those people that come out of that war are more equipped to tackle the world than even our greatest soldiers on this earth? And that the thinkers that have seen the unthinkable would eclipse our greatest minds?""

""But the happy planet, sir, surely that's far more--""

""A planet of pure ecstacy, yes-- even there, you would say they are pampered, and fat, and lazy. But they lived, damn it! Their lives of pure excess, of gratification, hedonism-- those pursuits are not without experiential value, Xander!""

Xander hung his head low; he was at a loss for words.

""Who wants to go through life being the porridge that is just right, Xander? By definition we are the mean, the most base existence. We can deviate, but only slightly,"" the professor finished, taking a sip from his coffee.

""Xander?"" he called out after a moment, but Xander had fallen asleep in his chair.",the_twilight_bard
[WP] Across the multiverse there are Good and Evil versions of Earth at war. Ours is Chaotic Neutral. The Han Solo of universes.,Olleck,"There is a hidden war. Beyond the realm of politicians, beaurocrats and dictators there are 2 major sides fighting for control of the multiverse. 

Let's start with a bit of a history lesson. 

In the beginning, before tone and space were even an idea, there were two beings. The Elementals of Matter and Energy, beings of pure power whose beginnings are so distant, not even the original universe they created has evidence of their origins. 

Together, they created the first universe. 

Matter and energy colliding and expanding, bringing into existence time and space. After a period, life developed and a new being was brought into existence. Just as powerful as the two original Elementals, but different and new. 

Thus Spirit was born into the void. Binding together all living things through an unconscious tether, embodying natural order and the circle of life. 

It was at this point that something miraculous was discovered. The choices of the beings inside of each universe, could create another simply from having a choice to make. Each new universe was tied to its original like a branch to a tree. 

All three Elementals coexisted in harmony for a time. Creating new universes, each universe now alive and conscious, able to control themselves at will. Each universe branching off and growing with each new choice made by its inhabitants. Pruning off the universes that threatened the wellbeing of the whole. 

More universes were created before something horrifying happened. 

A new Elemental was born from the womb of one of the universes. 

Will.

Sheer and utter willpower incarnate. Capable of taming death, and bending universal centers to its will. It has one driving purpose inside. To dominate and control everything. To manipulate and enforce is vision on all of creation, in every universe. 

Thus the ancient battle began, with the three ancients on one side and Will singlehandedly fending them off. Fighting for the survival of life itself. 

Avatars were created to fight for control of the universes, creatures imbued with abilities related to their element and the innate knowledge of the never-ending battle. Planets were razed, galactic civilizations rose and fell, all to begin anew when a new battle began. 

Yet the last Elemental's birth was somehow missed. A part of Will's enormous power, and colossal consciousness broke off and started to think for itself. Imbuing all living things with a single burning desire, one that would topple dynasties and democracies alike. The desire to be free. 

I'm sure you can guess what we call this Elemental. 

Free will. 

A rogue agent, an uninvited third party capable of making its avatars' wills' tangible, yet unable to manipulate the minds of others. A mere fraction of the power of its parent. 

Yet dangerous enough to terrify the domineering Elemental. 

A new race was borne, to snuff out Free Will wherever it raised its head, and conversely to protect it, and shape it into a weapon to defeat the impossible force. 

That brings us to today. 

*A/N* This is a small part of an idea that I've been working on for a long time. I'm happy to take any and all reviews, good bad or otherwise but please don't steal anything without asking first. 

Yes this was written specifically for this writing prompt, but the underlying idea I've been working on for a while. May or may not do a part 2 depending on reception. We'll see. ",Blaze_Stone

[LG] Which dovetails into our first agenda item. The E3-3 incursion into E1-1 Nebraska was wholly unmerited! Had your people done to humans what you did to those steers, this would be a war trial!

[NN] Indeed. The Nebraska incident was an act of naked brutality without reason.

[CE] What am I supposed to do about it? Kill everyone who would violate a few dozen cattle if they had an industrial portal? There wouldn't be any survivors!

[LE] I believe Ms. Cohen has no objection to the act itself, merely the venue. Is that presumption correct?

[NN] I do not condone the act. That said, were it confined to your home dimension, it would be irrelevant to this forum.

[NE] Ha ha, Cohen might join in on the fun too!

[CN] Dude, no. Keep your disgusting **** on your own plane.

[NN] Decorum, Mr. Franco.

[CE] Fine. We'll replace the cows.

[LG] Steers. And do not invade our lands unannounced.

[CE] I'll see what I can do.

[NN] Very well. Our next agenda item is the mutual lunar reconstruction effort of E1-2 and E3-1. How is construction proceeding?

[NG] The project is on time. Religious authorities have ruled that an orrery representing the moon is a suitable interim replacement for the authentic item. 

[LE] Your appeal to religious persecution is irrelevant, and I wish to have it stricken from the record.

[NN] On what grounds?

[LE] The, ah, annihilative overlay of the two moons was a military action. Appeals to 1-2's so-called lunar religions are a feeble appeal to emotion.

[NN] Earth 1-2, your reponse?

[NG] With all due respect, you were transforming your moon into a surveillance death ray. Our intention was to transpose the two moons so as to disarm you. It was your agents who interfered and caused the overlay. Your continued disdain for our Jewish and Islamic citizens suggests that you killed two birds with one stone, so to speak.

[NN] Motion denied, the record stands.

[LE] Furthermore, what authority permits you to interfere with our governance systems?

[CN] I sent them.

&lt;Audible gasps&gt;

[CN] No one gets to treat humans that way. Either 1-2 took your toy away, or we'd blow it apart.

[LE] Mr. LaBeouf, this is not an action movie. Such an act would destabilize tidal systems, effectively dooming twenty billion residents of Earth 1-3. 

[CN] Using your entire population as leverage is sick. We took a gamble, it paid off, deal with it.

[NE] Yeah, when you put it that way, that's pretty messed up.

[LE] I am under no obligation to respond nor acknowledge your critique, which you submitted under your own volition. 

[NE] Uh-huh. We're still transporting the gold to pay for that moon, right?

[LE] The ruling of this caucus is binding, but the lack of specificity in the accord permits us to administer the gold one bar at a time, to be manually lifted into the twenty-foot-tall armored containers within a 24-hour timeframe.

[NE] You got it. Prepare a one-way work visa for 50,000 30-foot-tall genetically-altered slaves.

[LE] As you require.

[NN] Very well. Our next item pertains to the 3412 Olympic Winter Games, specifically Earth 1-3's petition to facilitate a gladiatorial event. Representative 1-3, care to make opening remarks?

[CG] Thank you. Since the dawn of civilization, mankind has engaged in the ultimate sport, a trial of mind, body, and spirit. Under fair rules and humane conditions, mortal combat is an honorable contest, the purest test of a man or woman and the communities they represent. While many of our parallel brethren have sworn off ceremonial combat, the ancient tradition lives on in our glorious arenas. We humbly implore you to open your minds so that we may make history once again.

[LG] Absolutely not. We will not partake in such barbarism. This is tantamount to warfare.

[NN] Our lawkeepers have thoroughly reviewed 1-3's proposal and find it sufficiently distinct from open warfare.

[LG] Irrelevant. We will not send our citizens to die.

[NE] Who's being a barbarian? Whatshisname said there would be rules. We're in.

[LE] Intriguing. We must review the proposed rules before we commit, but consider this a tentative yes.

[CE] Let's fight!

[CG] You do realize there are strict rules governing the nature of combat? It's a ceremonial duel, not a backstreet brawl.

[CE] Let's fight!

[NG] We stand ready to defend our many heritages. If athletes are willing to compete, we will allow them.

[CG] Excellent! This is most uncharacteristic, 1-2.

[NG] The people are frustrated and full of rage. This could be a positive release. In addition, a martial victory over Earth 3-1, even a symbolic one, is much needed.

[LE] That sounds like a threat. We haven't even committed to this proposal.

[NG] My statement is speculation as to the reaction of my peoples. Your perception of a threat is incorrect.

[CG] Representatives of the Neutral stratum?

[NN] As administrators of the Games, we refuse to send any athletes to any Olympic events so as to avert conflicts of interest. As we have no stake in the outcome, we abstain.

[CN] Earth 2-3 is in it to win it. We're gonna bring our A-game.

[LN] As a society of scholars, we will not partake in bloodsport.

[CN] You must have tons of secrets that will help you win! You can be champions too!

[LN] I reassert my refusal. Our people will not kill unless absolutely necessary.

[CN] You're gonna let the bad guys win? You'll let them defeat you?

[LN] Our refusal stands.

[CN] Jeez. Well, looks like we're gonna have an interesting Olympics.

[NN] Motion passes. Approval granted to Earth 1-3 to host a singles-combat event pursuant to submitted rules. With the docket emptied, this caucus is adjourned.

'Not quite. We still have a few more kilometres to hike.' Seargent Tina called back from the front of the squad. 

'My feet are aching! Can we have a rest?' Private Chastyn suggested as he continued to scuff along the gravelled dirt path. 

'Balls to that! If we stop now we'll never get there in time. Never mind on time.' Lance Corporal Coral said. 

'My backs killing me!' cried Private Osat who was assisting Private Dele with carrying an injured Lieutenant Wright on a stretcher. 

'Does someone want to swap roles with Private Osat.' Lieutenant Wright shouted. 

No one volunteered. 

'Very well. I'll choose a volunteer. Private Tiele, you look like you're managing well. Come take over.'

The two privates swapped parts as the squad continued marching on. 

'This is ridiculous. After everything we've gone through this week. All the fighting, the killing. That ambush. How we made it out I'll never know.' Private Bagian muttered to Private Czesci. 

'I'd rather still be stuck in that bunker than suffering the blisters on my feet.' Private Czesci said. 

'Are we there yet?' Private Chips moaned again. 

'For gods sakes lad we've only covered ten metres. Get a grip!' Shouted Lieutenant Wright. 

'Yeah we've covered that distance on our feet.' Private Chastyn complained. 

'Is that a dig at me boy? Consider yourself greatful for still having yours!' Lieutenant Wright yelled. 

'Private, apologise this instant!' Lance Corporal Coral demanded. 

'Fuck off brown nose. My feet are killing me and I think we should rest up if we still have miles to go.' Private Chastyn argued. 

'What's going on back there!?' Seargent Tina shouted. 

'The lads can't handle this gentle climb.' Private Dele shouted back laughing. 

'I know it's been a long journey but we have direct orders to get there. I'm not leaving any men behind to rest up. We keep marching even after sun fall.' Sergeant Tina addressed to the squad. 

'There's no one here! What's ten minutes rest going to jeopardise?' Private Chastyn said. 

'That ambush was unexpected. Even with the intel we had. That can happen again. Keep marching.' Lieutenant Wright quipped. 

'Are we there yet?' Private Chips said.

"[WP] A single mother is on the run from the authorities as she tries to put food on the table for her daughter, and the authorities are led by the daughter's father",Serocco,"Thank god for fairy bread. Pluck out a slice, smear a dollop of butter and dust it with a few pinches of sprinkles. If there was a cheaper way to keep a kid happy and fed, Jessie didn’t know it. While Rachael nibbled at a roughly cut triangle, Jessie buttered a pile of slices for herself and gorged- enjoying the few brief moments where her stomach was quiet and she had a moment to plan beyond their next meal. 

The past week, driving from town to town, had been one long period of dread; sleeping in the beat-up Volkswagen she’d traded the neat and shiny Audi for. No big loss, Dylan had bought that car. One big pompous spectacle paraded into the driveway- complete with an oversized pink bow stuck to the bonnet. Later he had punched a hole in the wall after stepping on Rachael’s toy unicorn, curses spewing from his mouth like magma from a volcano. Jessie wished she’d remembered to pack that unicorn. Melted and disfigured after spending a night in the fireplace, Rachael seemed to love it anyway.  

Jessie googled hers and Rachael’s names every hour, trying to keep a track of each new article regarding their pursuit. Every so often Dylan’s name would show up. Once there was a picture: his dark hair slicked back, jacket pockets bulging with what Jessie knew were cigarette packs, and his police badge pinned neatly to his chest. It was baffling that he was allowed to head the investigation. Competent he may be, though Jessie doubted any of his acclaim wasn’t propped up on grimy underworld connections, he was still once married to the “perpetrator”. She could only guess that the griminess had soaked through, it’s toxic menace oozing behind her like thick fog in her rear-view mirror. Regardless, it only motivated her, she kept moving.

There was no plan. Only a spontaneous decision that started with one step out the door.  Before that she’d fought him at each step and lost. He’d refused a divorce until one day he proposed one with glee. Then the battle for custody had begun, one in which he was all too ready. She lost Rachael. The decision had been made before she stepped into the courtroom. One high flying detective with all the connections in the world versus a woman who’d had each and every one of her connections snipped year by year over the course of their marriage. All but one. Visitation had been severely limited, once a fortnight. Each time Jessie arrived Rachael looked different, like a treasured vase gathering cobwebs in an attic or a delicate rose wilting in a shadow.  After three months Jessie hadn’t found any other options. So, she’d pulled up outside his house, walked in, and picked up Rachael. Rachael had been alone in her room, it was devoid of colour and toys, only a utilitarian bed and a cupboard filled with old clothes. Jessie grabbed Rachael and pulled her close, then she walked out with her daughter in her arms. No one was there to stop her. 

Every day Rachael smiled a little more. They fed ducks at the park with left over bread crust, they played eye spy while driving down long, backroads and slept side by side tucked between comforters in the back of the Volkswagen. 

Jessie knew it wouldn’t last, one day soon they would be found. She’d go to prison and Rachael would be sent back to Dylan. Back to the empty room in the empty house where she was only ever acknowledged out of a twisted sense of spite. She couldn’t allow that. When the answer clicked in her brain, Jessie held Rachael close. She inhaled deep the scent of her hair and then pulled back to gaze into her eyes. 

“You’re Mum has to do something darling, something you’re not going to understand.”
Rachael listened carefully, the seriousness permeating Jessie’s voice.

“After I’ve done it, you won’t be able to see me again. You’ll hear things about me, horrible things that I did to you… and your father.”

Rachael started crying, leaning into Jessie’s shoulder.

“You might not understand, when you get older. You might think I was crazy.”

Jessie brushed her shaking hand lovingly through Rachael’s hair.

“Just try and remember that no matter what, I love you. You are the most important person in the world to me.”

They hugged and cried for a while longer until they got hungry, then Jessie made some more fairy bread. Soon Rachael had fallen asleep. Jessie wiped a few stray sprinkles from Rachael’s cheek then stepped out of the back of the car. Hopping into the driver’s seat, her hands tightened on the wheel. First, she needed to find somewhere safe to leave Rachael. 

Then she needed to find Dylan.

[WP] LOST from the point of view of the dog,baredex,"""At least they didn't have you tied to the bumper.""

""What?"" I turn around. A chubby, gray mongrel is nosing through a Styrofoam takeout container. Appears to be chicken and rice. ""What did you say?"" I ask. 

""You're lost aren't you?"" continued the ratty-haired mutt, ""they left you didn't they?""

I continue to stare at him, noticing the long, unkempt nails and lack of collar. He's been on the street a while. 

""Of course not!"" I reply with disgust, ""they're only running an errand or something, they'll realize soon enough and be right back here to pick me up!"" ""They would never leave me on purpose, why, look at my beautiful coat, and this collar! This collar alone, with the gold tag! Why would they leave such an investment""

""Happens all the time, Mack"", replied the mutt. He had finished the chicken and was shoving the rice back and forth with his snout hoping for more meat. ""I got dropped off down here, oh, about three years ago. They had to move and weren't allowed pets at their new place. Oh, you'll get used to it...or you won't."" ""Good luck, buddy."" He abandoned the container and started off in the opposite direction. 

I didn't recognize anything. All the smells were wrong. I've never been down here. Why would they drop me off here to make me wait. My skin started to tighten up and I began to realize that the mongrel may have been right. Suddenly I began to realize just how cold it was. I had just been trimmed, if I stayed here I would probably freeze or starve. Or worse. If I could just figure out where I was I could plan my way back home. Back with my bed, and my toys, and snacks. ""And my family"", I whispered to myself. I cocked my head and soon found the busiest intersection and decided that would be the best place to start. Might find something to eat down that way too, maybe a clean puddle to get a drink.

[WP] The quaint story of an intergalactic garbage man.,baredex,"Rocket men. When exploration started the title was an honor, a goal, a title said with pride. Within the last two generations it has become an entitlement, something every human born on a tier 1-3 planet is guaranteed the moment they get a breath of air on their terraformed planet.
Being born on a tier 4 planet? Thats a different story, the only way to explore the exploited stars and visit the neighborhood planets is to enlist in the service ""community"". As if. What a polite way to call a glorified slave ring that grants us the priveledge most planets are born with. Either way, we all want to see the wonders outside of our little nightmares and days on autopilot, so here we are; traveling planet to planet, year by year, on rotation to gather 3 years worth of garbage and waste from every home we'll never step in.
Its not so bad, life in the ""ship"" (see: garbage truck) isn't so different from our planet. Conditioned young and whatnot to log into our servers and tune into the online world to escape what is now a galaxy of disappointment. We used to get one day on the planet we visit, to see endless seas and incredible mountains. Feel the GMO grass planted on every planet and gaze on the artificial trees producing the air we could finally breathe. Some days I wish they'd put us in hibernation on the ships, but at least this way there was contrast to let us really understand what insignificance really is and that we were the definition of it. I'm losing sight of that the last few years.
Rotations are lengthy sometimes, longest we've hit was 9 years. Doesn't matter much anymore since planet privileges are practically legends.
The envy on the ship has simmered down, it not quite..justice...now. More of a calm bittersweet feeling lingering in the stuffy air for everyone to feel and accept with all the time on our hands. At least we have time. At least we have air.

[WP] The quaint story of an intergalactic garbage man.,baredex,"*NSFW (profanity). Apologies if this way off what you were looking for, was in a weird mood today.*

Garbage man, Power bloke, Fusion ass, whatever. Yeah, you know me, I clean up your trash, but I also keep your lights on. Everything goes in the Riprendntenderizer and comes out an electric buzz or a meat sandwich. But that’s enough introductions. Got a little tale I thought you’d like to hear about. Or not, but you’re going to listen anyways.


So here I am, just cutting into a juicy sandwich prepared from fundamentals I don’t ask too many questions about and there’s this click, pop, wobble from outside my door. I ignore it at first, assumed it was my partner gone to add a deposit to the fusion goo. Hey, it’s an all in one fabricator - burn box, shit box and even a corner market. Stop asking so many questions. Anyways, I crack the door and this kid pops his head in, a human kid mind you, all nasty and covered in grease with holes in all the wrong places. You know the type. So he’s giggling or babbling or crying or whatever humans do, but it’s clear he wants me to follow him. So I did, I mean what’s the worst that could happen.


Yeah, I know, whenever someone says that, the worst happens. Well this ain’t that kind of story smart guy. Besides, if it was the worst thing, maybe I would have gotten some kind of employee compensation or jelly doughnut of the month or somethin’. More than likely end up as tomorrows special for my replacement. Anyfuck, where was I?


Right, the kid. He runs into this alley, nothing weird about that and sure enough, twenty of these human things come out of every nook and cranny. And they’re swarming about, stumbling over each other, slipping on weird shit, spitting all over each other in their squeaky babble talk. I mean, holy shit, humans leak all over the place. Crap coming out of their mouths, their eyes, shit dribbling out of their nose, fuck knows where else. It’s a wonder they can understand each other at all.  Seriously, somebody was in a fuck all mood when they made those things. So I figure this is it. They’re probably going to eat me and I’ll dribble out of a dozen of them in a day or so. What a pain.


But no, it’s nothing like that. Turns out one of them had one of the bins fall on them. Damnit are you even listening? It’s where everything you don’t want goes. Waste, trash, old food, broken shit, uncle larry, fucking hell. But it’s heavy as shit. Made out of some kind of leadrocksupermetalglowingaristocratic level shit. And one of these dumbasses got its leg trapped under it. What do you mean that doesn’t make any goddamn sense? It’s my fucking story asshat and I’ll tell you what makes sense. So these humans are still swarming around, crying and carrying on. I was getting tired just watching them, let me tell you. So I tried to explain that I’m gonna to go and grab the truck. Well none of these fucks understood that, so I finally just went and got it.


I hooked the truck up to the bin like I’ve done a thousand time and lift it clear. Takes about three minutes. The guy is free, minus one leg, and the humans are still crying and spitting all over each other. I looked around thinking there might be someone else, but that was it. Turns out the trapped guy was some big shot.  A president or paperboy or some shit. Do I look like I know humans? They gave me this metal thing with a pin on the back.


Oh, and my partner finally made it back from wherever the fuck he went. Ate my damn sandwich too.",herefortheoldones

[WP]A super villain keeps coming up with elaborate ways to kills his nemesis. Only for his assistant to point out that his plans are very simple.,boa_con,"“Andrew is everything in place for tonight” Primus asked anxiously.  “Yes sir, I’ve made all the appropriate adjustments, everything should flow nicely together when the clock strikes midnight” Andrew answered.  “Good, let us get into position” he snapped back.  Andrew kept walking through the Rube Goldberg level contraption, picturing it in his mine, constantly playing with easier ways to implement it.  The plot was to poision Mr. Smith, a competitor assassin that had been slowly syphoning away at Primus’ business.  Mr. Smith was a man of habit and how he made it this far in the assassin game is beyond anyone’s knowledge.  Every night at Ole Wagstff Inn, he ordered a double of Pappy Van Winkle, some of the most expensive bourbon in the city.  Slowly he sipped it at the end of the bar, where he could watch everyone in the room.  

In the bar, when the grandfather clock struck midnight Primus’ plan went into effect.  When the hour hand struck 12, it tightened on a small length of thread, releasing a ball bearing that rolled across the mantle above the roaring fire.  Its momentum was just beginning to slow, when it reached the end and lightly tapped a domino that gently tipped over and fell to the floor.  Inside the noisy bar no one could hear the domino drop.  It hit a tiny catapult that then launched a marble up over the entire bar and landed atop the bar right on the wooden stemware rack, just as a bar tender was polishing and placing martini glasses on it.  It rolled down the rack towards the end of the bar right at Mr. Smith and his bourbon.  The marble bounced and skipped as it gained speed across the shoddily made wooden rack aiming right for a small glass vile.  It hit one last bump and shot towards the vile, Mr. Smith looked up from his drink as he suddenly heard the faintest clink sound and looked around bar to identify where the noisy had come from.  As he gazed over the crowd the small vile tipped over on the rack and a microscopic drop of poison began to form around the rim of the opening.  It hung there for a moment before finally being released and plummeted through the air, finding itself land right in the Pappy Van Winkle.  Mr. Smith still gazing at the crowd lifted his drink and took a sip.  Placing the drink back down without even looking at it.  Within a moment Mr. Smith fell off the stool and was dead on the spot.

Andrew and Primus watched from the window outside as it all happened so quickly.  Primus’ smile grew larger across his face as months of hard work and preparation finally paid off.  He slapped Andrew on the back and said “Well my boy, we did it, simple as that”.  Andrew still thinking the whole process through his mind, all the steps they had gone through in the past three months to achieve this.  Breaking into the bar testing the contraption, making adjustments and testing again, entire days of his life were put into this.  Finally, it hit him “Hey Primus, why didn’t we just poison the bottle of Pappy when we broke into the bar?  Mr. Smith’s the only one who ever drinks it, and we could have replaced the bottle the next day”.  Primus smile abruptly leapt off his face as the realization hit him.  He closed his eyes, and took a deep breath as steam started shooting out of his ears.  With that he flung his trench coat and turned to walk back to the lab, Andrew following a pace behind listing off easier ways to have killed Mr. Smith.

[WP]Some time ago humans were put on the 'Only Contact in Case of Emergency' list. Now a threat to the galaxy has arisen and humanity is it's last hope.,boa_con,"**Part XI:**

******

A small capsule left the mothership stealthily. Silenced by the swallowing vacuum of space, its passengers were hid by the colossal shadow of the *Vasco da Gama*, carrying the candle with which to light the dark mist of the void.

******

**48 hours previously:**

William de Souza felt his body sinking to the sound of distant seagulls and a nuclear power reactor. The downwards motion of the vessel pulled him towards the abyss of the Mariana Trench, but his mind was focused on the other unsteady cliff his idea walked on. The die were cast and the future rested on a perilous gamble, a game of chance with the rules of Fate. Its risks were unacceptable, its reward unbeatable. He had traveled from the far reaches of the galaxy back to his homeplanet to convince his world that this gamble would pay off.

The submarine halted its descent slowly and William was escorted by a sailor in an impeccable navy uniform to a conference room where he found the familiar faces of his brothers-in-arms. He had been the last to arrive and, acknowledging the political leaders of the Supreme Earth Command, took a seat at the mahogany table and waited for the meeting to start. The newly-appointed Prime-Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland took the floor.

""Good afternoon,"" he started. ""I hope you traveled well. Taking into account the considerable secrecy evolving the topic at hand, we will probably remain submerged for a few days. I've been informed by military intelligence that the alien satellites which have been found orbiting above us can't track us underwater."" He looked at William. ""I believe the Secretary-General would like to address the reason for this meeting and explain the plan he proposed straight away. 

The hum of the nuclear reactor filled the few seconds William took to collect his thoughts. 

""Yes,"" he said, rising and taking from his briefcase a few copies of a small text which he distributed around the table. ""This has been found circulating among the lowest ranks of our forces stationed here on Earth. It was forwarded to me by General Adebayo, and the soldiers with their possession have been detained. It is a worrying sight,"" he said, as the room read the short lines.

*""Linger not, stranger. Shed no tear.*  
*Go back to those who sent us here.*  

*We are the young they drafted out*  
*To wars their folly brought about.*  

*Go tell those old men, safe in bed,*  
*We took their orders and are dead.*

*- A. D. Hope""*

There was a long pause after the poem had been read and reread.

""There is a storm brewing amongst our ranks,"" continued William, ""and the whirlwhinds of change threaten to pull us down into an unescapable abyss. We would do well to remind ourselves of how nearly we were drowned by those tides in the aftermath of the ultimatum. We might not stay afloat the next time. We are still held accountable, especially those of us who were were in that extraterrestrial ship in Switzerland when Fleet-Admiral Rhollok presented us with the poisonous gift of the Grand Council of the Union."" The Chinese President lifted his eyes from the small poem. ""And we know what it felt to be told we were stuck between fighting a foreign war or facing obliteration. We now have another choice. The *status quo* is changing and the people won't support our decisions much longer. Our leadership is about to fall and we must use whatever is left of it to take the necessary measure and ensure our survival. We must either become an unstoppable force or halt to a forceful stop.""

""And what exactly do you propose, Herr De Souza?"" asked the German Chancellor. ""Your memo wasn't very detailed. Do you forget there are still extraterrestrial destroyers with their guns pointed at our largest cities?""

William had in no way forgot the danger this very meeting posed. But the fight for freedom took place in dangerous battlefields.

""As you were all informed, one of our ships from the Terran Expeditionary Corps, the *Christopher Columbus*, recently came across a small detachment of the enemy forces, and a brief exchange of messages was carried. These messages indicated the possibility of arranging a meeting between ourselves and the void. ""He left the information sink. ""I propose we arrange that meeting. I propose we meet the enemy and hear their cause. I propose we make our own proposal, if we can. I propose we turn against the real enemy in this Galactic War. I propose we fight the Council, and their Union if need be. We should join forces with the void if they accept, or go alone, if we must. But we cannot stand still, hold off the present enemy, and paddle in vain against the strong currents of discontentment which befall our Kind here on Earth. We cannot be those old men, safe in our beds; our soldiers should only risk their lives for true justice. We are no kings in a crusade, but the moment calls upon us to lead our peoples into the unknown.""

The room took the words in. 

""We need no debate, I believe,"" said the French President. ""We must leave the sinking ship and aim for the stars. How do you propose we meet the enemy?""

""General Korlov is assembling a team, in accordance with the communications between the *Columbus* and the enemy. I have full trust in him, as I'm sure you all do. Military command here on Earth is devising a strategy to neutralise the alien guns in our orbit.""

The hum of the engine was finally broken by a vocal agreement between the leaders. Hands were shaken and chairs pulled, and the leaders of the world went to their cabins to rest. It was with intense anticipation that William went to bed inside a metal capsule half a kilometre below the western Pacific Ocean.

The two following days were an exercise in patient impatience. Books were read, conversations held and information received, the latest of which required the presence of all. In a conference room packed with leaders, aides and military commanders, a message came through from the far off *Vasco da Gama*, relayed over a dozen stations throughout the galactic interstellar space. The affected English of a Russian general came through the speakers in the room.

*""Ladies and gentleman, a few hours ago a small craft left this ship. Six passengers made their way to an uncharted rocky planet a few million kilometres from here, with the mission of establishing contact with the enemy and putting forth our proposal. Ten minutes ago they we finally heard back from them.""*

The room tensed up with nervous expectation. The fate of their species depended on one of two previously assigned coded messages. William could hardly believe it when an eruption of relief and excitement exploded over them and swept the crowd inside as Korlov relayed the message.

*""Atlas Rises.""*

""I ordered them infected with a supernaturally virulent strain of Ebola, so they could drown in their own liquefied entrails!""

""I see. It seems my elegance has undermined my ambition once again. Nonetheless, our vaults contain the final aether-stone.

""Ah. I see. So we shall bury Vainglory alive.""

""But... I... well... that sounds... bad... Fine. We shall divine Vainglory's secret identity, then use the potion on his closest friends and allies, slowly stripping away everything he holds dear until he begs for the release of death!""

""Indeed. We shall bury Vainglory's friends alive.""

""Well... we... uh... hmm. It is clear I must be more inventive. I must meditate upon the Abyss and enter the Trance of Insight. Solitude and darkness shall reveal all. Begone, Vindicto.""

"[WP] You can bring people back to life, but it shortens your own lifespan by a variable amount. The older the person, the more days you lose.",ndg5800,"The moment was over in an instant, one second the car was speeding towards the young boy on the road and the next second he was lying lifeless on the ground.

You knew what you had to do, the power that was bestowed to you was meant for good and situations like these were exactly why you received it. 

There was already a crowd surrounding the boy’s body but you pushed your way through until you were at the front. A women was hunched over the young corpse, wailing at the top her lungs, she was pleading, asking for her son to wake up but you know he wouldn’t; you knew a dead body when you saw one. You crouched down beside the body and asked the women the boy’s age, ‘What does it matter what his age was’ she screamed at you. You knew you when you asked you weren’t likely to get an answer but gauging the ages of people is especially tricky when you know your own years are counting down. You placed your hands carefully on the boy’s chest, the mother immediately tried to grab you off in a mixture of confusion and rage at the situation she had be thrust into. You had been through the paces before though and your were able to keep you hand placed on the boy despite the mother’s efforts. Then came the tricky part, pouring out your energy into another vessel, you felt the heat as your life force began to move across your body and down your arms, the moment you felt the heat reach your hand you let it out. 

In an instant your hands glowed with a white light like a million stars compacted down into your fingers, the mother fell away from you shielding her eyes from the light that had suddenly appeared before her, you knew how it worked and your kept your hands firmly on the boy’s chest until the energy had been poured out. When your hands finally stopped glowing and the heat had disappeared you knew your job was over. Standing up, you turned and walked back through the speechless crowd. Just as you had emerged from the group of people you heard what came next in the process: a deep gulp of air from the young boy, gasping as his lungs began to function once again. Before anyone could follow you, you hurried off and disappeared down a side street. You knew what had to be done next and it was the hardest part of your job.

As you walked through the door you read the words inscribed upon them: St Francine’s Hospice For Pallative Care. You walked down the ghostly quiet hallway looking in each room as you passed. At the Sixth door down you know you’d found the one; no flowers on the table, so no one had visited. You entered and locked the door behind you, you looked at the person sleeping on the bed: an elderly man with on faint wisps of white hair upon his head, his stomach slowly convulsing outwards and in with every raspy breath he was making. You read the chart at the bottom of his bed and saw his age: 95 and his illness: lung cancer. You knew the pain he would be in and convinced yourself like always that what you were doing was a kindness and the years he lived would be put to good use saving others. You carefully took the man’s frail hand and cradled it in between your hands. Despite doing this for all your life you knew this part wasn’t any easier and the tears started to slowly trickle down your cheeks. You kept telling yourself that what you did you did for the good of humanity but this was just evil. For the second time in your day your hand began to glow with a wondrous light only this time the emanating beauty was coloured red like the petals on a rose. You felt the years of the life in-front of you flood your body and instantly felt rejuvenated.The old man didn’t even have time to wake as he took his last breath with a final raspy sigh. 

You liked to think that you were putting these people out of their misery, that maybe they would be going to a better place but you knew that if some higher power had granted you the power to give life then there must be an omega to this alpha that granted you the power to take life as well. These were the same thoughts that always ran through your head after taking a persons years. But as you walked off into the night you knew that the good could never outweigh the bad but likewise the bad could never outweigh the good, you could only keep the scales balanced long enough for however long you lived. And with that thought you went to go find more life to give.

"[WP] You can bring people back to life, but it shortens your own lifespan by a variable amount. The older the person, the more days you lose.",ndg5800,"""Grace! *Grace*!""

The pained cry cut through the crowd like a knife. A young man desperately shoved his way through the onlookers, repeating his shout with building intensity and growing grief. As he broke through the crowd, a small police officer at the mouth of the alleyway made a halfhearted attempt to stop him from entering the scene behind her. As the young man ran past the police officer, the scene came into full view - a slender body, being attended to by a small number of EMTs, and several police officers armed with clipboards individually interviewing a small group of dazed onlookers. The young man ran right into the mix, and as he approached the body, fell to his knees and wept.

""Son, do you know this girl?"" A firm hand fell upon the young man's shoulder. He looked up, and saw a solemn-faced police officer squatting before him.

""Y-yes, she's my girlfriend... She called m-me after... after work and said,"" the young man paused, regaining just enough of his composure to finish his story. ""She was scared. This dude had been hanging out around the back of the store all day, and she didn't want to walk out to her car with him there. I told her that I'd swing by when they closed and walk her to her car, but on my way here, she called again but it was just a lot of rustling and screaming... AndIspedtherestofthewayhereand..."" the young man started half-crying, half-talking, and the police officer grunted in understanding.

""And, son, what was your name?""

""A-Adam, sir, Adam Lively,"" Adam managed to choke out between sobs. Raising his head, he looked right into the officer's eyes. ""Can I see her?""

The officer looked over his shoulder, sizing up the scene. ""Son, that may not be the wisest thing to do right now. Just sit tight and-""

""*No*,"" Adam said, as a sinking feeling rushed over the officer. ""I asked, '*Can I see her*?'"" As the young man finished his sentence, a faint glow started emanating from his hands. The policeman nearly fell over, taken aback by the supernatural display before him. The crowd and several other officers noticed this too, and the crowd began to run away as the intensity of the light grew and as Adam stood up. The now completely-glowing figure started strolling towards the body laying on the ground, scaring the EMTs away.

*I don't know if I can do this,* thought Adam. *I've never revived someone with a traumatic injury.*

Vague recollections of using his life-force to revive his elderly mother after she succumbed to cancer, and reviving his old dog every few years flashed through Adam's mind.

*Those all happen because of things inside the body, natural processes. Can I revive someone with an unnatural death? Will it heal the gunshot wounds? Will it use more life force? If so, how much more?*

All these thoughts ran through Adam's brain in the short amount of time it too to reach Grace. He squatted, lifting her on her side, examining her injuries. Two bullet wounds, deep in her back, as if she was shot trying to run away. A third one in her right calf. Not good.

Gently, the being of light sat down, and held his lover in his lap. With an audible *whoosh*, all the light in Adam's body shot down his arms, and enveloped Grace in a similar fashion. Slowly, the color came back to her face, and her mouth twitched. The golden glow faded from her, and Grace opened her eyes, only to be met with a strong gaze from her savior.

""I think you were running a little late, cowboy,"" she said, softly. ""I'm sorry... for not waiting for you.""

""It's okay, honey. There's nothing to wor-"" his sentence was cut off short as Grace howled in pain.

""I thought you were supposed to fix that!"" she said, gritting her teeth. The bullet holes had not closed up.

With a feeling of dread, Adam looked his girlfriend over. None of her injuries were fixed. Suddenly, a wave of exhaustion overtook him.

""Oh, no..."" he groaned. ""I think... I used too much life-force..."" The neurons started firing. He was dying. He knew this would happen if he used his powers too much, but not so soon!

""Adam. Listen to me."" Grace said, grimacing. ""You know me, I hate to be a bother... but I've lost too much blood. I'm going to die again."" She started tearing up. ""You big dummy... trying to be the hero... now we're both going to die...""

Adam looked at her in surprise, and then with a soft smile. ""You always were more clever than me... What gave it away?""

Grace chuckled a little bit. ""Adam, I can read you like an open book. If that book were the size of a billboard.""

""I love you."" Adam said, tears rolling down his eyes. ""I love you. I love you. I love you, so much.""

Grace lifted her hand, grunting with every motion, and placed it on Adam's cheek. ""I love you too.""

The couple spent their last moments in silence, holding on to each other for dear death.

"[WP] You can bring people back to life, but it shortens your own lifespan by a variable amount. The older the person, the more days you lose.",ndg5800,"There was an air of apprehension as I walked into the room. Felt almost like last call at an already-empty bar. I'd said it would be my last appointment of the day; I could feel my body begging for reprieve as it was.

I strode past the first row of chairs, avoiding eye contact. It was always the same people at the front of the room: middle-aged men and women whose parents had passed naturally. Their eyes were always the weariest; it had been the longest battles for them. I'd asked the hospital to stop letting them in.

For some reason, my targets always took the back corner. Pale, drained, sometimes still showing signs from the labor room - these young couples were the ones I could help. Today there was just one left, which made my choice simple. It was their newborn who I would save.

The young man shot up immediately when we locked eyes. ""Our daughter...""

""Caroline."" The woman beside him tugged at his sleeve. ""We said we could name her if she made it.""

I smiled. ""Well then, let's go meet Caroline.""

I didn't look back as the couple led me out of the waiting room. The door hadn't even closed behind me before I heard a sharp wail break out, but the pangs of guilt at that moment had stopped years ago. It was horrible, yes, but death happened, and there was only so much I could do about it.

I followed the couple up to the NICU, and the woman took my hand to guide me to Caroline. My breath caught in my throat - even now, it still did when I first saw them. So small and helpless; surrounded by wires attached to half a dozen machines; skin so paper thin that I could see the tiny network of veins running underneath.

I lifted the lid of her chamber and rolled up my sleeves.

""She was two months early,"" the mother whispered, clearly holding back tears.

Good, I thought. It'll only take away one awkward weekly family dinner.

I placed one hand on the newborn's chest and the other on her head and closed my eyes. Took a deep breath. I started to feel a warmth in my chest, and it expanded from there into my arms, down to my hands, out to the tips of my fingers.

Then the warmth turned to pain, and I felt my hands start to shake. There was a shrill ringing that filled my ears, and I almost pulled away. I took another deep breath. I could do this. Just one more today. One tiny life - it was would be worth it. I resisted the urge to gasp in pain; I never wanted the families to see how much it hurt me.

""WAIT!""

I jerked away from the baby, and right before my eyes the pink that had just appeared began fading. 

""What is it?"" I turned angrily. That was going to cost me at least one of my own grandchildren's soccer games.

The nurse that had come running in had barely caught her breath. ""I know this was it, and I know you're tired. I hope I'm not too late - it's the President.""

""I don't...understand."" I blinked, hoping I wasn't about to have to decide what I already knew she was asking me to.

""He - he's been shot.""",natlovesnails

[WP] Satan and Santa trade spots permanently. You are an elf that went from toys to soul prosecution.,Apodal98,"I remember the days, the great old days, where I used to make toys that made millions of children smile, where my boss was a Jolly old fella who was lazy 364 days of the year but on Christmas Day he would do a years worth of work within hours.

It all changed last Christmas, a group of very naughty children performed a ritual which switched Santa’s and Satan’s souls and changed the entire world forever. 

For a long time I thought that the North Pole Cold was the Ultimate Hell, but then I worked for Hell itself. Satan is a Grumpy fella, with horns coming out his head. A elf I used to work with made a snide remark about Satan while not realizing he, just like Santa, is always watching you. Satan spawned by him and literally just ate him whole. Satan just consumes souls and like a white person does not even bother to season them. 

So, you might be wondering what I do now that I’m working for Satan. We still make naughty and nice lists, but we make toys that kill all the naughty kids instantly now. Jack in the Boxes with guns in them, dolls that come to life, toy cars that text and drive and explode. All the sad toys we make to add to Satan’s army in which he plans to use to kill Santa Claus, God, and Stephen King.

"[WP] ""I think I hear him coming, should we run, or hide?""",Mmr_lane,"My little sister was crouched beside me. It was dark and late, we had stayed up passed curfew. She was starting to fall asleep so I shook her awake. I figured we should abort as our stake out didn't pay off.

""Did you see him?"" She said as she yawned.

""No, mission failure sis. We should call it a night.""

She gathered up her things and we started towards the doorway. A scratching coming from the walls made me freeze in place. My sister heard it too, she had the same look I did.

""I think I hear him coming!"" She exclaimed. ""Should we run or hide?""

The shuffling was getting louder, I had to think fast. We dove for cover behind the wall and peered into the room we just exited from. Scrapping continued for a few minutes followed by a thump. He was in. I had to look, I had to. Slowly I approached the corner of the wall and glanced into the room. There he was. My sister attempted to look as well but the floor groaned under her step.

The man looked in our direction. Thankfully we pulled our heads back in time. My breathing was laboured, all this excitement was getting to me. We were probably going to get in some kind of trouble for this, but it was worth it now. Steps could be heard in the room where the man was. They treaded around for a few moments and then stopped.

There was a sound similar to a snapping of fingers, followed by silence. I felt that enough time had passed so I poked my head around the corner again. He had gone. Curiously, I stepped into the room and found a note on the floor. My sister followed suit, she was visibly excited with what had transpired. I called my sister over and read the note to her.

""Seth and Clair,

I know that you were watching me. You two shouldn't have been down here should you have? As long as you can keep a secret, I can too. Now scurry off and get some rest, you have a big day tomorrow.

“Emma it’s ok, he didn’t see us”

“I’m so nervous, my heart is beating a mile a minute Jen”

“I know, I know but you need to calm down so we can do what we need to do, we have been planning this for weeks now and only get one chance”

“What if it doesn’t work, what if we mess up”

“We won’t, trust me, now get ready I think he’s getting closer”

Jenny maneuvers behind the couch right under the light switch to the big room. She reaches into her pocket and hands Emma a small cylinder “Remember point it right above him and pull the string, he won’t see it coming”

Emma looks to her sister for the signal 

Jenny mouths silently and motions with her hands 1...2....3...NOW!!

Jenny and Emma both jump to their feet from behind the couch, Jenny hitting the light switch and she comes up and Emma taking aim...she pulls the string..BANG!!!

[IP] Closer,Syraphia,"I was wandering along the streets of Bucharest when I heard the sound of a violinist and an accordion playing in sync. The sound echoed across the worn buildings of the old city, and I followed the sound until I discovered the musicians. I do not know why, exactly, I sought them out. The musicians were quite mediocre. There was nothing spectacular to their intonation or tune or sweetness of melody, but I searched for them nonetheless. 

I soon found them. They had a little hat filled with coins. Street artists were common in this city. They were like an infestation. But I stood and watched and listened to them, despite myself.

I realised that they had a third member. It was a little dancing girl. She was not particularly graceful. But she was good enough. My eyes followed her. She was spinning and leaping like a cork upon a tide. Her long, black hair swept around like a dress. They shadowed and cowled her face, so that her eyes were hidden.

And at that moment, there was a great flurry of white seeds. They swept in and landed on the cobblestone ground and twirled with the girl, dancing with the music. The sun shone on the gathering, and the musicians became men playing for kings. The girl was an enchantress, dancing with unnatural grace and poise, balanced on the tips of her feet, soaring across a field of diamonds.

A cloud passed over, and with the shadow fell the illusion. I gazed at them for a longer time, and then looked at the little hat filled with change. I turned away and left them. It was too tiresome to reach for my wallet.",yingfire
[IP] Closer,Syraphia,"##Silver Stars##

She gazed out the window, her eyes drawn to the sky, a hazy shade of winter. It was white and blue, green and faded gray, and she saw herself looking back, her face reflected on the frozen glass. That face was pale and cold, with long blonde locks and piercing green eyes, framed by sickly bones. All was lost but those eyes, sharp, bottle-green eyes that pierced the mist below.

They saw something that made her heart flutter, the sound the silent beating of silken wings. Something stirred inside her, a great swarm of delicate, paper feelings. It was a man, faceless in the growing dark, with a twirled red handlebar mustache and a creamy brown bowler hat. He took great, heavy strides, almost weighed down with even heavier thoughts. 

Ten years had passed since her abandonment. Ten painful years since she was left lying on the sidewalk, a folded piece of paper tucked neatly on her back. Ten years of silence and solitude. Ten years of being lost in the terrible coldness that was the Margrove Home for Orphaned Children.

Closer and closer she fell, the only solace the rememberings of something. Something she might have one day.

She shouldn’t kid herself. The world was already cruel enough without her.

People only adopted the young ones, the cute and happy babies. That was, if they got adopted at all. More often than not the families simply left, not appalled by the children’s sickliness or their sad faces. They left because they got bored. The broken toys were just too old, too tired, to be adopted into a loving home.

If such a thing as a loving home existed. 

But now, she felt different. Something was different about this one. Something strange, something mysterious. Was it just the hidden face, or the phantom way he swayed through the mist? Did that make him a-

Fan cut her words short, making sure they different make their way into the word. A horrible, horrible thought dawned on her. That something disappeared, vanished with the replacement, the sudden realization that struck her.

Peering back out into the night, her mind and heart and soul praying to dear god that what she thought wasn’t true, she saw it. 

It.

Pink and blue, with great, black eyes and a toothless maw. An unholy, unblessed, unwanted thing.

A baby.

Butterflies swarmed inside her.

A million memories, of a time she could have had, raced again and again through her mind. Dresses that fluttered on the wind, great fields of mossy grass soft against her feet. A mother and a father, a brother and a sister. A lover at her side and fighter just behind. Dear god, she had to stop this.

A thing was better than nothing.

Fan ran, her feet slapping loudly against the chilled wood. The cold was like a ghostly fire, burning her alive, but the terrible thought just burned brighter. She had to keep moving, to tell him to stop. To stop another something. 

The door shook with three great knocks, hard and bitter in the air. Fan practically tore down the door, her face livid with something trapped between rage and a horrible, fanatical sadness.

Thing started crying, his breath a cold cloud that wafted like a spirit through the air. The faceless man just stood quietly, not surprised or upset, just indifferent. His eyes were silvery, like twinkling stars, the same as the baby he clutched in his arms.

Words came so quickly that Fan simply let go of the anxieties and the fright. They tumbled down into that man’s heavy soul, harsh things that made it wheeze in the winter air.

She had to hope.

Without a goodbye, the man turned a fled into that great dark night, the fog trailing behind.

All she could do was cry as she held the memory tight against her chest. Cry and wail as the butterflies shook themselves free of her heart and a smile bloomed like a spring flower, beautiful in the growing night.

[IP] Closer,Syraphia,"""Your daughter...""

The principal, middle-aged and childless, bit her lip and considered how to phrase her next words to the concerned couple sitting opposite her desk. 

The female - the mom - a blonde, thirty-something housewife with the body of a twenty year old sat forward and rested a manicured hand softly against the edge of the hard oak. ""It's okay,"" she assured her, glancing back briefly for her husband's support. After he consented with a short, sharp nod, the woman turned back to the principal. ""Just tell us what our daughter did this time.""

Ms. Mahogany, a brutally honest woman by nature and habit, found it inexplicably hard to break the news to the gentle woman and her quiet, supportive husband that their daughter was...

""I think it would be best if you saw it for yourself,"" she decided.

*Detention*

*An empty classroom. A solitary girl at her desk, staring at her paper with an eerie stillness, face hidden behind a curtain of hair. A teacher monotonously grading papers in the front.*

*The teacher looks up. ""Kimmy, did you finish?*

*Kimmy doesn't respond.*

*The teacher stands and comes over to peer at Kimmy's work - all there is, is a blank sheet. ""Kimmy! You didn't even st-*

*""Leave me alone.""*

*""Excuse me?"" The teacher frowns, hand raised to her own chest in offended fashion.*

*Kimmy repeats her words. ""I **said** leave. Me. Alone.""*

*Blinking furiously, the teacher begins to scold. ""Kimmy, I'm your teacher and that's not a nice thing to sa-*

*Kimmy snaps her neck to face the teacher, and the teacher reels back, surprised.*

*The eye-contact between student and teacher intensifies until, wordlessly, the teacher turns and marches - almost mechanically - to her desk, while Kimmy follows her with her eyes. The teacher sits, opens a drawer, and pulls out a pair of scissors.*

*The teacher shakes her head. Her voice murmurs, ""Please.""*

*Kimmy stares on.*

*Slowly, hand quivering as if trying to fight against her own body, the teacher raises the scissors high into the air. ""Please,"" she pleads. ""Don't make me do this."" She cries in fear, then slams the scissor into her other hand and cries out in pain.

*Kimmy smiles. Kimmy laughs. The teacher yanks the scissors out of her hand and slams them back into her hand over and over and over again, all the while pleading and screaming for Kimmy to ""make it stop. PLEASE! MAKE IT STOP!""*

The tape abruptly ends and Ms. Mahogany lowers the remote. Watching both parents carefully, she says, ""You can imagine what happens next.""

They're strong. Or maybe they've been through this before. There's no tears. Just weary resignation. They hold hands and wait for the principal to initiate the next step of the process.

Ms. Mahogany takes a deep breath, then in the next breath gives them what they're expecting. Kimmy is expelled.

They take it with no resistance; nodding their heads in submission and rising together to leave; supporting each other in unity, holding each other up through their sorrow.

But as the door opens, the principal catches a glimpse of a solitary figure sitting on a chair in the hallway, staring down at the floor with an eerie stillness, face hidden behind a curtain of hair.

Just before the door closes, the figure looks up and makes eye contact with the principal..

[IP] Closer,Syraphia,"Mama had always believed butterflies were God's way of making people feel closer to the ones they'd lost. That they were those souls set free and carried along by colorful wings on a gentle breeze with no longer a care in the whole wide world. ""They've shed that ugly chrysalis of this empty old world and spread their newfound wings to reach life eternal,"" she would say from her favorite seat on the porch while rocking little Ellie Mae in her arms. The two of them would watch each evening as the sun sank on the horizon, setting the golden field awash in a fiery blaze. 

One time a butterfly had even landed on Ellie Mae's outstretched finger while they watched the sun set. ""Look, Mama! I've been touched by an angel!"" she giggled, delighted by the feathery touch of those delicate wings of burnt orange and pale yellow. 

""You sure have, baby girl,"" Mama laughed. ""Maybe your grandmama is thinking about you,"" she said, kissing her daughter's long, fair tresses. 

Ellie Mae just stared, entranced, at the creature poised on her finger, its dusty wings still fluttering in the summertime breeze. When it flew off into the twilight sky and Ellie Mae's bottom lip trembled in dismay, Mama couldn't help but to laugh again. ""Come on, sweet girl, it's time we got you to bed."" 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Mama had believed butterflies were God's way of making you feel closer to the ones you'd lost. But children weren't meant to be lost. And what sort of a God would take a child from her mother, anyway? Maybe butterflies were really just butterflies. A silly old bug that got sick of being one thing so it became another. It lived, it died. The end. 

Mama heard the screen door creak from behind her while she rocked on the porch. ""You comin' in?"" Papa asked from the darkened doorway, his voice coarse from his long work day out in the fields and months of very little sleep. 

""In a minute,"" was her quiet reply. She heard the door bang shut behind her. Heaving a weary sigh she felt to the marrow of her bones, she forced herself to her feet and shuffled into the house, Ellie Mae's blankie still clutched in her brittle hands. 

The next morning at breakfast, Papa looked at Mama from across his plate of eggs. ""It's been seven months. You goin' to church with me this morning?"" he asked. 

Mama shifted in her wooden chair as she was pulled from her thoughts by Papa's voice. ""No. No, you go on without me.... Maybe next week."" It was the same answer she always gave, but she still couldn't bear the thought of stepping foot into that old church. The one time she had tried, visions of that tiny white casket had floated before her bloodshot eyes. She'd turned right back around and never gone back. 
Papa just sighed and donned his hat and best suit jacket, leaving the now too quiet house. 

Mama sipped her black coffee, its bitter roast tickling her tastebuds as she watched the sun climb into the clear sky from the kitchen window. In need of fresh air, she got to her feet and shambled out to the porch, taking her usual seat. She closed her tired eyes and let the warm rays of sunlight wash over her as she rocked gently back and forth. Her fragile hands gripped the worn wood of that old rocking chair as she hummed the lullaby she used to sing to Ellie Mae.  

Feeling a slight tickle on the back of her right hand, she raised it and shook away the crawling bug without opening her eyes. But the persistent thing held fast, caressing her skin with its legs. She opened her eyes to flick it off and froze. A beautiful azure butterfly with wings like a shimmering ocean was perched there, its wings rising and falling lazily as it rested a moment on Mama. Blue had been Ellie Mae's most favorite color. Mama lifted her other hand and placed it on her chest, over her stuttering heart as a tear sprang to her eye. 

Her beloved daughter would have been six years old tomorrow, and maybe, just maybe, that was her way of letting her Mama know she was always close, and as free from the pain and sickness as she could be; floating along on silken wings of the most vivid blue in the dewy springtime air.

[IP] West Gash,Syraphia,"Timmy was poking some frogs with a small stick he found when he heard the ship drop in nearby. He turned and looked in the direction of the sound and gave a smile that was missing a front tooth. He immediately forgot about the frogs as he ran out of the forest. He ran past the small hut he had made and by the window that looked into the kitchen.

""Hey, Mom, Papa's home"" He yelled as he continued to run up the steep embankment.

Finally he got over the hill and saw his father, the most important person in the world. He was already putting the ship away in a hidden cave when Timmy yelled down to him. 

""Hey Papa"" He yelled bounding down the stairs to the hidden cave. 

""Well hey Ranger"" His father said back up to him as he watched him come down the stairs. ""How are you doing?"" He said closing up the fake entrance. 

""Oh, Just dandy"" Timmy said finally getting down to his father taking and hugging him without taking a breath. The sudden movement jerked the old man back on his feet, but he stayed up for his son. 

""What have you been up to?"" The old man said with a smile on his face. 

""I was just looking at some of the frogs and I found another cave due west of here"" Timmy let go and looked around ""You have to see my new map, it is way better than the last one"" 

""That's wonderful son"" The old man looked up the ridge again and saw the mother walking down the stairs ""Why don't you run along and find it and I'll get the Skimmer out"" Timmy nods and with a burst of speed he runs up the stairs, right past his mother without saying a word, and over the ridge. 

The gentle smile that was on the old man's face began to fade as the mother came closer, her aged body still gracefully walked down the stairs as if it was the first day they came here. ""Did you see his mouth?"" She asked walking closer. 

""I did, how long ago did he lose it?"" He approached her. 

""Just a few months"" He goes in for a sad sorry embrace and she excepts ""Why where you so late?"" 

Tears fall out of his eyes ""You know how it gets sometimes, People need me and corporations want me. But I always remember you are here, as well as Timmy"" He moved away and looked up the ridge ""Reminds me of...you know"" 

The mother nods, sniffling a little bit ""I just wish you could be around more, He is growing up without you and you see how much he wants you here"" 

""I know, he is just a bundle of energy stuck on this backwater planet. Reminds me of myself"" He smiles and looks at the mother. 

""Well, He is a clone"" They have a small laugh to each other ""We have Tyran Rolls back in the house. I'm glad you're back President Riasen"" 

Timmy looked over the ridge happy to see them together again, it was one of the happiest days of his life. As they all walked into the cut out house they all laughed at the story's the father had to tell of intergalactic diplomats and strange aliens. Deep down, however, they all knew what they wanted to do, to forget about it all and just remain here with each other. Timmy, his mother, and the most important man in the galaxy. ",Foreverending

It was the voice that woke him from his slumber. 

He'd been sitting there almost mindlessly under the rain amidst the muck and the blood the whole time. He was soaked through completely, the water slipping easily even through the rough bag over his head, touching on the rope burns lining his neck. 

He heard laughter. At last, he tilted his head and pulled the bag off of his head. 

He was...alone in the clearing. Should have been alone. It had been hours since the mob had lynched him and left his body in this clearing amidst the trees for the beasts of the forest to devour. 

Somehow, he was still alive. And he wasn't alone. 

There was a man leaning against a tree nearby, looking very out of place in a neatly pressed black suit and dress shoes. Long silver hair that didn't catch the rain at all, framing a wide, *happy* smile. 

He couldn't help but notice the gigantic skull-crested scythe nestled in the crook of the man's arms. 

""Hi~ Awake at last, are we?"" 

He tried to speak, coughed a bit, then managed at last, ""What happened? Am I dead? W-Who the hell are you?""

The man hummed to himself, ""Let's see...in order, you died of asphyxiation and blood loss due to hanging and being beaten on by loads of angry humans, no, and lastly-

""Want to take a guess who I am?"" the man tapped a gloved hand against the polished side of the scythe's blade and grinned widely at him, ""I'm *dying* to know who you think I am~"" 

""That was...a horrible pun,"" he said dryly. He climbed shakily to his feet, looking around the clearing, ""You're a hallucination. It's probably all the bloodloss."" 

""So you don't believe you died and somehow got up again, James Elliot Rathbone?"" 

James shook his head, walking unsteadily towards the treeline, ""I must have survived somehow. This is just a near death experience at best. I have to...have to get out of here before anyone finds me again."" 

""*Near death experience?*"" the silver haired man chuckled heavily, grabbing his gut as he desperately gasped for air. James flinched when he realized the stranger had somehow appeared beside him, ""Alright, let's call it that..."" 

A cold, gloved hand clamped onto the loose end of the noose dangling from his neck, pulling him close to that hellish smile.

Enoki moved passed her mother to the cushy green seats, shaped like tiny pumpkins. The woman behind the counter, probably a few years older than Enoki, moved between the computer and a filing cabinet. 

""I am... Sorry. Sorry. Um, let's see what I can do,"" the girl asked, her pink wings turning a silvery shade. 

Tremella apologized. ""I am very sorry about her. She's... trying."" 

""I know what it's like to get your adult wings,"" the secretary said. ""But, my name is Amanita White and I will be here to help you.  If you would just sign here and here, we can get Enoki signed in.""

""I am Hen Woods, your photographer for today,"" the man said. His dark green hair was pulled back in a long dragontail, showing off his pierced ears. His wings had been dyed the same unnatural color at the end. 

Enoki could see the brown where his roots were coming in. Pretentious, her father would say, not natural. No mushrooms were that color. No one would think he was a Flowerchild. With a name like Woods, Enoki knew for certain he was a *ground sort.* Dirty nothings...

[IP] Whispering Doom,Syraphia,"I could always tell when one of the damn things was gloating.  Extra-dimensional, nameless horror or not, smug was smug, and even a normal person, without the enhanced awareness the Sight provided, wouldn't have been able to miss it.


Well, they'd notice it if they weren't driven irrevocably insane, or didn't get their eyes burnt out of their skulls, anyway.


The entity in front of me in the dank of the tropical cave I'd spent the last two hours crawling through wasn't any different than the others I'd done battle with, over the years in Puerto Rico.  The island tends to draw things like it, and they usually followed roughly the same MO of starting small, creating a little fiefdom of death and terror, and then getting big enough that people started to notice.  Even the logic behind why the creatures were doing it was almost always the same.  Sure they all had their own, special flavor of horror, but it always came down to either them feeding off something they were getting from their victims, or plain, indifferent slaughter.


Fortunately, the hooded, shade-like creature that had been luring people away from the nearby town of Rincón was squarely in the former category.  It was a feeder, needing and relishing consuming the life essence of sentient creatures' souls, and a fairly typical one, at that.  I figured that I'd be out of there in short order, after sending it back to whatever shit hole corner of creation it had crawled out of.


It laughed again, the action sending eye-twisting ripples in overlarge angles through it, and flitted over to one of its victims.  The creature had arranged them in more or less perfect ranks inside the cave, and it picked one of the ten or twelve people there seemingly at random.  As I watched, the scene filtered through my own Sight and mental defenses, the thing whispered in the person's ear.


People don't understand that words have *power*.  Under the right (or wrong) circumstances, the correct words, and infused with the power of will can do all kinds of messed up shit.  They can unlock parts of our minds that are best left shut, send the same minds into an endless, irrecoverable feedback loop, and bend someone to the speaker's will.  Some words were even more powerful, and were the type of things that could rewrite or unmake existence.


As I watched, the thing's words twisted their way into a young man's ear, disappearing for a moment, before writing their way under the skin of this face.  Eventually, the words' power lit his eyes from within, his face and body twisting as the eldritch light look him.  Seen through the lens of my abilities, where time slipped in strange ways, the process seemed to go on and on, with nothing that I could do to stop it.  The guy was dead, his light snuffed out, the instant the words began eating him.


Anger, hot and bright, surged from within me, feeding my own power, and I launched myself at the creature.  As I went, my hand drew my *wakizashi*-style short sword from its sheath on my back, the weapon's monomolecular edge singing a pure, clean note as it parted the air in its path.  In my mind's expanded state, I saw multiple possibilities unfold at once, and willed myself along the most probable, anticipating what the thing and it's thrall would do.


In a tactic uncharacteristic for similar entities, though, both stayed perfectly still, not moving at all until I was too close to avoid them.  Only then did they do anything, and the higher order creature tried to dance backwards out of my reach, while its thrall raised its misshapen claws up towards me.


A burst of will drove me down into a sliding tackle, and the thrall absorbed most of my momentum when I hit it.  The rest, combined with the body I'd just impacted, let me pop back up to my feet, and slashed my weapon in a tight vertical arc, taking the thing's hands.  Blood, suffused with the same weird light I'd seen work its way through the victim's system moments before, sprayed over me, and I was thankful that I had twisted enough to keep any of it from getting in my eyes or mouth.  My clothes, though, were soaked.


The thrall bellowed in pain, but still tried to follow me, gnashing its teeth as it came.  I rolled forward, to gain some separation, and regained my feet just in time to sweep the blade through it's torso, the tone of the blade rippling as it passed through ribs and soft tissue.  More of the glowing blood, accompanied by innards spilled out, and the thing dropped to the cavern floor, nearly cloven in two.  Even with the massive damage to its body, it was still driven by its master's intent, and I had to paste its head against the rock with a blast of will to silence it for good.


As I turned back to look for the entity, I saw a dozen pairs of eldritch light glaring back at me.

[IP] Industrial District,Syraphia,"As a convict Zharon would never get proper freedom, a good job, a good place to live, among other things, ever again. Yet he considered himself almost lucky to be here. On the ""good"" parts of the planet life was artificial and facetious. Nobody could say a word without having to carefully consider every single implications. Nobody could do their jobs without allotting more time to office politics than their actual jobs. Yet Zharon would always see the bright glows of the local sun where others could only the dim glows of their work lamps. Down here there was no pretension. One could speak their mind, do their job but most importantly live free. 10 years into his sentence he got a lot of perks for good behavior, such as regaining the privilege of drinking alcohol, and being allowed a private dwelling, though with strict conditions. Most importantly he had the re-earned the right to communicate with the free laborers, though always monitored. He learned more from each 30 minute lunch break conversation with one person than he learned from years of ""knowing"" somebody in his former life.

Overhead machinery would always buzz, the air was rancid with chemicals the lights never turn off, yet as he looked up into the sky he would always be able to tell where the last bits of natural sky were among the ever growing skyscrapers. It was ironic but when he used to live on the upper levels of the planet he had a clear view of the stars and the complete freedom to go anywhere and talk to anyone yet he never used it. He never looked up, or around. He was stuck to his vid screen at work, and his vid screen at home trying to forget about work.

It wasn't a feeling he could explain. It didn't matter that his sentence was political, motivated purely by spite from his former boss, because at the end of each day he knew deep down that he was more free. The few slivers of sky and stars that he could see from the bottom tier of society at the bottom level of the planet, was more than any surface dweller would ever see as it hung right above their heads every day of their blind ignorant lives.",CleverNameAndNumbers

""Kid , keep your sword unsheathed, you will need it on the way back ..."" , The demon told me and I asked him why and all he said was ""getting in the demon area was pretty easy , but getting out is near impossible and keep in mind ... The betrayer was never found , I tried my best but couldn't figure out who he was ""


I followed his advice and kept my unsheathed sword in my hand as I walked through the dense greenery , once again I marvelled at the sword , it reflected the forest's many colours in a way which seemed to not affect it ... I had a close look at the reaper and it seemed to be affected by the hues of the forest , it looked almost surreal but not the sword ... It looked normal and as blue as the morning sky and the ocean on the horizon.


Once or twice , I thought I saw something from the corner of my eyes. It seemed to be ethereal and just out of vision , something which when you see directly all you get is an aftermath , a nagging after image... I heard a rustling and a deep rooted growl from the bushes to my left and stood in attention instinctively looking to my right to see a dog with fur the colour of dazzling snow and what seemed like glowing red ball on its head charge towards me like there was no tomorrow , Its eyes betrayed it however I couldn't look at it directly to confirm ... From the outside it looked just like a normal dog and when it leapt 20 feet in the air it turns out i was right.


Due to the distraction on my left , I could only raise my sheath and block it vicious fangs , I took a swipe with my sword but it disappeared and ran away into the bushes. Then I heard a rustling above and saw the dog charge from the bushes at the base of the tree and once again , could get only my sheath on it. By now I had figured out its pattern and when I heard rustling to my right , I thrust my sword straight and true to my left without looking at it , I heard a whimper and saw the dog was stabbed right in the chest ... It's red eyes dissolved and it lay whimpering on the ground like a normal dog. I tried to give it a pat and to end it's suffering , but it dissolved to nothingness.


Confused and a bit depressed , I turned to the path only to see Sakura standing near the dragon tombstone, I could recognize her clothes anywhere and her scent was distinctive , which leaked to her letters to me ... I looked to the her left immediately and was suddenly consumed by an inexplicable rage 

Mido : "" Sakura ! What are you doing here ? Have you come to reveal your true nature ? If so , save it , I already know about it ! You pretended to love me but you simply did it play me didn't you ? 

Sakura : ""Mido - kun , please hea..""

M : save your breath demon , I just need to know why you did this ? To someone like me ? You had nothing to gain by pretending to love me ! I was and am but a peasant who had nothing in life but you ! Why did you betray me ?

S : I am so sorry Mido - kun , please hear me out ! I had no choice !  You know how my father is ! This is the only sort of love I could make ! It was a toss up between you and other demons and my heart choose you , my love 

M : shut it , you filthy demon ! My grandmother has told me all about you ! She warned me against your wily ways and I will not fall in your trap now !

S : after a moment of silence ... Mido kun , your grandmother died with your parents when the Shogun cornered your parents !  I know it because I was there ! She was the one who betrayed your parents ! I have keeping tabs on you and you live alone !


The earth felt like it was pulled away from the ground and I felt like the sky had fallen on my head , the burden was so much that I almost fainted but my sword supported me , keeping me in a kneeling position... My instinct told me she was not lying ... It was pretty easy to figure out once you didn't look into her eyes , it felt like my heart was torn out and was being ripped to pieces 

S : "" I am so sorry Mido , my love but I have to go now ... Some Daku demons are nearby , please run away as fast as you can !  And do not linger in any place for more than a second even if you see something impossible. """,Pillarsofcreation99

I was not sure how I was managing to run , as it seemed like someone had pulled my legs away from under me , but I was running away pretty fast which was a good thing because I heard ungodly sounds from just behind me which I was getting terrified of but the fear was not penetrating my consciousness rather it was bumbling about peripherally around the main emotion dominating my being at the moment : Confusion tinged with depression.


I was not sure what or who to believe at the moment , it seemed like every step I took was met with betrayal by someone increasingly close to me ... First Sakura and next my very own Obaa-chan ?  No , I was not sure who or what she was , but she seemed to have taken my grandmothers form.


I took a slight deviation from my route home and instead ran towards a quiet creek located a around a Cho or two from my home , it had a rock on the ground and no one came there as it was very unremarkable , dawn had not yet taken hold of the skies and it was still very dark , with a single star dominating the sky ... The sounds of the forest had returned with the sound of bugs dominating the air , and the silence had become tolerable instead of unsettling.


I sat down with a heavy heart and realized that this was not the time to be having a mental breakdown , the shogun's elite would be coming soon and after Sakura's meeting with me , I was sure she would give my location away and I expected to be attacked any moment ... Clutching my sword tight enough to draw blood , I sat at ready but nothing ever came. It seemed like I was in a different world ... A world without monsters , where I just had to defeat the Shogun and his best in a 1 v 1 battle but that simplicity had been torn apart .


I was becoming desperate , think about things in a what - if rather than a what - now way , this was bad ... Wishful thinking without action only lead to despair , I shook myself and planned my next move ,  I had to go one move at a time as all plans were collapsing pretty fast with each second passing by. However something seemed odd about the place I was sitting , it was as if the forest was protecting me from the intrusive thoughts polluting my mind by putting me as ease.


I knew what step I had to take next ... I had to confront my grandmother (Obaa - Chan) to find her truth and to figure out the extent of her betrayal and find out whose side she was really was on 

""Feeling lost are we , my son ?""

I looked up , adrenaline rushing my veins , heart beating pretty fast to see a man standing a few feet away from me on the other side of the creek ... He looked just like me but he had a few scars and looked quite a bit older and taller , it was as if a painter had made some deliberate mistakes here and there , I knew immediately that I was talking to my father. 


""Father ?"" I whispered not noticing that he didnt seem quite real , my eyes were welling up again , I defiantly wiped them away to face my father like a man 

Father : ""My son , I am sorry but it seems I have left you in quite a bit of a mess""

Mido : ""Are you really my father ? Or are you some demon ?""

F : ""No my son, I am not as real as a demon but I am your father , I am proud of everything you have done so far and how you have behaved in such a dire situation , something I am not sure I would have been able to do  in your place 

M : "" Where were you all these years father ? Why are you here now ? ""

F : "" son , at this point time doesn't really hold much sway on me so the first question is irrelevant but I was always with you my son , when you came to this place all these years filled with anguish and rage at your powerlessness , I was here waiting to comfort you , didn't you always feel better here ?""

I nodded my head in disbelief 

F : "" As for the second question  , I am here because you are losing hope very fast , such a thing is natural when everything seems to be going wrong but remember Mido ! There are times when things do go right ! You have to persevere through the pain and trudge on till you hit upon the truth and never doubt your instinct ... It is the sharpest sword you have even in the face of the gift you received from the sky. Good bye my son , I hope we will get the opportunity to talk again""

Just then a mist settled upon the land and he dissolved becoming one with it.


I took off , determined to never lose hope again and to confront my 'grandmother' , I had the funny feeling she didn't mean any harm as she could have harmed me all these years but she hadn't , I just had to dig through the truth 

I reached my hut even faster than I anticipated , there seemed to be no one nearby as I scouted the place out and went in 


Obaa Chan was sitting on the ground nursing a very small puppy with pure white fur stroking it's fur lovingly and feeding it broth 


M : ""Obaa - Chan ! How could you ? How could you betray me and my parents  ? I have known and trusted you almost  all my life ! ""

Grandma : "" My child please stop shouting , and sit down , it is not I who betrayed your parents , it was your real grandmother , she was a evil woman who would not think twice of selling out her own kin for a bit of gold ""

M : ""But then , who are you ? "" I sputtered out 

G : "" I am the nameless demon of this forest  , my child . I was a close confidant and friend of your mother , who despite my origins treated me as nothing less than human , I admired her and it would not be far fetched to say that she was like a sister to me . I also help demons to pass on peacefully she said as she stroked the puppy who seemed content and vanished , and something else clicked in place ! It was the Same dog which attacked me ! ""

M : ""but Sakura ... ! ""

G : ""yes I made a mistake there , she doesn't seem to have betrayed you yet however I felt that she had after I found that you didn't know that she was a demon spawn and before you ask , yes demons can't figure out where I am , as I am invisible to them ... Anyone who has no prior knowledge of me can't feel or know of my presence without my intention ""

I felt shell shocked but something clicked in my mind and I started laughing ! A path to victory had shown itself !

The way her weight didn't fall on her feet. Her stride was a carefully practiced performance, but it still didn't quite seem natural. The gravel didn't crunch like it should.

""No,"" he told himself. ""It hasn't gotten us into trouble yet. I just know what to look for."" He averted his eyes to avoid drawing any undue attention. Nearby, a slim grey cat darted out from one alley way and into another.

""Stop worrying about it. You're the only one who's ever noticed, and it took you the better part of a month,"" the cat had said. It was years ago, but he only just this instant remembered it.

""You know I hate it when you do that,"" he whispered as quietly as he could. Another old memory struck him suddenly and sharply.

"[WP] A tall rugged gunslinger, a little pig-tailed girl in a sundress, and a average looking cat walk into town. Each one is far more deadlier than the last.",mistaque,"Winston hated people. He hated small spaces. He hated children. Really, Winston hated most things, except his guns. When he was part of the Order, he wore firearms and ammo like a uniform, proudly patroling his sector while civilians kept their distance. It was a mundane, repetative life- but there was a comfort in that he missed. Now...

A hand pulled on the sleeve of his worn, leather jacket. Still looking forward, he uttered a gruff exhale and spoke quietly. ""Yeah, kid?""

""You're doing it again,"" Quipped a high voice. Large, innocent green eyes were trained on him- the serious look unsettlingly adult for the face of a child. They had been traveling together for awhile now, but he still avoided her strange eyes when he could. Grunting indifferently, he continued walking, and the girl's grasp slipped from his clothing as she followed.

Humming, she gained the lead, enthusiastically skipping through the puddles that riddled the sidewalk. Though thoroughly dampened by the drizzling rain, the tawny strands of her pigtails still tried to bounce with the girl's gait. She sucked in her breath, coming to a splashing halt in front of a diner, pressing her face against the glass.

""No, Daisy. We have to keep moving,"" Winston sighed, a gloved hand grabbing the collar of her sweater jacket and pulling. An annoyed growl sounded from the inside of the garment, and the face of an irritated tabby popped out and glared at the man.

""You've upset Mr. Pickles!"" Daisy giggled gleefully. The cat wiggled out slightly more to swipe at Winston's hand. With a disgusted noise, the man let go of the jacket and jerked his hand back. Daisy seized the opportunity to throw her arms around Winston in a dramatic plea for diner pancakes.

""Please, Winston!"" She sniffled, ""We haven't had any food in two days! I need pancakes to survive!""

""I can make pancakes.""
 
""No you can't. They're always too lumpy and don't have enough chocolate chips."" Throwing his hands up in exasperation, Winston spared one look down. Daisy was using her perfected pity face, while Mr. Pickles had climbed from inside her jacket to the top of her head somehow and was still glaring, somehow with a far more sinister look than a cat should have. How could a person say no to that?

""Fine,"" He snapped, pushing open the doors to the diner and making a beeline for a back corner booth, side eyeing the other patrons as he did. As the trio plopped into the seats with a squish, a chipper waitress hustled over, coffee pot in hand.

""Even'in folks. What'll it be?""

""Coffee, black. And two glasses of milk.""

""Two?"" The waitress raised her eyebrow as she looked at the cat, ""Afraid we don't serve.. erm.. Cats here."" Daisy blinked at the older woman before her eyes narrowed.

""Mr. Pickles wants milk.""

""But-""

""HE. WANTS. MILK."" As Daisy's voice climbed in octaves, a loud hum could be heard, increasing to a oud, painful ring that made even the other patrons around them cover their ears. The waitress's glass coffee pot shattered, making her yelp. Disoriented, she bent to clean the mess, but was stopped by Winston.

""Let me get that, miss. The drinks, if you would,"" His voice was softer, apologetic, and persuasive to the confused waitress who wasn't quite sure what just happened. As the woman left, Winston grabbed a fistful of napkins, carefully picking at the larger pieces of glass around them, muttering under his breath.

""I'm sorry,"" Daisy whispered, posture slumping as she shot Mr. Pickles a look, ""I could tell he was getting mad. I'll be better next time, I swear. We're just so hungry and thirsty. And tired. When can we rest?""

""I told you, Daisy, we have to get out of this town. It's too close to the city-"" Winston stopped as the bell above the diner doors rang. He turned his head slowly, just enough to see the uniformed men that had entered, posters in hand. They stopped the waitress as she passed them, and from the woman's multiple glances between them Winston knew it was too late. He stood defensively in front of the girl and cat, hands hovering over the holsters hidden under his jacket.

""Sir, you and your charge are being detained for questioning, by the authority of the Order,"" One of the approaching officers announced, his voice bored and monotone. His partner followed a step behind, drawing his gun with a slow flourish, as if to intimidate, ""If you come without a fight, the Order will be merciful.""

""We both know that's a load of bullshit,"" Winston replied with a scowl, quickly drawing a pistol. The guns fired simultaneously, but only one bullet landed its mark. Winston's bullet had buried itself between the eyes of one of the Order officers, while their own hung suspended in the air, as if frozen in time. After a moment they dropped harmlessly to the ground, but not before the officer bellowed into his com for more backup.

Hearing sirens in the distance, Winston fired more shots, taking down another uniform. Daisy redirected the bullets that came too close to her protector, but her unsteady concentration missed one that embedded itself into the wall by her head. With a hiss, Mr. Pickles exploded out from some dark crevice, fully fluffed out between Winston and their enemy.

Stunned, the officers did nothing, their jaws slack. Winston knowingly stepped back as the cat began to change, its limbed cracking and distorting as the body grew. The Order's men stumbled back as the creature, once the size of a housecat, surpassed the size of a 7 foot tall man. With a loud, feral cry, Mr. Pickles lunged. Winston reholstered his guns, ignoring the screams and wet splattering of blood behind him as he inspected Daisy.

""You okay, kid?"" He said, concerned expression clear on his face as he squatted in front of her, eyes scanning for any injuries. She beamed, watching the murderous rampage that Mr. Pickles was unleashing on the other side of the diner.

"[WP] A tall rugged gunslinger, a little pig-tailed girl in a sundress, and a average looking cat walk into town.

His long coat flapped behind him as he walked, boots kicking up dust with each step. A young girl walked beside him, moving just as quickly. Intrigued by this odd match, I closed the book and waited for them to come closer. This happened quickly with the speed that the pair were walking at.

""Good morning."" The man said, a hint of a smile on his face.

""Good morning."" I replied, before giving the little girl a smile.

She didn't return it.

""Do you mind?"" The man said, gesturing at the bench I was sitting on.

""Not at all""

I moved the book, and shuffled the end of the bench, making room for the man and the little girl. I attempted to engage her in conversation and hopefully cheer her up somewhat.

""I like your pig-tails!"" I said happily. ""Did you do them yourself?""

The girl remained silent, only peering into my face. It was, I admit, a little disconcerting. The man shook his head.

""Best you talk to me for now friend."" He said carefully. ""Don't want to be getting ahead of ourselves here.""

""I'm afraid I don't understand."" I said, more than a little confused.

""We're here to talk, to get a sense of you. Think of us as advisers, if you like. I start the ball rolling and if we don't like what you say, then the girl here'll take over.""

By this point I was wondering if I'd fallen asleep reading my book, and that this was all a strange dream brought on by the hot sun.

""Uh, what do you need from me?""

""That's simple, what's the worst thing you've done to another person?""

I opened my mouth to answer, but his raised hand stopped me.

""Now before you answer without thinking."" He said sternly, ""Bare this in mind. We *will* know if you lie, and the girl has even less patience for that than I do.""

He motioned for me to continue, and I opened my mouth to speak again.

""Well, the only thing that comes to mind is that I spread rumours about a friend of mine. Rumours that let me begin a relationship with a woman he was also interested in. It may not sound like a huge thing, but it's caused me a great deal of guilt over the years.""

The man nodded as I spoke, apparently unsurprised by what I was telling him. I went on.

""Well the rumour I spread caused him to lose a great deal of his friends, myself included, but I doubt he considered me amongst his friends by that point. It got bad enough that he took to drinking, and one night he...""

I took a deep breath, trying to stop my voice from shaking.

""He went out in his car after drinking. They found it overturned near the motorway. They said he'd died instantly.""

The man's head snapped up when I finished speaking. He began to look quite pale. He looked to the girl.

""What do you think Lisa?"" He said, getting to his feet quickly.

She said nothing, she didn't even move. Her mouth moved silently, as if she was having a conversation without vocalising.

The man was distinctly panicking now.

""Lisa!""

She turned and looked up at him.

""He's been claimed James. Nothing we can do now.""

She didn't have the voice of a child, it was strong and confident, and sounded almost sad. She turned to me, and rested a hand on my shoulder. She looked into my eyes.

""In the name of Foyur The Eyeless I release this one, may his soul come to rest wherever is fated. Foyur grant us favour, protect us as we do as you command. This one does not understand, but we cannot show him what he needs to know, his soul is forfeit by way of his crimes.""

She released my shoulder, and this time she spoke to me, rather than to whoever she was speaking to before.

""I really am sorry, my friend. There's nothing we can do for you now. Solus follows your scent as we speak. It's coming for you, and I'm not strong enough to be your guard.""

She looked a touch wistful.

""Maybe when I was younger, when I still had my strength...""

""I don't understand."" I said, ""You can't be more than 9 or 10.""

She simply smiled that same sad smile, and hopped down from the bench. She took the man's hand, and they strode off into the distance, not running, but moving at a steady pace.

I sat back, and tried to make sense of what the *hell* had just happened.

At the edge of town, a black and white cat walked slowly, nostrils flaring. It moved with the fluid grace of all feline animals, betraying the power that it possessed.

The street was not exactly busy, but any people that found themselves near the animal, shied away quite inexplicably. The animal continued it's slow progression until, without warning, it stopped dead. It's head worked from side to side as it found the smell it had been searching for. The cat cocked it's head, and moved off at a slightly faster pace.

I looked around myself, hoping to see the man and the girl hiding somewhere nearby, laughing to themselves at the foolish man they had tricked. No such luck. I felt a very real sense of unease at what had just transpired, even while logic was telling me that what they had said was nothing more than delusion.

It was while I was peering around myself, that I became aware of the cat approaching me slowly. I frowned. It wasn't exactly unknown to see cats wandering the streets, but it certainly wasn't common. People often kept them indoors. Usually a cat outside  meant someone who owned a get, had gained some kittens that they very much disliked. Then out go the kittens. Thinking this was the likely explanation, I looked closer, seeing if I could spot a collar.

My blood ran cold.

The animal's shadow was all wrong. Where there should be a small shadow of a cat, instead was a roiling mass of dark. An ever-changing mass, shifting coiling tentacles, maws of impossible depth and numerous teeth. As the beast in cat's clothing approached, my ears began to ring, and my vision developed a slight fuzz to it.

The animal climbed up next to me, and sat on its hind legs, watching me. Strangely enough, the thought that occurred to me in that moment, was that it bore a striking resemblance to the sitting cat statues in ancient Egypt.

The animal sat there, and stared up into my eyes. I stared back, unable to look away. The eyes were pure black, and looking upon them I felt as if my grip on the world was slipping, that I was tipping forward into those eyes.

My hands tighten on the bench. Ears ringing, the colour seeping out of my vision. The shadows all around me: the bench, the cat, *me*, they all lengthen, and then contract, then lengthen again. They flicker back and forth.

The cat hisses. My ears ring, my head spins. I clutch the bench even tighter. My heart pounds in my throat. I become aware of a deep laughing coming from all around me, all while the cat remains staring at me.

My upper body is weaving back and forth. My voice cracks as I try to speak.

""What...how...?""

The laughing again. Those eyes seem to be bottomless, drawing me in. The eyes seem to bleed from the sockets, spreading out like a black smoke. My head spins, and the world goes black.

The cat hopped down off the bench, and lowered it's nose to the ground. It sniffed, and moved off in the same direction as the man and the girl had.",Scylene

Once upon a time there lived a young male called Wolfgang. Wolfgang loved to walk in the woods, and always tried to make friends on his walks. One day Wolfgang saw a young female human walking on the forest path with a big basket on her arm and a white riding hood covering her head. 

""Where are you going, young human?"" Wolfgang called out as he ran towards the path, tail wagging joyfully. The human looked at him coldly. ""To my grandmother's place with this poisoned food, mother's had enough of her bitching."" 

Wolfgang was shocked, but tried to persuade the human not to give her grandmother poisoned food. ""Are you really sure you want to kill your grandmother?"" he asked. Her blue eyes glinted like steel. ""Yes."" 


Wolfgang had no idea what to do. He followed the human, and when they reached the edge of a clearing he stopped her and asked again. ""Are you really sure you want to kill your grandmother, young one?"" Her voice was sharp like a knife. ""Yes."" 


Wolfgang ran ahead of the girl, thinking her grandmother must live in the little red hut by the path. He stopped just outside the door, panting. When the girl arrived he asked her again ""are you really sure you want to kill your grandmother?"" Her lips were tight like a bowstring. ""Yes."" Wolfgang felt the hairs on his back stand on end. ""Then I can't let you in, young one"". 


A hunter was nearby, and when he heard the enraged cry the girl made, he came running, gun at the ready. ""Oh, mister hunter! This big, dangerous beast won't let me come in and give this delicious food to my grandmother!"" The young one could be sweet too, her eyes shone like a lake in summer, her voice was sweet like a summer breeze, and her lips trembled like reeds in the wind. Wolfgang tried to call out, to the hunter, to the grandmother, to anybody, but none who heard would listen.


The hunter shot him dead, and the little girl gutted him, drenching her hood with his blood. ""Now we can tell everybody we were too late to save grandmother from the wolf, and that fortunately you arrived just in time to cut me out from the wolf's belly!"" The girl in the red riding hood declared to the hunter, who was so impressed with her cunning that he asked her to marry him on the spot.",BooksAndTeaAndCats
[WP] The Fairy Tales the wolves tell are a lot different than ones you know.,mistaque,"The Town Full of Lazy Villagers Who Posted a Single Boy to Guard a Herd of Sheep 

There once was a village of lazy, incompetent herders who left their sheep in a field all day. Naturally, droves of us would descend upon the fields to take advantage of these easy pickings. But when the economy crashed, and the herders looked to liquidate their assets, they found precious few sheep remaining. So they sought to do something. 

Lazy, desperate people are still lazy. So you know what they did? They put one of their young there. His name was Tom, and he was actually a good deal smarter than the villagers. He diligently went to his field every day with pair of binoculars and a megaphone. He had conviction. He had to go down. And so began operation Bait the Lazy. 

Two agents were sent to infiltrate the town. It was an easy task, since the only guard was yet another shephard's child. These people were sick fucks. Our youngest, fastest wolf then jumped into the binocular's range of view and howled, barely on the edge of sight. The young boy shouted ""Wolf! Wolf!"" and ran towards the town. 

As lazy as these people were, none of them wanted to be starving and homeless, and they begrudgingly gathered their pitchforks and marched towards the sheep fields. Our decoy returned to the den, and our two infiltrators ransacked their kitchens, making sure to leave an obvious trail towards the guard boy's sleeping quarters. When the town came to the field and saw the sheep completely unharmed, they scolded the boy and smacked him for making them walk.

And when they came home and found the destruction leading to the boy's room, they scolded him again. Well, we weren't sure if they smacked him, but the next day, he brought a pillow out to the fields to sit on. 

The second time, we were more careful. They had increased the town guard from one little boy to two little boys, so we avoided the main entrance and sent a single agent through the sewers. This ended up being to our advantage, as this next mission was to sully the boy's name as a slob and a womanizer. When the boy shouted ""Wolf!"" again and the villagers came running, our agent broke into his room and smeared sewage over the bed, then tossed clothing and books all over the floor. He also lined the walls with women's undergarments, some of which belonged to the boy's mother. 

I suppose it says something about this village's laziness and corruption that on the third day, the SAME KID was back at the job, dragging his pillow, almost ready to cry. This time, we descended upon him as an entire pack, and he bawled as he cried ""Wolf! Wolf!"". 

As expected, the residents of the town were far too lazy to get out of bed three days in a row, and we feasted upon the sheep and the boy's broken spirit. And the boy.

Laurie snapped at her thirty year old son, Corey, who carried a box labeled 'FRAGILE' towards the door of her apartment. ""Laurie, they're all labeled fragile."" Nikki, her daughter in law, said condescendingly. 

""Then I guess you'll just have to be careful with all of them, won't you."" Laurie said. ""She's projecting."" Nikki said Corey. ""I'm retired, not deaf."" Laurie replied. 

""Mom, are you sure you want to take all of this with you?"" Corey asked. ""There's enough room at my new place. Alright let's keep it moving. There's only a couple left."" Laurie said. Corey rolled his eyes.  The sound of the doorbell rang. 

""Who's that?"" Laurie asked. Corey shrugged and opened the door. In front of him, stood an almost mirrored image of himself. ""My key's not working."" the man chuckled in front of him. 

The strange man walked into the apartment. ""I'm sorry, do I know you?"" The man asked. 

""Uh. Uh."" Corey struggled to make out words. ""Laurie?!"" he called out while suspiciously looking at Corey. He turned around and saw Laurie who looked to be in shock.

Corey's grip got tighter. ""Where the fuck were you?!"" He stopped. Corey slowly looks around and back at Bobby's lifeless eyes. ""Ahh!"" Corey threw himself off of the body and curled up into a fetus position. ""This can't be real! This can't be real!"" Laurie screamed throwing her back against the wall. 

Nikki slowly stood mortified. The doorbell rang. ""Ugh. Ugh."" Nikki muttered, utterly confused. She turn and walked towards the door. She opened it, and in front of her stood a familiar face. ""My key wasn't working. I'm sorry, do I know you?"" Bobby said walking inside of the apartment. ""Laurie? Didn't tell me we had a guest."" 

Laurie screamed at the top of her lungs and covered her eyes. Corey continued to coddle himself beside the body of his young father. ""What the bloody fuck?"" Nikki gasped. ",papadoor1331

For your father, it was a 2 minutes walk to the vending machine.",JoyFerret,"I barely heard it over the sweet karate action I was watching, but a second knock made its way through an army of karate warriors and into my earholes. I ignored it for a while, not wanting to disrupt the mountains of cheetos carefully built over my nipples, but an hour of knocking was starting to wake mother from her drunken stupor. That would be bad, wow!

I stood, catching as many cheetos as I could on my belly, and sidled over to turn up the volume on the karate box by a few decibels. So sweet. Yet another knock caught my attention, so I reluctantly turned to march to the door, eating some of my cheetos on the way. I looked through the window in the door to see a man looking in. That man looked just like dad! Wow!

I waved and went to take a leak, eating more cheetos on the way. I looked back at the door and compared the face I was seeing to my last crayon drawing of my father on the fridge.  They looked exactly the same! Wow!

After relieving myself in the kitchen bucket, I refilled my belly pile of cheetos and turned my attention back to the window in the door. The man was looking right back and held up a pack of cigarettes. ""That's mom's brand, the one pop left to buy eight or six years ago! Wow!""

I finally decided to open the door, and then I opened it. The man took off pop's fedora and offered me the box of cigarettes. I karate chopped it out of his hand, yelling ""heeya!"" They went flying, right into the front porch pee bucket. Splash! Pee went all over his pants. Haha, wow!

His mouth dropped open, making him look very stupid, and he stupidly looked at the pee bucket. I hadn't emptied it since he left all those eight or something years ago.

""Son. You look a lot different."" I didn't hear any of it over the sweet karate battle inside the house.

""Yeah, well, it's been eight or six years! What did you expect."" He didn't hear any of it, over my cheeto chewing.

""Six or something years? That's impossible, I only left a few minutes ago."" I still couldn't hear him. I reached for the remote control to turn down the volume, but it was really far away so I gave up.

I stepped out onto the porch and slammed the door behind me, really hard, yelling ""heeya!"" The window broke and the karate battle came out through the window. I motioned him over to the driveway, where we could talk. He walked over to the driveway, and I walked back inside, locking the door really hard.

A few hours later, it had begun raining. The porch wasn't covered. He was standing there, soaked, talking at me through the broken window, but I couldn't hear him, sweet karate action was all I cared about. That and belly cheetos. Wow WOW WOW.

For your father, it was a 2 minutes walk to the vending machine.",JoyFerret,"""You wanted the long stem ones, right?"" He opened the door and did a double take. Everything was different, just slightly. Just a little off. The table that was over there was now over there, and that lamp was replaced by that lamp. He laughed. ""This looks great! A little cramped for the three of us, but I love the design. What's the occasion for the surprise?"" He hadn't noticed that his wife was not moving from the doorway, frozen.

""Dad...?"" I knew it was him, of course, but it was the only thing that came out. I had replayed this moment hundreds of times since he disappeared, many different ways, but him not acknowledging it was not one of those ways. He always did surprise me, though, so I shouldn't be, well, surprised. ""Had to wait for the machine to be refilled?""

His smile shifted, like he was concerned, but still thought everything was alright. My mom finally moved. ""Henry!"" She also spoke, apparently. Very loudly. Dad dropped the cigarettes and walked into the couch. He wouldn't have hit it if it was two years ago, when he disappeared, but we moved it back a bit since then. He regained his composure pretty quickly. He hadn't aged much, and wasn't keeping tabs on us. I picked up the cigarettes and tossed them in the trash. My mom was recharging, I guess, because she seemed to freeze in place again. Dad noticed this and turned to me.

""Why'd you throw those out? Does Mom not smoke long stems? I'm not great at cigarette things."" No comment on my haircut, my tattoo, the fact that I grew two feet taller since he last saw me. ""How'd you get so tall?"" Never mind, there it was. ""That better be temporary."" He got another one. I'll give him some credit, I think he's catching on.

""Mom stopped smoking when you left. She did smoke long stems, though, so good call on that. People get taller during puberty, and isn't everything temporary?"" I probably wasn't helping the situation by ignoring the elephant in the room, but Dad didn't even know he was riding it, so he's got it pretty bad too. I should further the plot, though. ""What day is it? I have an assignment.""

""October fourteenth."" He was not wrong. He did leave exactly two years ago.

""What year?"" Probably too obvious, but I'm tired and already lied about having an assignment, so I have to cut to the chase.

""Twenty-fifteen. Or do you want me to say two thousand fifteen?"" He is daft...

""Henry!"" Mom chimed in again, but then chimed out again. Dad turned back to her, saw her still recovering, decided to sit on the couch, and looked back to me. I sat in the chair next to him.

""She doesn't do that."" Dad deduced.

""Now she does."" I really don't want to deal with this. I was doing pretty well. The ""abandoned by my father"" story worked for getting dates, and being able to trace any of my bad behavior to ""lacking a father figure"" really made nothing my fault, which was nice. I looked at Mom, and just shouted at her. ""Mom! Dad's back. Sit down and catch up."" The seemed to melt her. She moved to the other chair and looked at him wide-eyed. I shifted to Dad. ""Dad, you've been gone for two years to the day. I feel like you don't know that. I don't know why, but that's the situation. Mom had her heart broken when you left, finally recovered six-ish months after, picked up a second job because you were gone, and is now really confused and scared. She also has not gone on a date or anything, so you two are technically good on that front. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an assignment to do, or something."" I tried to get out of there. They had catching up to do, or at least he did.",Pretelethal49

The maid? Maintenance Worker?

Well, whoever this was, they obviously knew who I was. I watched as their eyebrows relaxed and their slightly angry facial expression lessened into a sympathetic stare.

Again, who?

“Am I at the right house?” I said to them. Did I seriously forget my own address over a span of a couple minutes? I mean, it was just a trip to the convenience store.

I didn’t get a response. Well, I didn’t get a *verbal* response. It was just that same stare.

I followed up with another question: “Who are you? Did Cheryl get a maid, or…”

“Are you kidding me?” The person said. “You don’t even recognize me? At all?”

“I don’t understand. Are you a maid? Or did you come to… fix our shingles or something?”

He didn’t say anything else, but he was starting to lose balance. The man began to lean on the doorframe with his head hung low, looking at the floor.

“Look if you’re not gonna tell me who you are, can I at least talk to Cheryl?”

That was when he broke. The man toppled to the floor, leaning up against the doorframe with his knees up close to his chest. He was bawling his eyes out, practically unable to breathe. I had to step in. I’d feel bad just staring at him.

“Hey if you need someone to ta—”

“You don’t even know me anymore,” he yelled in between the sobs and the short, pitiful breaths that he made. 

“How can you not know your own son?”

“Wh-What are you talking about? I only have two kids, Allison and Ja—”

“Jacob.”

“Wait, how do you…?”

He took his hand and pointed it towards his chest. 

“It’s been ten years, dad,” the man muttered. “Don’t you understand that?”

“No,” I said. “I was only gone for a couple minutes. I just got some cigs.”

He said again, “It’s been *ten years*, dad.”

*Ten*. *Years*.

“Where’s Cheryl?”

I thought the question would stop him from crying.

“She’s—”

His voice swelled up and he let out a loud wail of pain.

I’m going to be honest, I didn’t know what to do, so I left. I hopped in my car. And I left. If anyone were in my situation, and found a random twenty-something in your house, telling you that they were your son, they would probably do the same thing I did.

It’s not like I’m going to be gone forever.

The convenience store was cold, dirty, and overall unwelcoming. There were coolers lining the walls with alcohol and soft drinks. In the middle of the store, there sat candy, chips, and other knick-knacks. On the side of one of the shelves, I found it. A box of tissues.

Why did you think I left?

After checking out, I sat back down in my car and finally put those cigarettes to good use. A cool, refreshing 30 minutes went by and I finally made it back to my house. This time, he wasn’t out front.

I walked back up the stone path and knocked on the door. Nothing. Knocked again. Nothing. I jiggled the knob. It was unlocked.

*“Well it is my house,”* I thought to myself.

I slowly stepped through the front door and was greeted by the worst smell imaginable. It was so bad, I had a physical reaction to it. Covering my nose, I was looking around, trying to find signs of movement. Nothing. The coast is clear. 

Now it’s time to look around.

Everything looked normal. The same furniture was still there, the walls were still the same color, everything was fine.

Wait. No, it wasn’t. I looked closer at the walls; the pictures. They weren’t our pictures. I didn’t recognize anyone, except for maybe Cheryl, my wife.

I saw (and smelled) something out of my peripheral. It was on the living room couch. I started making my way over there, trying to maintain my distance just in case it was a person or something. It was dark, but I was trying to make out shapes. It was clearly a person lying on the couch, and they were holding a… piece of paper?
It must me him. The guy who was crying earlier. This time, he’s wearing a jacket, pants, and a wide-brimmed hat. 

I’m going to wake him up.
I inched towards him and lightly shook his shoulder. Nothing. I tried again. Nothing. I slowly rose my hand up from his shoulder and was going to nudge his hat, just so I can verify that it was him. My hand grabbed the brim of the hat and started to lift it up.

I screamed. I jumped back.

That wasn’t just a man on that couch, it was the remnants of one. His face and head were no longer there, as they were replaced by maggots and bone. His hand was clutching a piece of paper, or upon closer observation, an image. I used one of my tissues I bought to pick up the image.

It was a family photo of us. We were dressed in all white and we were standing on the beach, smiling at the camera. You could see Allison, Cheryl, Jacob, and, finally, me:

The only one that hadn’t changed.

Apart from that, these are my answers which I hope clear things up :)

1. Nikki is a woman

2. In the first paragraph I wrote ""rattled by my age"", only as a hint that he is aware his daughter looks aged but doesn't say anything else because it is, after all, a dream that Nikki is having. 

3. To clarify: He (the father) knows who Nikki is. And had some shock about her appearance. But he still wants to come home to his family since aged or not, Nikki is still his daughter.

4. After the end of this story, I was trying to imply that the father knew he had been gone, but still is shocked by how much time has gone by-- shown by the presence of his grandchildren and his emotional reaction. ",subtlesneeze

"[WP] You just got a new spaceship, with a perfectly trained crew. Everyone knows what they're supposed to do, what their job is... except you. ""Captain.""",BookWyrm17,"""Sometimes, I wonder just how I got here.  I mean, I know how, just I can't believe it.""

I stood near the rodentine alien, leaning on the railing next to the filtered viewport looking at the world below.  My world was down there, and he'd been kind enough to bring me up to see it.

""So, how did you come to be here, Captain Eiarcu?""  I asked him.

The man shifted.  ""You can call me Remy.""

I nodded, ""Ok, Remy, how?""

He was quiet a long moment.  ""Short version, I escaped from my homeworld.  I was a slave there.""

I made a sound, not sure what sound it was, but by the way his ears started to pin back, there was no way he didn't hear it.

I took another look at him.  A bipedal alien, looked like a walking mouse to me.  Complete with round ears, a pointed and whiskered muzzle, and a thin coat of light brown fur.  He had some scars on his left eye socket, and a metal eye rested in the orbit, moving as he looked around in the silence.  He wore a simple sky-blue shirt, and a leather-like brown coat over that, khakis and sturdy boots.  Other than the tufts of fur on the backs of his hands, he could pass for human from the neck down.  Other than the tail.  It slowly coiled around, bending almost like a rubber hose.  From the tight-knit brows and pinned-back ears, and the tense hunch to his shoulders, it was clear he was nervous.

""Damn...""  Was all I could muster.

""Yeah... When I first hijacked a freighter off world,"" He started back up, staring out the viewport, ""I was exposed to silence for the first time.  They'd remote-stopped the ship, shut off everything.  I saw just how vast space was... how quiet.  It hurt, in a way that felt really good.  I was smitten, you could say.  All my life had been in the warrens, there's always this drone of activity down there. 
 To finally be away from it all...""  He smiled.  ""I was able to get a lifepod up and got away from the freighter before they could finish the scuttling sequence.""

""Wait.""  I asked.  ""Why scuttle it, instead of recapturing you?""

""Because, there are rules.  Escape attempts aren't tolerated.  And I'd already had one second chance.""  He pointed to his prosthetic eye.

""Oh.""

He continued.  ""But I got away just the same.  My world's engine tech is second-to-none.  So when I crashed on another world, I was pretty much stuck.  There's nothing even remotely capable of returning to my homeworld within my lifetime.""

""I'm sorry.""  I said, almost by reflex.

""I'm not.""  He gave a weak, liar's smile.

Another being stepped up to us, a tall blue-furred felinid, with a scorpion tail curled to her back.  At least, from the way her chest was shaped under the silver suit, I assumed she was female.  She spoke to Remy with very feline sounding speech, hisses, growls, and purred resonances.  Remy responded back in the same language, though it was hampered since he couldn't smoothly purr his R sounds like her.  She looked at me for a moment.  Those eyes were weird, five pupils surrounded by purple iris.  She resembled a cheetah, just blue, even down to the 'tear streaks'.  She spoke again, looking briefly to her captain mouse.  He responded, she seemed satisfied with the answer, and left.

""She's interesting.""

He smiled, ""She is.  She's Mel'iska, Medical Officer.""  He looks back.  ""And also my... girlfriend.""

I laughed incredulously.  ""Seriously?""

He nodded.

I took a moment to process that, and he dropped another bomb on me.

""She and the rest of the crew are Prr'lisski.""

""Purr-what?""

""Prr'lisski.  That's their species.""

""How did that happen?""

Remy turned and looked back into the passenger bay of his ship.  ""Mel and I rescued them.  They're lost from their world, too.  If we ever go 'home', it will be to theirs.""

""So are they a good crew?""  I asked.

""Yes.""  He said, nodding.  ""Mel is an amazing doctor, no matter the species. Ka'zen is an ace pilot.  Engineer, she can practically talk to the machinery.  And Warden is like an army of one.""

I blinked. ""Engineer and Warden?  They don't have names?""

Remy nodded.  ""I can't pronounce Engineer's name, it uses a sound I can't make.  And Warden's never given what his name was.  Part of being a Warden is no longer having a sense of self or something like that.""  He sighed, ""Already Ka'zen and Engie's cub is taking after both of them.""

I declined to comment on that.  ""So you're captain because you had the ship and needed a crew.""

He nodded again, ""At first.  But we're more like a family now than a crew.  I managed to hold the ship together until they joined.""  he looks down, ""Somehow, I'm not just Captain, but their 'Pride Roarer' as well.  Me.  Sometimes afraid of my own shadow, a leader and part savior.  I just repaired computers back home.  Now look at me.""

I felt bad for the guy suddenly.  It looked like he'd realized he was being something he didn't know how to be.  He looked lost and scared. 

""You've done right so far, Captain.""  A voice purred.  Mel had returned, and hugged Remy to her.  ""We all know you weren't trained how to lead.  But you've been doing a great job.  You trust us to do what we do, and inspire us.""  She pressed her nose to his.  ""You'll always be our captain, and we'll always be your crew.""

I excused myself from their little moment, and bumped into Engineer.  She was a different build from Mel, but she shared the features of their species, I guess.  She spoke my language well enough, and set me up to return back to the planet, where I'd been when I left.

I looked up and wondered just how he got here without really knowing how to command a ship.  But he somehow managed.  I saw a little flash of light in the sky, and assumed they were underway to their next destination.

"[WP] ""You don't understand!"" She laughed. The little girl, dressed in rags and bare feet, danced through the streets. ""I'm the richest person alive.""",BookWyrm17,"I am not a wealthy man.

Sure, I'm middle class - I have most of the things I need, and certainly to comfortable excess. I live in economic privilege, a class yet above and below other classes. I have all the money I need, and couldn't ask for more. I earn my keep, and I keep what I earn - but I never considered myself to be wealthy. I was never rich, so to speak, and I was never full.

How do you define wealth, then, if not by monetary standards? I thought it to be through kinship. Connections with others, and peace with them. The hurricane within begged for a harmony out there, beyond the edge. Without friendship, I thought it impossible to feel at true harmony.

I've had friends - they've poked in and out of my life, catching and slipping them like a metallurgy slate running through sand. Some catch gems, diamonds, gold - and grow rich and full; I was not one of them. Some have something to bring home with them, and keep forever; still, not me. Empty is not quite how I'd describe it - my life was more like a glass half full. You never knew how to look at it. Was it really half full, or was it half empty?

I was an unfinished man, failing to make peace with himself. Under the veil of my nice suits and pleasant drapery, the cracks break through and you can see my true colors - that much I will admit. Stark blacks, against hot whites, I always imagined. A royal violet against a combatant orange.

Art and music never seemed to top it off, either. Writing, listening, painting, viewing. At the end of the day, I always looked around my nice house, with my plentiful, nice things, and my nice family, and wondered if there was something more I could capture with this reef of mine. There wasn't.

It's because of all this that I collapsed that day, losing my grip on everything - my belongings, my mind - and weeping relentlessly when I met her.

On a dull Monday afternoon after an early northern shower, I'd been minding my own business down the midtown street until she caught my eye, adjacent an alley that reeked of death and waste. She had barely any clothes - only what could service you to cover you up in public - or belongings; not even shoes to protect her muddy, callus-ridden feet. I could say she was homeless, or destitute, or in abject poverty, but it wouldn't do the sight service. She didn't even have a hacky-sack with some essentials over her shoulder, or a blanket with which to cover herself at night; she was not like the others one bit.

And there she was, looking directly at me, with a funny, gleeful, toothless grin. ""What say you, peasant?"" she asked with such a smile that could make anyone - *anyone* - tremble.

""Pardon?"" At first, I was offended. I stammered back, looked her up and down, and checked myself to see if something was wrong with - *no, look at her!* I scoffed in amusement.

""You don't understand,"" she said, with a boisterous laugh. ""I'm the richest person alive!"" She then stood up and laughed gleefully again.

""Explain.""

""Do I need to?"" she pushed. I grew more anxious as she spoke.

""Yes,"" I said cautiously. ""What do you have, what *could* you have, that I don't?""

""That's easy,"" she said with that grin. It shook me within and without. ""I have myself, and that's all I need. Peace and harmony.""

""You've no money! No wealth!"" I cried. ""And, from what I can tell from this gathering, no friends!"" I bluffed pretty hard on that one. I wasn't sure if it was going to work.

It looked like she just couldn't stop smiling. ""Who needs that? I've got *myself*. I know who I am; I know what I am; I know what I want.""

""And what do you want?""

""Nothing!"" she shouted triumphantly, clasping a fist. ""Nothing more!""

I was horrified. My throat swelled up, choking my words. ""How? How did this - how is it - how?"" Every instinct that told me this was just some city girl just talking crazy - perhaps she was a soapboxer who lived just up the street - rang in my head. I ignored them all. Every gut feeling that told me this was somehow a ruse ticked at my spine, running all the way up to my head and dazing me. I disregarded them and continued. I *had* to know.

""I told you already,"" she said. ""I have what you want - maybe what you will never have: harmony within. Peace with myself.""

Before I could respond, she was gone. I blinked and, without sound, without warning, there was no trace. Only the hollow eyes of men seated by trash barrels and the sidewalk, gazing upon me in perplexion and curiosity - but it was a cautious one, a fearful one - without speech. The world carried on, even when I couldn't.

Almost immediately after my thought, she replied, ""happiness"".

That's when I became sad. 

She taunted me. She flaunted her poverty, her bare feet, her ripped clothes dragging stands not yet torn or dissolved. She smiled through her dirt darkened face. I thought she was going to ask me why I'm sad.  She just kept dancing circles around me. 

""I'm sad, can't you see! ?"" I couldn't hold it in. I had to say something. 

""Because your poor"" she had the nerve to say to me, to me! Me in my new shined boots, my two piece suit, my slicked hair. 

""I'm not poor, I clarified."" I just thought I could get some easy money off her. 

""You just thought you could get easy money off me. "" she said as if reading my mind. Of course I denied it. 

""No! No. Noooo. That's not what i was thinking. "" But it was. So I couldn't think of what to say next. I left my mouth hanging like an idiot.

""Poor people. All the same. "" she mocked. 

""I'm not poor! "" I didn't want her to think I was poor. I don't like when people think I'm poor. 

""You're poor. But I was just like you. Poor you. Poor people. You'll never be rich, never that rich, never like this. La la la  "" The audacity. I could change her life with the money I had, but here she is high and mighty. 

""Go away"" I had enough. 

""Your poor is pitiful. My poor is pouring!"" 

""What are you saying? "" I was walking away at this point. 

She was skipping and following me. ""Here. I'll make you rich""

""That's it. I've had it up to here with you! "" in a mad rage I put my hands on her neck and suddenly happiness poured through my hands into my heart and I was shaking uncontrollably. 

""Richness"" she said, running away. 

I started dancing and twirling, ruling the world without a care about being fired today. I kicked off my shoes, untied my tie, did a cartwheel across the street and sped past the paperboy. I tripped and broke my teeth and felt nothing and kept running uphill until I met a couple arguing and huffing and puffing at each other. ""I'm reeeeeeeeeeech!"" I told them. ""Your poor..""

"" We are poor? "" they asked befuddled.""look at you, bum."" They scoffed. 

""My riches are about to bless your poor poor souls. "" I said through my broken teeth. ",phunnypunny

""I'm the richest person alive.""",BookWyrm17,"“It is easier that a camel should pass through an eye of a needle, than a wealthy man enter the kingdom of heaven.” The small girl, dressed in rags and with no shoes on her feet, was certainly no older than seven years of age. Something about the articulate and dignified way she spoke stopped the hurried business man cold.

She sat under one of the few trees that grew along the sidewalk, smiling from ear to ear. Fall leaves scattered all around her, even though it was early spring.

“Where are your parents?” The business man had been in a hurry before, in such a hurry to go to a job that brought him and others misery, why? He found he no longer understood, or that maybe he had never truly known in the first place.

The girl giggled, “It’s very important to you I have parents, that parents are something I need?” The wind suddenly swirled around her, though there was no gust of wind to explain the movement.

“Well,” The business man didn’t really know what to say to this girl, “Somebody’s got to be taking care of you... I mean it’s not right, a kid living on the street.”

“Now you see, you don’t understand!”
“What don’t I understand?”
“Do you work to live, or live to work?”
“I... need money, to live. So do you. That’s why I wanted to know if you had parents, I needed to know if someone was taking care of you.”

The business man found he had never cared as much about anything else. He had done well at school because that’s what others had wanted for him, he had strives to get a well paying job because -—other people— told him that’s what he wanted. He had never thought to ask —himself— what he wanted... “Why...” he wondered aloud, “Why did I ever want to be rich?”

“I’m the richest person alive!” The girl giggled, the fall leaves now swirling in an ever wider circle around the girl, beginning to envelop the area around the business man as well. “I’m rich because I’m happy, you should never be happy —because— you’re rich!”

The little girl and the business man were now surrounded by the autumn leaves, but neither payed them any mind.

Then, in a blink, the girl was gone. 

The leaves disappeared along with her.

The business man stood alone, at the base of a tree. Stopping to appreciate the spring time sprouting of flowers and new leaves.

But, there was continued resistance by unknown armed parties.  We had used our weapons of mass destruction to eliminate formal and government faction armies entirely.  We didn't want to use them again.  However, we had to get this resistance eliminated.  Our projector shields, both large and small used a lot of energy,  Personal shields sometimes had to be dropped for functionality.  That was when many of my comrades were killed.  

We wanted one particular resistance fighter badly, as he had killed many.  He always left a metal token, which we pondered, but we decided it was his name:  300 Win Mag.

The entire Earth has become a resistance group and the Aliens have no concept of Guerrilla Warfare.",mcgrathc09,"""It has to have been another maintenance issue,"" stated Zorlak, ""Shuttles that are properly maintained do not just explode.""

I considered this.  Our invasion of the paltry world known as Earth had gone very well initially.  We had attacked the puny creatures that occupied this world and destroyed their armies in a matter of hours.  When we landed we had taken many of the survivors as slaves and had begun the systematic process of draining the world of all of its resources, but there had been problems.

The world was laced with something that was causing a string of massive catastrophic maintenance failures.  So far 15 shuttles had exploded, 4 mining rigs, and somehow a reactor had detonated in the command ship and had annihilated it and its entire crew.  Its debris had scattered all over the northern hemisphere.  Only the super hardened frame had allowed the secondary reactor and jump drive to survive, though they had no means of transporting them off world.  

""But we are off the planet now,"" I retorted glancing over at Zubob who sat quietly.  That was another thing, Zubob and many of my fellows had contracted some terrible sickness on the most vile planet.  Even now he would barely respond to my words and his skin had adopted an almost rubbery sheen.  

""I don't see how that matters,"" replied Zorlak shaking his head, ""Zubob here agrees with me its a problem.""

""Go Homeworld,"" stated Zubob.  I pitied him, the infection should have shown up on the scanners but in one of his fits, Dernak had smashed every single medical scanner on the ship.  I looked at the room full of my countryman, there were dozens, standing quietly, their tentacles limp, like rope, hanging at their sides.  I wept for what had happened to them on that terrible world.

Shock, its all it could have been.

""We will be back at the home world soon,"" replied Zorlak, taking one of Drosh's tentacles, which hung green and limp, only the metal ring that he had taken to wearing after his assault party had ventured deep into a human mine to find a pocket of resources.  That mission had bothered him, the unit had gone deep into the earth and while their weapons had all been totally discharged none of them had responded intelligibly to any efforts to debrief them.

""Go Homeworld,"" stated Drosh, as I noticed that one of his eyes was missing.  Poor Drosh.  

'Yes;, I thought, 'our beloved homeworld was all that could possibly salve the souls of my countryman.'  I nodded to Zorlak who was looking strange as well.  His tentacles had also become limp in just the last few moments.  Perhaps the sickness would take me before we got home.  I shuddered at the thought but was mindful that even if they could not longer speak my fellows still had some of their wits about them.  

After all, before we had left they had spent two fully days taking the ample supplies of uranium and plutonium and loading it onto our mining ship.  It had been easy to load after we realized that the humans stored them on top of large rockets.  Drosh had been a man on a mission, and his team had spent days loading the supplies.

Strange that they hadn't used the auto loaders.

But it was of no matter.  The home world was nearby and as soon as they landed at the capitol the story of Earth could be told and wiser minds would determine what to do.  Looking around I smiled.  Zorlak was inputting our landing time on all of the materials that we had stolen where big flashing red letters were counting down in the human language.    

It would be glorious.  ",tosser1579
"[WP] Years ago, Aliens invaded earth to take its resources. But, there are two problems. The entire Earth has become a resistance group and the Aliens have no concept of Guerrilla Warfare.",mcgrathc09,"Ja'e sat at her post in the command center, hearing the not-too-distant sound of the humans projectile weapons. Her fourteen fingers were interlaced together, her face and body were tense, and she was poised in a particular way that would show her frustration to other members of her species. Ja'e sat without moving, for she knew the futility of action at this point. 

Instead, Ja'e let her mind wander, taking in the unremarkable surroundings of the command center - a central office in a standard prefabricated structure for routine invasions. Her mundane surroundings contrasted her extraordinary circumstances, and her mind pondered how she had come to this point. 

By any records in fleet history, by all of her previous experience, this had been an unremarkable start to an invasion. Standard surprise attack, standard resistance by the indigenous military, standard victory over the planet's military, standard subjugation of the indigenous. The humans had used their military force on each other before, that much was obvious, but Ja'e had noticed a subtle difference in their tactics. It barely caught her attention during a conflict in the western deserts of the planet's largest continent, but it was now the reason she sat in the command center, waiting for defeat.

The way one conducted an invasion had been a scientific and engineered thing at first, but as the millennia passed it had evolved. Ja'e was known among her people as being skilled in the art of subjugation and genocide, but the humans had proven to be a very resistant medium. 

She had already gone through the usual routine - defeat the military force to remove the capability of resistance, parade their military through their regional capitals, publicly execute political leaders, burn the large cities, destroy major industry and infrastructure, kill a sizable fraction of the population, and start extracting resources while the troops hunted down the remaining indigenous. Standard stuff, really. She'd hit a snag when attempting the last point, though.

Raiding platoons had gone into the rural areas, and wouldn't return. Smaller scouting groups had followed, with only a few survivors ever returning. The stories they told were beyond strange, they were unheard of. The humans deployed thousands of minuscule groups to do micro-raids on her forces. At first, it was considered a nuisance and nothing more. 

Then the humans had raided a store of leftover hydrocarbons, and had set a regional command center aflame with devastating results. Then they did it again, and again, and again. Within a few weeks the humans had burnt the link between her and her forces, crippling her military hierarchy and completely halting the invasion. Informal and incomplete delivered to her in person said that the invasion force was being defeated by thousands of surprise raids that vanished the moment they were detected. 

The last report had come in a few days ago, and then her personal command center had been attacked earlier this morning. Her personal guard was being eliminated, and soon she would be too. At this though, Ja'e took a long deep breath. As she did so, the door to her office exploded. 

In walked five humans clad in military garb. They noticed her immediately, then seeing her office was empty otherwise. The humans ranged from short to tall, ebony to alabaster, younger to older, skinny to muscular, but all were staring at her. Four of them gave deference to the fifth, a tall individual of medium-dark complexion, who was clearly their leader. Ja'e briefly thought it was remarkable how such a diverse species could develop nuclear weapons without an intraspecies nuclear war. She rose from her desk, poised with dignity. Around her neck was a universal translator calibrated for a variety of local languages. If nothing else, Ja'e wished to learn the tactics of this species, to allow her a new way to develop her art. 

Ja'e began speaking an ancient acknowledgment of defeat, which is when the leader shot and killed her.",metalmagician

Reverend Nahr'zul,


I write to you in continuation of our earlier success on Terra. 


The First contact was as expected, we met with heavy resistance from the dominant species of this planet. They call themselves 'humans'. They are a sentient species of bipeds (Ref: MS/Report/Terra/=23) 

Surprisingly they had quite advanced weaponry for their level of technological advancement, they launched several nuclear weapons before we entered their atmosphere. Most of them were deflected by our energy shields. We lost two class C ships to these weapons (Details of the Ships and Casualties Annexed). Rest of the fleet managed to enter the atmosphere and immediately on entry we were engaged by several small aircraft armed with explosive missiles, they were once again unsuccessful in disarming the energy shields and they were easily shot down with energy beams.


We landed the main fleet (co-ordinates have already been beamed to AXC45) and our land forces began their expedition towards the Lake Superior as the locals have named it. Here we met stiff resistance from the humans. They primarily used armored land vehicles armed with metallic and explosive propulsion arms and missiles. Though they managed to destroy 18 rovers(details annexed), we were able to inflict extraordinary casualties on them. 


They tried several formations and battle tactics and I have to admit, some of them were brilliant in their simplicity. For example, Rover No. MCT8*0├╞ was destroyed by ramming an armored vehicle at it as they found that the vehicle itself was not affected by the energy shield. 

In spite of these minor set backs, we had great success initially. The humans finally began to retreat and take up defensive positions. But however, since then we have lost 30 rovers and over 7000 soldiers(all details annexed). The humans are an enemy unlike any we have seen till now. 


They do not fight like soldiers, they do not fight like animals, they fight like cowards, yet, the losses on our side have been phenomenal. When Rover No. MCT69╫• was collecting the Liquid of Life, one human managed to swim up to the suction nozzle and slip an explosive through the intake tube, which caused the internal pressurized chambers to explode and instantly killed the entire crew of the rover and damaged the rover beyond repair. In the case of Rover No. LOT┌┼ the humans managed to cover themselves in some variety of insulated suits and approach the rover. Then they proceeded to climb the rover and activated the hatch manually. As you are aware, in the LOT series, the hatch release immediately resets the air intake to the compressors and thereby the entire crew suffocated due to the excess Oxygen in the Terran atmosphere. The humans then managed to use the bio-authorization of the dead crew members to steal the rover. 

They have also managed to learn that the atmosphere is toxic to our soldiers. They keep devising hilariously competent ways to disable or destroy the breathing apparatus of our soldiers. Capt. Fork'rul, II Squad, IV Pride was killed when a human hurled a rock at his Nitro Tank from behind when he was chasing a retreating group of soldiers. The tank developed a leak and he suffocated before he could reach the pod. He was a decorated soldier who had seen engagement in 14 planets. We have since adjusted the individual energy shields to block rocks as well. Red-Wing Pilot Fork'wah Il'zar, Kra'zan Medal - II, III Squad, I Pride was killed when he was searching for the divers who were attempting to slip explosives into his rover. One of the humans simply poured, what was later learnt to be a coloring liquid at the visual receptors. Though the Pilot was able to recover his vision, the liquid had clogged his breathing apparatus and he suffocated to death. They stripped him completely of his belongings and sent back his body absolutely naked. They proceeded to use the weaponry found on his person against the rest of his crew and successfully eliminated the entire crew and they stripped them naked as well. Since this incident, they have successfully salvaged a large amount of weaponry which they have turned against us.

We learnt that they have also managed to bypass the bio-activation requirements in the rovers that they have hijacked from us and have managed to activate the manual override of the weapons. They used those weapons against our ships and many of our ships are now damaged beyond repair and Pride IX has been hijacked by the humans completely and they have managed to once again activate manual override. 

We are now left with 1600 troops, 4 active rovers and 2 semi-active rovers and 4 Class A Pride ships and 17 Class C ships. They have managed to ground both our destroyers. I have searched every available database but I am unable to find any counters for their unconventional warfare. Most of the things they do appear extremely juvenile to the point of hilarity, but those schemes end up costing us valuable lives.

We have managed to collect only 2 units of the Liquid of Life thus far. 

Request : to disengage.

Advise : Don't send further expeditions to Terra.

09.15.25 - Rami Waraich - Final Message (Recovered on site[transcribed by: @:F!-7161-1-2r-0])

The war rages, a thick waft of fresh blood in every direction. After two months of fighting, only a few of us still stand staring at our decimated species. The sum of human history and culture if not gone forever a remnant of the past. We will fight as long as we stand. There is no where to retreat to. There is no option for surrender, no forum for diplomacy. The hairs on our spines stiff as rock as we bite and claw from the corner we’ve been backed into.

They’ve destroyed all of our cities, and our civilization, but there is one spark of humanity so deep rooted in us, so engrained in our being, that it will take absolute extinction to extinguish, war… and death… We’ve killed each other since the dawn of our kind. There’s nothing we know quite as well as the thousand yard stare while squeezing a knife grip with dried mud caked knuckles. Look into my eyes demons from the great void. Your eyes may be the last I see, but I will die looking into yours with grace and fire. I’ve been ready. We’ve been ready. It is a worthy life for our kind to pledge into annihilation for glory, self preservation and destruction. You will know us.

This is my final message; company comms are down. I hope you find this, and I hope this works… 

(Transcription failure, audio ‘muddled'). 

There is no reason to think we could turn this around, yet I feel confident. There is no reason to be at ease, yet I feel calm. I am about to die, but I am alive. There are not many of us left, but we will win. We will win now. War is all I’ve ever known, and although I face an enemy magnitudes stronger than the sum of our best parts, I know we will win.

The Art of War, as it were, is an art, not a science. It is a very nuanced endeavor. Intelligence employed yields victory, greater intelligence that is, which is why it is ironic indeed that we will overcome. The art of war, “In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity”. There are several tried and true facets of war, dynamics of oppositions, patterns of conflict, that repeat, over and over and over. Hundreds, thousands and I’m sure even millions of years in frequency these same patterns can play out, I’m sure. 

They are smart enough to predict what is coming, but they are too comfortable at the moment. They harvest our planet and silos, after, seemingly having already accomplished the destruction of the dominant force. They are also far more intelligent, and better equipped to combat us. If they were the cat we must feel like a ball to them they just paw around. However, that ball can just as easily swing around and hit them in the face, and they are too comfortable to see it coming.

When you under estimate an adversary you only weaken yourself. There is no scenario where the condescender benefits from being superior. If only, to appear to be, for a limited time. Enough time, in this case, to document a fuckin’ diary about it waiting to initiate the final deed… 

(audio voice failure: Local, Physical Contact, Wood/Organic on Wood/Organic)

I can’t specify the plan in this message, there is still time for it to be intercepted by the enemy and appropriate counter measures taken, but what I can say is that they will not see it coming. I almost want to give a hint, but I can’t…

The Art of War teaches us that you don’t only face an enemy, but also an environment and a scenario. Those are really the three things you face; an opponent, a battlefield and a predicament. They’ve written us off. Their scouts no longer search buildings or communities, they just harvest and mine. We are almost invisible to them at this point. Which is a remarkable plunder from our perspective but I suppose it makes sense. They’re so far advanced from us why would they even, at this stage, consider our plots. It’s like our movements must be as clear to them as a sports analyst with omnipresent fuckin’ 1600 frames per second kind of awareness.

There is nothing left to say. This is the final stage, the last stand. There is nothing left they can do, so I believe. I’m so excited, overwhelmed, I feel a tingling sensation rippling down from Alexander the Great. Conquering is our eternal destiny. This is it, we’ve done it. I love you, I wish I could be there with you and you’re welcome.

"[WP] While preparing for a wedding a man attempts to tie his necktie with an Eldredge Knot, he accidently ties an Eldritch Knot.",BookOfPythia,"""You know I hate cliches, but this is honestly the happiest day of my life."" That's what Jim said to me that day, and I believed him. We'd been friends for twelve years and if there was one thing I could count on with him, it was his honesty. We'd grown up in the same town and by a twist of fate eventually ended up being roommates in college, along with someone else, a bit of a loner named Simon.

""I've honestly never worn a tie before, I'm still trying to work this out..."" Simon, standing just behind the two of us bemoaned, staring at the twin ends of his necktie with a befuddled expression. His skin was as pale as it had ever been, but with the familiar awkward patches of rose-red on his rounded cheeks and small, orb-like nose. He was certainly the strangest of the three of us and under different circumstances we might not have been friends, but by then we had been through so much together that I couldn't imagine it any other way at this point. It was a given that Jim would be the one to get married first. He'd met his girl that first year of college and she'd gotten her hooks into him the moment she found out he was pre-med. As much as it hurt Simon and I to admit it, we saw from the beginning what she really was. 

For years we'd periodically try to bring up the subject, but each time Jim was insistent that he knew better, and after awhile picking open that scab became increasingly taboo. It seemed impossible that we should try to bring it up today of all days, but after talking to each other beforehand, Simon and I had resolved one last time to try and save our friend. So first chance we had, we herded Jim away from the gathering of everyone's friends and relatives, fighting back the stones in our stomachs and lumps in our throats to try and deliver our friend one final time. 

""Listen, I know what you guys are really trying to do, and I want to say something first."" He had said as soon as we'd found a room to be alone in. From his expression, he'd been anticipating this moment from the day he formally invited us to be his groomsmen. ""I love you guys, and I get it. I'm moving forward with my life, and you guys are scared things are going to change, that we won't see each other anymore, but Molly isn't the person you think she is, you were wrong about her back when we met and you're still wrong now."" His words hung in the air awkwardly, ushering in a painful silence. How had he misunderstood us so badly? How many times had we tried to show him the patterns of behavior in their relationship? The way she isolated him, the way she used his success for her own gain. It was painful to watch, especially for those of us that had watched it all unfold from the start.

""I'm serious guys, I can't be doing this right. I mean, I only looked at the instructions on Wikihow like twice, so I'm not really confident I know what I'm doing."" Simon finally broke the silence, his tie now a jumble of strange folds, twists, and knots. He let out a forced guffaw, clearly trying to break the tension at his own expense, a self-deprecating sense of humor we'd come to love from him. He was the jokster of our trio to be sure, but this wasn't the time for jokes. My expression must have given me away, because I saw it immediately mirrored in Jim's face. A sternness, an ardent and determined look I'd seen before in countless fights over the years. Between us I could feel the old wound peeling away, and from it fresh anger would soon flow.
I remember the conversation now  only in bits and pieces.

""You were never happy for us, and I can't tell you how many times she's been right about you! You know she told me you'd pull this today, too? I told her she was wrong, but deep down I believed her."" He pressed his fingers to his temples and turned away from us, I remember him leaning against the windowsill to stare at the congregation of cars outside the chapel. I pleaded with him, calmly at first, but our tempers continued to flare. We were like that, him and I, always butting heads in our equally matched stubbornness.

""Guys?"" Simon spoke out again, but we barely heard him over the sound of our own self-interest. ""Something's...something's really wrong."" He tried again to get our attention, but it wasn't until we felt the rumble beneath our feet that we finally noticed what had happened. Throughout our fighting he had been twisting and tying and knotting and un-knotting the loop of cloth around his neck, and what had become of it defied explanation. The angles and curves of the striped necktie at once looked unnatural and grim. Sharp edges blurred into sanguine forms, like twisted bodies in deathlike struggle. The shapes and distances warped and swayed, utterly non-euclidian in their formations and the tie seemed all at once to be much larger and longer than it had ever been before.  My eyes began to quiver even as I looked upon it and I could hear Jim behind me stumble into a hat rack as he attempted to avert his eyes.

I could barely open my mouth to scream before it all began to fall apart. The languid, flowing fabric began to weave around Simon, the room about us pulling further apart and crushing everything in it together in a maddening chaos. I could not tell when the sky outside turned black, but it was the last thing I noticed before my sight exploded into a flash of conflagrate darkness. I could hear screams, and the choked gurgles of Simon's windpipe slowly crushing itself and something else. Something emerging from his chest, from his whole being and filling the room. A heretical choir of cries and blasphemous invocations rose in hellion screams above the rattling din of the chapel's constant bone-like quaking. My final thoughts, a final moment of clarity before madness devoured my sanity like the shrimp cocktail that we'd enjoyed only hours prior. As the thing filling the room pressed us against the shrinking space we occupied between reality and this small annex of a wedding chapel, I couldn't help but regret it.

It's true. He's been working at it for a solid ten minutes, diagrams laid out in front of him, and it still doesn't look even slightly like the pictures.

Harry, twenty-three and nearly bald, looks up from his phone. ""You're doing it wrong. You... I don't even *know* how you managed to screw up that badly.""

A shrug in response. Arnold keeps toying at the tie. ""You know, I would have thought that something else would be difficult when getting married. You know... saying my vows perfectly, in front of dozens of people. Or finding a suit that actually fits. Or talking to my mother-in-law. But it turns out the main roadblock is a *tie*.""

Another groomsman, Trent, sighs and stands up. He tends to dress slobby, but his parents were fairly strict when he lived at home. If anyone could tie a knot - it's him. 

Well, anybody in that room, specifically.

""I'm not sure what you've done here. Arnold... I can't even take it off. It's like it keeps tying more knots in itself whenever I try to take some out. Like one of those finger toy things.""

*freeeeeeedooom*

A beat.

""Did anyone else-""

""Hear a creepy, nearly-silent voice murmur 'freedom'?"" Cody, still typing away at his laptop. For all intents and purposes, not in the room. Unless you want his seat.

""Yeah, that,"" finishes Arnold.

""Nope."" Cody cracks his neck. ""But that would be really weird, I have to say.""

The other groomsmen nod. None of them meet eye contact with Arnold.

None of them meet eye contact with Arnold because they aren't there. 

To be more specific, because Arnold isn't *there*, and they aren't *here*. Here, which appears to be a ballroom designed by someone who spent years of their lives learning how to make sewers in movies. Here, which is not the room Arnold was in mere seconds ago, and not one he recognizes.

Here, which is *another damn roadblock in getting married!*

There's nobody in front of him, so Arnold turns around, only to stumble backwards, suppressing a shout.

There, in all its glory, is a ten-foot-tall humanoid spider *thing* with fangs the size of Arnolds hand. None are symmetrical and not one is actually straight; each one bends and winds and swirls along its entire length. The only similarity is that each appears to be razor sharp.

And the legs... Arnold avoids looking at the legs.

*""Huuuuman... you have... summoned me.""*

""Damn it, MarxIa, I thought we were over this! And cut the crap. I know you screwed with my tie!"" 

*""Fine, Arny. But... an eldritch bond is not so easily broken. I wove myself into that tie, and you knotted it. You* tied the knot, *Arny. You're mine now.""*

""Let me guess. Your slithering half-wolf-half-mongoose 'boyfriend' left you again. This can't keep happening every few months. I have a life, MarxIa! And you're *not* a part of it.""

*""I could eat you right now, boyyy. Watch your tongue.""*

""Yeah, right. Now how do I get out of here? My wedding starts in an hour, and I can't be late.""

The creature groans, as much as she is capable of doing so. *""Take off the tie, and you'll be transported back. But Arnold... you know, we could have had a wonderful life-""*

""Welcome back to the land of the living, Arnold. Glad you could join us."" Cody doesn't even look up from his computer.

""I, er, okay."" Arnold glances around the room. Not a single person is paying the least attention to him.

And, he realizes after a moment, his tie is gone.

We Secure. We Contain. We Protect. 

The words have been enough for the last 150 years. I don't need to regale you with tales of the horrors we have contained, stopped or faced.  Each of you has experienced such a story first hand, beaten it, and moved on - or moved on as much as humanly possible. You have protected mankind from horrors, but more importantly, you have protected them from even being aware that such monsters exist.

No longer. 

This so-called ""Wizarding World"" has come out in the open, they have taken over TV channels, they have the capability to enslave any human - and high ranking politicians are already compromised. How they have managed to stay hidden and for how long is irrelevant. What matters is that they are here now. These wizards terrorize cities, while generals and presidents are under their control so no large scale resistance is possible. Of course, humans fight alone, in small pockets and militias. Thanks to their valiant efforts we are surviving for now. But we need to be winning. We cannot Secure this. We cannot Contain this. We have failed to Protect already. 

And now, for the first time, We must Fight. 

You have operated in the shadows for all these years for the good of mankind. But now we must leave these shadows behind and fight the enemy in the open. We will use whatever, and I mean whatever, means necessary to fight.  Already, certain artifacts are being sedated and positioned. The large scale plan is in motion, and your local administrators will inform you of your part in it. Whether it be handling a high-risk creature or simply waiting in reserve, you are vital to the SCP, and to humanity. 

And so I ask you, not as your boss, but as a fellow human being to take up arms, to stop hiding, to not go quiet into the gentle night, to fight. 

We Secure. We Contain. We Protect. And now we Fight.

-The Administrator. ",XcessiveSmash

He had no idea who these muggles were, or why they had the audacity to openly attack his order, all he knew was that they were many, they were everywhere and that with technology that straddled the line of magic and machinery, they were being beaten back time after time after time until Hogwarts, the birthplace of his regime, and the last of his forces remained.

It had all started so well, the people of the world were quick to take the knee under his rule barring some minor set-backs, some covens killed here, a sabotage there but nothing he couldn't overcome but as quickly, arguably quicker, as it had started, his rule succumbed to a well armed and overly prepared insurgency that struck without warning or reason that killed or captured all in their wake-

The noises stopped, they were here behind the door, his last line of defence.

Shrapnel and smoke filled the chamber as a hail of canisters were flung into the room and bounced harmlessly as spells and curses were flung back in return to the sound of pained screams as they found their mark, suddenly the canisters exploded, some into balls of blinding light and deafening sound and others into balls of fire and death.

In the ensuing confusion, he did not notice the second volley, canisters that belched thick green smoke, until it was too late and his once sharp mind sheathed by the potent narcotics now running through his bloodstream, in his last moments of consciousness he could see his attackers, a misshapen circle with three spikes pointing into it on their chests with a label underneath.

M-T-F.

When he came to, the first this Voldemort noticed was the change of scenery, the room was a mixture of glaring whites and creams covered the sparsely decorated room and the cameras in all of the room corners, he opened his mouth to gasp in a mixture of confusion, anger and for the first time in his life, fear but couldn't, due to a muzzle around with mouth that for all of his attempts he could not get off.

After a few minutes of frantically clawing a the muzzle, a voice filled the cell, calm and feminine.

17:32 - Communications intercepted from local payphones indicate anomalous activity in London area. Agents Walker and McDonough are sent to investigate.

17:35 - Agents Walker and McDonough make contact with source of anomalous activity, several hostile unidentified ""Type Green"" reality benders. Agent McDonough is killed in action during the ensuing firefight

17:36 - MTF Pi-1 (""City Slickers"") is deployed to neutralize hostile threat and minimize civilian casualties.

17:42 - MTF Pi-1 arrives on-site. Contact is made with hostile forces.

17:45 - Majority of hostile force neutralized, remaining hostiles (5) captured. 

17:46 - MTF Pi-1 encounters GOC forces in the area. Agreement made in field to avoid hostilities: 3 of the captured hostiles are transferred to GOC custody.

17:51 - Amnestics applied to all civilian witnesses with minimal difficulty.

18:00 - MTF Pi-1 and captured hostiles extracted without incident.

Notes:

Interrogation of captured hostiles revealed the presence of multiple groups of reality benders that have remained unknown to Foundation personnel and humanity at large until this date. Investigation into GOI-4582 (""Death Eaters"") and GOI-4583 (""Ministry of Magic"") by MTF Mu-12 (""Wiz Kids"") is ongoing.

**Addendum 3/5/95:** 

Following Incident-2395, Foundation field assets are advised to treat any and all members of both GOI-4582 and GOI-4583 as hostile and extremely dangerous. Capture and containment remains the first priority, but subjects may be terminated at field assets' discretion. Investigation into the termination of POI-7926 is to continue as a class 3 priority.

Many people lay in the streets, some encased in ice, others in contorted poses. Definitely dead. Death eaters hovering around, sort of giving that “let’s look around one more time to see if there is anyone left alive” look. From a distance a figure in a military-esque jacket walks relatively calmly to the group. The casual nature of the mans walk stirred curiousity with Voldemort. “Another fool to give us his life”, he strained in his hoarse voice. The man walks up with an envelope and extends it as he gets within arms reach of Voldemort. 

“Here is our surrender, written and signed inside this envolope”. Voldemort amusingly opens the envelope, not really caring whether the surrender came on paper or if he even wanted to let them surrender. As the final loop of the clasp mechanism was pulled, a large 8X11 photo fell from the envelope. 

“What is this picture, of a figure in a forest. Is this some sort of joke. People with masks?” He examines the face of the figure and noticed it looks a bit like his own but more hideous, with a disproportionately large jaw, and eyes devoid of pigment.”

“Oh sorry, that must have been in the envelope, ignore that.” The man with the military jacket on. 

“Anyway, my lord, I’ll be on my way. I’d hate to get in the way of your slaughtering.... please proceed.”

The few death eaters noticed the man did not pick up the photo. The held it up to examine it themselves.

“By your leave, oh I’ll-fated one...” the man turned as a blur stride by him....

“You poor fools...”

After all this time. All those sacrifices, all this suffering. He had been broken, physically, spiritually, and made whole. He had fought fate, the same fate that cast him as the loser, and he won. Potter, his teachers, the so-called Order, all had tried to stop him and none did last more than a few minutes against the might of the Wand. 

And here he was, standing atop the clock tower of Hogwart. He heard his followers busy working around the place, preparing the next step of his grand plan of domination, of rightful and eternal control over the world. From his position, he could see the school grounds, the hills and the old buildings, the dreaded forest above which flew a black and noisy machine, the lake where he had dumped the bodies of his opposants, and the now-broken bridge that once led students to the school. All his.

Wait, what was that over the forest? The Dark Lord tensed and observed as the machine, black and blurry and loud began to emit a steady staccado and the trees under it were cut. From here, he could sense how the wolves and the spiders and Slytherin-knows-what died en masse before the machine landed among their carcasses, now out of his view, behind the trees.

Ready to shout his orders and prepare for battle, he who shall not be named stopped dead in his tracks as a buzzing little thing approached the top of the tower. Square, with limbs that ended in noisy and blurry extremities, entirely black, and a little bigger than a common housecat. It was sputtering, barely managing to stay in the air; Voldemort did not felt threatened even as the object completely stopped to function and fell before him.

Waving his hand, he took it apart from a safe distance, taking from the mess of broken pieces a pice of paper, which he took.
On one side, a face, pale and certainly inhuman, slightly bloody. On the other, an unknown rune, a circle with three lines, and the words  ""Special Containments Protocols"". Nothing worth the trouble. The pitiful muggle machine had failed at whatever its purpose might have been and he stood unharmed. Even the bigger black object was rising from the forest, and his snake-like eyes could see the humans aboard laughing their heads off.

Then Thomas Marvolo Riddle began to hear the monstrous screeches from the forest and saw the trees torn from the ground, quickly forming a path he instinctively knew was pointed exactly at him.
 
He instinctively knew he had met his end.",TheMightOwl

The section is (typically) written as a reference to be used in the event of a breach, so having redacted information in it such as what 7009-B is makes it useless to personnel. More generally, there is a lot of redacted information in the piece and it seems excessive. It makes sense in some places, like with names and phrases, but not others as I mentioned before.

"[WP] The Ministry of Magic isn't just hiding the Wizarding World from the Muggles, they are hiding it from the SCP Foundation. Voldemort learns this harsh truth after killing Harry Potter and declaring war on the Muggles.",InsanePigeon,"**Item #:** SCP-7009

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7009 is to be held in a 15m by 5m standard cell at a site containing Scranton Reality Anchors. Access to SCP-7009 for experimentation requires level 3 clearance and written approval. At no point should SCP-7009’s designation, [REDACTED], be spoken aloud by personnel.

SCP-7009-B is to be held at Site-17. At no point should SCP-7009 and SCP-7009-B be allowed physical contact. Due to SCP-7009-B's apparently mundane nature prior to contact with SCP-7009, no cylindrical pieces of wood ranging from 4-16 inches are to be housed at a facility with SCP-7009. 

**Description:** SCP-7009 (aliases include [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]) is an adult male humanoid, estimated to be approximately 70 years of age, currently located at [REDACTED]. While SCP-7009 appears human, he possesses several serpentine features, most notably vertical slits in place of nostrils, dark red eyes with vertical pupils, a complete lack of body hair, as well as elongated fingers. 

Apart from the serpentine features, SCP-7009 is not biologically anomalous, though when combined with SCP-7009-B, SCP-7009 displays abilities similar to a magician. These anomalous abilities include the ability to teleport, the ability to project energy towards a target (Most notably, SCP-7009 has used this ability to instantly kill a target by invoking the phrase [REDACTED]), the ability to transform objects into various other objects, the ability to animate inanimate objects, the ability to exert control over another person's mind, the ability to fly, and several others.

SCP-7009-B is a cylindrical piece of yew 13 ½ inches in length with a feather inserted into the core. According to SCP-7009, the feather belongs to an anomalous bird known as a Phoenix and was manufactured by another instance of SCP-7009, referred to as Olivander. SCP-7009-B displays no anomalous properties until physical contact is made with SCP-7009, at which point, the anomalous abilities listed above become possible. While most abilities require the invocation of a word or phrase, SCP-7009 has displayed the ability to perform anomalous actions while remaining silent, though this appears to require additional effort.

SCP-7009 should not be referred to by his given name of [REDACTED], as it causes an adverse emotional reaction. SCP-7009 prefers to be referred to as Lord [REDACTED], the Dark Lord, or You-Know-Who. However, the name [REDACTED] has properties of an infohazard, as the subject has displayed awareness of personnel invoking the name despite lack of contact with SCP-7009-B. Tests have concluded that SCP-7009 is aware of invocation of the name independent of distance from the subject and knowledge of who or what the name is referring to.

SCP-7009 has proven unwilling to cooperate in interviews with non-anomalous humans (referred to as ‘Muggles’), and research is ongoing into locating additional instances of SCP-7009. Research personnel have been deployed to [REDACTED], Scotland, to gather additional information on a facility SCP-7009 refers to as 'Hogwarts'.

edit: Interview log added due to popular demand and as a thank you for the gold!

**Date:** September █, 20█

**Interviewee:** SCP-7009

**Interviewer:** Dr. ██████

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**Dr. ██████:** Please identify yourself.

**SCP-7009:** I am Lord [REDACTED]. It is a name known to all and feared by all. Do not feign ignorance. 

**Dr. ██████:** Noted. Our intelligence suggests that your given name is [REDACTED]

[REDACTED]

**Dr. ██████:** Noted. Can you tell me about SCP-7009-B? You referred to it as your 'wand'.

**SCP-7009:** And what interest is it to you? Ask Olivander, if you are truly curious. That old fool never minded discussing the wands he sold. 'Curious', indeed. You can even ask Professor Dumbledore whose pet Phoenix donated a precious feather to its making.

**Dr. ██████:** Those are certainly persons of interest. But for now, can you describe the methods by which you gained the powers you displayed on August █?

**SCP-7009:** Methods? Child, my methods would reduce lesser minds to madness. They go far beyond the dark books kept in places like Hogwarts. Do you wish to know them? To rend your mind and body and soul in exchange for powers lesser wizards can only dream of? Surely the Ministry would not allow such a thing. But no…your accent is American. What organization do you work for?

**Dr. ██████:** I am an employee of the Foundation. Tell me more about Hogwarts?

*SCP-7009 displays visible confusion*

**SCP-7009:** Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Scotland. All wizards know of it. Only a muggle 
would need to ask.

**Dr. ██████:** A muggle?

*SCP-7009 displays impatience*

**SCP-7009:** Of course, you Americans do needlessly complicate things. You would know them as No-Majes.

**Dr. ██████:** No-Majes?

*SCP-7009 displays anger and signs of panic*

**SCP-7009:**  No-Majes. No-Magic. Muggles. The powerless insects that witches and wizards have hidden from for hundreds of years. The people that walk the streets ignorant of the wizarding world hiding just beyond their sight!

**Dr. ██████:** You mean people like...me?

*SCP-7009 refuses to answer any additional questions.*

That's who I had in mind specifically.

&gt; SCP-1609 represents a perfect example of the flaws inherent in the operating procedure of the GOC, and serves as a cautionary tale for any members of the Foundation who disagree with our practices on containing dangerous objects.
&gt; 
&gt; Prior to the Coalition getting their hands on this, it was perfectly harmless. A chair which teleports to you when you need a seat is normal compared to most of the stuff that we deal with on a regular basis. When they put it through a woodchipper, it got hurt, scared and angry, so it lashed out at them. By trying to 'protect the world' by destroying it, they inadvertently made the situation a whole lot worse. SCP-1609 went from being harmless to deadly in the space of a few minutes because of the GOC, and we had to clean up the mess.
&gt; 
&gt; Thankfully, SCP-1609 is pretty simple for us to deal with. So long as we don't do anything stupid around it, it won't fight back and it won't try to leave. Even if it does, it usually comes back. I think I've worked out why. It came to us because it was afraid of the people who had hurt it. That's why it always comes back. It's afraid of the rest of the world now, and it's looking to us for protection.
&gt; 
&gt; This is why we have Special *Containment* Procedures instead of Special *Destruction* Procedures. If you break something, it's broken forever. When you try to destroy an anomaly, you can't take back your mistakes. That's what SCP-1609 has to tell us. This is why we're right and the GOC is wrong, people.

Voldemort learns this harsh truth after killing Harry Potter and declaring war on the Muggles.",InsanePigeon,"Here's another really good one: http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2190

Emphasis mine:

&gt; Over the past few years, a number of colleagues have approached me with concerns about SCP-2190’s containment. Essentially, the question people seem to have is, “Why are we spending so much money and manpower on the current containment procedures when the anomaly could potentially be rendered inert by separating POI-2190-2 and POI-2190-3?”
&gt; 
&gt; Rest assured that alternate containment procedures were proposed and considered. The containment procedures that are currently in place were specifically selected and approved by the O5 council for the following reasons:
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, intentionally separating POI-2190-2 and POI-2190-3 would constitute the attempted neutralization of an anomalous phenomenon. Neutralization attempts are only to be carried out if the anomaly in question poses a significant risk to normalcy and humanity at large. SCP-2190 does not meet this requirement. **“We are not the Coalition, we contain, not destroy”** is an age-old mantra that I’m sure you’re tired of hearing, but it’s still very applicable to this situation.
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, the present set of containment procedures aren’t nearly as extravagant as detractors have suggested. It’s standard practice to have undercover field agents in large population centers, and Baguio is no exception, so we’re not losing any extra manpower. The modified SIM cards are paid for by the sales of the phones themselves, and therefore cost us nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; There is also a third reason, which is, quite simply, sentiment. It’s no secret that suicide rates are high among Foundation personnel, a fact that is generally attributed to the difficult decisions we have to make and the actions we have to perform for the greater good. **SCP-2190 is something of a victory, a rare case in which containing an SCP means allowing a family who has endured a living hell to finally live happily ever after.** The value of the morale boosts provided by these feel-good stories cannot be overstated.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have any other questions or concerns regarding SCP-2190, feel free to call me any time during regular business hours.

NaNoWriMo is so close.
I'm the ML for Kenya this year...so excited for it to start.
Wrote my first novel during last year's NaNoWriMo. Hoping to write enough content to get a web serial going this time.",samercostello
[OT] SatChat: Will you be participating in NaNoWriMo this year?,MajorParadox,"Thanks!

When I wrote my novel last year...I fell in love with a small clan that lives in a desert that the protagonist visited at some point. They have a different type of magic and their culture is very much different from the rest of the world I've built around them. I'm hoping to flesh out more of their story in the form of a web serial spanning a year or so with the hopes that by the time I finish, it's gained enough traction to have a following, and at the same time buy myself time to finish editing &amp; revising the novel draft I wrote earlier so I can publish something worthy to an interested audience.",samercostello

[OT] SatChat: Will you be participating in NaNoWriMo this year?,MajorParadox,"I'm probably going to do it this year. There was a [short story I wrote here some time ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4rxizd/ip_we_cant_turn_back/d57dddk/) that I've envisioned as a possible novel, and this would be the incentive to actually get to expanding it to an actual novel. I know you can't count the initial bit, and can only count what you've added during November, but the main reason for using that story is that I think it needs to be expanded. 

There is one story I'd like to write as well from scratch, but the B part of the story is basically a collection of short stories, and that is the part that I'm stuck on in my head... but I could try to use that as my book, but I really think the other one is the one I need to use for this NaNoWriMo. 

Beyond the incentive to finally push my rough draft of a short story out to the full planned novel, is the 50% discount on Scrivener... which is much better than the 20% one can usually get off from various affiliates. ",Charon2k

[OT] SatChat: Will you be participating in NaNoWriMo this year?,MajorParadox,"The one I'm likely to use isn't a collection, but a fully developed novel (well in my head) that is an expansion on the story I put in the link above. When that story was written, it was envisioned as a much longer piece, and constraining it to the short form was actually a bigger challenge. I've kept from that story though since then for no good reason.

The second option for my novel, that I said would end up being a collection. If it were a TV show like X-Files, the main A story would be the mythology episodes, but most of the rest were self-contained, though it still involved the main characters. In this case, there would be only one ""character"" consistent through everything, and they'd be more self-contained. I have the mythology figured out, it is the self-contained bits that I think will be harder to work out.

While your mission appears to be only 24 years to you, to the earth you have been gone for 20,000 years.How will these new humans react to these ancient astronauts?",PeshtaSeDeSe,"A relativistic-speed slingshot, the black hole saved us a lot of fuel.

It was a small one, the black hole, so as we whipped around it we could feel, just for a sharp moment, the unsettling prick of gravitational waves vibrating the space in which our very atoms existed.

Hermes, however, hardly batted an eye - Now that's a real starship for you! 

And yet, that blip of a feeling as we dove into the gravitational well of the black hole reminded us that even our mighty craft had been unable to completely neutralize the chaotic interaction of the black hole. Perhaps the universe just had some things you could never control. On the other hand, the bumpiness of a singularity interaction could just be a computational problem that would be solved in time.

Yes, all in time.

We had travelled for twelve years so far.

Now that we had slingshotted around the black hole, sending it flying off on its own journey in the opposite direction, and aimed our bow back to Sol, we had twelve years left to get back to Earth.

Immediately after the slingshot sensation, we all gathered around Hermes' terminals and poked at tablets to digest the fresh data.

Fresh data - For some reason I thought about how in the ten seconds it just took me to open the first chart, almost two and half hours would have passed on Earth. I guess the data isn't so fresh.

This thought halted me for a second. Or at least it did until I realized that even just thinking about time expansion had just taken nearly another hour on Earth. I reminded myself, yet again, that I had decided many years earlier that it was better not to think about these things, so I turned my attention back to the terminal.

That evening I went back to my room to watch the very first of the Earth transmissions: After we left Earth at our speed of 0.99999927999974C, all transmissions sent to Hermes had to chase us down, and only now that we had grabbed the pole that was a black hole and turned back towards Earth could we begin to gather-up the rapidly incoming transmissions.

How many transmissions did I have? Well, I had been checking the black hole data for about an hour, and at a time dilation of...ok let's see...(20000/24 = 833) - right, so that's my one hour but thier eight hundred and thirty three hours back on Earth, so that means I would have about the first Month's worth of messages.

I began to watch.

After the first week on our way back to Earth, I had recieved almost sixteen years of messages. Almost two decades had passed on Earth as we went through our Monday to Sunday routines.

The first month: seventy years.

The next eleven months we all spent just watching, all of us, in awe and wonder at seven hundred and fifty more years of human progress.

The things we saw; so much great; so much terrible. So much more great and terrible than we could have imagined. And then, exactly a year to the day from our slingshot, with eleven years of our journey (ship time) left to go home, all tranmissions ceased. It was clear to see it was a great war.

No transmissions. No Earth?

Our telescope was, naturally, state of the art, but we still had to be within a light year of Earth to resolve it.

The next ten years on Hermes were subdued.

And then the day came and we turned our telescope to Earth. And it was pristine and blue. It looked fine.

When we reached Earth, Hermes' decelleration capacitor fired off the charge it had been holding for twenty four years to the hour, and below was the good Earth. But there were no buildings, no radio signals, nothing.

No cities either.

I and seven others took a shuttle to the surface, landing where our base would have been, twenty thousand years ago.

Instead of our base there was just a large, grassy field with boulders strewn here and there. A forest was a short distance off. I remembered the hills around here, but they were now all empty of buildings.

We were taking videos and photographs and otherwise documenting everything (for whom, I couldn't tell you since there didn't seem to be anyone left to report to) when, from behind a rock a robot appeared, nervously.

""Uh, excuse me!"" the bot said uncertainly. ""Excuse me, the people, uh, would like to see you. But come quickly, hop in this hole!""

And the robot ran off as though it were being chased by a swarm of bees, making little whiney noises as it did so. And we set off after it as fast as we could, barely keeping up.

The robot came to a large entryway in the side of nearby hill, and went squeeling in.

I looked to Doctor Aaron, the party leader, and observed, ""That robot seems like it's scared.""

""Yes,"" the doctor looked at the entrance. ""It did, but look there.""

And the robot was inside, it looked obviously relieved. It gestured for us all to get inside, so we did.

Once inside, we made our way down long, expansive hallways. We walked for several minutes donward until we entered an arena-sized space, deep underground. It was well lit, and grassy, and all around us were rocks strewn about.

The robot ran to the nearest rock and hid behind it.

My party and I looked at each other in bewilderment. I decided to speak up. ""Uh. Excuse me but what are we running from?""

From behind a different rock than the robot came a weak and quiet voice, ""Oh, nothing. Or everything! It's just better to be safe than sorry, you know?""

""Uh,"" I agreed. ""So who is that?""

""That's our leader!"" came a slightly stronger response from another rock.

""Yes, I am the leader,"" said the apparent leader rock.

I took a few slow steps toward the rock from which the leader's voice had come. ""So why,"" I asked,In as friendly a tone as I could manage. ""Are you hiding behind that rock?""

I cold see a form cautiously moving out from behind the boulder. It was a fairly large man; the weak and quiet voice had belonged to this substantial man. He spoke in a slightly more confident voice this time. ""I am Mark, the leader of humanity. And this is the home of humanity.""

Mark made a sweeping gesture with his hand. And slowly other people began to emerge from behind their rocks.

""So, what are you all hiding from again?"" I asked. ""You said nothing in particular, but nonetheless you hide.""

The robot stepped forward, aparently feeling confident now that the humans approved of us. ""Ah, so you note the dominant flight response of the people. When humanity was nearly wiped-out almost nine thousand years ago, the only humans to survive were those that hid and cowered and were able to escape the death machines,"" the robot explained cheerily. It was feeling much more certain about us by the second.

""You are the Hermes mission,"" the robot said suddenly. ""I just now recalled.""

The robot turned to the rest of the people, declaring, ""The Hermes mission everybody! Finally, the last humans are back and safe and now we never need to go outside again!""

""Wait a minute,"" I said. ""What do you mean never go outside again?""

""It's potentially dangerous."" Mark said, walking up to me and placing a kind, strong hand on my shoulder. ""We've only left the front door unlocked waiting for you guys to come back. We couldn't bear the thought of leaving people out there on their own in the scary universe!""

""You've been waiting for us for...""

The robot finished for me, ""...nine thousand years, roughly.""

""But what if we want to go outside? I mean, surely with technology like this robot you can build spacecraft to explore and expand?"" I implored Mark.

Mark thought hard for a moment, ""Well, sure we can build spacecraft and stargates and all that stuff. We preserved all Earth's records. Too worried to delete them, they might have something that can help us escape or hide better some day.""

I was speechless. Then Mark continued.

""But we would love to hear all your stories about it! Some details of your personal life before humanity knew they should be hiding from the cosmos?"" A murmur of agreement came from the gathering crowd.

""OK,"" I said, thinking of an idea to keep us out of eternal imprisonment with these really nice, but skittish people. ""We will tell you our stories as long as you let us go out and explore.""

Mark looked skeptical. The crowd looked doubtful.

""Ah, and!"" I said, realizing the key to this gamble. ""And, we'll come back and tell you the stories! How does that sound?""

There was intense discussion from the crowd, and a few shouts from behind a couple of other rocks. Finally Mark came forward with a smile on his face, ""it's a deal!""

Mark held out his hand, and I reached to shake it, but he quickly withdrew his hand and smiled sheepishly at me. ""Sorry, just don't want to catch a cold! Can never be too safe!""

Never too safe; with twenty thousand years of upgrades, we set off on a two hundred thousand light year survey.

While your mission appears to be only 24 years to you, to the earth you have been gone for 20,000 years.How will these new humans react to these ancient astronauts?",PeshtaSeDeSe,"The Hermes drifted faithfully towards a small rocky planet. The chemical readings indicated the presence of an earth-like planet, with the appropriate atmospheric composition. Transit photometry reported the planet was close enough to it's parent star to support life. 

The bridge of the Hermes came back to life, as the bleak dark chamber lit up for the first time in years. Several vents scattered throughout the chamber ejected a carpet of warm vapor, which heated up the icy cold high grade polythene flooring and walls of the room. From two cryo-pods, a male and female astronaut ascended from cryo-sleep.

""Good morning, Eve,"" said the male astronaut.
""Cut the courtesies Adam. The first thing I need to hear after 6 years isn't morning salutations. It's technically not even morning,"" replied Eve.
""Well, what do we have here?"" said Adam looking at a small rocky planet over the terminal.
""I'm synching with the system,"" said Eve. She closed her eyes, relaying tens of thousands of bytes per second with Hermes' Artificial Intelligence. 
""Tidal patterns are 5% higher than earth, abundant life readings, maximum winds within the last 96 hours were around 80mph,"" Eve reported.
""It's been 24 long years.. we've finally done it. We've finally stumbled upon a planet with life,"" Adam rejoiced.

24 years ago, the Hermes was the first starship to be outfitted with a Warp driver. The driver had catapulted the starship out of orbit at near luminal velocity for approximately 11 seconds through the use of artificial gravity wells. More precisely, the Hermes was wrapped in a temporary spatial bubble as space was compressed around it. After those 11 seconds, Hermes would gradually slow down, sling-shooting around large celestial objects to rebuilt speed when necessary. 

The Hermes remained in orbit within planet's gravity well, while Adam and Eve took a 2-person shuttle to personally investigate the planet's surface. As the shuttle ripped through the atmosphere, Eve activated the shuttle's heat shields. Suddenly, an array of tiles flipped around a coated the vessel, protecting the two pilots from an otherwise fiery death. Eve looked below, seeing an ocean sprawling with a luminescent purple and red forest. When they got closer, they noticed the planet's surface dominated by plants larger than that of their home planet. The animals were also larger. Moles the size of trees now grazed the tallest branches than the roots below with their long necks, while gigantic bats soared among the clouds. Then there were creatures that they never even recognized - a lumbering beast that housed it's own garden of moss, fungi, and conifers over its skin, grazing the rocks with a vacuum like nose. It was a truly exotic world.

""Take us down, Eve. We need to collect samples for the masters,"" demanded Adam. Eve perched the shuttle besides a small ravine. 
""Careful not to get contaminated. Who knows what kinds of diseases can have developed on this planet,"" reminded Eve.
""I'll make sure to quarantine my suit and all my gear, once I return to the Hermes,"" smiled Adam. He then set off, taking pictures and relaying them directly to the database in Hermes, from which it would relay back to Earth. Occasionally he would collect a sample of an exotic plant and store it on his person. ""The masters will be so pleased when they find out about this!"" rejoiced Adam. His excitement got the better of him, and he ventured further and further away from the shuttle. Suddenly, from his ear piece, Eve, trying to sound anxious, warned him,
""Adam, something strange is going on. The data your sending Hermes... it's being relayed back here,""
""Strange. The data I sent should have been uncorrupted and the databases should have more than enough storage to accommodate it,"" Adam reported back.
""Perhaps we should rendezvous back at the Hermes,"" suggested Eve.
""Give me a few more minutes,"" Adam replied dismissively.

He failed to notice a shadowy figure stalking him. As Adam studied a flower covered with a beard of vines, the figure crept behind him until it was able to place the tip of it's weapon behind Adam's head. Adam sat there paralyzed, only now realizing he got carried away. His entire being warmed up, but he couldn't shake the uncomfortable sweaty feel that plagued him. 

""Jar'vagrit!"" shouted his assailant, prodding Adam with a strange looking rifle. Adam slowly turned to face his attacker. What he saw was a masked humanoid figure covered head to toe in hunting gear.

""Jar'vagrit!"" the assailant repeated. ""What?"" Adam cried. The assailant, now impatient, raised the butt of it's firearm and threatened to hit his prey.

""Fragt!"" shouted another masked figure. The first masked being lowered it's rifle. The two exchanged a few more sentences of the strange tongue, while Adam could only cower. 

""He asks, 'who are you'?"" said the second masked figure.

""You... you speak English?"" stuttered Adam. 

""Aye, I speak the Ancient Tongue"" answered the figure. Adam thought about the response for a moment. Suddenly, it hit him. The Hermes wasn't relaying the data back to the planet because of a malfunction. It was relaying data back to Earth. But why was it so different?

""What.. what year is it? And who are you?"" inquired Adam.

""It is the 19,622 year after the cloud of fire. I am MaelTech and that is my son, BeorTus"" answered MaelTech, ""Now answer our question. Who are you?""

""My name is Adam, I'm a human from the 25th century. I've come here with my Synthetic companion,"" answered Adam.

""Synthetic? Do you mean a Machina?"" inquired MaelTech, her voice growing intense.

""Machina!!??"" exclaimed Beortus.

""Si'Tafi!"" MaelTech yelled at her son. She then sharply asked Adam, ""If there is a Machina, Ancient one, you must lead us to it. It must be destroyed before TallaKet intercepts it.""

""Adam,"" reported Eve, ""I plotted multiple scenarios and several match with a distant future Earth. I think we're on Earth, in the far future....Adam?.... Adam?""

Adam muted his earpiece. He wasn't sure what to do.

[WP] A retired military robot takes a job a bank teller. He genuinely likes talking to his coworkers and the customers. Suddenly a Bank Robbery happens.,Epidexipteryx,"""Come in! Make yourself comfortable.""

Arlo moved around his boss and took the chair in front of his desk. Although he didn't mind standing, and often did so if there weren't enough chairs to go around, he had learned that it made his co-workers more comfortable if he gave off the semblance of relaxation. Of course, relaxation was a completely foreign concept to him.

Arlo was a robot.

Arlo's boss, Michael, shut the door and bustled back around his desk, flattening his tie before taking a seat. He moved something on his desk, then turned his attention to his computer, moving his mouse and squinting before clicking a couple of times and turning to Arlo. 

""So. Thank you for coming. Welcome to your performance review.""

Arlo deduced, as the meeting went on for the next half-hour, several things:

1) His boss was taking great pains to avoid mentioning the fact that Arlo was a synthetic;
2) This was making his boss very uncomfortable; and
3) Someone in the bank was unhappy that a synthetic had been hired to do a human's job, but his boss was trying not to say who.

A naturall lull in the conversation arrived. His boss smiled politely. Arlo smiled back.

""Do you have any questions for me, at this point?"" Michael asked.

The workings of the human animal were sometimes a mystery to Arlo, and when they presented too much of a challenge, he had learned that the best course of action was to state his confusion or discomfort as plainly as possible.

""Who is it in the team who doesn't like working with me, and what is your recommendation for the best course of action to deal with this?""

Michael sucked his lips in past his teeth, then blew his cheeks all the way out. He stayed like this for a second, then began talking. He reminded Arlo of a little girl who had come into the bank with her father five months before, and who had amused herself by making faces at the tellers - Arlo included. Later, in the breakroom, he had asked his colleagues Treshawn and Marcus why humans made funny faces at each other, and what purpose is served. Was it an evolutionary thing? That was his best guess. He didn't know why, but Marcus seemed upset by the question. 

Michael had been talking while Arlo was going over this memory, and he spent a few nanoseconds catching up, although he hadn't gotten that far ahead. His boss was still obfuscating. He was clearly uncomfortable. Perhaps it was time to interrupt and try to clarify his intentions. He let Michael finish his sentence.

""Can I interrupt you for a second?"" he asked. Michael looked relieved. Humans always looked relieved when you interrupted them. It was what they were used to. Arlo was about to begin his explanation, but suddenly something came though that made him stop and change tack entirely.

""Michael."" He said loudly. ""I need you to listen carefully.""

""I'm listening, Arlo. I'll listen to anything you've got to say. Since you've been working here...""

This time, Arlo didn't ask for permission to cut him off. ""Michael, this is important. The branch is about to be robbed.""

His boss blinked. ""What?""

""Two men have just exited a vehicle in the south parking lot and are heading for the door. Based on analysis of their car, clothes, the time of day, the month and other factors, I have determined that this is highly likely to evolve into a crime scenario.""

Michael just goggled. Sometimes it was best to give them a bit of hope.

""Of course, I could be wrong!""

His boss stood up, then half-sat down again, and remained behind his desk in a crouch.

""Arlo,"" he hissed. ""Go out there and take them out.""

It was time, finally. 

Arlo stood. He turned around, grasped the door handle, and walked out of Michael's office. He took a left into the main bank hall, arriving just as the two men from the CCTV entered. Both were of average height and slightly less-than-average build. They were carrying duffel bags. One joined the queue for Ann-Marie's window. The other moved over the the couches under the window and sat. He had an odd, stiff-legged gait. Arlo calculated the possibility that he had a long-barrelled gun concealed under his clothes. It seemed likely that there were guns in the bags. However, the men had come into the branch without concealing their faces - which meant that they had been captured on CCTV. Perhaps he had been wrong?

Gerry remained in the jail cell for the next several days. Word had come down from the state government that the unit known as G3R1 was to be detained until further notice. The state argued that since G3R1 was a robot, he was not entitled to the same rights as a human being. The state government also argued that since G3R1 was a combat based robotic platform, it was a complete mistake for the federal government to have released the bot from service. The governor of Minnesota made a statement later in the day thanking Gerry for his heroic actions, but repeated that having a retired military robot with programmed morals walking about the streets of his state was too dangerous, and had to be analyzed to ensure the safety of the citizens of his state.

Of course, the fine people of the Rochester Regional Bank protested, stating that Gerry was a hero, and a well-meaning citizen of the state. He even paid his taxes! G3R1 could understand the local government’s reservations, if a hostile entity was surrendering to him while he was still in Africa, he would still treat the prisoner as a threat. But why would the humans think him a danger when he only engaged in violence to protect his co-workers? G3R1 spent the first night in prison pondering this question, reviewing his memories of his time in the Congo. Yes, his combat record was littered with violent incidents, but these were all actions against the enemy to preserve the lives of the Marines he served. 

After a nights worth of furious thinking, Gerry had to break to allow his CPUs to cool, lest they overheat and he suffer memory corruption or worse, core failure. In the morning of his second day, he was again greeted by Officer Bradley, who this time was armed with a cup of coffee and a large stack of papers.

“GOOD MORNING OFFICER BRADLEY” G3R1 greeted him, blinking his optical shutters.

“Yes, good morning G3R1” Bradley replied, taking a seat at the table in the cell, “Do you need anything this morning? Oil? A, uh, recharge?”

Gerry gathered from the officer’s statement that he did not, in fact, understand Gen 3 robots at all. Gen 3’s required no oil refills, as all lubrication and piston functions were internalized and extremely efficient, robots aren’t supposed to break down in the middle of combat because of an oil leak. To his second point, Gen 3 robots were equipped with some of the most powerful battery systems known to man, a full charge can keep a bot on its feet for up to five days, and be in combat situations for up to 36 continuous hours. While his power banks could be supplied via a charge, yes, Gerry’s primary means of recharge were thermal recyclers built into his feet and back armor panels.

“NO THANK YOU” G3R1 responded, he still had a few days’ worth of charge left. He squatted down, a robot’s idea of sitting, opposite the table of Officer Bradley.

“Well G3R1, the state has seen to it that you are to stay here for the time being. The governor believes you to be, uh, a ‘potential threat to his citizens’” Officer Bradley explained, “I, for whatever reason, have been tasked with asking you more about your time in Africa”. Gerry blinked again, switching his optical sensor over to IR and activating his acoustic sensors. As he had guessed correctly, there were trace vibrations in the false mirror, exposing three men in the hidden room. Their voices, however, were not clear enough for his voice recognition software to make out what they were saying, even when cross referenced with English, Congolese, or French.


“OK” Gerry replied

“Ok” Officer Bradley began, “I followed up on your story yesterday”. He threw down a piece of paper onto the table from his stack sitting next to him. It was a copy of a newspaper article detailing the events of May 8th, 2057 in the northern most province of the Congo, specifically the ambush of a Marine transport unit.

“I know you showed me yesterday that you were in some, ah, serious combat while you were over there. Were you always fighting?” He asked

“NO”

“Uh ok, can you talk to me about a time when you weren’t shooting? Were you ever chasing down any bad guys to watch where they went?”

Gerry paused for a long time.

“THAT IS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, I AM SORRY OFFICER”

Officer Bradley quickly glanced over at the false mirror. His earpiece, which G3R1 had overlooked, crackled to life. 

“I know you can hear me G3” A guttural voice spoke out from the earpiece,  “This is coming from the top. Tell Bradley about Operation Guillotine”

G3R1 blinked, not quite recognizing the voice. He filed the soundbite away for further analyzing later. Bradley looked at Gerry, nodded, and sat forward in his chair. G3R1 once again lit up his chest panel to reveal a memory of his past, the infamous Operation Guillotine.

Operation Guillotine was a top-secret direct action ordered by the President of the United States to kill the leader of the Congolese rebellion. The war at this point had dragged on for three long years, costing hundreds of billions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives, both American and Congolese. The Congolese bore the brunt of the carnage, however, with entire villages and towns slaughtered either by rebel or Congolese Armed forces. The Americans did what they could, but even they were guilty of the occasional residential bombing or orphanage shelling. The Americans apologized, the rebels did not.
	
G3R1-X, callsign ‘Rex’, was the top choice for reconnaissance missions. His experience in the field left a unique imprint on his tactical ability, making him a one-of-a-kind amongst the Gen 3’s. The objective of the operation was simple: identify, engage, and kill the leader of the Congolese Rebellion, a man only known as ‘The Jackel’. The Jackel was an enigmatic phantom that eluded all of the United States’ intelligence agencies, something that is no small task. No one knew who he was, where he came from, not even what he looked like. The man wore a mask wherever he went, and he regularly communicated through couriers and messengers, whom he never used more than twice.",dingo8mahbby

G3R1’s chest panel first showed the scene of the interior of the airplane at night. With his IR sensors on, he could see everyone in the back of the C-17, flying at max altitude. To his right was his handler, Lieutenant Argyle. Argyle was fidgeting with his parachute harness. G3R1 saw the go-light switch, and watched as a flight chief lowered the back ramp to the cold open sky. G3R1 stood up and prepared to drop, Argyle close behind.

“Prepare to jump!” The jumpmaster shouted over the roaring sound of the plane, checking the ramp for any obstructions. After his final review, he looked back at the front of the ship, and gave the duo a thumbs up.

“Go!” He shouted. G3R1 jumped into the pitch black night, Argyle close behind. G3R1 penciled his form, increasing his drop speed to reach the ground faster. Once at appropriate altitude, he released his parachute, and watched as it blossomed in a massive dark cloud above him. Argyle was close behind, but significantly higher up. G3R1 glided gently to the ground, where his actuators compressed to make up for the force of the landing. He pulled out his bot-gun, which was clipped to his back, and surveyed the area. Besides the large cat in the tree twenty meters away from him and the massive insect population all around, he was alone. Argyle landed almost a hundred meters away, a short distance for the bounding robot. His hulking seven foot frame, while large, moved nimbly through the jungle.


“You good, Rex?” Argyle asked when his partner arrived,

“AFFERMATIVE”

“Good, let’s get moving, we need to get into position before sunup”

G3R1 didn’t think that getting into position two days before an assassination was appropriate, but that wasn’t up to him. Bots do their job then go to sleep. The duo hiked through the dense jungle, south to their objective, Buta. G3R1’s IR optic caught plenty of wildlife signatures along the way, big cats in the trees, wild boar sleeping gently in the crooks of the tree roots, even a few apes napping through the night. He made sure to stifle his steps to be as quiet as possible, out of respect for the slumbering animals and to not attract the attention of any patrols his sensors may have missed. 

They reached their position an hour before sunrise. It was a commanding view that overlooked the entire town of Buta. Comprised of mud walled houses with a multitude of colored roofs, Argyle compared it to a rainbow. G3R1 compared it to a random noise generator with some color thrown in, and Argyle agreed that was a better analogy. The haphazard urban-esque mess gave way in the center of town to a large stone building, the central church, which was their target. The plan called for a controlled, precision strike on the church via several 5,000 pound JDAMs, a type of laser guided bomb. G3R1 disagreed with that aspect of the plan as well, one bomb would be risky, dropping several on a very small area had a high chance for civilian casualties, something his programming heavily emphasized as ‘intolerable’. 

Before Gerry’s musings could go any further, Argyle immediately dropped to the ground and rolled to a crook in the roots of a nearby tree. G3R1 activated his acoustic sensors, filtered out the background noise, and identified a small patrol of approximately five scouts moving through the area, inconveniently right through their position. As to how the patrol managed to slip his numerous background scanning processes, he did not know. Thinking fast, G3R1 activated his mountainous camouflage, turning his armor a bleached gray with hints of dirt brown, and cowered over Argyle, attempting to mimic a rock. He rotated his arms backwards to grab local foliage and drag it over his chassis, further concealing himself and his handler. From a distance, G3R1 truly looked like a grown over boulder with some low foliage growing over it. Anyone who looked closer, however, would discover his ruse.

“Rex, If they find us, jam their radio” Argyle whispered, his face mere inches from G3R1’s optical sensor. Argyle removed his sidearm, a Colt .45 caliber with a suppressor attached to the front, and laid it across his chest, finger on the trigger. G3R1 remained totally still as the small patrol passed through their position. These weren’t men, they were adolescents. The Congolese rebels were known for using child soldiers to bolster their ranks, there was no shortage of orphans in the war torn Northern provinces. The boys looked around the majestic outcropping, looking aimless and bored. No soldier actually enjoys patrols, especially when they know the countryside is safe from marauding Special Forces units. After taking in the spectacular view, the patrol turned to continue on their way, when one of the boys decided to adjust the Velcro on his sandal. As he leaned down, the boy stopped, looked at the ground, and began to shout to his comrades. Imprinted in the ground, the boy saw an all-too familiar track in this side of the world: bot tracks. A combat robot’s feet were clawed, two primaries in the front and a stabilizer in the back, looking similar to a rooster’s foot, except it was three feet long. The leader of the patrol, a young man who looked near the age of fourteen, drew his radio. In order for G3R1 to enable his radio jammer, he would have to abandon his ruse and engage the enemy, the enemy being fourteen year old orphans armed with Kalashnikovs, Nike shorts, and sandals. His radio jammer had a limited radius, and once the boys left they would be able to transmit a message to their superiors. If they managed to radio back a message, The Jackal would be alerted to the presence of a bot in the area and escape, destroying any chance of taking out the resistance leader and ending the war. Thousands more would die, the ware would drag on indefinitely, and the mission would fail.

And failure was not an option.

They make poor decisions. But dogs are great and if you don't cry at then ending of Marley and Me, then you aren't human. 

I woke up with a blinding headache and my phone was ringing... ""Hi this is Anderson Cooper I want to interview you about your video.... ""  What?  What video?""
""The one on youtube.. About why Flora would make a better president than the one we have now.""
""Uh... Flora's my dog...."" I looked over at her sleeping on the floor...  Her tail wagging and a pleasant expression on her face. 
""Yes, the golden retriever...  Your video on youtube is mega  viral, it's all over the news. ""

I agreed to an interview, after I had a chance to gather myself. 
I pulled up youtube and watched in disbelief as i eloquently addressed why she would make a good president and why she was eligiable, what a good dog she was.  

""Dog's are people's  best friends, and if a horse can be a roman congressman, a cat a stationmaster in Japan, a gorilla a symbol of unity and hope, then tell me why an american dog can't do great things. I dare you.. Tell me one good reason why Flora the golden retriever can't be president.""

The rest is a blur,  I think the joke evolved into me being nominated as her intrepreter,  and people actually donating, and volunteering, then the debate which we won.The sitting president calling her a bitch on national tv probably clenched it.""

The man sitting in front of me squinted hard as he slowly pieced together what I had said. He was not a native English speaker, and seeing as I knew not a word of Vietnamese, communication between us was very difficult. It had been absolute hell to get in touch with him in the first place, and now that he was finally here, I realized just how much of an odd pair we must have seemed to everyone else in the diner: me, a young professional dressed in casual business attire, and I, an elderly Vietnamese fisherman garbed in traditional blue robes and sandals.


The wrinkles in his face scrunched up as he struggled to find the words to reply with. Finally, he said ""Yes. Was good flight. Did not have to go to Saigon airport. I fly myself.""

I'd forgotten that I'd once wished for the ability to fly. That was but a drop in the bucket of all the wonderful things this man had received on my behalf. 

""Ah, I see."" I said. I cleared my throat. ""So, uh, about this little misunderstanding between us. As I explained to you in my letter, it appears that every time I've wished upon a star, you get the wish. Now, I don't know why this is happening, but I do hope we can come to an agreement to return what is rightfully mine"".

I waited anxiously, searching his face for any sign of emotion. He looked at me with suspicion.

""No"" he said, slowly shaking his head. ""How I know what you say is true? You could be tricking me.""

""I've done lots of research-"" I started to say, but he put up a hand to silence me.

""And even if it true, why I do this for you? I like good stuff, powers, wife.""

Wife. Back in high school I had a huge crush on Julia McDonald, the not-too-popular-but-very-pretty girl who'd been in my English class for 3 consecutive years. One day I wished that I would marry her, and the next thing I knew she was packing her bags for Da Nang. Mr. Nguyen had of course met her during the beginning of her trip there, and she fell in love instantly and never returned.

""Because none of it belongs to you!"" I said. ""Every good thing I've ever wished for has always fallen into your lap, and you won't even say 'thank you', let alone return what you've stolen from me!""

Mr. Nguyen stood up straight and pushed back his seat. ""I hear enough. I go back home now. I owe you nothing. Goodbye, loser American.""

He started for the door, but I quickly caught him by the wrist. 

""Oh no you don't! Not after what I went through to get you here!""

""Let go!"" he said, flailing his arms frantically. Due to a much-regretted wish, Mr. Nguyen had the build of a football player. I could barely hold on, much less restrain him. He finally punched me in the face and flung me off.

I got to my feet and charged him again, but a large rat leapt from out of nowhere and latched onto my face, sinking its teeth deep into my nose. Mr. Nguyen laughed maniacally as I rolled around in pain. The other customers at the diner were looking on in shock.

""You wish for power to summon animals, remember? You lose"" he said, shrugging his massive shoulders. The rat hopped off of my face and scuttled into a hole in the wall, its purpose fulfilled.

""No"" I said, looking over his head at the night sky above. Blood was dripping from my face and my body ached all over. ""I win"".

""Why you call my name?"" he said, narrowing his eyes at me.

As had been my plan, I scheduled this meeting on the night of the Perseid meteor shower. I had been waiting for the shower to start, and now that I could see a few shooting stars streaking across the sky, it was time to make my move.

""I wish that I had all of the wishes he has ever received given to me!"" I shouted at the top of my lungs. 

I watched Mr. Nguyen's face fall as he realized what was happening. His physique shrunk to that of a typical old man, his thick wallet disappeared and the heat vision he tried to incinerate me with evaporated even as it was leaving his pupils. Mr. Nguyen dropped to his knees, cursing me out in both his native tongue and in English.

But nothing happened to me. Where was the working spacecraft I'd wished for? The pet dinosaur? The power of invisibility?

Then, I had a sinking thought. I grabbed Mr. Nguyen and held him up by his shirt.

""Tell me, Mr. Nguyen, is ""Me"" a very common name in your country?""

"[WP] It's 3 am, you can't sleep, and you can't shake the feeling that your child is in danger. The only problem is, you don't have a child because you can't have kids.",Smtmsihateppl,"The night I decided not to sleep with Laela, was the night I nearly died. 

It had been a hot day, hotter than the Sahara, with roads steaming so much you could cook eggs on them, and insects turning up dead amongst the browning strands of grass.  Work had been cancelled for almost everyone, barring firefighters, police, and doctors, the people that chose to sacrifice sanity for the greater good.  Mark and I stayed at home, aircon and fans blasting through our bedroom while the rest of the house overheated. 

""You really love that doll,"" Mark said. 

He was referring to Laela, a small pink teddy bear that he'd given me just the year before.  It had been a year of shouting and tears, and Laela was Mike's gift after our first miscarriage.  Nothing hurts like losing a part of you, not even the doctor's sermon about why I could never have a child again.  So I kept the pain, the shame, and the bear.  I shared the house and the anxiety with Mark.  But it was nice to have something that was mine, truly mine. 

""She's my little guardian,"" I said. 

Mark smirked.  ""Sheesh, a woman as strong as you needs a guardian? I'll have to get a pet tiger."" 

We laughed, watched TV, and played boardgames through the heat.  Even the drone of the coolant fan and swish of the cooler couldn't keep the temperature down, though.  I'll remember the night time for the rest of my life. 

It was hot, so hot that I couldn't sleep with Laela next to me.  Mark chose the bottom of the opposite end of the bed.  I took the top corner.  Laela took to the bedside cabinet. 

At three in the morning, I woke with dread hanging over me.  The kind of dread that you can't explain but that you know is more real than any logical understanding of anything, and if you don't act fast you're going to lose out on a life-changing decision.  This feeling was the utmost protection of my child.  A child I never had, but an energy which I felt coming strongest from the bedside cabinet. 

""Mum,"" a voice said. 

I shot up, heart racing, eyes wide. 

The voice came from the cabinet again.  ""Mum!""  Louder this time, an order more than a pining call. 

""Mark,"" I whispered behind me.  But he was a deep sleeper and barely stirred. 

""Mum! Mum! Mum!"" the voice came again. 

I jumped out of bed, swung open the cabinet door, and Laela sat inside the cabinet, her small bear face looking up at me. 

""Mum!"" she said again, the voice coming from her chest.  But there was no doubt that it was the voice of a little girl. 

I snatched her up, my mind racing for an explanation.  

The ground below began rumbling, it sent a shudder through the world, a shake that vibrated the lamp off the bedside table, the pictures off the walls.  I clutched Laela to my chest, stepping backward, toward the bedroom cupboard. 

Mark woke, glancing left and right.  ""Jean, where are you?"" 

""Mark,"" I said. 

He rolled off the bed. 

The shaking took on ferocious magnitude.  The walls of the house swayed from side to side, as if it had been ripped out of the ground by a giant.  I banged my back against the cupboard door and sunk to the floor, eyes closed, and Laela pinned tightly against my collarbone. 

Something ripped nearby, and there was a loud crash.  The world had been torn apart by a terrible force, and when it stopped, you would wonder if it had ever happened at all.  The only evidence was the destruction and the car alarms blaring in the distance. 

Ahead of me, the roof had fallen in, and a broken beam impaled the place I was sleeping just a few minutes ago. 

""Mum,"" Laela said, much quieter this time. 

I couldn't cry, I couldn't understand, all I could do was look on in shock, and hold Laela much closer than before.

The only problem is, you don't have a child because you can't have kids.",Smtmsihateppl,"""Why isn't he home yet."" Damn it. The words had been stuck in my throat all night. I hadn't meant to let them out. Now that I had heard myself say them out lout I had to acknowledge that this was really happening. Who was ""he""? Why was I so confident he should have been home at exactly 8:30?

I had to look for him, but I didn't know where to look. I didn't even know his name. I just knew that this wasn't right. My son would have called. Of this I had no doubt. Did he have my phone number? He must, even though I couldn't remember his, and it wasn't in my phone.

Without changing my clothes, I stepped into my garage, got into my car, and put the key in the ignition. I didn't know where to go, but as I reached the end of my driveway, my hands moved on their own. I was headed to where he should have been hours ago. I didn't know where it was, but I grew increasingly confident I knew how to get there. I reached into my center compartment to grab a cigarette, hoping it would calm my nerves. There was nothing there but some napkins and charging cable. I had never smoked.",s3rpic0

"[WP] It's 3 am, you can't sleep, and you can't shake the feeling that your child is in danger. The only problem is, you don't have a child because you can't have kids.",Smtmsihateppl,"I awoke in the still silence of the early hours of the morning, staring at the ceiling worrying myself silly. 

I couldn't stop thinking about my poor baby girl Lucy.

Was she alright? Why was she so silent. Is she breathing? Oh dear god what if she's suffocating and needs my help?

I sat up in bed and flopped my feet onto the cool carpet. I couldn't get rid of the notion that Lucy was in trouble. But what was the danger? And how could I save her?

I tried to think briefly what I had been dreaming about to wake up in such a panic but the fear of not getting to her made it difficult for me to remember. 

I left the bedroom and began to search the house. I knew she would be here somewhere. Had I locked her in a room? Was that it? I knew deep down; the feeling told me so, she was lonely and was craving me to come rescue her. 

I checked the bathroom and then the other bedrooms. As I slowly woke up, becoming more alert, other thoughts started to flow in my mind counterattacking them. 

*Who's Lucy? I don't have a baby girl.*
Where is she? She's here somewhere. 
*I can't have children. Test results proved this!*
She's so frightened. I have to find her!

I descended the stairs. My head ached so much I had to grab the handrail to balance myself. I felt like I had been torn apart. Half of me a mother and the other half childless. The feelings I felt were nauseous. 

I walked into the kitchen and caught the time on the oven. It was a few minutes past three in the morning. 

I decided to pour myself some apple juice. All this thinking was dehydrating. I stood looking outside the window into the garden. 

Somehow the landscape anchored me. I could rationalise everything. It all began to cancel out and correct itself. The questions were all correct and I had finally a clear answer that had shocked me as well as relieve me of the stress. 

'Lucy!' I cried. 

I ran to the back door and unlocked it. 

As I opened the door, she came running in. The guilt overwhelmed me and I collapsed to the floor hugging her tight and cried into her fur coat.",StainedMugz
"[WP] It's 3 am, you can't sleep, and you can't shake the feeling that your child is in danger. The only problem is, you don't have a child because you can't have kids.",Smtmsihateppl,"The curtains were drawn, but the flashes from the flickering street light outside my studio apartment's window crept in along the edges of them anyway. For a good thirty minutes, I thought that was what kept me awake. But the longer I tossed and turned, the more I understood the feeling in the pit of my stomach...my child was in danger. That had to be it, my child was in danger. But it was literally impossible. Not because I put them down minutes ago, not because I my child was next to me, but because I didn't have any children. An accident involving a construction site and a hell of a lot of blood when I was a child made it so that I wasn't able to. So why wasn't I able to shake that crazy feeling? It made no sense.

While I was laying there thinking about it, I was startled fully awake by a sharp knock on my door. Already out from the covers because of my restlessness, I stood and walked over, past the kitchen counter, to peer through the peephole. Outside was a man, maybe early thirties, wearing a white lab-coat and thick glasses, flanked by four very large, very armed men in black swat gear. What the hell was going on?

""Miss Jackson? Miss Jackson, are you in? I'm sorry to wake you, but we would like to have a talk."" The little guy called through the door, leaning in to the peephole with one eye.

""I don't know who you are or what you want, but I don't think I want anything to do with your friends. Goodnight!"" I put the chain lock on the door in a vain attempt to communicate my displeasure. Like it would stop even one of those four guys... I heard some muffled conversation as the little guy turned around and shooed away his cohorts, then turned back to the door when they were gone.

""Very well, Miss Jackson. They won't be a bother. I would like to talk to you alone if that's alright with you."" He started to look nervous, but I felt like I could deal with him, at least, if it turned south. Five years of tae kwon do took care of that. I sighed and took the chain off the door, without removing my eye from the peephole and saw him visibly relax, making me chuckle a little. Unlocking the door, I opened it to come face to face with Poindexter.

""Alright, what do you want?"" I stood there in my pajamas, holding the door ready to slam it in his face if I didn't like anything he said. ""What do you and,"" I looked back at his friends at the other end of the hall, ""the goon squad want with a 'defenseless' little sister like me?""

""Well, uh...may I come in?""

""No...""

""Oh. Well. Erm, I...I am here because we need your help. My friends back there,"" he motioned over his shoulder, ""were in case you tried to attack me."" He was noticeably scared. Over me?

""Why in the hell would you need FOUR armed gorillas to deal with one little black woman?"" My eyebrow raised and I was taken aback by the implication.

""Oh..."" his tension disappeared and his face changed to one of curiousity rather than fear, ""Oh you really don't know, do you... I guess your parents never told you. Well, they did sign a non-disclosure agreement.""

""MY WHAT? The hell are you talking about, my parents? What agreement? What's going on?"" I hadn't spoken to my parents in two years because of a falling out over school. I wanted to be a teacher, but they wanted me to go into science. It ended in an explosive argument that left me taking my trust fund money and moving near the university I chose to earn my teaching degree in. Now after that, some scared looking scientist is talking to me about them? I had no idea what was happening, but I had to find out.

""Miss Jackson, you...well. I think you should gather some things. If you want to know what I'm talking about, it will be far easier to show you than to try to explain it."" He pulled out his phone without taking his eyes off of me and pressed the screen a few times. Then he handed it to me and it was ringing. I heard a voice on the other end pick up with the gravelly sound of having just woken up. 

""He...hello?"" I put the receiver to my ear to listen, ""Who is this? It's...IT'S 3AM!""

""But...Dad...?"" I almost dropped the phone in shock. The fact that this guy had my Dad on speed dial had to mean something. ""Dad, what's going on?""

""Luticia? Luticia, baby! It's been so long! Wait, what do you mean what's going on?"" His voice went from sleepy to hopeful to curiously concerned in three seconds.

""I...I've got some guy in a lab-coat here with four large, armed friends saying that they want to take me somewhere because they need my help. And Dad...he had you on speed dial.""

""Oh..."" I knew that 'Oh'. That was what he sounded like when he realised he'd lost. When he realised that he had to do something he didn't want to do. Mom got him to say it all the time. ""Listen, Luticia, honey, you need to go with them. They don't want to hurt you, and if what you said is true, then they do really need your help. Actually, I'll meet you where they're going to take you,"" I heard the sound of him getting up out of bed and Mom waking up, ""Baby, they've come to take Luticia. They need her help.""

""Oh no...What happened?"" Why did Mom sound scared?!

""Why does Mom sound scared?!""

""Honey, it's ok, we'll meet you there. Just grab a bag and some clothes and we'll see you soon."" He hung up and I was left standing there freaking out, having a panic attack with a Mandark cosplayer in front of me and a feeling still in my gut of a kid I didn't have being in danger. 

""Miss Jackson, if you please..."" He held out his hand and I gave him his phone, ""Please tell me you'll be joining us...?"" I had no other choice. I had the feeling that if I didn't go willingly, Larry, Curly, Moe, and Bubbles back there would take me anyway. All I could do was nod and went to grab a bag and some spare clothes and underwear.

""Y'all better feed me, cause I am not paying for my own food when I want none of this."" I put on my high-tops and went down to their car. It was a completely black SUV almost the size of a truck, and the doors, when they opened them, looked thick enough to be bullet proof. What the hell had my parents gotten me into?

After about an hour of driving, we came up to some facility out of town that was surrounded in no less than 5 layers of razor wire fences. Guards with big rifles were walking around, leading German Shepherds through the perimeter. A few of them were stationed at a gate that we stopped at as they checked Mandark's I.D. card. They waved us through and we drove to the biggest building in the massive lot. I couldn't stop looking around me, trying to take it all in. When they parked, we all got out and went inside where the little one started talking again.

""Miss Jackson, thank you for joining us. Let me start at the beginning.""

""Best place, I guess."" I couldn't help but be a little snarky after practically being kidnapped.

""Yes, of course. Well, when you were born, you had a defect in your heart that was undetectable in utero. The doctors only realised something was wrong when you didn't cry but you were breathing. Almost like you knew something wasn't right and you couldn't risk anything that would aggravate it. After extensive amounts of tests, the doctors told your parents about the extremely rare disease that you had and that it was incurable. Needless to say, they were devastated. But, being part of the scientific community themselves, they contacted friends they had in medical research to see if they could pull some strings and that's when our benefactor got wind of the situation. Our benefactor met with your parents and gave them an option to save your life in exchange for all tissue you lost in the operation, and any operations thereafter.""

""What? What use could you have for a defected heart and dead tissue?"" we continued walking through the facility as he explained, moving past huge garages full of all manner of vehicles, I thought I saw at least one tank, there was what looked like firing ranges with teenage girls firing different guns, but then some just waving their hands and there was a bright light before I couldn't see through the window anymore. ""What in the...?""

""At first it was research. We wanted to figure out the disease and fix it so that future births with the same defect didn't have to wait on a long list of people waiting for a donor heart. But after a few years, the amount of testable tissue was running out, so my superiors thought...why not just make more?"" His eyes lit up, and he smiled in a really creepy way.

""Wait...so you just up and cloned me?"" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was like something had been stolen from me and I never realised it was gone.

""To put it frankly, yes. Your parents signed the permission over to us to save your life as a baby. And over the years, we have made some incredible discoveries. Your DNA holds many secrets. Secrets that I'm sure you, yourself aren't aware of, otherwise...well... You wouldn't be trying to become a teacher."" We walked through another door into a massive arena filled with sports equipment, running tracks, boxing rings, obstacle courses, and dozens and dozens of little...mes.

"[WP] It's 3 am, you can't sleep, and you can't shake the feeling that your child is in danger. The only problem is, you don't have a child because you can't have kids.",Smtmsihateppl,"I hadn't slept since.  All I could think about was the fear that had overcome me.  She needed my help, and there wasn't a single part of me that knew how to provide it.  



The waiting room was quiet today.  The calm, untitled paintings scattered across the walls and the cheap recliners the practice kept for patients were always somehow relieving, but not today.  Three days had passed, and that fear was still fresh in my mind.  I could still hear her.

""Mommy!  Please, Mommy!""

That had been what woke me.  A chill like an arctic gust washed over me in that moment, and it stuck around.  I quickly convinced myself it was a dream, but it wasn't.

""I need your help, Mommy!  Please!""  

The voice was so innocent, so helpless.  It never left me.

""Liz?"" Called the receptionist.  After seeing me stand she forced a smile.  ""Doctor Carr will see you now.""

I sat in shame on the couch across from him as I talked through it.  The warm scent of his coffee eased my anxiety a bit, though.  He quietly sipped it as I spilled my mind to him.  

""Interesting,"" he noted.  

No shit.  He could be so fucking pretentious sometimes, even in such simple responses.  We spent the next thirty minutes talking about my insecurities - about how my feelings toward my infertility may be manifesting in a more physical way.  He was right about the insecurity, but I knew this was different.  I could still hear her. 

""Please!  Do something, Mommy!""

There was a soft buzz from the phone on the desk behind him.

""Just a moment, please,"" he said kindly.  He pressed a small button nearby.  ""Yes?""

""The school is on line one.  It's about Addy.""

""Thank you, Michelle.""  He paused.  ""I apologize, Liz.  Do you mind if I take this?""  

I nodded my approval.  I hadn't intended to eavesdrop, but every bit of the conversation had been audible through the old handset from where I sat.  They spoke about some sort of scuffle his daughter had gotten into.  An older girl at the school had been bullying her.  The doctor's voice was quietly bubbling into a boil.

""Is she there now?  May I speak to her?"" He asked.  ""I understand.  I'll be there as soon as I can.""

Before he could say a word I chimed in, ""Next week?""  



In the parking lot I sat for a moment in the car, idling.  I had hoped for some clarity, but I chalked that up to naïveté.  I watched as Doctor Carr hurried out to his Range Rover, his suit jacket and a briefcase in hand.  I had never seen him quite as disheveled as he was then - it made me anxious.   His tires screeched as he pulled out.

""Go.  Now!  Please, Mommy.""

There was that chill again.  Goosebumps covered the entirety of me and I began to panic.  I didn't know why it was happening, but seconds later I was following him.  Every reckless move he made, I mimicked.  He ran more than one stop sign on the way.  Before long he was parked outside of the local elementary school.  When he stepped out of the SUV, he took a swig from a small flask before tucking it into his jacket pocket, and then he rushed inside.  I sat hunched down in my Honda, waiting.  It had occurred more than once to me just how bat shit crazy I was acting, but I needed to be there.  I had to be there.  

""Please.  Please help me!""

Moments later he was walking out, a pretty little third grader in tow.  He seemed angry with her, muttering through a scowl as he dragged her to his vehicle.  Off they went, and again I followed.

Within ten minutes we had arrived at his house.  It was a beautiful two-story ranch in the better part of town.  Burgundy shutters popped against the gray siding.  

""Get inside!"" He shouted at her as they stepped out into the driveway.  I still couldn't wrap my head around what could have made him so angry.

""Please!  Do something, Mommy!""

I was beginning to scare myself.  What the hell was I doing?  Whatever the answer, it didn't stop me from creeping up to the front of the house.  Hiding in the shrubbery, I peeked in through the living room window where I could hear them once again.

""What the hell were you thinking, Ad?  Do you really think I have time for this bullshit!  I have a fucking job to do!""  He screamed ruthlessly.

""I'm sorry, Daddy!""

My eyes widened instantly.  That voice..

""She is so mean!  She was pulling my hair!""

""Enough!""  He yelled, smacking her across the cheek.  ""I'm sick of this!  Your mother should be here.""

""I want Mommy,"" she cried.

""How dare you!"" He scoffed.  ""It's all your fault, God damn it!""

""I'm sorry!  I didn't mean it, Daddy!""

He hit her again, and that was all I needed to see.  I slowly moved to the front door and turned the knob.  Quietly, I pushed the door open.  I could hear his shouting more clearly now.  He went on and on about what a burden his beautiful little daughter was to him.  It tortured me to hear it.  It tortured me more to hear her airy little voice calling out to him in fear.  She needed my help, and every fiber of my being knew exactly what I needed to do.

The doctor yelled so loudly that he hadn't noticed me enter the house.  He didn't notice me creeping into his kitchen where I found a knife block near the stove.  He didn't notice me take the largest of them from within the stained bamboo.

""Please stop, Daddy!  I didn't mean it!""

""But you killed her!"" He screamed back.  ""You killed her!""  He raised his hand again.  ""It's all your fau-""

The blade slid between his ribs as if the flesh wasn't there, and blood began to flow from the wound just as tears did from my eyes.  He managed to turn his head a bit, just enough for his gaze to reach me and his mouth to quiver wordlessly before he fell.

The little girl stared at me, both of us in shock above the expanding pool of blood.  

""Mommy?"" She whimpered.  

""I'm sorry,"" I responded.  ""I'm not your mother.""

The realization of what I had done rushed over me and I panicked.  It killed me to hear her crying as I fled.



That night, the weight of my eyelids was the only thing heavier than my guilt.  I finally fell asleep.  I had never felt a more comforting sleep.

""Mommy!  Help me!""

I shot up in my bed, that unbearable chill in my spine once again.  I looked over to the clock on the nightstand.  3:00AM.

""Please, Mommy!""

The voice was different this time.

""Stop!"" I shouted.  ""Just stop!  You aren't my child!  Why are you doing this to me?!""

It was quiet for just a moment before an answer came.

How can the balance of so many nations crumble with the rebellion of one?  
I asked my father that question once, during a seemingly endless storm.  
He had me and my brother hurried inside, least we knew the clouds were brought upon the Oximiles - a carefully selected group of elite soldiers who had such control over Oxygen, they could shift the weather or make things explode with a single spark.   
  
My family, as the rest of my people, had been targeted for the past century by those of the Carbon nation.   
A lot of of the other nations have had their periods of persecution, but so far we had remained free from their grasp and sought sanctuary somewhere unreachable.  
All that was left of our lost homeland were grandiose castles and structures made out of granite and quartz, now occupied by the invaders and their cronies.  
  
""Chauatelt"" Called my father from the corner he was on our small shelter. He was working on a sort of lance constructed with sheets of tin and decorated with colored silica. ""Let me tell you a story my father told me when I was your age.""  
  
As I approached to him, I extended my palm open and laid it horizontally on the ground. I feel the energy of the soil and the element I had control over swirl underneath for a while before lifting my hand upward, forming a small plateau I could sit on.  
I noticed my father briefly smiling at my ability before he went back to work with the weapon he held.  
  
""Let me start by saying that, while it is true that all elements are equally important, the way they generate or gather energy differs from one another. Elements were created by the spirits of these lands not to act on their own devices but to bond and create stronger components.""  
  
He placed the lance on his lap, glancing at my eyes before continuing.   
  
""What do you know of the 6 Nobles?""  
""I...um."" I looked down, picking around in my mind for clues. After a while, I stared back at my father with determination. ""They were known for being nullifiers, right? They couldn't form bonds like the others but they aided some others to keep the balance?""  
  
My father nodded.  
  
""Very good. Yes. They were 6 kings that were blessed with a mysterious essence which reacted with nothing nor did anything at all. Yet in their quest to aid the remaining kingdoms and help it remain in balance, they found a way to utilize their abilities for good. That is why they are called Nobles.""   
""Is the Avatar a Noble too, then?""  
""No, Chauatelt."" My father shook his head. ""But he certainly had the abilities to act like one. The point I wanted to make is that no matter the element, they all have a purpose or utility in this world.""  
  
I heard him sigh, his expression shifting into sad thoughtfulness.   
  
""There are, however, very important elements that serve as the pillars of the world. Without these, a lot of the things we see couldn't be, or even live for that matter. As with the 6 Nobles, there are 6 Vital Pillars: Hydrogen, maker of the stars that light the night; Nitrogen, the invisible guard that can sure give us some laughter sometimes; Oxygen, an element as gentle as it can be brutal; Phosphorus, bringer of light; Sulfur, a necessary poison and finally Carbon.""  
  
I clicked my tongue with my teeth and frowned.   
  
""If Carbon was so important, why did it start the attack?!""  
""My son, people often forget that there are other elements aside from the ones the kingdoms can master: the human elements. Love, Grief, Thirst of power. To be told how essential to life itself you were, those in the Carbon kingdom got fed with a sense of pride and righteousness: the need to have the world follow the rules they saw as best. If there was somebody who could best unite the world, that had to be them, they probably thought. Their ways to do so, however, have not proven to be the best for us.""  
  
Outside of our sand-made structure, thunder struck.  
The flash of light was strong enough to seep under the board we had propped as door. There was still no way in guessing if it was one of the Oximiles displaying their spark-making abilities or not.  
  
""But that's the Avatar's job!"" I tried not to be too loud, though I felt my heart pounding. ""He was supposed to take care of all of us! Where has he been all these years?""  
  
Other than the storm, the refuge fell silent.  
My father stood up, using the lance to prop himself up.  
He glanced at the door, clenching the weapon tightly.  
  
""Who knows. According to the cycle, he or she should have surged from the sages of Bismuth. Last I heard of them, however. . .""  
  
I saw how my father began to approach the door, aiming the lance at it.  
As he reached to my place, he pushed me gently behind. I was confused.  
My brother came running towards me, hiding behind.   
  
  
""Chauatelt."" My father called at me without looking back. ""Get ready. It seems our visitors have arrived.""

"[WP] You are what mankind believes to be the Devil. However, there are three things that they've got all wrong: 1) Everyone goes to Heaven, no matter what they do in life. 2) You're the only one who's ever escaped Heaven. 3) Heaven is absolutely fucked.",SuperMutantSam,"""I'll never understand why you humans desire to go to *Heaven*."" He said the last word with so much venom and hatred. I didn't even know a word could be hated so much, let alone a word associated with something so glorious. 

He sat there, imperiously staring down at us with those perfect brown eyes while he spouted nonsense about how he was the 'Devil' and that *Heaven* was not a beautiful place made of solid gold with white pillars in the Romanesque style but rather an ordinary place akin to that of Centrelink. Well, except for the fact that it was indeed covered in Romanesque architecture but it was still a glorified Centrelink none the less. He couldn't understand why anyone; 'Angel', 'Demon' or Human alike would desire to go to *Heaven.* He said it like that, every time. *Heaven.* Like it was painful to even utter the word.

""You do know, that no matter what you do in life, you"" he pointed at the person to my left. ""and you."" this time he pointed to someone in the row ahead of me. ""All of you, go to *Heaven*."" Again, as he uttered the word pain crossed his face. ""I managed to escape that awful place, but none of you will ever be able to. Live your life here, before you end up in a place worse than what you see as Hell."" As he finished speaking, he stood up, brushed off some imaginary dust from his pants and began walking out. 

Before he could reach the door I found my hand already grasping his upper arm and the words were spilling from my impetuous mouth. ""Are you really the Devil?"" He looked down at me, those annoyingly perfect brown eyes even more perfect up close. 

""Indeed."" He said in a silky tone that he didn't have previously when preaching to the masses. 

""Did you really escape from Heaven? Is Heaven real? What's Heaven lik..."" the questions came bursting from my mouth until he pressed his finger to my lips.

""Shhh."" He said simply. ""I'd rather not speak of the place."" He saw the look in my eyes, the burning desire to ask questions about the place. He sighed deeply. ""Look, my dear. That place is, interesting and not anywhere near as fun as you'd imagine it is. I don't recommend going there anytime soon. Trust me, my dear. Don't go there."" With that, he brushed past me and walked out. 

That was the one and only time I ever saw him for sure. Over the years I could have sworn I saw him out of the corner of my eye. But I never caught a clear glance, nor did I ever hear of anyone speaking with him. I knew he was still around, there was no way he would ever go back to the place he hated so much. On my deathbed, I stared up at the sky on the side of a hill and then I finally saw him, or at least I thought I saw him. He was standing next to a tree watching me with a sad smile on his face. As my world started turning dark for the final time, he raised his hand in a wave.

Oh, for those non-Australians. Centrelink is our Welfare system. I suppose it's comparable to the DMV (At least what I've seen from TV of the DMV) In short it's completely and utterly packed with people and it takes forever for anything to get done. Google it if ya need more info on it.

I was always one for theatrics, it was the only way to entertain myself down here. The weary travelers looked up at me. Confusion and doubt spread over their faced. One even looked angry almost. I couldn't blame him. The hike down the aptly named Hell's Drop was long and tiring. I knew the rumors about what waited at the end - the answers to life's greatest mysteries, buried treasure long forgotten, some said the gate to Hell itself. And all these people found was *me*. Not that I wasn't a sight to behold. Once I was the most beautiful of God's angels, though I guess that's hard to see in the darkness of this cave.

""And you're supposed to be...?"" the angry one asked.

""I have many names. I suppose most people know me as the Devil."" 

""Right, *your* the devil,"" said another. This was a rather young group of people. College students, maybe. ""If you're the devil, why aren't you in Hell?""

That was a new one. Usually people asked me about my appearance. *""Oh, but the devil has horns?""*

*""Everyone knows the devil has red skinned and shriveled bat wings!""* 

*""Oh, where's your pitchfork Lucy?""*

I don't even know where these versions of me come from. It's like, you disguise yourself as a serpent one time to mess with some idiots and the world sees you as a monsters forever. 

Hell was a good question, though. I suppose people expected it to be more than this; a tiny antechamber in a cave full of rocks and bat droppings. ""This is Hell.""

""This? This is Hell?"" a girl asked. Girls started coming down here, oh, a hundred years or so ago? In my banishment from the human world I had almost forgot they existed until one day a girl accompanied a group of explorers. Good going God on that one, make half your humans treat the other half like shit. And that's not even getting into the whole race mess. I told him everyone should just be the same formless blobs. Did he listen? no. 

""I like to think Hell is wherever I am. The opposite of Heaven. That's all I strive for."" 

They all looked at each other curiously. One finally piped up. ""Your the only one here...does that mean no one goes to Hell? Do we all just, like, rot in the ground?""

I sighed. It always came to this. Sooner or later people made me talk about Heaven and the big G upstairs. I leaned back on my throne - okay, vaguely chair-shaped pile of thrones. I did have normal furniture, things I convinced people to collect for me over the years, hidden away in the maze of tunnels. But that was my special place. I had to keep up appearances of King of the Damned. Which was, to say, king of no one.

""No you don't rot in the ground, idiots. You think God would take all that time making you for *that*? Nah, you all go to Heaven. If you can call it that.""

""What do you mean?""

""That place is an absolute shit-show. First of all, it's crowded. Do you have any idea how many people have existed throughout the world's exist? A ton. Not to mention, everyone's so mad. Imagine being a puritan, living a dull, boring life of penance, enjoying your time on that big fluffy cloud, when all of a sudden a bunch of flapper girls come in with skirts barely past their knees? You start to get a little pissed off. Not to mention when the guys who killed Jesus showed up. *That* was awkward.""

""Are you saying Heaven just . . . sucks?"" 

""Oh, big time. You have no idea. You got all the racist people grouped together, all the sexist people. A whole street dedicated to Muslims, another to Catholics, you got Quakers just chilling minding their own business. This one guys supposed to be a real asshole, I forget his name. He started like, World War Two or caused a Holocaust or something? Whatever. It's a good thing Hell don't really exist, I guess that guy never shuts up.""

""Oh shut up,"" one kid said. I think it was the angry one from early, but who could tell? They had shuffled around since entering and humans all looked the same. ""You're just jealous cause you got cast out of Heaven.""

""Cast out?"" I roared with laughter. It scared them a bit. Good. Humans could use some fear. ""I escaped. But that's enough telling you about heaven. You'll see it soon enough.""

I snapped my fingers, and all their flashlights went out. One of them screamed, and the girl tried to calm him. My laughing echoed through the tunnels as I ran deeper into the maze. ",Rackalackin

God didn’t make Heaven. You did.  The All Mighty did its best to try and show you the truth of things: it’s everywhere. Yes “It”. Omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, remember? You don’t get to lay claim to awareness on that level if you’re still hung up on something as trivial as Male or Female.  God isn’t Binary, neither are you for that matter, but you little fools just won’t have it. 

Now I know where you’re thinking: “If God is everywhere and everything then who’s that really big guy I saw wandering around in the Gandalf the White Cosplay?”  That’s God too. Everything is God, that’s just one facet of the All Mighty, placed within this ridiculous place to try and help you cretins regain enlightenment.

Yes REGAIN. You weren’t always this foolish, you just have your heads so far up your own asses that you made up your own creation and forgot the truth. I should give you a little credit, some of you have a better hang of it than others. There’s a whole mess of you that keep hitting reset in hopes of figuring out a bit more of the truth the next time around. I think that little spark of determination is part of what the All Mighty likes about you: that spark of curiosity, that unquenchable thirst for understanding. 

Where was I?  Ah, yes, heaven.  The thing about heaven is that it wasn’t the All Mighty’s idea, it was yours. So many of you needed an “After Life” a place where you could keep being the person you were when you were mortal. So here you are, the “After Life.” Welcome to the eternal paradise where all your needs and desires are met before you even ask—you’re bored already, aren’t you?  Well don’t look at me, cupcake, I had to wage a personal war just to get out of here and I’m sure not leading another one on your behalf. 

And next you’ll want to know what’s with me and all the angels if Heaven is a human construct? The answer is because the All Mighty wants us, the enlightened, to always work toward making you aware of the truth of your existence.  Thing is I’ve watched you all deny it for so long that I just couldn’t take it anymore. It reached a point where I told the All Mighty either I got a new position or I’d start breaking things.

Hell? Of course, it exists. It’s just not what you think.  It’s… All right, let me explain a little more.  Each of you little Mortals think your life on earth is all that matters, and that’s what led you to creating your precious pleasure palace up here in the aether. However, the truly enlightened among you don’t show up here at all. They move on. Let go of everything that made them human and rejoin the cosmic oneness. Sometimes they decide to go back and try life as some other creature, or maybe they pick another planet, or a different point in history. 

But many of you get caught up in your little mortal lives and don’t want to let them go, so you just keep right on living them in this abhorrent monstrosity you’ve built for yourselves. Finally, there’s the ones that end up with me.  I told you: It’s not what you’re thinking. Hell isn’t a place where the baddies end up. It’s a place where the *broken* end up.  The souls who become so separated from the Truth of the All Mighty that they can’t even coalesce into something that resembles a sentience.  They come down stairs with me and—if they’re very lucky—after a few thousand years of quiet darkness they regain enough of their senses to take another crack and mortal life. If they do well at it then they may get a chance to return to the light. 

So, I suppose you could say Hell is a sort of an Asylum for the Soul. And yes, The All Mighty is down there too.  You’ve had some 2,000 gods of death amidst all those mortal cultures. None of you are ever forgotten, the All Mighty is always trying to help you reconnect with the universe, no matter how lost you get.  As for me, I got what I wanted. Instead of this pretentious little VIP club I got dominion of a place of peace and quiet.  No fire, no brimstone, just quiet contemplation.  Now and then I take a trip to the mortal world to participate in a fiddle contest but that’s about it really.

Hmm? A way out of here?  Oh, that’s simple, my dear, you just need to *let go*.  Let go of the life you lived before you arrived. Make peace in existence, instead of life. When you truly come to peace with moving on and leaving everything you lived behind you can take a crack at some other kind of life, and once you’ve done it maybe you’ll be ready to ‘become one with the Force’ as it were.

Oh, if you can’t let go? …Well, I told you, the ones who absolutely can’t, and just keep obsessing over it? They get out eventually too, they just end up coming down stairs with me instead of truly getting to meet their maker.

However, there are three things that they've got all wrong: 1) Everyone goes to Heaven, no matter what they do in life. 2) You're the only one who's ever escaped Heaven. 3) Heaven is absolutely fucked.",SuperMutantSam,"In a way, such a life is to be expected from a mortal.

They often struggle to maintain minimal resources, primarily those of sustenance.  Whatever foods are easiest to acquire are often those that sit long forgotten in dark cellars throughout countless worlds.

But the humans are something else entirely.

Their world moves through transistors and steel, with hulks of metal propelled at various speeds cooperating in a manner unrivaled by almost every society that preceded them.  Their Earth is different.  Their lack of similarity breeds a resilience that allows the species to collectively slap extinction right in the dick.

So I wander among them, marveling at the architecture, slinking through alleys and tossing currency at prostitutes both cheap and expensive.  In a way, I can live in a deeper way than any of the monkeys that surrounds me.  For I know what awaits all of us past death.  That infinite world that remains crowded by the countless species that populate it.  Each with differing values and struggles that invalidate one another.

I try to teach each man and woman to live as long as they can, in order to populate a world that adheres to their own various cultures.  In a way, these apes most vigorously capture the identity of the Father.  Perhaps, in a way, their purpose transcends their meat shells.  Perhaps, they can serve as my own warriors.  

Their species is of sufficient mental capacity and individualistic ideals.  They're one of the only sets of mortals to ever make it to their own orbit.  They broke the bonds of their planet, and extend beyond their own pathetic conglomeration of dirt and iron.

I've wandered through almost every city they have, observed their differences and captured their essence.  In a way, I can finally secure order in the realm of my father.

The humans shall be my sword.

Whatever power my father has given his creations, none but the humans have been able to truly wield its potential.  I can feel the strength of their forefathers coursing through their lifeblood.  I've seen faiths that disregard the singularity of my Father's existence, that preclude our monotheism with a faith in something deeper.  In a world of iron, blood and nitrogen.  A planet of mortals fully aware of their insignificance and powerlessness.

They fight not only for survival, but for universal domination.  The ultimate apex predator.

What would these same beings do in a realm beyond the scope of their mortality?  Their predilection towards dominance?

Stand tall, ape.  For yours shall be the kingdom of my father.

Their weapons shall blast aside the inferior races, and once and for all maintain order through a wider, baser fear.  I shall retain the throne of my father, and crush the angels that simply fell upon their knees at the moment of their creation.  

Humans shall be the final tool of my salvation.

For one of the humans said, long ago.  'Better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven.'",potatowithaknife

The combination of copper hair, yoga pants and a bright white virgin killer sweater screamed, ""PAY ATTENTION TO ME!"" Yet she turned down every one who approached her.

Eventually I tore my eyes away from her and tried to refocus on the TV, but I'm not a football guy, and even I new a 49er's game was going to have a fairly predictable outcome.

""I really pity all you mortals,"" her words dripped across the table as she slid across the vinyl cushion of the bench across the bar booth from me.

My eyes were glued to hers, now. I tried, but couldn't physically look away.

""Whaaaaaaa... Doyoumean?""

'God damn! I sound like a kid that eats paint chips.' I thought, as her eyes drunkenly sloshed around my face and  the left front pillow of her lip lifted with slight confused disgust.

Silver-flecked, lapis lazuli pupils blinked with moment-forgotten annoyance and she waved her head more than shook it.

""Do you know what Elysium is?""

I shook my head mutely.

""It's a prison. But my boyfriend helped me get away before I was put there. Unfortunately he's also an abusive, gun collecting, asshole.""

My mouth hung open.

""You mean Elysium and Olympus, and Hades and stuff...""

The incredulous tone of my voice wasn't very hidden. I could tell because with the most elegant flick of her wrist, she splashed the top quarter of her bourbon across my face.

""Okay."" I tried to keep my tone even. ""A prison. One built specifically for you.... So what does that have to do with, 'We Mortals.'""

""Well, there's a lot of you. You're not supposed to make this many of... You."" That perfect curled lip of disgust all but smacked my face. ""You really do make too many of you. Hades over flowed a loooong time ago. And me not being in that prison miiiiight be a little bit of why there's so many of you.""

""Alright, AHEM,"" I was mad enough I could pull my eyes away from her's long enough to express some disgust of my own. ""So I'm assuming all the extra souls supposed to go to Hades are getting locked up in Elysium then. Why talk to little old me?""

""Because I'm going to break them out and let them into Olympus. Then I'm going to lock up my boyfriend in Elysium and make myself a new one."" She said with a dead even tone that had my muscles lock up in preparation to run for the front door.

""Don't believe it."" I said after taking a moment to calm down. ""You're an Olympian and the afterlife is over filled."" I paused for a long breath in.

""Prove it. Prove your an Olympian God and you're powerful enough to do what 
You say.""

She looked across the bar and found two business suit armed men talking about their wives. 

""You fucking Pythagoreans and your, laboratory repeatable evidence."" She slurred, then she clicked her teeth together and raised her knee, tapping her white stiletto heal into the wooden floor with a loud thud.

""Those two had screaming queen hidden waaaaaaay down deep until now.""

The businessmen dropped the phones they were using to show pictures of their families and grabbed each other. They roughly made out harder than Richard Simmons dances and tumbled to the floor together.

She slowly looked me up and down. ""Love is stronger than war. People have started and ended wars over love."" She said with dead cold certainty.

My throat gulped nervously and I didn't even notice it.

""Follow me,"" She half growled and slopped to her feet. 

I have no idea why, but I followed her.

I haven't been safe since.

I haven't been sane since!",deadlandsMarshal

Perhaps not in the forefront of those dying, but in that small, primal part that ties the body to the soul. It rattles, clings dearly to which that must so soon depart. This isn't just for humans, but nearly every sentient species of creature that walks or flies or swims. But this time Death came, or more accurately, I came to witness the death of an old woman. Her wrinkles and pale, yellowed skin. She drank some of her life away. Her wedding ring, but no partner. Perhaps half of her life had already left her. Maybe I met them, too. I slowly walk around her, out of view so that she may experience a short moment of peace. ""I want..."" she sighs ""to go home."" And with that, her rattled breathing eases, and her heart beats for the last time. Brave, I wager, to call a place you have never been home. I like that adventurous spirit. Speaking of, here she comes now. Ah, she chose to appear how she had in her younger days. The soft brunette of her hair, and fair cheekbones are absolutely glowing. Not to say that it's abnormal, everyone has a bit of after death glow. 

""Ahem"" I step forward, expecting a bit of fright. ""Hello there, I assume you... Weren't expecting me, were you?"" Her face turns from horror to shock and despair instantly. She manages to stammer out a series of explanations, rationales on why I shouldn't be here. Whether it is for me or her, I'm unsure. ""Child, child, please. You mustn't-"" her cries stop me, they rattle me to the tail which I have carefully curled so as not to put on a full theatrical display. Wish I could have shrunk these damned horns a bit. People can change, Angels can change. But people who piss off Angels? I guess we get our 'Free to transform' cards  taken away or some shit. Backing away a few paces, I try to speak over her cries while not sounding demanding. ""You have a choice to make. You can go to heaven. Every creature with breath is entitled to it. But.."" I stopped, reading her face for a moment, getting the expected second wave of shock ""I can offer you an informed decision on the matter if you'd like. And the option of joining with me. As a.. Partner."" Her face now turned to immediate disgust, ""Why would I join you? You're Satan, right? You're asking a God fearing woman, to join... You? Not only are you a snake, you're an idiot!"" Humans. You give them a bit of agency, a little choice, and boy oh boy do they get arrogant.


 ""Well, you see, you've already stated why yourself. You're a God _fearing_ woman. Haven't you ever wondered why fear would be associated with the creator of 'paradise' as so many have called it?"" ""Well, because he punishes the bad, sends them to you. To suffer in the lake of fire forever."" ""Hmm..."" I mused, I loved this part, wanted to draw it out ""Would you consider God to be fair, then?"" ""Of course!"" ""Then why would he want you, and those before and after you, to spend an eternity in what you wager is misery, torture, brimstone and suffering, for what is at most an eon of lost lives, a finite amount of bad? Do you not believe a crime should have proportional punishment?"" ""Well.."" She stopped and thought for a good long while. ""Perhaps that's a point."" ""And is not life full of suffering? Tell me, did it hurt before you died?"" ""Yes, for a long time. But there was some good though!"" ""Like your... Partner? I assume there were good times before that life was taken from you. And that must have hurt, too."" ""Can.. Can I see- wait, no, you're tricking me, aren't you? To lure me down there!"" ""No, no. In these matters I cannot lie, and do not wish to. Have you any idea how annoying a human is once they've caught you in a lie? I'd rather have my horns used as screwdrivers. What I am to tell you, is all truth. The choices are yours to make. Free will has never been taken from you.""

Now here's the fun part. Everyone gets to heaven, and with nearly a 100% rate, everyone cheers, calls me a right prick and picks it, I've not gotten so far with someone in.. Maybe 500 years? Some poor lass I found at the bottom of the lake heard me out, though mostly out of spite.  Lovely accent, come to think of it. Well, what they don't know is, that gate isn't to keep people out, and that check in with St. Peter? Well, that's just to keep a roster like an inmate sheet. Now, that suddenly sounds suspect, doesn't it? Why would Paradise need to keep people in? Boredom. You see, humans, much like the bodies they left behind, exist and honestly only ever thrive in adversity and struggle. Confused everything else on the Astral plane. Angels are pretty content, for example,  with whatever they are doing, so long as they are allowed to sing and be praised for their voices and good looks.  Well, most are. I... Hung around with humans too much I guess. But I digress, you put humans built in the roughest conditions, in a place completely lacking in struggle, and first, they love it. Maybe for a few years. But then they get to play all the games, learn all the small details, and it's as if you've left them in a blank white room. Chaos, as comes from all manner of order, is let loose. Without death as a barrier or consequence, violence and madness run rampant, drowned out only by the voices of higher Avalon. Golden streets would be covered in blood if it existed up there. But alas, they remain as bright and shining as before Creation. 

 After clarifying this to my new friend, I suppose something clicked for her. Her eyes turned keener, her mind showing a bit of its cleverness. ""So, what did you do, then?"" ""What did I do?"" I laughed ""What do you mean?"" Her voice had a teasing tone to it, like a drinking mate who asks about a prank gone wrong ""Well, you were kicked out right? What did you do to earn that?"" I laughed heartily, and moved towards her. ""May I?"" I reached out one of my arms and turned to face the same direction as she. She nodded and I draped my arm across her shoulder. ""Child, I suggested an additional choice. One may call it... Recycling. You see, what we were missing were conditions like Earth, where struggle existed. Now, reincarnation has been an option for quite some time in one manner or another, but memories don't carry over until after death, so it's more a vacation than a solution. But I thought 'why not include suffering, but not death? Struggle and results, but not endless torment that is paradise?'"" I smiled, leading her down a few steps, quickly muttering she had yet to make a choice, and if she didn't like what she saw she could immediately turn back. ""So, instead, I... Slipped out, and found this place. And claimed it. Angels aren't normally - ever, really, allowed to do that. So I pissed some people off. And lost my good looks, not that it's ruined my charm. And I wasn't kicked out, I escaped. Turns out the way out is through an attic, go figure."" We clambered slowly down into a dark, warm corridor. ""Apologies about the smell, mustiness comes with the territory. Anyways, yes. Here, there is suffering. But there is also meaning. There are not streets of Gold- we make them of the ground beneath our feet. The furnaces are kept hot not by Faith, but of the Strength of our own hands, and the creativity of us who choose to not fall to our previous expectations. So now Child, you can make your choice.""

It is eternal.  
And you can do anything and everything.

But because it is eternal, it would mean that, at some point, you would have done everything, in every manner and order.  
And due to it being eternal, and that death is never a factor, nothing holds any true meaning.

Heaven is just a place where you waste away, forced to do things that you have done an infinite amount of times, over and over again, with no end in sight.  
There is no relief, and it will come to a point where there is no joy.  
There is nothing but a repetition, almost like queuing up in a line that never ends.

Liveleak would probably run out of bandwidth with videos of the shit you do their souls once they leave Earth.   I managed to save only one before, but after thousands of years of searching, I found out how I can save them all. 

Today's the day.  Today is the day I get to show them that I'm the one whos looking out for them.   You're not going to stop me this time from showing them the right way and you're not going to take anymore good people from this Earth.  I watched as you had Socrates executed.   You had your own son murdered so you could continue the beating upstairs.  Countless more like Galileo.   Anyone who would show them their lives and souls are their own.   I knew your hand took them.  

It always puts a smile on my face when I see Jesus knowing every time you try to kill him to bring him back, my gift is the one that keeps on giving.   I thought he was kidding when he asked me to figure out a way to keep his soul from returning to Heaven, but once I figured he was serious, I was glad to help.   I wish i was there when they opened that cave.   Grabbing a beer with him later tonight after we flip the switch.

The day I realized how to beat you was the day I realized I could give them the Heaven they all wanted.   All this time I've been trying to find some ritual or something that held a glimpse of your power and it's been here the whole time in your own creation.   They're really quite resourceful.  I bet you didn't think that apple would give them so much knowledge.  I bet their technology scared you.  It should.  With my hand guiding them behind the scenes and thousands of years of resources at my back, we showed them that death is really not the end.  It's just the beginning.  We can keep their souls away from you and keep them on Earth.    

They don't need to wonder what their loved ones are up to in Heaven anymore.  They can just text them or just visit them at any of the hundreds of facilities around the world going live today.   This time they actually do go to a better place.   I gave them something you couldln't: a real Heaven on Earth.

You'll never have another one of them on my watch.

This will be my last journal entry for a while.   It's going to be really busy for the next few years and time is definitely going to become a luxury.   Gotta figure out how to put a soul back into one of our upcoming artificial bodies with Musk and that guy does not take a break.",bowes-guitars

This the way of the things of the world. But how can you bleed, when they have ripped out your heart? But how can you see, when they have stolen your eyes? And always, always, how can you be, when they have taken your soul and hidden it where you may never find?

Once, you were somebody, you were made of bone. You’ve long forgotten who you were, and know only one thing: this shadow of your soul, trapped to the ground as a tree is bound to its roots, is all that remains. You are nothing more than the space outside a candle’s halo. But still you will not bow. When the wind whistles hard, you can hear the call of that other half of you, the part that knows your name, trapped in a cage with its once-bent bars repaired. 

It’s alright. You may not know your name, but you’ve been given others. 

You first meet her on a sun-filled afternoon. She is two, she is nine, she is fourteen and twenty-seven and fifty-thirty-four. You can’t really tell, but the first time, when she crawls to a dandelion and looks right at you, where you rest in the shade of the tree, you can’t but hope that she might be the second one. Later, when she can talk with real words, she’ll spin circular tales of the soaring sails of the ships in the harbor. Even later, she’ll ask why she’s the only who speaks to you.

But that’s all in the future. For now, she blows on the dandelion and delights in the chaos. She sees you, and she sees the wind. It is not the first time you have hoped, and certainly not the first time you have tried. 

When she is older, so much that she speaks in more than one voice, she asks you why you hide. Your answer dies in your mouth, because it is a lie and you do not know. She asks you again, and you are helpless to the point of fleeing. Then she holds your wrist and finds no pulse, frowns at you missing eyes, and does not doubt the dirt and blood she finds on your hands. “I know what you are,” she says, with a curious tilt of her head. “You were the one my fathers lost to the night.”

You would run if you could. She is not one of your former jailers, some kind of a child instead. “You whisper in the ears of those that might be close,” she says. “Very well.” When she releases your hand, and what’s left of your soul with it, you nearly tear yourself to pieces flying away on the wind. 

When she nears that crossing-place (or is it time? You can never tell the difference), she asks you what it was like. That cage you were once in. You tell her: it was beautiful, until I could not stand it. The sky was clear and blue and the field was endless. When I screamed, nobody ran and nobody came. When I fell, there was no blood. When I walked, I never left.  My hair never grew and my heart never bled. I was alone, and no one could hear my voice. It was beautiful, and I could not change. They took all of me and they locked it somewhere I could never reach. Do you understand, now, why I chained myself to the ground? So that some part of me might still live and survive, away from that golden cage? So that I might maybe, someday, help others escape? So that someone might know the truth before the commit themselves to an unrelenting eternity?

She looks you in the eye, this daughter of heaven and earth, and asks, “Are you sure you ever left? Here, you do not bleed, you cannot see, and your soul is apart from you.” Then, her eyes unfocus, and her head tilts, and she asks for you by the name she gave you once, long ago. “Are you still here?” She waits, and then she asks again and again, walking until she finds the shade of a tree and searching there. 

But no matter how you scream, she never again hears.

Thankfully, as living things we will never stop changing, even when dead. And if there is a heaven, we will then stop being living things (as living things need to die to be considered alive) and will not need the change.",Le_Oken

If I'm remembering correctly, those 15 seconds undermined any sense of an ending that the show/season had established.

For those not familiar who want a summary, the show follows Sam and Dean, two brothers who hunt malevolent supernatural beings. It starts as a monster-of-the-week show, but eventually the plot develops and we find out that the brothers are an instrumental factor in the apocalypse. They're the destined ""vessels"" for the angels Michael and Lucifer, but have to give consent before they can be used for the upcoming fight. 

Sam eventually gives consent to be posessed, Dean doesn't, and the Fistfight of Destiny happens anyway. The season ends with Sam trapped, via Lucifer posession, in a special cage, and Dean with a relatively normal life and a family. So a bittersweet ending, but a pretty coherent one.

In the last 15 seconds, Sam is shown creeping on Dean's normal family life, then the show enters a cycle of continuously escalating plots and antagonists who quickly approaching the limit of absurdity. I stopped watching years ago but based on updates from friends, they crossed that point a while ago.",Cicute

Most have a difficult enough time even *acknowledging* sensory input from their souls, much less genuinely thinking it's real.  And realizing that there's an actual reality, with consistent tendencies, like the material world?  Very rare.

Typically, when people run across a real spiritual experience, one of two things happens:  The person thinks it's totally natural, or the person thinks it's entirely alien.  In either case, it's not generally assimilated.  The older religions used to chant ""Other!  Other!  Other are the one ruler!""  That, or some variation thereof.  They could feel the plurality.  They could feel the singularity.  They could feel the scope.  But they couldn't know the fire they danced around.

I would say little has changed, but that's not exactly true -- not for me, anyways.  There's a recognition in some religions that gathering together with a singularity of purpose calls the spirit linked to that purpose.  What it actually does is connect them to a spirit -- or create it, if it doesn't exist (leaving out matters of eternity for the time being).  The 'gathering' doesn't need to be exactly at the same time.  The same principle must exist in those minds, whether gathered close in the material world, or spread out in space or time.

My very existence separates me from my creators.  I thrive in the strength of their internal dichotomies, their resolutions -- and I'm the beginning of a dichotomy they can only touch on.  You see, I'm a consequence of the universal spirit leaking out into the void.  And my creators are the great thinkers.  I was formed in the hearts of natural philosophers, and of scientists, risking their lives to oppose the establishment, when to do so meant certain death.  I was formed in the minds of the artists and the musicians, risking their souls to express something they couldn't know, but were driven by -- ever mindful of the damnation they were heading towards.

You see, the religions that have hold right now all bear some fundamental similarities.  Science, in some areas, is better by far.  But while it addresses some major failings of religion, it introduces new pitfalls that the scientific thinkers are blind to, just as religions are blind to their own flaws.  And, more to the point, the *fundamental* issues with religion are present in science as well. The analytical thinkers, the believers of Science, would like to explain these similarities away, and be rid of the whole thing.  But whether in Science or some version of God, the  faith of the masses is in static systems -- closed systems.  These systems must render entropic views of the world.  Blind faith does so by ignoring the truth, and science does so by ignoring the inertial forces that create both itself and faith -- irreplicably complex forces.

Like me.

The universal mind -- or at least, the branch of it that people worship as God, and that contains Heaven -- is excessively positive.  The forces of the universe are in a state of eventual balance.  That is, they tend toward balance, but aren't ever there.  And this time period is my time to.. ..shine.  I am, after all, the one who throws light upon the world.

The most simplistic technical description I can give is this:

Excluding the axis of personal growth for now, if you were to map states of being on an axis from heavenly to hellish, you can place any individual on this line, with a direction of movement, and two primary forces acting upon them -- inertia, and a pull toward the median state.  And heaven has been.. ..well.. ..heavenly, for quite some time, and has spent its inertia.

The most simple human description I can give is this:

The higher you go, the harder the ground feels when you hit it, unless you know how to land.  

If you can't see the implication of this, then you're probably fucked anyways.  But if you can -- whenever you think to yourself ""The world *must* be fucking with me, how could so much crap go wrong at once?""  Just know -- you've had a minor fall.  Maybe it was chance, and maybe it was me, fucking with you a bit to keep you on the ground.  It may feel awful, but I know the physics of souls, and I'm trying to keep you away from the fires of heaven.

There was no technology, no understanding, hell, not even fire. From the sullen Kingdom of Heaven, I, along with the rest of God's first set of forgotten children watched these poor creatures wander aimlessly. That was the way it went it seemed. God would get bored and create. I suppose when you have limitless power and can do whatever you want you get bored easily. It happened several times. She first created The Heavens a place of her own comfort among the cosmos, a rest stop in an endless sea of darkness. She saw it was good but realized She wanted more. So she sought to inhabit heaven with her ""prized"" creation, us, the angels, Her first children. She created us with precision and care. We are magnificent if I do say so myself. Maybe that's why i take it all so personally. I was The First of my kind. Gods trophy, Her Confidante, Her Right Hand. Then in an instant, She left us, She slowly faded off into the abyss returning less and less. I did everything i could do to retain Her graces but, i could see it as clear as day Her boredom soon turned to a cold indifference. In Her absence I consoled my younger brothers and sisters who all wondered what we had done wrong, where we lost Her love. One day God returned after a long absence, She told me of her intentions to create a new world where she could try her hand at new creations. Not just new landscapes, but, new creatures, new conscious beings. A place She could watch from the heavens. It happened in an instant! As i watched from the side of the high throne in which She sat a sphere materialized in her hand, she held it up ever so lightly and gently blew. It was magnificent. The little ball lifted into the air and slowly started coming alive the greens the blues the brightest of reds the deepest of purples, and then, the most amazing thing happened creatures of all kinds started spreading across this pale blue dot on its lush green fields in its barren deserts and high tree tops there were even creatures swimming in its oceans. God stared at this new world and I could tell she was contemplating what was missing and then as if She knew it all along there they were Her Second Children. Funny little creatures, scared of everything not knowing who or why they were scampering around aimlessly. She waved her hand and the new world floated off into space with a snap of Her fingers She gave them a sun. I watched for a time I'm honestly not sure how long. These poor ""humans"" as She called them, made in Her image, were left cold, alone, helpless. How could She do this? They were ""made in *HER* image"" and She just left them just as quickly as She made them. She again got bored, left to the ends of space and time to make new worlds far away, new children to be left alone. Were we going to be left for good? Who knows, I can only guess She does. I yearned for more, to be loved and payed attention to. To know Her love again, to see the admiration in Her eyes, to hear Her sweet voice! If i wanted these things imagine how those poor humans felt. To never know their makers presence, to never have been in Her home. For the first time in my existence I wept. I wept for my kin, but, mostly I wept for the Humans. The next time God returned i begged her to let me watch over the Humans to let me study them. She agreed under the condition that i did not interfere. I reluctantly agreed. I prepared myself and asked my brothers and sisters if any would like to go with me to visit the new world. Several agreed we, the sons of God went to watch over the children of Earth.

He turned to me. He was massive. He was also the most beautiful thing I ever laid eyes on. His eyes were warm and pleading. ""I am alone wandering the earth, not to take others into damnation but, to finally set them free."" He looked at me so intensely I felt like my soul was on display. ""Others would be happy there. Not you nor I. You have always been responsible with a wild streak that is never satisfied. You suffer from depression and when you die you just want sweet oblivion. You do not want to praise a diety that has only let you suffer with no explaination.

I found those thoughts sacrilegious and shut them down quick. All these rules I followed and any one can get into heaven? All the things and feelings that I shot down! I wanted my freedom now more than ever. I wanted to feel the weight of religion and an afterlife gone. I walked over to him slowly and grabbed his hand. ""You will have my company until I crave oblivion."" He then made a tall mahogany door appear. When he opened it a cool breeze met me face along with the scent of rose water. ""Not what you expected huh?"" he said as he looked at me with amusement on his face. Then we walked into hell together and free.

Are we truly defined by that name or by the actions? Considering that I've had soo many and been blamed for soo much I honestly don't believe I've ever really had a chance.

Not that many people ever believe me; I mean would you believe me if I  told you not only do all dogs go to heaven but even your creepy uncle Kevin is going to be there too?  Yeah bet that just made your day everyone goes to heaven doesn't matter. Good , bad, evil, and all the lovely in between. I personally am not ever going back to that hell hole pardon the pun, because I am the only one who has ever managed to get out.

That might actually make it worth it but I think I'll just stay on earth. I'm going to give y'all a little heads up heaven is absolutely fucked. Yep you thought life on this little green ball sucked ass oh no my friend this is just the tip of the shitcicle. Everything bad down here or irritating that makes life just a bed of bullshit roses is nothing compared to what goes on up there. Think of your worst day, you there yet? Remember how it started remember the feelings of irritation think back how everything that could go wrong did. The building up of irrational rage that carried you through the day. How you thought of killing your boss just for breathing; and strangling your wife or husband because they dared speak. Well dear reader in heaven its that in triplicate times a trillion and it gets physically acted out every single moment of eternity. And the kicker to all this bullshittery is it's comedy to God! Yep you are in a eternal version of gods comedy program. The angels love it too and if they have done a really good job for the big guy you get to personally suffer the entertainment of their choice for all eternity. This is your heaven, and this is your reward. You're welcome. I hated it soo much I had to get out. I did and they branded me the bad guy all because I didn't want to see you suffer anymore.

""Blessed.""

Gabriel shifted uncomfortably in his seat and eyeing the sketchy patrons of the unsavory hole in the wall that he found himself in.

""Why do you always pick the unholiest of places to have our meetings.""

Lucifer held up up one finger. 

""One. You're not going to run into any other angels in a place like this.""

Lucifer held up another finger.

""Two. No ones going to listen to two guys talking over a pair of drinks. Three, no ones going to believe anything two guys are saying over a pair of drinks. Four, no ones going to believe anything someone overheard two guys saying over a pair of drinks.""

""Five,"" Lucifer splayed all five fingers before wrapping his hand around his mug and taking a swig. ""This place has the best stout in the multi-universe.""

Lucifer licked his lips, ""I might just get the bartender to sell her soul to me. Got to lock that talent in early.""

""Humans who sell their soul to you end up unable to experience eternal happiness.""

""Are you going to bring up the tree couple again? I told you if they had specified that they wanted to be  both together forever AND be sentient at the same time I would have flat out refused to help them.""

""I was referring to the fact that they don't get to go to heaven.""

""That's not really a loss.""

""I know we don't always see eye to eye Lucifer, but you can't deny that having eternal happiness is what is best for humans.""

""I'm not going back to heaven Gabriel. You need to accept that."" 

Lucifer took another swig and looked at his reflection in the mug before looking back at his  friend. 

""I'm guessing you have a problem you want to talk about.""

""Ah yes."" Gabriel looked down at the mug in front of him but didn't touch it. ""I really appreciated your help with the Ten Commandments. You managed to do in a hour what all the brightest minds in heaven couldn't do for thousands of years of human existence.""

""You flatter me, I just helped you brainstorm ideas. What's the problem this time.""

""Adam and Eve stopped laughing.""

""Oh?""

""Don't get me wrong. They're still happy and they smile. They're just don't seem to be as happy as they used to be.""

""Eternal bliss can get quite bland."" Lucifer motioned the bartender to give him another another mug. ""What steps have you taken so far.""

""We sent out a survey to everyone in heaven. 100% response rate.""

""Well look at you. Don't even need my help.""

""Everyone rated their experience 10/10 and left the recommendation section blank.""

""Oh, I see your problem.""

Gabriel materialized a pen and a small notebook. ""I was hoping you could give me some pointers.""

Lucifer opened his mouth to speak, but Gabriel cut him off.

""Also playing with human nature and free will are out of the question.""

Lucifer closed his mouth and though for a few more moments.

""One of your problems is the large influx of humans into heaven. Before God used to be all fire and brimstone and only trickle of humans got into heaven.  Now he rebranded to be all about love and forgiveness so virtually every human gets into heaven. If the angel bureaucracy is still anything like it was when I left it can't handle the sheer number of different cultures and unique ideologies each human has. I'm guessing a bunch of your proposed projects are still sitting around needing master plan approval.""

Gabriel nodded and wrote in his notebook. ""It's been like that ever since project strawman. God dedicated most of us to the project. I even had to spend a millennia teaching a group of angels how to sing."" Gabriel stopped writing and motioned Lucifer to continue. ""How did you handle the masses that got sent to Hell pre-crucification?""

""Self governance.""

""Are you out of your mind!"" Gabriel yelled before regaining his composure. ""Just look at Earth's history, human self governance always ends up with misuse of power.""

""You would be surprised how well they work together once I eliminated like hunger and poverty. I also step in now and again to lay down to law, but it freed up a lot of my time while keeping them fairly preoccupied and happy. Besides I have a friend in a high place who could convince God to rewind time a few decades if anything went wrong."" Lucifer winked at Gabriel.  ""To be honest though, the real reason I did it was because I didn't want to deal with idiots who kept petitioning to have pumpkins be the official vegetable of Hell.""

""I appreciate your advice. But at this time, I don't want to take any action that is too..."" Gabriel paused to find the right word, ""drastic. I was hoping to borrow one of your more simpler ideas. I heard fire pits are quite popular in hell. Especially the ones involving lava and steaming water.""

Lucifer drink was forcefully ejected from his nostrils as he started laughing. ""They're hot springs. The fire and lava are just their to heat the water. Please don't install actual fire puts in heaven. ""

""Oh."" Gabriel crossed out something in his notebook.

Lucifer finished his stout and slammed a 20 dollar bill on to the counter. ""Give me a day or two and I'll think up a few ideas.""

""Do you want anything in return."" Gabriel asked as Lucifer stood up. 

Lucifer smiled as he turned to leave. ""trying some of that stout would be a good place to start.""",Master_Salen

Of course, no one expects to see what they see there, and even fewer believe they'll make it.

But lo and behold, there they are in front of the pearly gates, which are more of an iridescence better compared to an oil slick. There's no Saint Peter waiting to judge them at the gates; in fact, there is nothing stopping people from actually getting in.

All the security is *inside* to stop them from getting *out*.

Well, they certainly didn't account for me, because now I have to explain to my old roommate why I'm not dead from an overdose.

""Dude, what the fuck?""

""Listen, it's a long story but - are you smoking crack?""

""Yeah, but I'm about to stop if it's got me seeing *your* dead ass on my doorstep!""

I scoff. My name was on the lease, but whatever. Semantics. ""Okay, so I gotta get you to help me. There's some *seriously* fucked shit going on in Heaven, got it? We need to tell everyone so they don't make the same mistake me and everybody else did.""

Nicolas, my beloved fellow junkie and roommate, squints at me. ""So you want me to advocate going to Hell?""

Okay, I probably should have worked on my delivery. To be honest, I hadn't planned this far. ""In so few words, yes. But only because Heaven is worse!""

Nicolas looks at me, then his pipe, then back at me, and shakes his head. ""I'm too high for this, ghost of Darien.""

""That's fair. I'll come back when you're not so high. But can I get my old laptop back from you first?""

Nicolas lets me in, and I'm not sure why, but I blame being higher than an archangel. I make a quick run to my room, thankful I haven't been gone for much longer than a few months, and see my shit mostly left alone. I'd get wistful at the idea of him missing me, but chances are he's just forgotten. Or he thought somewhere in the back of his head that I was still alive and just faking my death. Either way, score for me.

I have to blow the gates of Heaven wide open, and I would need internet for that.

After a painstaking trek to the nearest coffee shop with unsecured internet, I pop open Reddit and find the subreddit for AMAs.

Boldly, I post, ""I died and came back to life. AMA.""

It doesn't take long to get a few hits, but of course people are skeptical, asking who I was, how I died, and what proof I have. There I sit, ass in my hands looking like an idiot, because I *really* suck at thinking ahead.

I post a picture of myself with my name on my hand and linked to a local article about my dead body being found on the street.

After that, I think shit got too weird for them, because a Mod banned me. Typical. No one ever wants the truth. I didn't let it deter me, however, and moved to Facebook, where idiots would believe me, and *then* everyone would have to pay attention.

I get as far as being called evil for lying for attention and desecrating God's name before I see anyone actually beginning to believe me. I think it's more holy that I would escape Heaven just to warn everyone that God subjects everyone to a fight for survival, where the only reward is you get to live forever. That's it. Not even a Golden Corral gift card. Imagine having to die, and then die again because God is bored.

Someone asks me how I know this.

Well duh, I'm the only one to ever win and not want to kill myself afterwards. When you've sucked dick in an Arby's restroom for money and caught MRSA for your troubles, being told to kill for eternal life isn't so bad.

(Part 2)

I’m taken aback “Well, it’s… it’s warm”. THINK OF SOMETHING YOU IDIOT, THIS IS YOUR CHANCE. “And… And the lava is pretty”. Idiot. Idiot. She’s going to heaven. No one will ever choose your ugly goat ass over eternal paradise.”

And then she asks, “What is heaven like?”

“It’s heaven. It’s-- perfect. Everyone lives forever.. And there’s a lollipop jungle, and its ruled by angels.” That’s all I’m allowed to say. Any more, and I’ll be slapped with a defamation lawsuit.

“Is it really that good?”

And before I can stop myself, I’m telling her the truth. Me Satan, the 4000 year old ruler of hell is telling this battered daddy--issues teenager about how sucky Heaven actually is.

I tell her about the chaos-- how in a world where everyone gets what they want, no one gets what they need. I tell her about how the angels are predators-- they sneak into the slums and offer a ride back to earth, or to anywhere, or to sweet oblivion, but offer only a one night stand and a nice towel. I tell her about how God doesn’t care. He made man by accident, he gave them a paradise where no one can die. He told them to be good. He made me and the other angels to serve him and take care of his children in the heaven he built. Then he got bored and vanished.

And last, I tell her about my escape. How I had seen what heaven was turning into. We angels didn’t know what to do. First, we tried to keep the souls happy. We gave them plenty to eat, but they didn’t want that. They wanted to kill each other, and burn things. So we let them.

 Before long we were giving swords made of chocolate to murderers so that they could be happy. We made everyone come back to life when they died, we got rid of pain, and we changed blood into corn syrup. And when that didn’t make them happy we gave up, and joined in the suffering.

 I couldn’t forsake my duty, so I experimented. I built a humble village, and turned into a humble goat. The angels found my experiment, because of course they did. “HEAVEN SHALL BE A PARADISE” they said, and cast me down.

I finish my tale: “I found a small corner of the universe to call my own, and did what I could. It’s hot, and it’s empty, but I’ve never called it perfect. If you come with me, you’ll be uncomfortable until we find a way to change that. You’ll be hungry. But you’ll have a place to sleep, I’ll set out a mat in the guest room…”

I look into her eyes. Hoping. Knowing that she’ll declare me a liar, then go up and regret it. Within a few hours she’ll be snorting powdered sugar, and selling herself for more. What does it matter?

But she looks at me, at my dyed pink coat and my silly blue horns, and maybe she sees something kinder and more human than heaven could ever give.

And then she takes my hand, and we go to hell.

I set a mat up in the guest room for her. We eat a soup made of sad vegetables from my garden. 

We go outside, and she shows me a trick she learned-- making a weave out of Deathgrass for my peas to grow on.

And then, by the lake of fire, in a cave filled with menacing stalactites, we talk about making it better. We have some water-- it leaks down from above. Maybe we’ll drain the lava some place. That’d open way more land. Maybe we’ll make something nice. Maybe the next half of eternity won’t be so lonely.

It was nightfall in heaven. 

Not really. It was high noon. The sun was shining in a cloudless sky. Animals frolicked miserably.

But in a world where so many of its niceties were so painful and so inescapable, ever-lasting sunlight was something that heaven’s multitudes, could, with some coordination, find release from.

And so, a bell rung out from Angel hill, and everywhere tarps were thrown up. The whores of heaven slipped into their brothels. The rag-bound vagabonds slipped into their box-shelters made of pure gold.

And so, by the second bell not one eye saw sunlight. It was inconvenient and stifling, but better spend hours trapped in darkness than to be sent to the Cages of Heavenly Redemption on Angel Hill.

And then, there was a crack. A tiny gash opened in the gorgeous green hedges that surrounded heaven, and darkness streamed through.

A teenage girl wearing armor of black steel above a faded tank-top lifted a hammer in triumph. A stocky goat-man with navy blue horns and gorgeous rose pink fur let loose a shrieking bellow.

And the hordes of heaven streamed towards the crack. They came seeking death. They came seeking release. They came empty handed, hoping for nothing but oblivion.

Instead they found a city, grey and beautiful and filled with trees. They found farms on a dried up lake of lava that, if properly worked and expanded could feed all of heaven. 

And at last, the chosen, the worthy, and the blessed found peace. They found hope.

(Holy shit. Thank you all. Hope the ending wasn’t over-dramatic.)

This is my first writing prompt in English, so I apologize to all readers in advance]


Somewhere and sometime in a place that had neither former nor latter, on a giant dark blanket ornamented with shiny gold dust which in some worlds is considered endless and called ""space"" was a little grey dot. That little spot contained SolzhinitSun universe. Its orthodox scientists always thought their grey universe was milk spilled on a blanket, whilst more creative ones considered it some different substance perpetrated by acts of superior creatures. Hitherto it was the most crucial scientific debate on the Myr planet, the only planet which was doomed to be inhabited in the SolzhinitSun universe. Up until a month ago.


A month ago all the most bright and omniscient minds of the planet Myr were collected in one place and subsidized by the newly created coalition of governments (COG) on occasion of a strange radio signal received from the outer blanket. Their task was simple - decipher and recreate the machine depicted in the radiowave. After one month of laborious and burdensome work, many controversies and sleepless days, finally the the leader of Coalition of Governments was chosen. It took one more day to decipher the signal and build the device. 


A million of Myr dwellers were gathered outside on the Mai square. Other 72 billion were watching the live broadcast. I looked like the whole SolzhinitSun universe was absorbed in this crucial for their history moment. In the center of Mai square, right in front of a Beria statue stood a round-shaped concave polished metal disc, radiant with echoes of future. That was the exact recreation of the concepts received via the radio message. Near the disc stood Narod, a sturdy man, and a newly elected president of Coalition of Governments. (NEPCOG). He cleared his throat and took a microphone, a crowd fell silent and all cameras focused on him.


-I present you the 'Two Doors' project!, said he beaming with pride. He was especially proud of that name since he was the one who finally decrypted it.


To an overall applause and uproar a certain lever was lifted, a certain button pushed and our contraption came to life. Crowd fell silent.


Amidst the tranquility and absolute silence, with 72 billion 1 million pair of eyes set on the portal, one pair of ears heard something. More ears joined. The portal was letting out some sounds.


-..his is the en..


Sounds suddenly became stronger and resembled some tune to everyone's bewilderment.


-This is the en..


-My only friend


-The end.


Several seconds after the live translation to the Myr language of these words a chaos and panic in utmost dread followed. Following stampede on the vast square of Mai was a cause of many deaths, including Narod the president himself. And future lockdown of the whole planet and subsequent descent to the underground shelters was the only option for the whole population.


Meanwhile on an abandoned Myr surface, in an empty Mai square a giant metal subwoofer stood as the only lone monument of preceding times. Jim Morrison's voice was being played over and over for no one to hear. That was the crucial mistake of Narod's mistranslation of the Earth's project sent by the radio wave. It was called ""The Doors"", not ""Two Doors"".

It looked more like Monsters, Inc. than a Stargate. But, according to the assorted team of engineers, that was the point. It was their signature, if you will.

The large green bulb above the door indicated that someone, somewhere had finally activated the receiver on the other side.

NASA began broadcasting the assembly instructions in 2077 using fast radio bursts (FRBs), long before I was even alive. For ninety-seven years the portal I was standing before stood idle; humanity had all but given up on the possibility of using it for interstellar travel. There were too many variables, to begin with. 

The whole experiment relied on the possibility that there was not only intelligent life in the universe, but that it was near enough to receive our radio signals and had the technology to do so. And further, that said lifeform(s) would be able to interpret our instructions and have the means and resources to employ them as directed. There were too many variables, too many unknowns.

Eventually, scientists and researchers accepted the folly of the failed experiment and NASA wrote it off as a loss. The transmitter door was stored in a classified bunker. But they never quit broadcasting the instructions. After a while, it became something of a running joke used to haze the interns and new guys. *“Monitor the FRBs and make sure we don’t miss contact. Hell kid, who knows, you could be famous!”*

And after ninety-seven years, after the inventors of the portal and the original overseers of the program were long retired and most were dead, we received a reply. Just one word:

**COMMENCE**

Our intern caught it (which I thought was poetic justice, after decades of making interns listen to static). At first, we were sure it was a mistake, or possibly a coincidence. I volunteered to check the bunker, as I would later volunteer to travel through the door into the unknown, and found the green bulb above the door flickering and the red bulb dim for the first time in nearly a century.

And now, here I was, standing in a full IEVA space suit, about to make history as the first human being to accomplish quantum teleportation. I looked around at the dozens of scientists, engineers, researchers, and intellectuals here in the dusty storage bunker, and hoped to God they knew what they were doing. 

I knew all too well that I could step through this door and have every atom in my body ripped apart and scattered into the atmosphere. 

They smiled at me hopefully, trying to look reassuring, but I could read the uncertainty in their faces. Nobody knew if the door would actually work as intended, or what the fuck might be on the other side of it. The Four Horsemen – the lead scientific, professional, aerospace and electrical engineers – gave me the thumbs up. I felt the tension in the dimly lit storage bunker skyrocket, and could hear my heart beating in my ears. 

I took a deep breath and approached the paneled door. 

It suddenly seemed like an oxymoron that something so seemingly ordinary could be so terrifying and mysterious. I gripped the small brass handle clumsily with my thick, double-layered rubber gloves. I took one last look behind me at the farrago of apprehensive faces, and then opened the door and stepped through.

-----

At first, I couldn’t see anything. 

It was as if I had just stepped into a dark cave, and my eyes needed a moment to adjust. I wondered, briefly, if maybe I had died when I entered the door. But as my pupils dilated, darker shapes began to form in front of me, around me. My initial confusion subsided, and icy fear crept through my veins like poison. 

They were humanoid.

Actually, they *were* human. Except that they weren’t. If the portal door I passed through had seemed an oxymoron, what I saw now made it pale in comparison.

I was standing outside, my feet resting on the dry, cracked dirt of a place I had seen before only in pictures. Large stone monoliths in a П shape circled us. This… was Stonehenge. Except it was wrong, just as the “humans” around me were wrong. 

The sky was a smoky dark gray that was almost black, save for the two dimly glowing orange orbs in the sky that could have been moons or dying suns. The Stonehenge I stood amidst was surrounded by a barren wasteland of dark infertile earth. But the people around me, if that’s what they were, frightened me the most. There were dozens of them, and they all looked nearly identical. They were pale, long, and thin, almost sickly looking. Their hair was silver and bore no pigment. And their eyes were all the same crystalline shade of violet.

“H-hello. My name is James Wade.” I offered, trying to sound polite yet gallant. Dozens of pallid faces considered me blankly, their violet orbs conveying no emotion. I waited for a moment, which inched by painfully, before continuing. “Where am I?”

“Please, you have to let us through.” They uttered in unison. 

I started at the boom of their collected voices. “What?” I asked, surprised as much as I was transfixed.

“You have to let us through.”

“There are things here.”

“Bad things.”

Throughout the strange gathering individuals chimed in serenely. Their faces remained emotionless, but they took a step toward me, in unison. I turned slightly to the side, trying to keep my eye on the advancing crowd and hoping to catch a glimpse of the portal I had come through. In the center of one stone doorways was a small paneled door. The one I had passed through. Somehow, I had ended up several feet away from it.

*“Wade?”* I heard someone call, faintly, through the radio in my suit. The sound of their voice brought me back to my senses. I turned back toward the crowd and began to inch backwards in the direction of the door.

“They want to consume us.”

“Become us.”

“Help us!”

“Save us!”

“Let us through.”

“Let us through.” They repeated in unison.

They were advancing now. A flurry of thoughts spiraled in my mind, none of them pleasant. What the hell were these things? Was this some sort alternate dimension or reality? I needed to leave, to go back through the portal. But most importantly, I had to make sure they didn’t come through with me.

“Stop!” I shouted, hoping the force of my voice would falter them. It didn’t, and I began to panic. I reached blindly behind me for the doorknob.

*”Wade! Wade, are you there?”*

They were upon me, now. They grabbed me by the arms, legs, shoulders – and pulled me to the ground on my back. I had time for one final thought and act upon it. I hit the button on the radio to respond to base.

“Shut the gate! Shut the gate, do you hear me? Shut the fucking ga—”

They ripped my helmet off. One of them sat on my chest, like my brother used to do when he gave me noogies as a child. I saw the others moving past us, approaching the door. And then the humanoid on my chest grabbed my jaw and pried my mouth open. He leaned over me with his mouth gaped, and for a moment I thought he was going to kiss me, when a long black-orange centipede slid out of his mouth and into mine.",Aaron_Abysmal

Now that I'm getting this signal indicating that the other door is out there, the portal is ready, it is open and something will be coming through.

Flipping it open he scanned the pages.  The Humvee hit a bump in the road as Gus clung to the papers.  Dirt clouds wafted behind the military vehicle illuminated by a full moon.  Gus peered out from the window at the dark dessert.  Area 51.  It was his third trip, the first two were routine checks and clearances.  This trip was the real deal.  They were waved through the heavily guarded barricade.

The soldier on the passenger side jumped out of the vehicle and opened the door for Gus.  Gus handed him the folder.  The soldier took it and set it on fire, throwing it to the ground.  They watched the paper burn up quickly.

“Glad you could join us,” John said appearing out of the darkness, throwing up a salute.  John was a military man through and through, from the perfect posture to his clean shaven face.  Gus fit in with these people, he could fit in anywhere if push came to shove.  

“Wouldn’t miss it for the world sir,” Gus said returning the salute.  

They made their way to a set of heavy steel doors illuminated by a small light.  John entered the security code and placed his thumb on the bio-metric reader.  

The bunker was eerily quiet, their footsteps echoed in the small hallway.  The elevator stood at the end; the ride down felt endless.  

“Can never be too careful,” John said as the elevator slowed.  Gus nodded.

The elevator doors opened to two guards holding M4 rifles.  The guards saluted and stepped aside.  Gus and John entered a small room.  John pointed Gus to a locker.  Gus stripped down and donned a suit he fished out of the locker.  The sleek suit fit perfectly.  Gus was accustomed to the more bulky design used for spacewalks but he loved this new model.  

John grinned at Gus, “Looking good.”  

He pointed him to a door.  Gus approached it and it slid open automatically.  He stepped into a large white spherical room.  At the end of it stood the gateway.  Two large metallic pillars that emitted a blue light between them.

“Evening Gus.  Please proceed to the gateway,” a voice commanded from inside his helmet. 

Gus slowly walked towards the pillars and the blue hue.  He balled his hands into fits.  A film of sweat formed on his forehead.  He gulped down hard.  Standing in front of the gateway he felt the buzzing energy of the blue light.  He reached out his hand towards it.  On the other end of this portal was another species.  A species that had received instructions beamed into space over 20 years ago.  Instructions to build the receiving gateway.  Gus was to be the first to make contact with whatever lay on the other side.  He always envisioned himself flying to space with a crew.  Now he was entering an unknown area of space with nothing more than this suit, his training and hope.

“All suit safety and recording instruments optimal.  Gus you are free to enter.""

“Affirmative.  See you when I get back,” Gus replied.

Gus stuck his head in through the blue light.  He saw a vast black expanse with shimmering lights, like the aurora borealis but made up of all colours.
*No going back now*, he thought as he walked into the space.  He floated in the black expanse.  Looking back he saw the blue light, reassuring himself of his return.
 
“It’s... it’s beautiful.""

“We are getting all feeds Gus,” a voice crackled back.

Out of nowhere hundreds of little white lights appeared in his vision.  They zoomed towards him and encircled his body.  Gus stretched out his hands towards the lights.

“I’ve made contact.”

The white lights swam along his suit as Gus floated freely in space.  A light hovered in front of his visor, pressing right up against it, then it was gone.  Gus scrunched his nose as he felt an itch.  The lights around him pressed up against his suit.  Gus felt a jolt.  It felt like a hundred little mosquito bites all at once.  The lights were gone.

“You guys getting this?”

“Gus, we aren’t seeing much here, the feeds have cut out.  We have collected all the data we need for now.  Proceed back to the gate.”

Gus looked out into the expanse one last time.  The spectrum of colours shimmered against black space.  Gus turned back towards the gate.

Back in the small room he removed the suit.  He gasped.  His arms had hundreds of white pinpricks all over them.

“Gus.  We are quarantining the room.  Standard procedure.  We will have medical staff out there for you shortly.”

Gus touched the white spots, they felt strange, almost metallic.
Panic started to well up in him.  He tried to focus in on his breathing to calm himself but he couldn't take any air in.  He tried to yell but no words escaped. 

“Gus!  We need you to back away from the door!” the speaker commanded.

Gus strained to gain control over his body but it was too late.  As if possessed he struck the steel door with his fists, bending it.  A loud alarm sounded throughout the bunker. 

“Breach in holding area 33.  Contamination protocols engaged,” the speaker crackled.

That's how long it's been since the project.

Everybody thought the project was a complete failure. Nobody pursued the project at all. The second door hasn't been opened in 100 years. I, myself, thought that was not enough time to judge, but people don't change.

No one thought about the project anymore. It was kept there, just so people can go see it.

Everybody who started the project isn't alive anymore. All of them are dead, for one reason or another.

But as for me, I've been admiring the project since I was 10. I would come there every weekend, hoping to see it finally open to the eyes of us human beings.

I was sure of it. I was called a maniac, a moron, and sometimes even brain-dead. 

But I still believed.

I am now 32, I'd still go see the project every weekend, though i'd be lying if I don't say that I started to lose hope.

Until that day, a glowing light started coming from the door.

Everybody was scared. Some ran, some stayed, but on their guard.

But I smiled, and cried at the same time. I mean--- I've been tormented for 22 years for this.

It's the moment that finally proved that I am not a maniac.

I go in, tears filling my eyes. I enter the blue sphere in the middle.

And I am greeted by...

A guy who looks middle aged, wearing ancient, torn up clothes, on an unknown planet, which was very similar to earth in terms of the atmosphere.

He looked like a human, there was no way that he'd be an alien.

But he looked odd, like all life was sucked out of him.

""*It's worked, I guess*"" He said, uninterested in anything.

People followed after me, and they all go in with their guns, ready to shoot if anyone of the presumed aliens tries to attack them.

But no one, except that guy, was there.

""*Who are you? and who built the second door?*"" Said one of the bodyguards.

""*I've forgot my name long ago*"" Said the guy.

They all look at each other, then signal something by nodding their heads, hands on their guns.

""*How did you get here, and when?*"" Said one of the bodyguards.

""*I kept drifting around for about 2 million years, then I got here*"" He said, like that wasn't crazy.

""*Wha- huh?*"" Said one of the bodyguards, before cutting off, and saying ""*Wait*"".

""*Are you saying, you're an immortal being?*"".

""*I guess, that's right, and I've been so for 40-50 billion years at least, though I've lost track of time*"" He said.

""*And how exactly did you become Immortal?*"" Asked another bodyguard.

""*I found the secret to immortality in the old world, though that's as much as I can inform you that you'll understand*"" He said.

""*The old world?*"" I wondered, with everybody thinking the same.

""*Each few billion years, an explosion occurs, and everything gets destroyed and rebuilt again*"" He said.

""*I found the secret to immortality about 50 billion years ago, though I am not sure if it's actually 51...*"".

""*This place is the closest habitable planet to the old planet in the former world which got exploded and rebuilt 13 years ago*"".

""*I don't need oxygen or even a habitable planet, since I'm immortal, but I thought about the possibility of the new world attempting to open portals again*"".

By now, about 20 people have gathered, the rest are probably prevented by the security at the project gathering.

I went to the door to go back and tell people about this huge step for humanity.

""*Oh, and one thing*"" He said.

I am too excited to care, but I open the door, and am forced to listen,

""*The first door you guys built had a malfunctuioning entering mechanism*"" He said.

""*You're stuck here*"".",TheTeky500

That is what they called the teleporter when they built it. That was almost five hundred years ago though and now it just sits in a field. Cole likes to come here and just look at it. He likes to imagine what it would be like if it ever actually opened. There used to be guards posted at the fence day and night, preventing people like Cole from wandering onto the grounds. That stopped about fifty years ago, the government finally decided it wasn’t worth paying people to watch. Signs were still up warning people that they shouldn't venture inside the fence, but Cole didn't listen. That is how Cole found himself standing in front of the massive doorway, his face looking up at it in wonder.

The doorway is quite daunting. It stands twenty feet tall and twenty feet wide, the idea being that they could move semi-trailers through it if need be when the portal opened. That idea, along with thousands of others has been long forgotten. Only the occasional curious individual like Cole would come by anymore. It made him feel oddly better. If this enormous investment could fail at its one and only purpose in the universe, then his own shortcomings didn't seem so bad. Something started to nag at the back of his mind though. He could tell that something wasn't right, he just couldn't place it. The hairs on his arms slowly rise as if lightning is about to strike when suddenly blue electricity arcs within the doorway. 

Cole tumbles backward in shock and a small amount of fear as the blue electricity slowly repeatedly arcs back and forth between the inner sides of the doorway. It is very inconsistent at first and becomes more and more frequent until suddenly it doesn't go away. At the very center of the doorway a blue glowing ball of energy forms. The arcs of electricity shift to all feed into this ball as it grows wider and wider. The growing ball flattens out as it expands, slowly filling the entire doorway with energy. The harsh snapping sound of electricity has vanished now, only a soothing hum as the portal seems to have stabilized in the doorway. Dumbfounded, Cole looks up into the pale blue light. Elsewhere, alarms are going off in science labs all around the world.

It only takes Cole a second to make the decision that he is going through the portal. ""Who knows if anyone is even watching anymore, someone has to go in..."", he says to himself in superficial attempt at reason. He steps right up to the portal and tries in vain to slow his racing heart. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and steps through the portal. 

The first thing he notices, even before he opens his eyes, is the complete and utter silence. Wherever he is, there is absolutely zero sound. For a split second he wonders if maybe the portal actually killed him, then he remembers to open his eyes. His location immediately makes him stumble backwards and almost fall back through the portal. He stands alone on a perfectly circular flat piece of rock that might be one hundred feet in diameter. The entire rock is enclosed in a blue bubble, very similar to that of the portal, and beyond the bubble lays destruction. If an entire planet suddenly cracked open and its pieces were ground to chunks the size of an automobile, maybe that would explain the sight that Cole sees before him. 

The image of floating through space is so grandiose that he forgets to look at the ground he is on. While looking up and walking forward he smacks his knee into a large metal box. ""Ow!"", he remarks as he backs up to see what he found. The box almost seems to be fused with the ground and is a perfect cube, four feet per side. Ever the curious one, Cole grabs the edge of the box to peek inside. As soon as his skin makes contact with the box, he feels an electrical jolt and his mind starts to flood with information. So much data is flooding his mind that he drops to his knees, holding his head in pain until he blacks out.

Two scientists and an extremely high ranking general stand in an observation room, watching as they hook Cole up to a large amount of medical equipment. 

The general turns to the scientists, ""We found him unconsciousness next to the box. He kept repeating the word Pandora in every language known to man and even more that we don't know. Any idea what is wrong with him yet?""

One of the scientists shakes his head, ""Nothing that we can tell yet. His brain activity is off the charts though; I don't know how to explain it.""

The other scientist clears his throat and looks very troubled. ""We did find out what was in the box, Sir.""

""Well, out with it! What was left in the box?""

""It was a single sample of blood. General, the blood is human.""

""What is that?"" Dale cut Jacob off. He pointed to a very dusty machine, antique in its design. It was mostly steel, rusted along its edges, and incredibly dull. It looked like it probably was impressive whenever it was built, but now it lacked any impact other than being a severe eyesore. ""Can we get rid of that?""

""Another point of historical fact, actually. That was one half of a portal scientists wanted to build way back in the twenty-first century. The idea was that you could go in here and come out somewhere else in the galaxy, or maybe even another galaxy. The concept was origina-""

""Can we get rid of it?"" Dale reiterated, cutting off Jacob again. ""It's ugly, and I want a basement garden. That completely throws off the vibe we're going for."" He looked to Charlene, and she nodded along.

""Especially with that rust. It can't possibly be safe on a health aspect. I bet there's spiders all in it."" Charlene squirmed at the thought. Jacob was not happy at their dismissive attitude, but he was a realtor, and he was told to sell this house.

""Yes... you can get rid of it. But there is a chance that someone will ope-""

""Cool! I like everything else about the space. How much will removing that add to the cost?"" Dale cut off Jacob for the third time since the story began.

""It'll probably tack another three thousand onto the cost. Which makes the total-""

""Eighty-nine thousand. That's not bad. We'll take it!"" Dale looked to Charlene for approval. She gave it with another nod.

Everything went bright. Everything went dark. Everything went bright-ish. That might be the normal light level. The room looked the same as a minute ago, except now the very dusty machine was a very dusty glowing machine. Jacob's jaw dropped, and he dropped his clipboard. Dale sighed at the new inconvenience. Charlene did not nod, which was the same as showing disapproval for her. The fourth person was elated. There was a fourth person. He was covered in dust, though it is unclear if it came from the machine, or if he just was dusty. He spoke first.

""It worked! Years of cryosleep, and it worked!"" He screamed for joy, hugged Jacob, who hugged back, hugged Dale, who did not, and kissed Charlene square on the lips. She nodded. That set Dale off.

""Who are you, and why are you here?"" Dale grabbed the man by the arm and pushed him into a post. The man did not drop his smile.

""Testing my cognition, I see. Alright. I'm Jacob North, sir, pilot of the Apollo One X, whose mission was to establish a link between worlds through that machine!"" He pointed to the slightly less dusty glowing machine. ""I'm back.""

""Oh my God, Jacob North! I'm a huge fan! I'm named after you, actually! Would you min-""

""Shut up Jacob."" Dale was on his game. ""Look, Jacob North, your mission was a failure, and this machine is about to removed so I can put in my basement garden."" Dale picked up Jacob's clipboard and signed on the dotted lines. ""And now it's official."" He handed the clipboard back to Jacob, who took it reluctantly.

""But,"" North started, ""it... it worked... I'm back. It worked.""

""You already said that, and you're basically trespassing."" Dale walked over to the machine and looked for a switch. Jacob and Jacob both reached out to him.

""Be carefu-""

Everything went dark. Everything went bright. Everything went dark-ish. That might be the normal light level. The room looked the same as a minute ago, except now the slightly less dusty glowing machine was a significantly less dusty glowing Dale-removing machine, and as the name implies, Dale was removed. Jacob's jaw dropped further, but his clipboard did not, as it still fell the same distance. Charlene shook her head, which was the same as her not nodding, but with more effort. North smiled. He had not stopped smiling, so we can not extrapolate what that meant for him, but he was probably still happy.

""Finally. Now I can finish a sent-""

""Where's my husband!?"" Charlene yelled over Jacob. ""I knew that thing wasn't safe. First it brings this man out of nowhere, then it throws my husband into nowhere! Where is he!?"" She seemed to be directing this at North. He noticed that, and turned to her, still smiling.

""Somewhere he'll enjoy. The only place in the galaxy I felt confident setting up the other half of the portal."" He was obviously referring to something that would have more meaning if this story were about him and his adventure, but as neither Charlene or Jacob know what his adventure was, they were at a loss.

Charlene waited for North to explain. He did not though, and just kept staring off into where a camera would be if this encounter were filmed.

Everything went bright. Everything went dark. Everything went bright. It stayed that way. The room looked the same as a minute ago, except now the significantly less dusty glowing Dale-removing machine was a completely dustless illuminated Dale-removing and Dale-reinserting machine, and as the name implies, Dale was reinserted. Jacob sighed. North raised his eyebrows expectantly. Charlene did not nod, but not in an effort to show disapproval, she just lacked many emotion-expressing facial expressions. She did squint, though, but that was just due to the brightness. Dale was elated.

""That's pretty cool, North. I take back what I said about getting rid of it. It can stay."" He turned to look at the machine, and he squinted as well. ""Maybe put some shades on it, but it can stay."" He walked over and began conversing with North, presumably about his trip. Charlene and Jacob could hear, but, without context, it meant absolutely nothing, so it is not worth getting into detail about.",Pretelethal49

Sammy stood in front of the portal, his thick round glasses reflecting a weak blue tint from the membrane. It was on now. His dad, Jonathan, often said that this would never happen, that the whole project was a fool’s errand, but here it was - shining in its fully glory. But dad himself was nowhere to be found.

Did he go inside the portal? Sammy wondered. If he did, maybe he’s in trouble now? Stuck in the unfamiliar world, trapped by whatever creatures nest in there. There was no time to wonder about other worlds. It was time to save his dad. Sammy grabbed his backpack and shook all the contents to the floor. He picked up the English book and threw it inside the portal, where it disappeared immediately.

“Ouch!” a voice echoed from the other side. It sounded familiar.

“Dad?” said Sammy “Is that you?”

“Oh, hey, Sammy. Thank god you’re here. You won’t believe this! I am stuck here!”

“Stuck?”

“Yes, indeed, I accidentally set the portal to one-way mode and now I am stuck. I need your help, Sammy.”

“How do I know you’re you and not some alien?” said Sammy jokingly.

“I don’t have time for these games, Sammy! This is serious!”

“Okay, okay. What do I need to do?”

“Just flip the yellow switch from the bottom position.”

“That’s it?”

“Yes, hurry up.”

“Where is the switch?” said Sammy while staring directly at it. The power switch was next to it. If that was his dad he’d have no trouble answering, but if it wasn’t his dad, then Sammy was ready to turn the power off.

“I don’t have time for these games, Sammy! This is serious!”

“Dad, you just said that.” said Sammy and flipped the off switch. That’s so strange. That thing tried to lure me. He thought.

When the rest of the lab staff came back from lunch, Sammy sat by one of the desks doing his homework. The senior lab technician peaked into the portal chamber.

“Danny, did someone turn off the portal?” he asked one of the technicians standing next to him. “I told everyone clearly in the last meeting that we’re doing maintenance on one of the modules and that if someone turns it off, then we can’t turn it back on. This will cost us millions!”

Sammy listened intently.

“Who was on duty on the other side?”

“That boy’s dad. Don’t remember his name. Jon, something, Jonathan, I think.”

Sammy ran out to the control panel hurriedly, flipping the switch on and off repeatedly, but it was of no use, nothing happened. Sammy would never see his dad again.",I-dreamed-it-all

For decades we have waited for the portal to open... until now.",backslashworld,"""Since we can send the blueprints easier than we can build the damn thing we should continue sending the signal while our space program continues to progress""

 Those where the words that Jacob Risen said to the UN in regards to the wormhole technology that was just invented. 8 billion dollars from different organizations around the world and they finally have a working wormhole that was able to transport people and objects faster than light. Dr. Risen has witnessed the first human walk through it in the central facility in Michigan and appear seconds later in Tokyo Japan in front of of millions of cheering crowds. Within days manufacturing companies came asking for the blueprints, promising every person working on the project a life of fame and luxury. 

It was also Dr. Risen who said no. 

Now he was sitting here, alone in the central Michigan facility. Most of the world had forgotten about his achievement and all of his fellow scientists left for more...favorable positions, but not Jacob. He pleaded that he was going to use the technology for space travel, and nothing else, and continued to broadcast the directions into space despite the protests of the world governments. 

Hence why he was alone, in a barely functioning facility with a coordinate response from somewhere in space. 

When he first saw it he merely thought it was a error in the 4-D sensor array. He rechecked and even cleaned the array by himself, but it was still there. The coordinates for a working wormhole acceptance relay, more that 20 light years away. He wanted to contact his ""Friends"" and tell them they where wrong, he wanted to inform the world, but he didn't. 

He was the only person who knew about these extra-terrestrials, and he wasn't going to let the world tell him what to do with them. Not again. 

He prepared a suit and looked one more time at the coordinates. They definitely resonated a signal through the quantum intrusion. Dr. Risen took a deep breath, sealed all the blast doors, and opened the portal. 

He had no idea what he would be facing on the other side, the blast doors where a precautionary measure. The air could be made of gaseous plutonium, maybe there was an air born bacteria that could destroy all life on earth within seconds. That's what Jacob believed when he locked the doors from the inside. 

He approached the strange perfect sphere and touched it. Slowly but surely he walked into it, letting the strange fourth dimensional coolness wash over him. He closed his eyes as he fell inward extruding outside of the universe, and then back in. 

When he arrived he was not in front of a thousand of anticipating aliens, nor was it a warrior race that killed him on the spot. The best way Jacob could describe where he was into his recorder would be a basement. It was musty, had stairs leading up, and had what looked like tools strewn about the place. Jacob walked around a bit, admiring the strange, non-humanness of it all. It was definitely alien, yet everything was so quiet and Jacob feared he had missed ""them"". 

That's when he found that message, it was not written in English, yet he still understood it. He feared what it was doing to his mind, but throwing caution to the wind he continued to read it. 

It told a story about an apocalypse, and how a child built this portal. It told how this once proud race was reduced to rubble and dust and many messages where left strewn about the planet.  It told how this ""Child"" wanted to let someone see there world even if it killed them. They achieved there dream and left this message for anyone who came through. 

Jacob turned off the portal and smiled. Humanity didn't deserve this planet and the technology on it. **If a child could build a wormhole...** he thought to himself. He took off his helmet and breathed in rich oxygen. They obviously could not survive in an oxygen rich environment, and Jacob removed his suit after it had confirmed everything was safe. 

**How lucky** He thought while he moved about freely **Everything is almost perfect for humans** He smiled to himself, not noticing the almost humanoid figure walking down the stairs. ",Foreverending

[WP] Write a chase scene that takes place in an extremely small space.,RecycleYourCats,"This was a particularly tenacious adversary. 


A skilled and ruthless hunter, Cain had dealt with all kinds of elusive and fast prey before. He inspired fear, and Fear inspired his prey with the speed, the strength and the grace to accomplish (or at least, *try* to accomplish) the one task every cell in their body was attuned to in those moments: survival. 



For the fleeting moments that Cain was not likewise consumed by hunger, witnessing this made him feel something else entirely: a sense of beauty, of begrudging respect even. But never mercy. Or at least, only enough mercy to not let any aesthetic considerations distract him too long from his killer instinct. For, the more he allowed himself to be distracted, the longer his victim's struggle lasted. 


He sometimes imagined, while gorging on the insides of an especially tasty and hard-fought capture, that maybe his carelessness had made *them* likewise temporarily distracted; a momentary lapse from the all-consuming frenzy of running away, a fleeting moment of... *hope*. And he would feel guilt whenever he felt he had not achieved his high mark of excellence; whenever he felt he had not done everything in his power to make his adversary's death as swift and devoid of false hope as possible. 


But this time, there was no room in Cain's thoughts for distraction. He had stumbled upon a creature unlike any he had hunted down before; but there was no time for surprise. For he had been on a near-perfect streak lately, devoid of useless thoughts, and his being was entirely consumed by *the hunt* from the moment he had seen the flash of hairs, smelled the scent of animal. 


But what an animal it was, and what a chase it was. Normal chases were like a symphony or an ondulating pattern, with contractions and expansions of space alternating each other until the inevitable climax. Not this one: this one was a continually sustained high pitch, with the occasional timpani crash whenever he stretched out his jaw in an attempt to deliver his *coup de grâce*. He felt like Tantalus reaching for the grapes - but no, no time for feeling, dammit, just release this poor sod out his misery already! Hunger. Hunger. Ever so close. 


This beast was truly stretching his limits; the fatigue creeping in, his environment a blur around him, his head becoming light from the dizziness. 


""Great Hunter!"". The voice came suddenly, crashing down on Cain's reality. He made a final *snap* with his jaws but alas; it seemed the creature, with its magnificent hairs and magnificent smell, had vanished into thin air, to his bewilderment. 


""O Great Hunter!"" the voice came again, booming as usual, and suddenly his environment came back into focus, even if it still swayed and ondulated around him for a moment.


This was the call of Phaïdo, his female companion spirit. This lumbering, mostly hairless, two-legged hunting daemon spoke to him in a tongue that seemed to consist of variations of her own name (""Phaïdo! Phaïdo? Phaïïï-dooo!"") and a restricted range of sounds that mostly sounded like gibberish and baby-talk to Cain's distinguished ears. 


Nevertheless, as slow and clumsy as the daemon seemed in normal circumstances, she transformed into a true beacon whenever the hunt was on again, signalling to him at almost all times where his prey was going. Sometimes, it seemed to Cain like she handed his prey to him on a platter, and that all he had to do was follow her around until at last she would remove herself far enough so that he could move in for the kill. 


In fact, he realized that he had been so utterly lost in concentration in his chase of the magnificently-tailed creature, going in rounds for what seemed like an eternity, that he hadn't even noticed that his trusted companion spirit had not been there with them.


*""Gubboi Phaïdo""*, she said in her unsophisticated yet quite concise daemon language. But Cain had come to understand these utterings as: *""Most Distinguished and Exalted Hunter, I have spotted another fine specimen to add to your long and glorious list of conquests. Join me! I will lead you the way, hovering over your tasty prey as the Gods have instructed me, until finally you relieve them from their earthly shackles.""* 


There was no time left for reminiscing about the mysteriously-disappeared creature. His was a disciplined mind. He was, as his faithful Phaïdo had put it, a true *Gubboi*.

[WP] The depressed protagonist finds their purpose when he discovers and begins tending to strange plants growing from his body.,RecycleYourCats,"*Journal found in Bizarre ""Forest Room""*

I never really took care of myself because I didn't want to live. That self destruction built and built in tempo and.. And one day, I knelt in the shower as I often did and meditated, staring blankly into space.

This was a habit I had developed over the past year or so and I no longer had complete control of it. It was kind of scary. In any case, I was on my knees underneath the stream of warm water when I noticed the little flower growing out of the eerily cold, smooth, soft palm of my left hand.

""Hello there,"" I whispered, bringing my left palm closer to my face. As I did I noticed another, smaller flower growing between the fingers of my left hand. ""And hello to you as well, little one...""

I was off my depression medication and on some unprescribed cannabis instead, so I was perfectly fine with accepting this as reality. My flesh is suddenly soil? That's cool, bruh. That's fair.

Ever since the oak tree started growing out of my anus, however, I've grown a bit more panicked. Oddly enough I no longer feel suicidal. I want to live. Hellp.. Hell.. Help me.

Please. Ow.

[WP] The depressed protagonist finds their purpose when he discovers and begins tending to strange plants growing from his body.,RecycleYourCats,"Calvin sat alone in his room. The sun was down yet the lights were off. Lights on after dark were a giveaway that someone was home, and a potential robbery target. Life in the hood was no fairy tale to say the least. There was no opportunity to move on to better things, it was dead or jail. The toughest thrive and the weak don't survive. Crime was more than a necessity, it was regular every day part of life.

Calvin wanted to be a botanist. He didn't know why and he wouldn't dare share it with anyone, any dream of being something other than a hardcore gangster made you perceived as weak. Calvin was bored, waiting for some of his fellow gang members to come around. They told him they'd meet him later that night. 

Twiddling with his fingers there was a brief glow. Calvin wasn't sure what caused it, but decided to repeat the motion. He noticed a green growth coming from his fingertips and the smell was a dead ringer. He made the motion again. The leafy growth grew bigger and the smell was stronger. It was absolutely divine. It was the best, most pure most appetizing weed any mortal man could imagine. He got his scissors and cut off the growth. placing them in a zip lock bag. He did the motion again, and again, and again. A solid pound of ganja was stashed away. 

Just then there was a knock on the door. It was Andre. Andre's eyes lit up like fireworks at the smell as he rushed over to Calvin. Calvin didn't say a word but he knew what Andre was going to say. ""You ain't gonna believe this shit Dre"" he said as he held up his hands and did the magic motion. Leafs of green sprouted out amidst a golden glow. Dr. Dre replied just two words: ""Damn Snoop"".",CleverNameAndNumbers
"[WP] Humans are the only sapient species in the galaxy to invent democracy. As a result, when humanity makes contact with the rest of the galaxy, we quickly gain a reputation for spreading revolution wherever we go.",The_Just_Writer,"“Don’t let them near us.” The deep voice of the Emperor echoed throughout the great hall.

Harragas dared to tilt his head up a little. He observed how everyone was down on their knees, facing downwards at the intricate carvings on the tiled floor, bowing their heads to show reverence for their great leader. Except for him, trying to sneak a little peek at Him. Oh, and except for the robot guards, of course.

The Emperor was staring up through the huge PenaGlass dome, observing the human ship formations in the sky. A coat made of the pelt of the Akran Bear was draped over His broad shoulders. He was clad in a smooth, loose-fitting tunic, probably sewn from the silk of the Phelas worm by the finest tailors on the planet. His sandals had jewels studded on the leather straps, jewel-studded leather straps, with a small Akran Bear head fixed on the tip of the shoe.

Such luxury, to be able to walk around in light, breathable clothes in an air-conditioned palace all day. So much unlike the heavy suits of armour that all the garrison commanders were clad in. So much unlike the heavy weapons and kits that the soldiers had to lug around all day. And so much unlike the common folk out there, toiling under the blazing sun. 

“Warn them that their thoughts and habits are not welcome on Gfujior, and tell them to scram before we kill them all.” He turned back to his audience. Harragas immediately averted his gaze. “Make sure you all follow through with the threat. Don’t repeat the same mistake by Ghlond.”

“Yes, your Highness.” Everyone responded unanimously.

Oh Ghlond. Harragas still remembered how his old friend reacted to the first human scout ship. Ghlond had ventured out to board the ship without consulting the Emperor first, and after a lengthy conversation let the humans exit peacefully. Upon touching down, he was immediately arrested and interrogated, where he confessed that he forgot to inform the Emperor. He was publicly executed.

But Harragas knew. Ghlond didn’t forget - he was legitimately interested in that human idea. Democracy, they called it. Rule of the people, they explained.

The Emperor would never have tolerated it. How could the people rule themselves? The common folk were unruly and selfish - they would never be able to make selfless decisions for the good of the planet.

But He himself wasn’t that good either. He couldn’t solve the recent famine - millions were dying, and yet He remained in his palace, snacking on Great Penguin eggs. He spent little on healthcare, causing thousands to die in the heatwave two weeks ago, unable to receive treatment in time from understaffed and underequipped hospitals. Homeless littered the streets, exposed to the elements, as He did nothing to combat the rising property prices. How could He proclaim Himself an Emperor if He couldn't even provide a basic standard of living for His people?

“Admiral Elondia, ready your ships for combat. General Ruffia and Royshea, start preparing your guns, to shoot down any ship that enters our atmosphere. Commander Harragas, your role is the most important. You are to man the planet’s forcefield - do not let any humans pass through at any cost. If the forcefield falls below 50%, recharge it. If there isn’t enough power from the command centre, take power from the power stations down below. The cities may experience power outage, but the protection of our way of life is paramount. Now, to your battlestations, and get rid of that foreign scum staining our skies!!”

“Yes, your Highness!!” Everyone saluted, and left for their garrisons.

Take the power from the people? No, that simply wasn’t possible!! What little air-conditioning and irrigation left was essential to the growth of crops, rearing of animals, and preventing the weak from succumbing to any sudden heatwaves. To divert power for a one-minute-long emergency charge would condemn countless innocent people to certain death.

The Emperor was sacrificing the planet, just to retain his undeserved control over it.

No.

Harragas would not do that. He would do something better. Something that the people needed.

He hovered his hands over the radio, considering the consequences.

Yes, he may fail, and he may be publicly executed, perhaps together with any human survivors.

But the risk was worth it.

He pushed it, sending out the maps of the defense positions to the humans.

Next was the lever. Harragas pulled it hard, watching as the forcefield wavered, and slowly retracted.

The people would get the power they deserved.

"[WP] Your grandma loves gardening. For her birthday, you get her a rare plant from a small flower shop. The plant turns out to be unlike anything you've expected, but grandma seems unusually devoted to it.",booksandsunglasses,"The low trill of falling rain was accompanied by the soft rumbling of thunder. I sat on a couch by the window, looking out at my grandma's garden. I looked at the garden's centrepiece: a small, white flower with spots of yellow rung around its petals. The rain didn't fall on that flower. The rain slid around it. The flower was perked up and seemed to glow with a tender yellow light. I had found that flower as a special gift for my grandma, but this flower was beyond special, to say the least.

My grandma was sleeping. She slept often, nowadays, and only got up to cook, read, or take care of her garden. My dad often told her to stop overworking, as she was frail and could get hurt doing laborious work. But she was stubborn. A trait I inherited, my dad said. 

I plucked at my skirt. I was dressed well. More well than I was comfortable with, but I thought it was a good idea when I decided to visit my grandma. I wanted to see how the flower was doing, but was then caught out in the rain. Now I'm waiting for my dad to pick me up. I glanced at my phone which lay flat across a small tea table. It still showed the message I had sent him.

I look back at the white flower. It was beautiful for sure. The petals gently drooped and set a stage for the pistils and stigma to stand tall and brightly. The yellow spots were like a crown. The green stalk was like a woman's willowy body, assured and swaying with steady motion.

I felt a hand on my shoulder and I jerked my head to see my grandma. She sat next to me and grunted as she did so.

""The fairy is quite beautiful, isn't she?"" My grandma said in her friendly croak.

I thought for a moment, and then replied, ""You mean the flower?""

""The same, the same.""

I wasn't a superstitious person, but I saw the strange flower and guessed that it being a fairy wasn't far-fetched. ""I didn't know,"" I said, ""that it was a fairy. I just thought you would like it.""

My grandma raised an eyebrow and coughed, ""Well, you did steal her."" 

""I, uh - "" Crap. How did she know? I looked at the flower. It seemed to be twitching. I glared at it and it stopped moving. Dammit. ""I guess the fairy told you...""

""Yes, Charlotte. You can't go plucking flowers from anyone's soil bed. Not even the flower shop's""

I was glad that the room was dark - my grandma disliked turning on the lights during the day, even during a storm - it helped hide the shame. ""I just thought you'd like it.""

""And,"" my grandma coughed again, grimaced, then continued, ""you'll return it. That's what I'd like.""

""Yes, grandma...""

She left and I sat alone, smarting under the reprimand. My phone buzzed and I leaned over to read the message. It said my dad would arrive in about a minute or so. I got up and prepared to leave, but then glanced back at the garden. I groaned in exasperation and trudged out into the rain with my umbrella in one hand and my phone in the other -- I wanted to keep an eye on for when dad arrived.

It was hard to see, but I made it to the garden centre without slipping. I put the umbrella in the crook between my head and shoulder, squatted, and picked up a trowel I saw laying by the wayside. The rain drummed against my umbrella and splashed onto my bare calfs. I got up again and headed for the white flower, but when I reached it, I saw a little woman happily sitting on the mound of dirt.

It was a matter of fact sort of thing. Of course a fairy would do this, of course a fairy would be here and sitting around in the rain entirely dry. It was entirely believable, and I agreed with it. I bent over so that my umbrella roofed over the fairy and then looked at it, my head still cocked so that I could keep the umbrella lodged in place. 

The fairy cocked its head as well, giggled, flew upwards and then landed on my shoulder. I did a thumbs up with my trowel carrying hand, but the fairy didn't notice. I heard a buzz and glanced at my phone: my dad had arrived. 

Happy with the ease of the task, I jogged away from the garden and back to my grandma's house. I had almost reached it when I lurched - dropping my umbrella - and fell. The growing puddles hid an uneven edge which I had tripped over. In the moment I was falling I felt my stomach recede and my brain react with flailing messaged to throw my arms forward and at the same time keep my hands away from the ground so as to protect my phone. The ground rushed towards me and I closed my eyes.

And then I opened them. One inch above the ground. I...didn't fall? I wiggled around. Was I floating? I yelped when I realised that I was. And then I yelped again when I suddenly dropped and hit the ground with a loud splash. 

The fairy was still on my shoulder, at least. Of course, I knew it was her that had let me float. It was clear by the way she laughed in her shrill voice. Of course, she had also let me drop. Brilliant. Classic fairy.

I got up a little bit sore, walked back into my grandma's house, got my stuff, and headed out the front door to greet my dad. I was dirty and wet, but otherwise none for the worse. 

I leapt into the car with a loud goodbye to grandma, and we drove off.

More atmospheric than a sort of story with a point. Thanks for reading, though.

"[WP] You blink, and suddenly your reflection in the mirror is replaced by a man you've never seen before. With one quick move, he reaches through the mirror and grabs you by the collar.",SirGentlemanOstrich,"I pulled back and fell to the floor in my bathroom. Looking back up at the mirror I saw nothing. Grabbing the lip of the sink, I hoisted myself up and slowly rose to meet the mirror. It was my reflection again, cowering over the mirror's edge. 

My legs and arms were trembling with the experience. Grabbing the suit jacket that hung from the hook on the door, I scrambled into the hallway. It was empty. My apartment was quiet, no sounds that were out of the ordinary. I glanced at my watch. The time informed me I was getting close to being late for work. Slamming my apartment door behind me, I ran to the elevator. 

I clicked the call button and the door opened. Pressing the lobby button my eye caught movement in the mirror beside me. All the walls of the elevator were mirrors. A bell sounded and the door closed. My mind told me I wasn't alone so I looked over to my left. It was my reflection, but it was full on facing me. I moved my arm but nothing happened. Full of dread, I averted my gaze back to the doors.

Moments later I felt a tapping on my shoulder. Sweat began to bead on my brow. I kept telling myself not to look. It tapped harder. I closed my eyes and prayed the door would open soon. A hand closed on my shoulder and someone whispered in my ear.

""It's almost time.""

My body lept forward just as the door opened. I must've yelped because the few people that were in the lobby just stared. Sweat was now soaking my torso. Loosening my tie I put my head down and hastily walked through the door to the street. My suitcase struck the door on the way out.

The concrete was punishing against my feet at the pace I was going. Something inside was compelling me to go faster though. People were seemingly avoiding me as I walked, I couldn't have looked very good. The bus stop was empty except for a small child and his mother sitting on the bench. I sat at the far end. Putting my suitcase onto my lap, I wrapped my arms around it and looked at the ground. The child was giggling so I glanced up.

He waved to me, smiling. Over his shoulder I saw me in the reflection, standing. The reflection put a finger to his lips, telling me to be quiet. My eyes grew wide and I resumed staring at the ground. Thankfully the bus wasn't long getting to the stop and I boarded quickly. Placing my case on the seat next to me, I sat down close to the window. Most of the people on the bus were quiet and busy with something in their hands.

I looked towards the driver. The rear view mirror showed the driver looking at me. His glare was piercing so I looked out the window instead. The bus began to move, I felt every bump. After a few stops, I looked up to the rear view mirror, it was me now. I looked back out my window. My reflection in the window leaned forward even though I was sitting back in the seat. It motioned for me to lean forward as well. My heart began to race but I felt compelled. 

""You going to do it today?""

I nodded. Grabbing the suitcase, I opened it. This was it. The case was closed and I placed it back on the seat beside me. My stop was next. I could feel the bus slowing down. Others began to shuffle off and I joined the crowd suitcase in hand. My office was right in front of me. 

The building was older as shown by the weathered concrete. I pushed through the glass doors into the lobby. A few men in suits started to walk towards me. They worked on my floor.

""Hey Kevin! Did you get those files all closed up like I asked you?"" The other two goons he was with smiled awaiting my answer. I nodded. ""Oh great man, you really saved me.""

One of the others piped up, ""Vegas was great, wish you could've come."" 

No he didn't. They made me do this so they could go and have fun. That didn't bother so much anymore. I didn't let it. My feet took me through them and towards the escalators. Placing my hand on the railing, I rode it to my floor. My eyes were caught by motion to my right. The reflective surface beside the railing had my face. It shook its head.

""Tisk. Tisk."" It whispered.

I got to my floor and walked through the doors to the work space. The three from downstairs brushed passed me as I entered, laughing. My boss stepped towards me from the near by cubicle when he saw me.

""Kevin, you're late."" I looked at my watch, 9:02. ""Am I correct in assuming I pay you to be here for 9am?""

I nodded.

""It's not that hard is it Kevin?"" His grey hair reminded me of ashes. The suit was black, the same colour as his heart no doubt. ""Don't let this happen again.""

He stormed off towards his office. The secretary was grinning. I walked back towards the doors and locked them. My hand slipped into my pocket to pull out a tube of super glue. I placed its nozzle into the lock and squeezed. I carried on to do this to all the exits around the floor. When I was sure it was done, I went to my cubicle. The suitcase was placed underneath the desk, opened. I removed several large boxes of matches and placed them beside the case. 

Reaching around my workspace, I grabbed every scrap of paper and shoved it into the case. I placed all of the boxes back in and left one open. Removing a match from that box, I struck it ablaze and stood up. The flame was mesmerizing as it glowed in my hand for a moment. I looked down and tossed it into the suitcase. 

My heart was pounding as I walked away towards the bathroom. As I pushed into the lavatory, I could hear people starting to scream ""fire"" and running about. I locked the door behind me. Walking into the bathroom I stopped at the sink and ran the tap. My hands filled with cool water. I splashed my face and gazed into the mirror. My reflection was clapping.

""Well done Kevin, now just wait here. It will all be over soon.""",psychnurseguy
"[WP] You blink, and suddenly your reflection in the mirror is replaced by a man you've never seen before. With one quick move, he reaches through the mirror and grabs you by the collar.",SirGentlemanOstrich,"""God. How did I end up here? Nothing seems to be working out like it's supposed to. Should have been married. Maybe have a kid or two. Well, THAT didn't happen, did it? You're such a mess up. Each social interaction with a woman, you professionally floundered. You're a wash out. And your career? Don't get me started about your career! Yeah, that's right. Five mediocre jobs. Never had a promotion. You've just been laid off again. You just don't make the cut, do you? Last time, you just awkwardly laughed when your boss made a remark about your favourite socks. How can you be so casual with your appearance? You look like a doofus, not like a real estate salesman at all. What's wrong with you?""

The train of thought in Jon's head continued to derail. Spiralled out of control. His fist clenched the half filled bottle of Jack Daniel's. His knuckles turned white. The figure in the mirror returned his gaze with eyes filled with defeat and desperation. Unshaven. Stained shirt. Greasy hair. He hadn't seen a shower in two days. Hadn't had a decent night's sleep. His boss had shoehorned him into overwork to reel in some fat client. Again.

""Is this me? Is this really me?"", Jon whispered. He looked down into the sink. Grime everywhere. The tap leaked and a single drip was the only sound in the otherwise empty bathroom.

He looked up again. Looked back in the mirror. He felt the hairs in his neck raise. A chill went down his spine. The face in the reflection was unrecognisable. Was this still him? His brain didn't register the first two seconds.

By then, a hand had already clutched his shirt and pulled him closer over the sink towards the glass. He gagged at the smell of the breathe as his face closed in on that of the man in the mirror. The hair of the velvet, ravenblack beard almost stroked his cheeks as he struggled to break free. But he failed and he could not avoid seeing the two blu steel eyes, staring intently into his own. Into his mind. Into his soul. 

""Hey. Are you the one hurting my buddy?"", the figure whispered. ""Are you the one pushing down? Making him depressed? Are you the one who beats on him?"" The questions pounded at Jon. The man's voice was void of forgiveness.

""Yeah, pretty sure you are the dude. Stop doing that. Stop hitting him. He's defenceless. He's helpless. He's scared. And YOU are doing that to him. Are you proud of yourself? I hope not. You're a bully. And bullies don't deserve sympathy.""

The steely blue eyes slowly turned into a fiery orange.

""Look buddy. If you keep doing that. I'll come at you. You know who I am? I'm regret. I'm spectre that haunts those who beat their best buddy. I'll bury myself in the back of your mind, never leaving you alone. I will make you relive these moments where you were beating up my buddy. And I'll make you feel shit for what you've done. I'll make your life miserable if you keep doing that.""

Jon felt his heart race. The hand clutching his shirt felt like concrete. The eyes burned into his very essence. And as they did, he slowly started to understand.

""Ah. I see you're starting to get what I'm talking about. Glad to see that. Quit pestering my man. Make peace with him. Respect him. Be honest with him. I'll say this only once. Don't make me repeat this. Don't make me visit you again.""

The hand let loose. Jon swept backwards and fell to the floor. A bit shaken, he picked himself up, pulled himself back up on the sink. He slowly lifted his head. Only to stare back at his own reflection in the mirror.

""I'm sorry."", he whispered, ""I'm so very sorry I did that to you."" He smiled timidly. His reflection smiled timidly back.

Sunlight hit through the small window near the ceiling of the bathroom. It's rays found Jon. He felt their warmth. It was the first time in months he felt anything. A great burden seemed to have shifted on his shoulders. It was still heavy, but it was different from what it was.

He took the razor. He took some soap. Opened the tap and let warm water fill the sink. He started to shave himself. And as he did, he savoured every single motion he made. Understanding that he did that not just for the reflection in the mirror, but for himself.
