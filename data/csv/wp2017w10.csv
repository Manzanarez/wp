"[WP] Your phone runs out of charge, but instead of turning off, it is now on %-1 charge.",-4-a-,"""Oh, yeah, - said the man behind the counter, - they do that now.""

I glanced at my phone's screen one more time. It was now showing -15% of charge. I forgot to plug the charger for the night, so the damned piece of plastic was nearly at zero when I left for work. But I got worried when I saw it at -1% at lunch, when I wanted to play some games. Took it to the repair service at the first opportunity.

""It means you're in debt now, - explained the man, - But it's no biggie. Just remember to charge it when you get back home. It costs a little extra to charge the indebted devices, but it worth it, don't you think?""

I nodded. Useful feature, even if it could become pricey for someone as forgetful as I. Then a thing occured to me.

""What happens if you don't charge it?""

""Well, it gets more and more debt""

""But it goes on working?""

""Sure. But you don't want to acquire too much electrical debt! The company might send the collectors""

""To get the money?"" - I asked, a bit worried.

""No, mister. To get electricity""

""But how...""

""Your body mister. Your nerves use electricity, your brain uses electricity. The collectors get that if you're in debt.

"[WP] Aliens arrive on earth, ready to invade it. They arrive there to find it full of zombies.",-4-a-,"We had anticipated interaction once we began surrounding the planet.  Our data showed the planet's technologically advanced species was capable of space travel and there was enough orbital debris to ensure us our initial reports were correct. 

Continuing as planned, we began submerging into the atmosphere at roughly the same time.   Our hopes were to overwhelm them, shocking them into submission.  We'd seeded this planet long ago and it's social management had not been neglected. Not wanting our planets to be easily taken over by the Ch'KShovan, we had built aggressive as well as tactically intelligent traits into the human mind, but it could be bypassed with the words and action.  Pacification should be as simple as what they would believe were complex ""negotiations"".

Past units sent to check up on their progress had insisted that we take care to remain out of airspace, citing problems with human pilots.  Intelligence was very thorough and rarely wrong.  The lack of aircraft was concerning.  Could they be planning a surprise attack?  Were they smarter than we believed?  Had they evolved past what we'd made them?

The order came in. The Mothership, nearly as massive as a small moon and loaded with food, energy and supplies should something go wrong, would continue to orbit. All other craft would approach the planet. 

Things were progressing much faster than we'd anticipated, but until we discovered what the creatures on the planet were doing we were to continue as previously planned.  I had an overwhelming sense of wrongness, but nothing solid enough to set logic on and retreat. 

I felt the ship's gravity dissipate as we landed, efficiently being swapped for that of the planet.  As we were to land in the North American landmass, the decision had been made to send our fighters out, first.  They were to file out in impressive formation and wait for one of us who was larger and more elaborately dressed.  The assumption would be made by the human population that this would be the one in charge.  This would give them a false sense of sameness and set up a framework for control.  

A crowd did gather around the ship, but they weren't forming groups in the way we expected.  They acted more like debris, clumping here or there than living, thinking creatures.  

Our forces began their orderly exit of the ship, but the humans weren't moving out of the way, as expected.  Instead they pressed forward, grabbing at them, getting underfoot.  Shooting began, and it was a slippery, disgusting mess.  The troops had been confused and the unexpected carnage hadn't helped.  

A plague of some sort had broken out, leaving the ""native"" inhabitants half rotted.  They weren't rational.  They also weren't driving by madness.  It was more like hunger.  

A recall order went out.  We regrouped and I contacted the other ships.  Our experience was far from alone.  Those who landed in cities had it the worst.  We lost several ships to hoards of rotting, plague ridden humans.  

Mothership put out a request for an infected Earth Native.  It was believed the Ch'KShovan had discovered our planet, and infected the inhabitants in an effort to remove them and take our territory.

One of our newest recruits managed to capture one nearly intact, and was bringing it to me.  He'd been bitten by the thing and would need medical attention.  Their mouths were filthy and under the best of circumstances.

He brought the creature to the containment unit and I met him there.  I set my decorative metal staff against the wall and saluted him.  

I had been sent to play emissary, but this was so much more important.  If the humans were suffering from a plague, they would likely do anything for something as simple as a cure.  Political intrigue would no longer be necessary.

The native threw itself at the clear wall with a gurgling groan, leaving a grotesque smudge.  I'd been lead to believe they were relatively fragile physically and had no idea they could survive this level of necrotic tissue.  The computer began its readout.  The blood-flow in the subject we were viewing had completely stopped.  There was no heartbeat.  It should be dead.  One of his arms was missing and his foot was at an odd angle.

I put in the order for the craft to return.  I turned toward my companion to ask some questions but was interrupted by his sudden need to vomit.  Thick black blood slopped across the floor and onto part of the wall.  

Pulling emergency quarantine I sealed myself in with him.  It was the last thing I wanted, but instincts are strong and I felt a need to protect the rest.  

His skin was bubbling up and erupting through his strong exo-suit in little bursting spurts.  His head swiveled in my direction and I could see all five eyes train on me, turning a milky white.  The skin around his teeth shrunk back with a hiss of steam and he came at me, howling.

Whatever he'd caught from the human, it hadn't made him slow.  In one smooth motion I grabbed the staff staff, braced it against the ground and aimed at his main sensory center.   It made a crunch as his face crumpled.  My staff slid through his nasal passages into his brain.  It was over.

I needed to inform command, but the ship wasn't set up to keep access to any communication panels from a quarantined section.  I would have to wait.  This was what came of a humiliating lack of preparation.  

There was no possible way a plague of this size had spread so quickly.  Perhaps our intelligence force had been taken by the infection.  Why hadn't they sent word?

That's when they started to arrive.  Driven by instinct and need to spread the contaminant, they didn't learn.  They would beat themselves to a pulp against the clear wall over and over.  In their eagerness to get to me, they would crush each other against it, stepping on each other when their bones would snap and they'd fall underfoot.  Those who fell would still try to bite long after they should have had no life left.

My spacecraft was heading to the Mothership. I had no way to warn them.

[WP] Solange's Lost Diamond Ring of the Muses,Ibs12,"Hi sorry. sure, that tale was born from a riff, it is my first time posting to WP, but I've been inspired in the past. Thought I left it open-ended enough to build a good story, just setting the theme. Solange lost her ring. A lost soul finds it. It contains magic. 
What happens to the soul? Solange? Was the ring even truly endowed? Is there a curse? So many questions!
Anywho, apologies for misunderstanding the extent of ""Inspirational"" (that distinction is not made on the posting page, I'll point out)

"[WP] You are a normal person, who is dating the protagonist of a shonen anime.",Nyerf,"::""Jotaro, you cannot solve every problem by punching it,"" you sigh, picking up the broken tea cup and shoving it into the tiny trash can by the sink. Dating a Joestar was something of a fairytale, strong muscles and dashing good looks... Of course, you forgot about the whole /fate of the world/ aspect that came with it. Also, the man you're currently dating is more or less a giant jerk. He offered you a rather annoyed glance and bit his lip.

""I had asked you for black tea..."" He sounded like a toddler. You glared at him before shoving the empty tea box into his hands. 

""Then we have to go to the grocery store."" 

And thus, you two took the journey to Kroger. Jotaro awkwardly sitting in your Volkswagen, his head leaning sideways because he was /obviously/ too tall for your car. Of course he would be, his shoulders stretched out nearly 30 inches (obviously an exaggeration) but this man was obnoxiously /huge/. There was an awkward silence before getting to the store, where he followed you in quietly. 

You browsed through the sections, ignoring the odd glances you were receiving. It was probably because your petite 5ft stature looked bizarre compared to a man who was easily over 6 ft. He took your shoulder in one hand and looked nervously at you.

""Someone is following us.""

Of FREAKING course someone was following us. You barely could walk down the street without an /enemy/ stand user stalking you. Your hand was deep in the boxes of tea as you heard a voice...

""Ah! You were expecting TEA! But it is I, Dio!"" The blonde man grabbed the box from your fingertips. You gasped as Jotaro tossed you behind him with a huff. 

""DIO!"" His voice thundered, causing everyone in the store to glance at you. 

""Ah yes! Jotaro Kujo you thought you had stopped me back in Egypt. But using my new powers of re-incarnation I was able to hunt you down!""

""You won't be able to succeed Dio!"" Your boyfriend proclaimed as their stands became present. Or at least, you think they did. You and everyone else in the store /couldn't/ see them. 

And thus, the battle begun! An invisible match where you watched your boyfriend be thrust onto the ground by some invisible /force/. Called a stand...

""H-Hey lady. I'm gonna have to ask you and your boyfriend to leave... He's kinda making a scene and knocking over the cereal boxes..."" An employee grabbed your arm as you sighed.

""Sorry Pablo, we'll try to stop Dio before we come into the store...""::

That all changed when a moon called Gyrus 38B located in a star system in the Messier galaxy is found to have ruins on its surface.",etiks,"386-481-02-26-15:04:016

We approached the ruins at 1100/05/00 to confirm early reports. We cleansed the site as we went, per your instructions, there were none left standing. We have taken samples from all matter on site, organic or otherwise for further study. 

Everything on site was as early reports said. There was one word, my lord. Leave. After taking our samples, and making sure there were no survivors or recordings, we purged the site from orbit. 


Bishops left the system at 1400/05/00. 

Session Terminated 1400/10/00



I watched from orbit, the carnage and fire. I double checked that my sensor array picked it up. The bishops were officially disbanded, according to the Imperium. Any spacer worth his bolts knows that’s never the end of the story. What the Imperium say, and what actually happens are rarely the same. 

Slowly, one system at a time, life flooded back into my ship. Cold iron warmed to the touch, and I stopped shivering. It was time to leave, before the Bishops scanned the system again. 
Life support was still warm, Navigation was coming back online, Weapons hot. Engines failed. Shit. 

“Hey Lucy, what’s going on with the Jump?”


“Running diagnostics” The computer chimed.

VI was rarely sloppy, and all the calculations were usually pretty spot on, but this time, with what was at stake here, I had to double check. I pulled up the manual diagnostic and started running sims.

“Fault Identified. Tasking Drone” The computer interrupted.

“Hang on Lucy, I need to see what’s wrong before we fix it, then when we get into port i can take a real look.” My hands danced over the consoles, looking for the fault. Leaking coolant, a loose bolt, maybe even a plasma surge, it had to be something. Engines don’t break for no reason.

“Alert. We are being hailed. Tasking drone to seal coolant leak.”

“Fuck, Alright Lucy, play it cool.” 

My hand hovered above the console. I wasn’t sure if I should open the channel or try and run. There were probably a handful of people in the black that knew the Bishops were still around. 

Run, or Answer. Fuck. What have I got to lose?

[WP] You watch as your most prized painting replaces the Mona Lisa.,Aneoyo,"Most people would say it isn’t as good. The curves aren’t as smooth. The eyes aren’t as detailed. The backdrop isn’t as meaningful. But I couldn’t disagree more. 


This picture was different. Each stroke had meaning. Nothing was there that wasn’t suppose to be. The artist was younger than Leonardo da Vinci when he painted the magnificent, Mona Lisa. Her younger age compared to his made the picture that much more meaningful though. 


I slowly detached Leonardo’s copy of the painting from our wall in our living room and set it on the ground. The wife will get the final decision on where to put it next, but I was thinking either the basement or our bedroom. The newly decorated artist ran up to me with double sided sticky tape stuck to her hands and shirt.


The blotches of Crayola paint burst out of the paper. Granted, the artist only had red, green, blue, orange, and yellow. But that was because she spilled purple and and black on the dog. She has only had 1 brush, but that was because the other two brushes went surprisingly missing after the great “Sleepover of 2016.” She was still running around with the sticky tape stuck on her shirt. I was in the midst of holding both the old and new masterpieces so I couldn’t stop her. 


“Claire! I need your help. Can you hold this very carefully?” I asked, finally getting her attention. 


“Sure thing daddy, do you want to know why I like mine more than this one?”


I chuckled. “And why is that?”


She didn’t notice but she got the sticky tape on Mona Lisa’s cheek. “Because this picture only has a mommy in it. Mine has a mommy, daddy, brother, doggy, and ME!” 


I couldn’t help but smile as I finished up putting up the new masterpiece. “Well, I guess you have a point. Thanks for holding that. Where do you think we should put just the mommy now?” 


She thought for a second, thinking of every possible open wall in our house. She stopped running by now and was playing with the sticky tape on her shirt. “I know daddy! Can we put it next to mine so I can copy it next time?”


“Sure thing girl.” ",Doktor_Diesel

[WP] You can only use each word of the dictionary once in your life.,Kwalm0,"I was born in a small town north of Memphis. From birth, my mother doted on me endlessly - perhaps too much. Her baby boy had to have mahogany for his crib, silk threaded blankets, and nothing but the finest toys.

By school age, mama's son expected everything handed to him. My classmates found it insufferable. They avoid that pompous new kindergartener, at first. Then, their approach involved direct conflict. Name calling, jeers, fights - these filled our early days.

Aristocratic, superior children can't keep inflated egos forever. After repeated vicious, violent initiations into reality, your once-gentle narrator learned that one must humble oneself to survive.

When adulthood hit, excessive humility overwhelmed every act. Meek, solely, could describe such dispositions. Cowardly. Speaking came unnatural, uneasy. Words stumbled out clumsily, overly cautiously - yet rarely. Inferiority, fear -- both rooted inside completely. 

Love, though, can change everything. Sheila burst such romance alive. Eventually, this woman would become wife -- even best friend. Although, first, just another coworker among many.

Fireworks exploded immediately. New courageous emotions consumed internally. Anyone could transform into loquaciousness, before boundless beauty.

Typical questions ensued.

Dinner? Yes.

Coffee? Sure.

Work tomorrow? No.

Stay tonight? Certainly.

Meet again? Definitely.

Marriage, shortly afterward. Honeymoon, naturally. Conception, nearly instantly. Nine months later, birth. Healthy. 8 pounds, 2 ounces. Male. Indescribable pride.

Life, now, imbued with meaning, carries forth. Today, however, old age weighs down our very bones. Illnesses, tiredness -- always contaminating movement.

Over soon. Endings approach.

Eventually, death conquers existence. Previously, pondering mortality ensured anguish. Nonetheless, somehow, presently, eternity provokes none.

We will descend below ground together. United forever.

True happiness.

Worthwhile. Each moment.",takenorinvalid

I felt a raindrop on my forehead. I took a look at the ground and began to see sprinkles polka-dot the concrete. I sped up to catch up to Janie but softly tripped on something wedged into the crack between two buildings. It was an umbrella. I looked around and slowly pulled it out. Janie caught wind of this.

""See?"" I said, smirking as I opened it.

""Stealing umbrellas now?"" she asked playfully.

""Hey, at least until we hail a taxi. Then I'll put it back, I swear."" She gave me a gorgeous smile and walked me to the curb yelling ""Taxi!"" Some 7 taxis passed us by without a second thought.

""Let me try. Taxi!"" I yelled. Immediately, one stopped in front of us. I turned to Janie and gave her a big, shit-eating grin as I opened the back door for her. I motioned her inside with my open palm.

""Whatever!"" she huffed jokingly, crossing her arms as she ducked into the car. I followed suit after placing the umbrella back where I found it.

""Does this mean you'll let me kiss you on the first date?"" I grinned cheekily. She laughed.

""Maybe."" She told the driver her address and we were off.

""So have you always had this...power?"" she placed her fingers to her mouth coolly.

""Yep. In fact, I've never waited at a stop light. Just watch."" She watched as we passed one green light. Two. Three.

""Impressive."" I looked into her eyes and moved my gaze to her glistening lips. She smiled softly as I began to pull in. Guess I'd be getting the first kiss after all.

***WHAM***

I felt Janie's body push me against my side of the seat as glass and debris flooded my vision. As our car spun out into the street, I saw the grill of another car detach itself from behind Janie. The car stabilized, my ears hearing nothing but a cacophony of sirens and horns.

I then felt the warmth and wetness of Janie's blood seep through my clothes.",Orest-Mercator

"[WP] Write a story without using the letter ""E""",Slyde7,"It starts with a popping sound around back; that’s how it is for us, anyway. Popping? Or did slurping start first? Anyway, as soon as that sound starts, it all slows down. Our thoughts, actions, words slur a bit. Can’t think straight. Confusing. At first all of us think it is our own malady, but that guy from that rocky world — I’m foggy on which rocky world, and now that I think about it, I’m foggy on that guy’s alias, too — that guy looks at our ship logs and says, with alarm and many word-contortions, that our logs look similar to “swiss… milk curd product.” I think I know what that guy is trying to say but this obstruction afflicts my silicon circuits as much as his gray brain. Gaps in our ship logs. That’s what panics us all. Our logs should automatically catch anomalous cosmic conditions, but if our logs lack an account of so much of our wayfaring… what if…

A quick ping to HQ confirms that this isn’t only a local complication.  

Captain Gary starts to say a funny bit from that holofilm that was on last night. Captain Gary says it to try to allay our discomfort but halfway through, Captain Gary can’t finish a word. His flummoxing alarms most of us who know him; his facility with words — particularly his ability to mimic hilarious holofilm bits during scary occasions — was a critical qualification for his position. Captain Gary looks past us, drops that phony swashbuckling air, and slumps in his chair.

“What if…” I say — and what a whirring in my circuits this brings! I’m running much too hot from trying to do such basic oral articulations — “What if I flip our quantumscopic focal point again? Just to look at what’s going on?”

A communal groan. 

Captain Gary flaps his mouth trying to start talking but his words won’t work right at first. All of us wait. Captain Gary finally says: “You don’t know that flipping our quantumscopic focal point actually shows what you think it shows.”

I say, “If it is what I think, it might justify our quandary.” 

“Or,” says Captain Gary, “It might just show us what is always shows us, which is usually gross.”

“It was only gross in a singular occasion.”

“It’s a portal that shows a masturbator.”

“Okay, but what if I’m right about him?” Through a howling clamor of disgust, I shout: “What harm do you think looking through that portal right now could do?”

“Go for it if you want,” says Captain Gary, “But don’t put it up on our big holo-curtain.”

So I launch our quantumscopic application; thankfully, it runs without crashing. I do a calculation to flip its focal point. Similar to looking through a primitivistic stargazing contraption through its wrong way. 

I gasp, which, for a droid, is a crunching cacophony I’m told sounds similar to dial-up.

“Okay, put it on our big holo-curtain,” grunts Captain Gary. 

All of us watch. It’s that guy, sitting at his laptop in a room that looks as if it has an odor of swiss milk curd product. Thankfully, no masturbation for now. But this guy is picking at a spot out of sight. 

“Tilt down, flip 180,” says Captain Gary. “Zoom in. What’s that say? Q, W… R, T, Y? What’s going on? What’s that crusty spot?”

“What’s going on,” I say, without gloating, for this is no victory, “is that gazing into an abyss risks that it will soon start gazing back at us.”

“Talk plainly,” says Captain Gary.

"[WP] All of the rocks in the world come out of hibernation, they have been asleep since the beginning of humanity.",llcoll,"It was a Tuesday, rainy skies; nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. Gordel’s eyes glanced down at his watch, ’6:43 pm.’ A smile quickly formed on his face,

“You are the man, you are the man. You’re going to be 10 minutes early; the dad is going to love me. Score 1,”

He spoke to himself as he held the umbrella firmly against his shoulder, advancing around another street corner advancing closer to his new girlfriend’s home. So, there he was, walking down the concrete sidewalk in his blackened suit. Gordel was ready to take the world head on. 

Suddenly, the ground started to shake, the sound of a thunderous boom awakened in the atmosphere simultaneously. The man fell quickly to his knee’s, unable to stand in the wake of the current events. His emerald eyes swiftly glanced all around, only to see houses beginning to fall all around him. Another swarm of thunderous booms came quickly after, smoke barreling into the atmosphere. 

Gordel dropped the umbrella, placing his hands on the concrete. He held on tightly, thinking that if he didn’t, more than likely he would be thrown from the face of the earth. At that moment, all he cared about was his life; his girlfriend became put on the back burner. His heart pounded, 

“Please don’t let me die, I don’t want to die today. I want to live, I want to live, I want to live.” He spoke out; his sound choked with tears now streaming down his face. 

“Oh my God, look!” Someone shouted not too far from him. Which caused his head to turn towards the voice, to see someone pointing with a look of pure despair written across their face, Gordel turned back, only to have the same look of despair to become written across his face in like manner. 

The Mountain of Anubus was in the shape of a man, moving towards the edge of the city. The rock had red eyes seared into it’s foundation at the peak, along with frost coming around the edge of its mouth like a beard. A cave around the inner edge of the snow. Rocks that were falling from its side took their own shape like men. 

“It’s real; the stories are real! The rocks, their coming to life, just as the ancient stones foretold.” He murmured, his words stumbling over one another. 

Ancient stories were told about this day, known to be fairytales to him, but now they had become all too real. Abruptly, the thought that had evaded his mind came to him, his girlfriend. The male turned from the Mountain rock and started to run the opposite direction. Thought’s that had never crossed his mind became the center point; he glanced down at his watch once more, ‘6:58 pm.’ 


“Far too long have we kept our peace and silence. This world has become disgraceful to our people, and to our lands. We established ourselves before your existence, but now, we take back what is rightfully ours!” The mountains voice spoke loudly. 

Gordel turned back, but his body responded and kept running. Soak and wet from head to toe; he glanced at his watch once again, ‘7:01 p.m.’ As he continued to rush towards his new girlfriend's house. But little did he know, that the time was the very beginning of the end for the dominance of humanity.

As before, the resistance was able to send a lone sommelier. A selector for John. It was just a question of which one of them would reach him first…*

In a dark alley, between an abandoned gold’s gym and a trader joe’s, a bum was sleeping off his bottle of two buck chuck. Lightning began dancing off of the dumpster and across the wires in the alley. The bum awoke as a lick of lightning sparked across hid hand and he dropped his economically priced case of Charles Shaw Red Blend. His eyes grew wide at the light show and he curled into a fetal position as a ball of lighting coalesced into existence and then exploded, revealing the toned but nude form of a man. 

The man looked around and then down at the bum. “Your wine, give it to me.”

The bum reached into the box and pulled out a bottle. “Uhh, here you go man. I think you need it more than me.” He pulled out a corkscrew and popped the cork on the bottle before handing it over to the nude newcomer. 

The newcomer looked at the bottle and then took a swig from it. He narrowed his eyes at the bum. “This wine is barely acceptable for a girl’s night in. What are you doing drinking this in public?”

“Beats me man.”

The naked man handed the bottle back and went looking for a wine store. 

“1990 Bordeaux”

“That’s French, will you be drinking this solo or with a meal?”

“2015 Cabernet”

“Another from the Bordeaux region, just got these in. You can age it or drink it now. That’s a good wine.”

The nude man eyed the bottle and read the label. 

“Just look at the quality of the wine, it shines through the glass. Just put it in the glass of the woman you’re after and she’ll fall for you. It’s a can’t miss.”

The nude man only continued to look over the wines.

“Anything else?”

“2019 Riesling in a 16% range.”

“Hey, it’s just what you see pal.”

“The 2013 Bordeaux”

“You may know your wines, buddy. Although the thirteens are past their prime, you can still enjoy a more difficult blend at home.”

The nude man stared down the neck of the wine.

“So, uhh, what shall it be?”

“All.”

“So, uhh, I guess I’ll close early today. There’s no wait on the wine bottles, let me put them in a box so you can take them right now.” 

The nude man pulled a corkscrew from the counter and popped a cork from a bottle of 1990. 

The clerk saw what he was doing and pointed. “You can’t do that buddy.”

“Wrong.” The nude man took a pull from the bottle and spat it out, spraying the clerk in red wine. “This bottle is corked.”

The clerk passed out from embarrassment. 

The nude man picked up the rest of the bottles and walked out, pausing by the door to utter “Hasta la vista, baby.”",PoopsForDays

"[WP] resurrection is real, however there are only 7 billion souls in total. There are now 7 billion people on earth.",palitu,"He sat, stock-still on the worn loveseat, staring out at the yard.  The bike was there, still on its side where he had left it,, bright red paint glinting in the afternoon sun.  He wasn't crying.

Danny never cried.

""Sweetheart, don't you want to go out and play?""  I asked him, trying to find that place of reason he preferred, ""Logically you know that Sarah didn't intend to be mean.""

""I wanted to play, but I don't any more.""  Danny agreed, in his quiet voice, ""Mommy, why am I different?""

""Do you remember when we talked about non-renewable resources?""  I asked, trying to hide the slight quaver at the end, ""How sometimes things run out?""

""Yes.""  Danny agreed, turning his head to stare at me, sober and calm.

""There you go!  Unfortunately, some parts of how people are made are a resource that runs out.""  I told him, forcing a smile, and giving a small nod, ""Some people are born different.  And it's not bad, and it's not good, it just is.""

""If people don't want to be mean, mommy, why do they say mean things?""

That one I let sit for a moment, trying to think over again all the lessons that had been hammered into me.  Dozens of books, parenting classes, online resources...I thought I had been prepared.  I thought I had understood how we would raise him.

We would do better, we would teach him all the things that other people would know instinctively.  He would thrive, survive, become an example.

We wouldn't be those parents that threw our child on the system and prayed he'd turn out all right.

""Because some people are very complicated, sweetie.  They are afraid of things they don't understand.  They...emotions are very complex.""  I say, stumbling a bit, trying to keep that confidence in my voice, ""Emotions make people act and speak irrationally.""

""Sarah said when I die I'm gone forever, and she's going to come back.  She said I'm a 'bomination.""  Danny told her, so calm and stoic it only made me hurt more.

""Sarah is right about the first part, but not about the second.""  I told him, the slightest twitch of my lower lip forcing me to clamp down on it, fight back the tears before I could finish, ""You are not an abomination, but no, baby.  No, you're not going to come back.  You will be gone forever.""

Silence from him, but I could see he was thinking.  My brilliant boy.

""You might have only this life, sweetheart, but if you choose, you can do more with it than people do with a thousand.""  I told him, finally hearing my voice fracture,  ""It's your choice.  You can be amazing, you can do amazing things.  Just as you are.  You don't have to be anything else.""

""Okay.""  He agreed, sliding down from the couch, ""I'm gonna go play.""

""Okay, sweetheart.""  I agreed, smiling as he turned to glance at me.

I met his penetrating stare, keeping my smile in place as he searched my face.  He'd gotten better at smiling, but even though we'd discussed the usefulness of fitting in, he never quite seemed to care enough. 

He shouldn't have to, but that was life.

People would still expect you to smile, to pretend to care, to need them the way they needed you.  To care about the things that they cared about.  I understood that he didn't, but it was my job to teach him how to make people believe he did.

""Mommy, you're crying.""  He told me, and then turned for the door.

Lifting my shaking hands, I wiped my cheeks as he headed to play outside.  The small, pathetic hurt I bundled back up and folded it away inside me.  It didn't belong, it wasn't necessary.  I had chosen to raise him, to keep him, and my own emotions had no place in it.  I had a duty now.

He would do amazing things.


But he would never love me.",bubblefritz
"[WP] resurrection is real, however there are only 7 billion souls in total. There are now 7 billion people on earth.",palitu,"“Sir, we’ve got a problem.  We’re running out of human souls.”

“What?  Don’t be preposterous, Jenkins, we created 7 billion.”

“I know, sir, but the human population has grown to over six and a half billion already.  We project that within the next 25 human ‘years’ they will exceed soul capacity.”

“Check the figures again, Jenkins.  Did Frank run these numbers?  He’s always getting sloppy.”

“I assure you, sir, the numbers are correct.  I’ve checked and double checked them myself.”

“But that’s impossible.  That planet can sustain four to five billion at most.  Why, at seven billion they’ll begin to do irreparable harm.”

“Yes, sir.  We tried forcing them into a couple of global wars to knock them back to the ‘stone age’ as they call it, but they only developed technology *faster*!  Somehow they’ve managed to manipulate plant life to create a reliable food source.”

“Hmm, I see.  We’ll have to petition for the right to create new souls while we think of a more long-term solution to such unmanageable population levels.”

“Very good, sir.  Of course, that will take several of their millennia at least before we hear back on the petition.  What shall I do in the meantime?”  Here, if the abstract idea of Jenkins had a face, he would have grimaced as he voiced his next question. “Should I...should we...fracture their souls?”

“What?!  Good heavens, no!  You know full well what damage a fractured soul causes.  Why do you think we have an entire soul-repair division?  You want to *intentionally* fracture souls?  Honestly, Jenkins, what has gotten into you?”

“I’m sorry, sir.  I don’t know what came over me.  The question remains, however.  What do we do?”

“I think for now we’ll simply have to leave some of them without souls.  That is a far more merciful fate to inflict than forcing them to live with only a part of a soul.”

“As you say, sir.”

“It’s our best option, Jenkins.  We’ll simply have to live with the consequences of letting this get so far out of hand.”

“Yes, I’d like a footlong black forest ham on honey oat with american cheese, untoasted.  For toppings I’d like lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, and a little bit of bell pepper.” Mrs. Vanderburg said, waiting patiently while the young, red-headed man behind the counter began assembling her sandwich.  He moved at a pace that would have bored a snail.  Mrs. Vanderburg tapped her foot while he continued slapping cheese onto the discolored meat.  When he had finally completed the sandwich, and Mrs. Vanderburg had successfully jack-hammered a hole in the linoleum with the ball of her foot, he rang her up.

“That’ll be $6.75. Ma’am.  Please have a nice day.” He said with a smile, but the smile never reached his grey, soulless eyes.

Imagine a computer, a machine so advanced it was perfectly indistinguishable from a human. Would that machine have a soul despite only being a more complex version of your regular old laptop? without a concrete way to measure this mysterious entity, we will never know. What we do know, is that this machine having a soul would have to mean that all machines have souls, regardless of simplicity, and that this would likely apply to animals as well. If not, then we'd have to ask ourselves ""If something soulless cannot be distinguished from a human, does that not mean there could be soulless humans as well, indistinguishable from the rest of the population, but with nothing inside?"". And if we continued on this trail of thought, would we not come to the conclusion that all life besides our own is soulless, or that our own soul in fact is a mindless hitchiker inside our body, incapable of anything but experiencing?

I myself didn't, but required a methaphorical kick in the back to realize the truth. It came like a bolt of lightning out of a clear sky, my eyes suddenly seeing things none before me had. These tiny lights inside of living creatures, shining through the skulls of plant and insect alike. Not all had these shining beacons inside, however, and most organisms in my line of sight lacked the spark which inhabited some of their kin. Intrigued, i left the forest trail i'd been walking along, and made my way closer to the mossy woods at its edge. The pines above covered the anthill i was quickly approaching in a patchwork of shade, leaving dots of illumination on the massive nest. Spotting a certain ant in the chaos of the antcolony, i picked it up, and promptly squashed it between my fingers. The little mote of light within it flickered once, and then went somewhere i couldn't grasp. It didn't go in a direction per se, but rather into itself, while at the same time expanding to encompass me and everything in sight. I could, however, feel that it had left the now dead ant. By now, i had already figured out that what i was seeing was souls, and done what most people do when something they don't want to deal with comes up, namely go home. I quickly turned around, heading towards the small town i called home. As i got out of the local forest, and once more entered civilization, i realized something. If the shiny things i saw were souls, why did only some beings hold them?

An elderly man came jogging from the opposite direction, heading towards the forest. His tight outfit showing more figure than wanted, the inside of his skull, dark.

Jack Kimball watched his wife on the hospital bed. Her heart was beating. Her breaths were heaving. He had thought of the 53 years they had been married each other. He moved his wedding ring around his hand. They got hitched when he was 22, and she was 20. 

They had noticed it a few months ago. She was feeling dizzy, and wanted to sit down in her rocking chair by the window. He had gone into the kitchen to make some tea when she started moving. The dog started whining, and when Jack came back into the living room, she was raising and lowering her arm. Jack put down the cup and started to walk towards her, when she completely blacked out. He drove her to the hospital to see what was wrong. That was the first time he had gone over the speed limit since he was in his 30's. The doctors diagnosed it as Grade IV Glioblastoma. She had 4 months to live.

Here he was today, watching her breathe in, wait what seemed like forever, and then breathe out. Breathe in...out. Breathe in...out. Breathe in...nothing. No sudden movement. His wife died in a whimper.

The greedy fucks just breed like little shits. I mean, they even breed with their own family. That's kinda sick ain't it John?""

""Yes sir,"" I respond, letting out a silent sigh. I stare up at the towering figure, his stoic body glowing softly with divine light. He's been at it for hours now. It's been days since he first started getting wasted on star juice, and he hasn't stopped since. Right now he's a bigger problem than the fact that we're running out of souls.

""And then,"" the man says, his giant cup slopping some of its juice across the floor, ""God tells me 'sorry I don't do plagues anymore' like he's too fucking good for us now?! I was there when that little shit was born."" He stands up, roaring his final words up at the sky with a shake of his fist. ""I HAVE YOUR BABY PICTURES YOU FUCKING PRICK!""

""Sir-"" I start, but my words are cut off when i watch the eyes roll in the back of his head. I watch in a state of strange calm as he starts to keel over, falling forward toward us all. I quietly take a few steps to the right, just in time to hear a heavy oomph as he hits the soft, mist-like floor. I stare at his body for a while, trying to comprehend what is happening. I look around at my subordinates with looks of terror on all their face. I can't blame them. I mean, this has never happened before. We only give souls to sentient races. What sentient race breeds like rabbits? Have they ever heard of quality over quantity?

""Sir!"" One of my subordinates says, having appeared before me. ""Since the Keeper is now unconscious, regulation DicPic states that you're now enacted as the temporary Keeper until he is otherwise available.""

""Regulation wha-no, never mind,"" I mutter. I forgot who was our boss. ""so now it's my fucking problem huh?"" I feel a strong urge to kick my boss, but I suppress it for the good of my health. At the very least, I get to take his chair. I take the steps up to the misty platform slowly, letting it sink in. I am the Keeper now-no wait, that's not important. There's no point in enjoying this if we're all out of jobs in the next few days. Moving a little faster, I finally make it to the top. Turning around, I plonk myself down and rest on the giant chair.

""my friends,"" I say softly, the words travelling through the air. They all look up at me, anxiety and fear across their faces. I give them a reassuring smile. ""I know this may seem like the end-""

""It is the end mate!"" I hear someone cry out. Frowning, I look over to see who it is. Ah. I give him a small nod of my head and a twinkle in my eye. I did need to find someone to replace so I could get that cute girl into the workforce. I'll remember your face for later.

""It may seem like the end, but do not fear!"" I cry out, raising myself up, my arms reaching wide as if to encompass the whole room. ""Why? Because..."" I falter for a second, realising I don't actually have a solution. I look around desperately, trying to come up with anything in the few moments I have before they start realising I don't know what I'm doing. Wait, that's it! my eyes light up with fervor. I have an idea.

""My friends!"" I cry out, grinning widely. ""We do not need to fear because we can simply split the souls in half and give half each to 2 humans! We'd double our souls in moments. Everyone would be saved!""

""Isn't that a little..."" I hear them start muttering.

""So he was that sort of person. Yuck, and I had the hots for him...""

""So even Celestials can get a bad apple once in a while...""

""Isn't he rather ugly-""

Wait, that last one is uncalled for! ""Okay you're right,"" I say, raising my hands. ""That wasn't the best idea. I was just testing you. The truth is...my real idea is..."" I feel sweat start to trickle down my brow as my subordinate's stare at me. Their looks are rather...hey, I'm not that bad am I. Come on. I'm trying my best. Your stares hurt. Think, self. If you come up with a brilliant idea you can get yourself out of this predicament. And remember, the cute girl doesn't know anything yet. You can score at least once before she thinks of you as trash.

""Of course!"" I say loudly, feeling a newfound strength overwhelm me. ""I have it! We give a soul...to every second human! That way, it'll last us 14 billion right?""

""Are we sure he didn't come off the defected stand?""

""I wouldn't doubt it. Even Gods make mistakes once in a while, you know?""

""And with those looks...I'm just saying, if God didn't craft him as a mistake I just feel sorry for him.""

Hey...that last one is still uncalled for.

""Hey boss,"" I hear someone else perk up, calling to me. I look up quickly, pain in my eyes.

""Yes?"" I ask cautiously, expecting to be put down.

""No, I'm not going to hurt your feelings,"" the guy says, shaking his head. ""I mean, are you even worth it?"" Hey...that hurt my feelings. ""I'm just asking a question here. I mean, feel free to tell me I'm being ridiculous. But can't we just...make more?""

""..."" Everyone stares blankly at the guy, trying to process the information we were just given.

""I'm just saying but did you even look?"" he asks, walking over toward the big machine that towers in the front of the room. ""Doesn't this say ""add more souls"" right here?"" He says, pointing to a big, bright blue button. I walk over next to him and peer at it. He's right. It does.

""So both him and big boss are like that huh?""

""Yeah, maybe someone tried out his idea and gave them only half a brain each.""

""They definitely didn't give him any good looks, that's for sure. I know this is kinda getting old, but jesus is he fucking ugl-""

Drowning out the rest of the voices, I plonk myself back down on the massive chair. I look around the room, feeling a sense of emptiness filling me. is this what my life accumulates to? I look down at the boss, and more important at his liquor. I agree, big boss. I reach down and struggle to pick up his drink. This jobs pretty fucking shit. Raising the glass high, I start downing some of the good stuff.

"[WP] There are 2 humans left on Earth: you, and a crush you once asked out who said ""I wouldn't date you if you were the last person on Earth""",sToTab,"""Well...well...well,"" Each word slid off Jay's tongue in a slow, deliberate manner as he looked at the woman standing in front of him. This wasn't just any woman though, this was *her*.

""Jay,"" Stacy said softly, ""Let's not make this any more uncomfortable than-""

""Silence!"" Jay bellowed at her. He probably meant for his voice to sound commanding, or threatening, but instead it cracked and he sounded like a child on the edge of pubescence. Of course, Stacy knew that this was probably an apt description of him despite the fact that the greasy haired, fedora wearing man in front of her was on the cusp of thirty. They were in what had been his mom's basement, he was sitting on a life-size replica on the Iron Throne, and at his right hand was a body pillow with a picture of his waifu Mashiro on it.

""I'm king of this world now,"" he continued, ""And I will decide how *comfortable* this will be.""

His extra emphasis on the word comfortable made her shiver. Much to Stacy's dismay, he noticed.

""You can't even contain yourself,"" Jay smiled as he rose to his feet, ""Just the thought of the comforts I could offer has you shivering where you stand.""

Stacy did her best not to feign a gagging sound, and instead stared at him in silent contempt. Reading social cues had never been Jay's strong point though, and the effect was lost on him.

""Kneel,"" he suddenly whispered.

""Excuse me?"" Stacy blurted out.

""Twelve years, Stacy."" Jay sighed, ""Twelve years ago you told me you wouldn't date me if I was the last person on Earth, and then left me for *Chad*. And now, you show up here as one of the last two people on this planet, begging me for companionship. I will consider it, for I am a gentleman, but first you will kneel.""

Stacy wanted to scream at him, to call him vile and disgusting, to berate him for not having changed an ounce over the past twelve years. She thought that coming here would be a good thing, surely no one could be this awful, this self absorbed, this delusional about what the world is and their place in it for twelve years without some sort of reality check.

But she was wrong. He hadn't changed.

And he was right. They were the last two people on Earth. Her sweet, sweet, Chad was gone. The man who had hugged her all night the day her puppy had died, who had stayed up two nights in a row writing a song to propose to her, who was universally loved by everyone he came into contact with, and was one of the most genuinely good people she had ever met.

She swallowed her pride, and unconsciously touched her stomach. Inside of her was Chad's unborn child, and as the child grew she would eventually be unable to take care of herself alone.

*Just once,* she thought as she fell to one knee, *Sleep with Jay once, convince him that the child is his, and then you might have a chance.*

She would have the child, and after a few years they would run. But for the short term, she would have to put up with Jay.

He approached Stacy, and cupped her cheek in his shaky hands. It was all she could do not the pull away from him. Jay leaned in close to her ear, and whispered.

""Let's take this upstairs M'lady,"" he said with what sounded like his attempt at a seductive voice. Before Stacy could react, she felt something wet and warm slowly moving its way up the side of her face.

He was licking her, she realized.

""Okay,"" she yelled, rising to her feet, ""I'm done. Nope. You're insane.""

""What?"" Jay said, dumbfounded.

""I was wrong,"" Stacy explained as she turned her back on him, ""I thought I was being too cruel when I said I would never date you. I didn't put much thought into it when I said it, and now that we're in that exact situation, I thought maybe it could work.""

""I was just-,"" Jay began.

""Shut up,"" Stacy cut him off, ""Now I realize I wasn't cruel *enough*. That I wasn't clear *enough*. Not only will I still not date you, even though we are the last two people on Earth, I will risk the life of myself and my unborn child just to be sure that I never have to see you again. I would rather my child and myself die, than have both of us survive living with you.""

Jay began to whimper, and Stacy decided the least she could do was leave so he didn't have to cry in front of her.

""Friendzoned again,"" he sighed into his body pillow, as the basement door slammed shut. ""Stupid bitch. I'm a nice guy, what's wrong with her?""

"[WP] There are 2 humans left on Earth: you, and a crush you once asked out who said ""I wouldn't date you if you were the last person on Earth""",sToTab,"""Well?""

Otho looks up from where he's scavenging among the plants to laugh derisively. ""I told you I wouldn't date you if you were the last person on Earth. We are the last people on Earth. So, I won't date you.""

""But most people aren't actually expecting—""

Otho waves me off, bending down to pull the carrots out of the garden. ""I was. I'm not like other people, remember?""

""What, at the tender age of fourteen?"" I scoff.

""Come on. We all knew this apocalypse was coming.""

I roll my eyes and return to my own section of the garden. The bug that came and took us—took everyone except us, rather—affected only humans. It only took a few months for the rest of the world's population to die off, once the bug, Plasma, hit critical levels and started infiltrating through Asia. That was seven months ago now, before Otho and I somehow found each other again. But when we were fourteen, when I first asked him out on a date—maybe about three and a half years ago, when students were still going into school for some semblance of education, because when there were still four billion people left in the world, things still seemed salvageable—he said no. Those exact words, of course. I know; I remembered them myself. I don't know how he manages to remember them, in their specific order—but there you go.

Maybe he does love me, I start to think, but I cut off the thought, and return to divesting this garden of its vegetables. I'm in the tomato part of it, stripping the red fruit off the creepers which curl up over their wooden sticks. With the apocalypse having happened so recently, there are still hundreds, thousands of bodies around; there are even a few in this garden, which was of the sort that would belong to rich people. Otho and I have been avoiding them as best as we can, though he did risk going near-ish to them to get snap peas...and I do love snap peas....

""Trudi,"" Otho says now, drawing me from the tomatoes, ""do you ever think about everyone we know?""

And I shrug one shoulder. When you're surrounded by all that death—when, literally, every single person you've ever known has disappeared into the abyss—you just think, well—

""I think that one guy said it best,"" I say quietly, taking the carrots he hands me and slipping them into our rucksack, since his is full. ""'One death is a tragedy. A million is a statistic.' Or something.""

""That's an awfully cavalier way for you to feel,"" he murmurs.

I shrug, not looking at him, instead focusing on shoving my tomatoes into the sack. ""I...."" I haven't really processed it yet; it all feels like we're on some grand adventure, like any day now we're going to go back home and find my parents, smiling at me. We went to boarding school together; I'm used to not seeing my family for extended periods of time. And I didn't have that many friends....

""We'll be okay,"" I say finally, forcing a smile, and Otho's face falls.

""I'm sorry I don't treat you very kindly,"" he says.

""Oh, I—"" Wait, why I am I apologizing? ""Thank you,"" I say, flashing him a grin. ""I know—you must be in shock, right? And trauma? You were never that mean before.""

""Yeah, I guess so. And it's not just that....""

""Why?""

""Well, whether we 'date' or not,"" he says, framing the word in air quotes, ""we're going to have to repopulate the Earth, aren't we?""

I look around us, at the rich people's garden. There are still animals frolicking around; the place is covered in kudzu, but it can't hide the three corpses that surround us, ruining the snap peas and the cabbage and part of the flower garden.

""I don't know,"" I say. ""I'd like to. But we're so young.... I don't really hate you either, though,"" I add after a moment.

Otho nods. ""I didn't think you did.""

There's a silence.

""Let's go look at the iceberg lettuce, shall we?"" I say lightly, drawing us out of our own thoughts. ""The animals aren't going to get it for us.""

But I'm crying as I say the words, and tears are starting to spill from Otho's eyes as well. Without exchanging a word, we reach forward and hug each other.

""Trudi?"" he says, when his arms around me and mine are around him.

""Yeah?""

""I...I don't know that we're going to be okay. But I'm going to be here for you.""

""I'm here for you too.""

We hug a moment more, then he gently breaks away. ""Shall we go get the lettuce? It's not going to walk off and jump into our rucksack,"" he says, wiping a hand through the tears in his eyes, and I give him a smile.

""Yes, let's,"" I say. 

Together, in harmony, we stand up, take each other's hands, and start walking over to the lettuce—and the rest of our lives.",rockwell78

"[WP] There are 2 humans left on Earth: you, and a crush you once asked out who said ""I wouldn't date you if you were the last person on Earth""",sToTab,"“You ever hear a silence like this before?” I asked Jessica.

“Nope. Never.” She said. “If you keep talking, I never will again either.”

“Yea. Well. I guess I’ll just go over there.” I said. 

Scratching the back of my neck, I felt the scruff of my hair coming in. I hate that, when the hair grows out after a haircut, and the neck hair and sides grow faster than the rest, and you don’t really need a haircut overall but those parts definitely need to be trimmed. 

“Hey,” I swung around. “I know you said ‘not if we were the last two people on earth…”

“I meant it Seth.” She said.

“Yeah, when there were like, 8 billion people around.” I said. “But did you ever really think about if we were the last two people on earth? Like, literally the last two people alive?”

“Well, when you put it like that… Yeah. Nope. Still not gonna happen.”

“Seriously?” I said, shocked that she was still playing hard to get. “You’re seriously not even entertaining the idea of repopulating the world with me?”

“Uhh, nope.” She swung her beautiful golden hair over her shoulder and turned her back to me. “Don’t bother.”

“Well, I hope you enjoy a long lonely life. Cause if you’re really gonna turn me down now, in the end of human kind, then I guess I’m just gonna have to go explore what’s out there on my own.” I said, leaning forward hoping she would take the bait.

“Fine, you go do that. I’ll be here, or somewhere, doing something else.” She said. She pulled a piece of bubbleicious out of her pocket, unwrapped it, and popped it in her mouth. I could hear it smacking in her teeth and the exhale with a little pop after. 

Man, that girl is dense and basic, but she captured my nervous system. If I can’t capture her heart when there is no one else left, then what the hell am I wasting my time for?

I said, “Okay. I’m off.” I began walking down the road, and found a razor scooter against a trash bin. I hopped on a pumped my way into the distance. 

A few miles later I heard a slight whirring noise. It got a little bit louder, and louder still. I stopped and looked behind me. Coming down the hill, long golden hair flowing in the wind, was Jessica.

My heart did a backflip and my mouth went dry.

She raced down the hill on a little green and black bmx bike. She slammed the brakes as she neared me and fishtailed to a stop a few feet away. She walked the bike up next to me, and we looked at each other.

She reached out toward me and everything went slow like  waking up from surgery. Then she punched me hard in the chest. 

“Ow! What the heck?”

“You were really gonna leave me alone back there? You are such a tool. We’re the last two people on earth you idiot.” She said.

I was silent, squinty eyed, and my head turned like a dog trying to understand.

“Well, let’s go on that adventure you were talking about. Maybe we can repopulate the world.” She said.

We ditched our rides in the middle of the street and locked arms together, and walked. 

I looked at her and said, ""How are you at cutting hair?"".

"[WP] There are 2 humans left on Earth: you, and a crush you once asked out who said ""I wouldn't date you if you were the last person on Earth""",sToTab,"Humanity had been refining teleportation technology for two decades, but with all the progress, the machines still needed two operators on either end to function. For this reason, two volunteers had to remain behind when we evacuated Earth. It just so happened that the only two volunteers qualified to operate a teleporter were me and my middle school crush, Jessie.

The last person we ported out was the president of the United Space Council, who had given us a small medal ceremony and speech of thanks. After confirming he was through safely, we shut down the teleporter for the last time.

""So what now?"" Jessie asked, looking at me from over her console.

""Whatever we want, I guess. We've got plenty of supplies left, so that won't be an issue."" It was true. A month's worth of food, water and other necessities had been stockpiled in a bunker for us: enough to last the rest of our lives.

""So what do you want to do? We can go anywhere, do anything, no one can stop us."" She replied.

""I don't know. There's nothing in particular I want to see. What about you?""

""Nah. I'm not really into travel.""

""I guess we could just watch Netflix in the bunker.""

""That sounds good to me.""

We walked across the street to the bunker in silence. It didn't look very sturdy: it didn't need to be, as it wasn't designed to protect us, just to be a place to live comfortably for our remaining few weeks. We sat down on the couch and I switched on the TV, looking for something to watch.

""What about this documentary?"" I suggested. ""It's about colonising Mars.""

""Nah, I'm not into history.""

In the end we settle for an old episode of South Park. It really went downhill after the fourtieth season or so.

After watching a while, I ask her:

""Hey Jessie, you remember when we were in 8th grade...?""

""And you asked me out?""

""Yeah. Do you remember what you said?""

""I said 'No'.""

""Yeah, but do you remember your exact words? I do.""

""I don't remember.""

""You said you wouldn't go out with me if I was the last guy on Earth.""

She paused, and we both burst out laughing.

""Maybe I was a little harsh."" she admitted.

""So you're saying...""

""Maybe. Give me a month to decide.""",kibblestheclown

After hitting your head on the job, you can no longer remember which country you're ACTUALLY loyal to",sToTab,"My sight was blurry from the impact. I don't remember ever feeling so sore and hungry from waking up since Tommy's bachelor party back in London. Well, at least I still had every limb in my body. 

I could see my whole body lying on the stretcher right in the middle of the infirmary. Moving my feet took me some time to get used to. I caressed my head to make sure everything was in place, and felt a big lump above my right ear. After all, it did hurt like a bitch to get struck by a swinging metal pole.

I couldn't remember much, except that we were in the open sea. The clearest image that I had was the captain and the rest of the men on the other side of the ship looking at me, in the middle of the storm, as I ran towards the inside. The heavy rain falling on us didn't help me at all to walk across the ship. Heavy winds brushed me away. The look on the captain's face was blank, as if he had seen a ghost. ""Erik!"" was all I could hear him scream, as I sprinted across the ship. It was at that moment when the pole hit me. 

After recovering control of my whole body, I figured it'd be a good time to eat something. I don't remember the last meal I had. I stood up, and headed towards the kitchen, hoping to find anything that wasn' stale or rotten. 

As I walked through the infirmary, I noticed the amount of sick men lying down. For some reason, the amount of men was unnaturally high. You'd always expect to see 1 or 2 soldiers but this time there were about 6. 

The medic was looking after one of them, who appeared to have lost an arm. For some reason my instinct told me to avoid the medic, which I did by walking quietly as I left the room. I wondered why I did this, but was more concerned on feeding my growling stomach. 

Inside the kitchen, there was almost nothing left to eat. I checked the biggest pot and found some stew left. Seeing no one was around, I quickly filled a bowl with some stew and ate it.

I walked up the stairs heading towards the deck to find out what happened. To my surprise I found that there were almost no men left, and a big chunk of the ship was blown off. During my 2 weeks staying on this ship I don't remember ever seeing that hole on the floor. Right next to the hole I saw Private Baum picking up some remaining explose charges. I requested him to fill me up on the situation.

""The explosion was caused by a bomb, sir"" he said in German. ""We still don't know who the responsible was, and there still are some explosive chargessir."" At first he seemed confused, which was understandable, but then I explained I didn't remember what had happened. He then told me to look for the captain, since he wanted to talk to me.

The only room at deck level was the captain's. As I was coming closer to knock of the door, I heard Private Baum shout ""Fire!"". My shoulders became tense as I turned around. The ship was being bombarded. From a distance I saw what looked like a ship from the English navy. 

Everyone was rushing down the stairs towards the cannons of the ship. Naturally I followed, even though I wasn't completely aware of the previous situation. The soldiers were aiming the cannons towards the English boat. I tried to find an empty canno but most were either occupied, blown apart or missing something. That explosion had caused serious damaged our boat.

Since no cannon was available, I tried to help in any other way. Sergeant Habicht was firing one, and I noticed him shouting his ammunition was running low. I sprinted towards the ammunition reserves and picked up a crate labeled with the word ""Munition"" in red capital letters. 

As I was returning to the sergeant I looked from the window to see the English ship taking recieving damage. I could the sergeant as he shouted ""need ammo!"" in German. I started loading his weapon back when I suddenly stopped. He was screaming at me various words in German which I didnt really pay attention to. It was all coming back. I wasn't with the German military, I was an undercover spy sent by the British. 

This attack had been already planned, and I was sent here to prevent the Kriegsmarine from retaliating against the Englishmen, who knew were outgunned by the Germans. My sole purpose of staying on this ship was to blow it up, and I failed it.

"[WP] There are 2 humans left on Earth: you, and a crush you once asked out who said ""I wouldn't date you if you were the last person on Earth""",sToTab,"I could see my neighbor approaching me with that same walk that had caused me to trip and spill my lunch tray all over the cafeteria floor in the third grade. As she walked, she held her eyes slightly downcast - like when you're walking down a long hallway and someone is walking down from the other way, you're the only two people, and it's too awkward to make eye contact.

Her eyes were...""beautiful blue, like the sky, like the seas, and my favorite blueberry slushie"" was how I had described them in a poem I had written for her in the fourth grade. I didn't show her that poem until the sixth grade. She laughed and threw it in the trash.

She got closer and I could see that her hair was tied back in an intricately braided ponytail. The sun gleamed bright on high, and turned her blonde hair golden. She looked up and smiled with beautiful white teeth that I hadn't seen been yellow since she joined the cheerleading team in 5th grade.

Without asking, she came and sat with me on the porch and stared ahead, like I had been doing. I glanced at her - found the small mole on her neck that I loved; no bigger than a period- and then turned away. 

I pointed at the sidewalk in front of her house. ""Right there. I fell off my bike and broke my hand the first day I saw you in the front yard with your mom.""

I could feel her looking at me. I guided my hand to the right, pointing at her lawn. ""And that's where I sang love songs to you all-night in the 7th grade.""

I dropped my hand and touched the small space on the porch beside me. ""When I fell off and broke my hand, you laughed and you've been laughing at me ever since. When I sang to you, you never opened the window; never gave me any window of opportunity to get to know you. But you see this spot on the porch where I'm touching?""

She looked down at my hand, briefly, then back up at my face and nodded.

""This is where I had my first kiss. That night, in 8th grade, when you told me that you wouldn't date me if I was the last person on Earth...I cried. Right here. And some girl left the party, crossed the street, and sat right here with me. Cried with me. Comforted me and told me that you weren't worth spending so much energy and time over. I hated her. Because I didn't realize it then - but what she was saying was true. When she kissed me, I sat up and wiped my lips and told her to get off my porch and never to talk to me again.

For the next three days after that, I was mean to her...so...mean... But for some reason, she just kept smiling at me, doing little things for me, trying to make me laugh and...basically doing all the things I did to get you to like me.

Finally I just decided to get with her because I surely wasn't getting any attention from you. I had planned to just use her as a practice for if you suddenly had a change of heart. What I hadn't planned on...was falling in love with that girl.

Two weeks later, she was dead.""

Her eyes widened. She knew who I was talking about. They had announced her name on the speakers in school. 

She lifted her hand to touch mine, but I pulled away.

""In 8th grade,"" I continued. ""...you told me you wouldn't date me if I was the last person alive. Well,"" I gestured around, ""we are. And unless we find other people out here, somewhere, the human race is going to die with us. Because I don't want to date you, sleep with you, or any of that. I'll help you survive, but that's it. I know what love is, and you can't provide it to me.""

Then I walked inside and quietly shut the door.

"[WP] There are 2 humans left on Earth: you, and a crush you once asked out who said ""I wouldn't date you if you were the last person on Earth""",sToTab,"I needed to get the hell off this planet.

Over the past month or so, this sentence had become my mantra. All I could think about was escaping the hell-hole formerly known as Earth. Humanity's arrogance and insatiable greed had rapidly depleted the Earth's natural resources, while their pride had launched nuclear missiles and killed billions of people, baring two -- me and Amara, my crush from high school. 

A long time ago (or at least, it FELT like a long time ago), I had asked Amara with a sweet poem about destiny, only to receive a scathing response:

""I wouldn't date you if you were the last person on Earth.""

If I was still the boy I was when I asked her out, I would have said God was on my side. Now, on the other hand, I wanted to march up to the Almighty Prick's door and punch Him in His Almighty face. Why?

Because Amara and I were the only survivors the human race left on Earth. The lucky few thousands who had survived had left the planet and travelled throughout the cosmos. Through some scavenged communications tech, I managed to hear the most awe-inspiring stories filled with adventure and wonder.

Meanwhile, I was stuck on this god-awful husk of a planet, with a woman I couldn't care less about. Not to say that Amara was a horrible person, but rather she kept insisting that we stay on Earth and repopulate -- that this was a second chance. Unfortunately for her, I no longer felt that way; all I cared about was reaching for the stars and joining a species that wasn't such an utter embarrassment (I had my eyes on the Etherean society). As soon as I finished building my makeshift teleporter, I was outta here.

...

With a triumphant grin and elated sensation, it was finally ready to use. I was just about to press the button that would teleport me to the Etherean High Council (I had all my paperwork ready), when Amara came running towards me with a pleading look in her eyes.

""No! You can't leave! This is our home!""

I rolled my eyes at her.

""Maybe it's yours, but it is NOT mine anymore! You're welcome to come along, if you want.""

""We can finally be together,"" Amara said with a flutter of her eyelashes. ""Just the two of us; we can build a life together. It is our destiny.""

I pretended to consider her argument. 

""Nah. My destiny is out there, and it is calling to me.""

With a press of a button, I disappeared in a flash of blinding light, before I found myself in front of the Etherean High Council. They were tall, gangly beings with violet skin and sapphire-blue eyes like tennis balls. As members of the High Council, they wore elegant robes of blood-red. Behind the eight members of the High Council was a glass wall, behind which one could see the sprawling crystalline city full of technological wonders.

""Welcome to Etheria.""

I couldn't be happier.

"[WP] There are 2 humans left on Earth: you, and a crush you once asked out who said ""I wouldn't date you if you were the last person on Earth""",sToTab,"I walked down the lonely street searching for any sign of any human life. It all happened so fast that no one could do anything about it. The hadron collider caused a quantum energy flux and sent every human being into the future 20 years. Well... almost everyone. 

The reports from the machines indicated that 1 percent of the population was still in this time zone. However most of those were located in China and very few were here in the US. So for all intents and purposes I was the last man on earth. 

I was heading down deserted streets just looking for people. I had already armed myself, not for other humans mind you, but for dogs and other animals that had suddenly become feral after a few days without food. I had my rifle shouldered and pointed towards a pile of garbage as a heard some rustling. 

""DONT SHOOT!!"" A voice rang out from behind the garbage. 

I lowered my rifle and looked curiously. ""Is someone back there?"" 

""Yes... Yes someone is back here."" The voice said in a no shit kind of tone. 

""I won't shoot you. I thought you were another wild dog. Here I will lay down my rifle if you want."" I said as I laid it at my feet. 

Suddenly a clump of cherry red hair and freckles stood up from behind the garbage cans. Jenny Slim. An old high school crush and a girl I had not seen in 12 years stood up and walked around the garbage cans. ""Hello Jenny."" I said with a smile. 

She squinted for a second and then here eyes went wide. ""Marvin!?"" She exclaimed and ran over to hug me. ""Oh my god you do not know what it has been like. Ever since it happened I have seen no one at all. It was like everyone on earth had died."" She said a million miles per hour as she hugged me. 

Suddenly flashes of 9th grade flew through my head. A time when I was nervous and asked her out to the dance the next saturday night. I had made the mistake of asking her in front of her friends causing her to loudly proclaim that she would never dance with me even if I were the last man on earth. Reality snapped back when she broke the hug blushing. 

""You have changed."" She said looking away. 

""Yeah I lost the weight and grew a goatee."" I said stroking my moustache making her laugh. ""You have changed too."" I said noticing how she had filled out in all the right places over the years. 

Jenny blushed and looked away laughing. ""Stop it."" She said with a giggle. She took a moment to compose herself. ""OK. So. Do you know anything? Where is everyone and how are we still here?"" She asked. 

I explained how an accident had occurred at Cern and how most of humanity had been transported 20 years into the future. Not just humanity but the vehicles they rode in and anything they happened to be touching. So fortunately there were not thousands of airplanes crashing into the earth causing massive wildfires. That comes later. 

Once I finished explaining the situation to her I told her about the base I had set up. I took her back down to my car and drove her to the underground server farm that was set up to run netflix for the south central part of the US. I take her in and show her the amenities. This facility had its own solar power plant, its own water source, and its own kitchen. In short, it had everything we would need. 

Once she got in and settled she grabbed my laptop and started looking through it. 

""Uhhhhhhh"" I heard from behind me. ""Mind explaining why you have a very large porn collection on here?"" I blushed and looked away embarrassed. 

 ""I thought I would never see another human again."" I said without thinking. 

Jenny looked down for a second and then back up. Here eyes went wide and her skin turned pale. ""I never thought of that."" She said absentmindedly. 

""Never thought of what?"" I asked knowing full well what she meant. 

""We are quite possibly the last two people on earth. Of course we would want to... you know."" She said getting awkward.

""Have sex?"" I asked grinning. 

Here face went completely red and she turned around. ""DATE!"" She said nervously. 

""Relax... even though this is definitely a lair it is not my 'sex dungeon' or anything else nefarious like that. It is just where I found to hole up while this is happening."" I said laughing. Jenny visibly loosened up when I said this and turned around. 

""Heh yeah I guess you have a point."" She said as she sat down and pulled up a music file on my laptop. 

The music was ""Careless Whisper"" and quite possibly the best mood setting song I had ever used when dating. ""Cmon lets dance."" She said with a smile. 

I grabbed her arm and pulled her in close as we danced to the music. As the song changed to ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" I started laughing. 

""What"" She asked giggling. 

""Do you remember back in, 10 grade for you 9th for me, when I asked you out to the valentines day dance?"" I said as she smirked. 

""I know I told you no."" You were quite pudgy and nerdy back then.

""Well the exact words you used were. 'Not even if you were the last man on earth.' Well... here I am the last man on earth and we are finally getting our dance."" I said with a big grin making her laugh so hard she fell over making me catch her. 

Jenny then smiled up and grabbed onto my shirt pulling me down to the ground. ""Cmere smart ass."" She said as our clothes flew off in blind passion. ",texasgunowner12

I mean, if you could choose to live anywhere on earth, why would you choose Australia? Sure, it gets nice and hot there, beaches to chill on, (chill? OK, maybe not), but basically everything wants to kill you there. But maybe that was the point. 

That was a few months ago. I lost track of exactly how many. I did try, at the beginning I thought it was important to cling onto the human construct of time, but then the days merged into each other, weeks, months....

I'd moved to what was formerly Florida, it was somewhere I'd always wanted to go. Nice and warm, all year round, without getting too ridiculously hot. OK, so there was a rainy season, but I'd cross that bridge when I got there. And I could always move again - the world was my oyster, right? Or at least half of it. And at least it wasn't grey and rainy every single day of the year. I'd never been so tanned in my life. Not that there was anyone around to appreciate it, but you can't win them all, eh? 

I mean, really, Australia. It was such an extreme reaction. Maybe he'll get over it, once he gets tired of all the snakes, and the sharks, and the spiders... ",greyclearsky

"[WP] There are 2 humans left on Earth: you, and a crush you once asked out who said ""I wouldn't date you if you were the last person on Earth""",sToTab,"We sat together on the old park bench, ironic how this symbol of our childhood was still some how a salvageable piece of furniture. The beacon of youth and my first realization that I had feelings for this girl. She didn't really like me or no my name, but I knew hers and it sent tingles throughout my body every time I thought of it. I thought back to that day when I was young and the words she said to me, ""I wouldn't date you if you were the last person on Earth,"" Now ten years have passed, the world is basically obliterated, I am now twenty-two. 

I got up from the bench, looked at her, and said 

""Well, isn't this ironic huh?"" 

She looked at me in a way I've never seen before. She was almost astonished by looking at the young boy she once rejected blossomed into the man before her, well young man, I'm not like thirty-five, that's a man, but anyways. I could tell she was attracted to me, so then I saw my opportunity. I sat back down and got real close to her. I put my arm around her and I said

""So, would you still not date me?""

Not a word left her mouth she just looked at me. I took her hand and squeezed it and said, 

""Hey it's totally okay the past is in the past. Now are you gonna talk? I mean it's gonna be really boring if I have nothing but one fourth of a picnic table to talk to.""

She smiled, good I was getting somewhere, I asked my question again. This time she finally gained the courage to say, 

""Well, I realize how stupid I was, and how mean that must've been, but wow you've really turned into quite the man you know it?"" I smiled, and then I asked another question, that only seemed right to me.

""So, with that being said I've got one more question.....You wanna start to repopulate the Earth?"" her eyes widened. I gave her one of those sexy forward slash flirtatious winks, only I probably looked like a pirate trying not to lose his eyeball. ""I mean, what else are we gonna do for fun?"" She was still in awe, but I waited, I mean I didn't really have any other options. Then after a millennia of waiting she finally managed to give a head nod. ""So uh, is that a yes?""

She finally managed to squeak out, 

""Yes..yes I would."" I was wondering why it took her so long so I asked,

""Hey, why'd it take you so long to answer?"" she looked at me and replied

""Well it's almost like the universe intended this to happen,"" I just looked at her confused. 

""What?""

""Well you know, like you're like crazy hot and stuff now,"" I'll be honest with you guys I was probably like a 5 on a scale of one to ten, but whatever.

""Oh well thank you, you're definitely not bad yourself."" She enjoyed that compliment very much so, and then she paused a little more. She then summoned the courage to lean in for a kiss. It was at this point I saw how things were going to go, success! 

Then I raised my hand and I put it on her face and said, ""Listen here freak!"" then I paused hoping a case of deja-vu would hit her. ""I wouldn't date you if you were the last person on Earth!"" I then got up, looked down at here and sprinted away. I didn't know where I was going nor did I really care, I had gotten my revenge. Besides did you really think two humans could repopulate a home of 7 billion people? No way man! There's like inbreeding and shit it wouldn't work after awhile. I mean sure her and I could do it but what about our kids who do they have yanno? Oh well, I'm gonna like go and see how close I can get to the Seattle Space Needle before I die. I mean, I live in Minnesota so it'll be interesting...650 feet off the ground..

""As ready as I'll ever be."" I said nervously, trembling slightly at the touch from the man who tormented my dreams for the past ten years. 
""You don't have to be nervous. I'm not going to hurt you."" 
""I know..."" His warm breath danced across my jaw, his lips trailed sweet kisses along my chin. 
""Relax, Emily..."" His deep, musical voice weaved a spell through my achy muscles, persuading my whole body to let go of any concern, and allow the inevitable to happen as smoothly and gracefully as possible. 
""Wait... Wait, wait, wait."" I pulled away and wrapped my arms around myself. ""I know we need to do this, and we will, I promise. I won't destroy the fate of the human race all because I'm a pathetic loser, but... I need to say something.""

""This is so juvenile,"" I added. ""I just want you to know that I've acknowledged how juvenile this is."" 
""I'm sure it's not if it's bothering you this much."" He chuckled. It wasn't mean, he wasn't laughing at me, I was simply amusing him. And that was okay. His smile made it easier to continue. 
""Okay; so... When I was in the sixth grade, and you were in the eighth, I told you that I liked you because I thought you liked me too. But you didn't..."" My eyes found his and watched the memory return to him as his face sobered. ""You laughed at me. Your friends were there, and they laughed at me too. It was... humiliating. I wanted to die..."" 
""Christ..."" He whispered and put a hand over his eyes.
""And I'm not holding onto it or anything, I swear! I know it looks like that, but that's not what I'm doing. I just... I want to make sure you don't still feel that way. Because I can't be humiliated again. I mean... you literally said that you wouldn't date me if I were the last girl on Earth... Ironic now."" I shrugged. 
""Emily,"" The hand dropped from his face and he took a step towards me. His hand cupped my jaw as he looked into my eyes. ""I was a stupid kid. A stupid, STUPID kid. Of course I don't think that way now. You're beautiful. Every man in that lab has been green with jealousy since I was chosen to stay with you.""

""Yes.""
""That's not a pity compliment?""

A tall blonde woman stood over me, ""Get up, everyone is staring"" she whispered as she reached out her hand to help me get back up on my feet. After getting up again the party resumed and chit-chat once again filled up the room, the blonde woman kept dragging me with her *who is she and where the hell is she taking me?*, I should've asked her then, but I feared that I might reveal too much about the Italian government, or was it the Welsh? 

We wandered through crowded halls and rooms, none of the guests seemed interested in whatever we were doing, all the men wore suits, and the women wore fancy red or white dresses, after what seemed to have been an eternity of rooms, we finally reached the balcony. 
- Well? What did you find out Wright? she exclaimed with great stress.
- About what? I'm sorry but I don't really remember too much after falling down those stairs. 
- We don't have much time Wright, you're a special agent for Wales, you were supposed to find out about what Mr. Giunta is planning to do with Prompets!
She kept on talking but honestly I couldn't hear any of it, I looked out over the great garden, it was beautiful, a tennis court on the east wing, *maybe I'll have my own tennis court one day*. 
""Now go in there and find out where they are holding him"" she kissed me on the cheek and went back inside, time for me to find out where they are holding Prompets then I guess. 

Back inside I wandered about, there's at least a thousand people here, how am I to find one guy. A waiter walked by with his plate full of Moët, I took to and grabbed him by the neck and whispered softly but very convincingly ""Tell him we need to talk"", there was a brief silence, we looked each other in the eyes for a long time *damn it, it didn't work* I thought, but a few seconds after staring me dead in the eye, he exclaimed ""sissignore"" and rushed off. I needed to find out what side I was on, I do remember growing up in Wales, and the Italians did kidnap someone, but something was off. 

I looked at the time, it was 23:39 and these people we're dancing and chatting like the party had just begun, maybe I was just getting old, I looked around in envy at all the young people who seemed to be having the time of their life when I felt a hand on my shoulder, I turned around, it was Antonio!
He will see you now Mr. Wright, come with me. 
We walked out of the mansion and across the yard, you could see the small house a bit further forward, it was just me and Antonio. ""I know we haven't talked in a while Wright, I am sorry but after you moved to the Wales, my father he just, o vaffanculo he told me you're a traitor of the lands"", he seemed full of regret, I patted him on the back and told him that it wasn't his fault, and that everything was going to be all right. He opened the door for me, ""I cannot go further"", so I entered, all alone.

""Come in, come in signor Wright, did you bring it?"" he was a very old man, he seemed to weigh more in skeleton than in flesh, I didn't know what he wanted me to bring but out of reflex I knew that I had something in my pocket, and I took it out. It was a note, It read ""Il mio nome è Prompets, fedeli a Italia, i draghi sono traditori"" it was my handwriting but I couldn't recall writing it, there was more on the piece of paper but Giunta snatched it from my hands before I could read the rest. He then grabbed my hand and let out a relieving ""You have saved us all kid"". He picked up the phone and just as he was about to call, the door was torn down and police forces started raiding the cottage, ""DOWN, DOWN ON THE GROUND"", there she was again, the tall blonde woman, ""Uncuff him, Mr. Wright's with me"". 

After the turmoil had settled, I was sent back to Wales, I even received a medal, what confuses me the most though, was the words the secretary of state whispered to me during the ceremony, ""Galles sarà nostro, i draghi cadranno signor Prompets"".",Frankwhitey
[WP] You are in charge of naming new species of animals,sToTab,"There was no escaping the news. It was on every poster, every newspaper. The creature had to be caught at all costs, before all havoc broke loose.

It was very distressing, but there was  one thing nagging at me, a stupid mistake. I was part of the researchers who found, categorized, learned of these creatures. I had been given the oppurtunity to name one. Of course I had to have gone and been all ironic.

After all, this thing was a monstorous, panther looking creature. It was the size of an elephant, vicious and bulky. I couldn't resist.

I named it Bubbles.

At least my great grandchildren will get a kick out of it, I guess.

[WP] A cult tries to sacrifice you to whatever they worship. Their plan backfires somehow and you become the leader of the cult.,tlaz10,"""Um...you're kidding right?"" I question the shady, disheveled people muttering wordless incantations around me. ""I mean...that's a rock.""

""Be quiet sacrifice,"" one of them spits, pointing at the rock with fervor. it sits directly in the middle of a large, sinister picture of a rabbit painted in blood. ""That rock is our connection to our god. How dare you try and defile it with your tongue!""

""Hey, I'm not trying to put your group down,"" I say, shaking my head. ""But no matter how I look at it...it's just a rock.""

""Impudent!"" Another says, leaning over to smack me across the mouth. I feel a little light-headed as fresh blood flows freely form my pierced lip. A little uncalled for. But then again, so is kidnapping me and preparing to sacrifice me to their god. I tell you, groupies never give you common courtesy. A little decency goes a long way.

""Just watch. We'll show you,"" another says, his voice slowly starting to grow louder. The others follow suit as they raise themselves off the ground, spreading their arms wide to encapsulate the rock that sits regally in the middle of all of it. I mean, it really just sits there. But saying regally makes it a little less embarrassing for them.

Suddenly I start to feel the ground shake a little. For the first time since this started, I pause and really consider things. I'm sure of it. There is no doubt in my mind anymore. That cute girl at work definitely waved at me. What a wasted opportunity. I guess my friends are right when they say I'm oblivious. 'You wouldn't even notice if we tied you up and took you to our cult as a blood sacrifice'. Haha. They always had the best jokes.

**Crack!**

Like a lightning strike, something jagged strikes down from the sky and slams into the ground, creating a thick smoke cloud that wafts over everything. The impact causes the cultists, who had inched closer toward the rock, to be sent flying backward and slammed against the wall. They fall down, unconscious. ""WHO DARES TO SUMMON THE MIGHTY DARK RABBIT!"" I hear a voice roar next to me, causing me to wince a little.

""Hey keep it down mate,"" I say with a shake of my head. ""I only have one pair of ears, you know?""

I hear a soft chuckle emanate from inside the dust cloud. ""You must be the one who summoned me. Only a fearless warrior such as yourself could possibly dare to call me from the underworld."" The chuckle turns into loud laughter which reverberates around the dark cavern I'm sitting inside, tied up. Wait, is that John over there? Strange. ""You have interested me. Very well, I will amuse you. Tell me your wish- is that a rock?""

""Yeah,"" I say simply, finally watching the dust cloud dissipate. Standing in the middle of the cavern is a giant rabbit with fur of an enigmatic black. Its eyes are of a piercing blue that glow darkly, emanating a strange, abhorrent sensation. It looks down at the rock, something akin to disgust on its face. ""You summoned me with a fucking rock?!"" It looks up at me, its body shaking uncontrollably. ""A FUCKING ROCK?!?!?!""

""Well, to be fair I said the same thing,"" I say, shrugging my shoulders. ""I mean, I didn't even summon you. It's pretty sad actually. You answer the call of a rock? You mustn't be very powerful.""

""You-"" The rabbit cuts itself off, a conflict of emotions passing over it. ""A fucking rock,"" it mutters to itself. It suddenly looks up at me sharply. ""Aren't you scared of me?""

""Should I be?"" I ask calmly, wiggling around in my ropes. ""More importantly, how are you going recover from being summoned by a rock. I mean, if I were you, I'd want to just stop existing right about now. Like a rock? And not just a rock, but it's a pebble. it's a tiny, insignificant peb-""

""I GET THE FUCKING PICTURE!"" The rabbit cries, slamming its foot down. It shakes its head, its ears drooping down over its face. ""I'm going to be the laughing stock of the underworld. my mum is going to disown me."" Tears start streaming down its face as it rests on its haunches, loud crying filling the room.

""I guess evil bunnies have it tough too,"" I say. I slowly wriggle over to the rabbit and give it a few soft head bumps. ""Keep it together bud. We just gotta figure out a way to turn the tables. I mean, it's a rock now. But what could it be?"" I tell it, trying to comfort the rabbit at least a little. It's not the rabbits fault the cultists are incompetent. If you think about it, they didn't even sacrifice me. That's rather pathetic isn't it?

""You're right...you're right!"" The rabbit cries, suddenly jumping up. It looks down at me with a gleam in its eyes. ""It may be a pebble now, but I will turn it into a powerful magic item! And then I can tell everyone how I was summoned by it. Thank you, kind frail human. Though I think of your race as a sad, little speck in the face of the sheer size of the universe, I would consider you an exception.""

""Thanks!"" I say cheerfully. ""What're you going to turn it into?""

""That's the hard part,"" the rabbit says, frowning. ""Any ideas?"" it asks, furrowing its brow.

""Well, you don't really want to turn it into something that could actually be useful. I mean..."" I say, looking around at the cultists. ""Would you really want to give something useful to...*them*.""

""You speak words of wisdom my new friend,"" the rabbit says, nodding its head. ""It is true, I would not want them to wield an artifact of immense power. Though it would be fun to watch this world turn archaic, having them be the leaders of the new age...it would sicken me.""

""I agree,"" I say, nodding my head earnestly. ""they'd probably fail in a week anyway.""

""That is true...my friend, how about you? Do you desire strength?"" the rabbit questions.

""Nope,"" I say, shaking my head.

""Then what do you desire?"" the rabbit asks, looking at me curiously.

""Well..."" I start, frowning. What do I desire? Life is rather boring right now. I sort of just drift through it and see where it takes me. ""How about...fun?""

""A grand desire for a grand human,"" the rabbit says, letting out a chuckle. ""I can do anything. Tell me of the fun you might consider having, and you will lead these cultists into a new era. Think big.""

I look up at the sky, simple clarity entering me. Of course there is only one thing I could ever request. Nothing could ever come close. I turn to face the rabbit, assurety in my gaze.

[WP] A cult tries to sacrifice you to whatever they worship. Their plan backfires somehow and you become the leader of the cult.,tlaz10,"My blood was spilling out across and over the edges of the stone altar. My entrails hung from my body down onto the floor. The knife which was used to gut me was now being raised upwards as it was embedded into my heart.

And the statue of the enormous dragon head, carved into the cave which this cult was praying to was now moving, tearing rock down as more of its form was revealed, strong enough to crush the village I grew up in under my foot, its eyes looking directly into mine. 'My, aren't we in a pickle,' it said indignantly as it pulled my hollow corpse upwards using one of its talons. 'Need any assistance?'

I gasped for a moment as air finally began to pass through my windpipe. The dragon gave a curious raised eyebrow before pinching the ceremonial robes I was dressed in and removed the massive claw that was impaling me in the chest. 'What the fuck?!' I screamed in shock as my organs and blood pulled themselves back inside my body and it stitched itself back to normal.

'It's a true shame how crass the youths of the day are,' the dragon said in a disappointed tone, 'but I guess times change, though. I do have to apologize on behalf of my... ""Followers"". To be honest, I don't particularly care for them, or the sacrifices. But let's just say that... there's something different about you.'

'Can you put me down?' I asked the giant crimson-scaled beast.

'Sorry,' he said as he carefully lowered me to the ground. 'I guess introductions are in order. I am Bahamut, God and King of Dragons.'

'Alastair,' I stated. 'I'm just a farm worker.'

'And I take it you were snatched from the field by that *cult* that worships me,' Bahamut said, his voice rather indignant to the word.

'I think you'd already know that,' I said. 'They're doing it in your name.'

 'You see... I honestly have no idea what drove these humans are worshipping me,' he explained. 'Well, I know what they *want*, but I'd rather just sleep under this mountain without having to wash blood off myself using magic! It's rather sticky, thank you very much.'

'What *do* they want?' I asked him.

'Oh, just unlimited magical and physical power and dominance by being transformed into dragons,' Bahamut explained. 'Only I have the power to grant draconic power to... That gives me an idea.'

'What?' I asked as he looked down at me. Then I saw him giving me a mischievous smile. 'What the hell are you planning?'

'Child, you're dead and even ignoring said fact, a being at the very bottom of the rung of life,' he said to me. 'A rather obvious fact, but it also means you have nothing to lose.'

'Hold on!' I protested. 'What of my family? My parents and siblings!'

'Oh, simple,' Bahamut said as he rested his head on the ground, stretching his serpentine neck as far out as possible while being only a single meter from me. 'By turning you into a dragon, you can collect taxes on those you wish. Anyone want to stop you? Just crush them under your might! Your family would benefit from a few ""donations"", wouldn't they? All I ask is one simple favor... STOP THE BLOODY SACRIFICES! I *ended* the forest elves who disobeyed me!'

At that instance, the visage of Bahamut subsided back into the stone and the images of humans in cloaks filled the room. I was back in my corpse once more and now I was screaming in pain as it began to dissolve into blood.

'What is this?' the leader of the cult asked in confusion. 'Has our God finally graced us with a blessing? Everyone, bow down and speak the name of the mighty Baha-'

With a single hand, or rather a gigantic hand, I crushed the man who had murdered me as the blood congealed into a new form, becoming bones and muscular sinew as I stood, my scales shining even in the darkness formed as I flapped my leathery wings, a symbol of pride and power.

The cult grew silent, daring not to utter a sound, but my hearing had improved to the point I could hear their terrified hearts beating at a faster and faster pace. I could've just torched them all to death, to be honest... but I had my revenge on my murderer, so I charmed the torches back to life, allowing them to see my new form, the power I had, how absolutely *furious* I was!

And as I spoke, flames pouring out with each word, I made sure they were aware of that fury. 'A personal message from Bahamut, your supposed ""Patron"",' I spoke in a voice so powerful the stones around me vibrated with each syllable. 'No. More. Sacrifices, or instead of a gift, all you'll receive is being impaled from ass to mouth on his teeth for even longer than existence itself! And I'd personally recommend you listen... they're *very* sharp.'

They all stood silently around me, before bowing down to my confusion. 'He has spoken to Bahamut and received his blessing! Praise the Speaker!'

I stood in confusion... until I could hear Bahamut's chuckling before yawning. 'Finally, I'd be able to get some rest. Don't worry, boy - I'll deal with them once I've had a good sleep of... 10 years or so? For immortals such as us, that's a rather short time.'

'Son of a...' I muttered. 'If you truly wish to earn the respect of your god, go out and help those less fortunate than yourself, not soak his sleeping form in the blood of innocents! Now go forth, as I shall. I have a few... words to say to the king and lords regarding a tithe.'",res30stupid

Za’Xui was new to this whole shapeshifting thing, and hadn’t quite yet mastered the fine motor skills necessary to control the five so-called *‘finger’* appendages at the end of his fleshy, pale tentacles. This was the third glass he had smashed in an hour, and he feared his roommates might start to suspect something. Sweat beads formed on his forehead as Emily approached him, and he racked his cerebrum trying to conjure an explanation. Much to his relief, she passed him entirely, shaking the end of her limb at him as their paths crossed. He had studied this mannerism in his early years as a Sapientologist. It was one of good nature: a greeting. Crisis averted.
 
He watched on, intrigued, as Emily reached for the cupboard door. In all his eons of studying this fascinating creature, he never imagined himself integrating into their habitat and studying them in this way. Emily grabbed a glass cup, bared her two mouth-rows of enamel at him in what is known as the *‘smile’*, and threw it to the ground beneath her. Za’Xui couldn’t believe his luck. None of the books had mentioned this ritual, and yet, purely by accident, he had uncovered it. 

~

As her grip loosened on the drinking vessel, Glebu wondered if she had done the right thing. Perhaps, she thought, only one person in each human household is the cup-smasher. Perhaps there is a set order to the ceremony, one which she had broken. Had she done the wrong thing? Her thoughts were interrupted by the cracking of the cup on the hard tile floor. Was this why humans wore garments over their bodies – to protect themselves from rogue shards? 

From across the room she heard the repetitive clap of flesh on flesh. She recognised it instantly. On the sofa sat Bob, demonstrating the infamous *‘applause’*. To applaud, she recalled, was to produce a noise by way of hitting one’s hands against each other, in an effort to show approval of the actions of another. Thank Juvoxi – her risk had paid off. How she wished she could record this primal act, but being caught doing so might threaten her anonymity. Participating in the cup-dropping had been enough of a gamble. No – in future she would focus on blending in. Should she jeopardise this mission, she would be the laughing stock of the entire department.

~

Qaluxi’s palms stung as he carried out the clapping performance. Was he smacking them against each other too hard? Perhaps the humans’ hands were calloused from a lifetime of applauding, leaving them used to it. Or - was it possible that pain was the desired outcome? Were the humans willing to self-inflict pain in order to truly prove their admiration for another? It was commendable dedication. Moronic, certainly, but commendable.

He turned his attention to the talking box of electricity facing him. The small characters inside it interacted only with each other, not with he and his roommates. Was this a punishment? What had the tiny humans done? They didn’t look unhappy, but to be confined to such a small space was no way to be living. He didn’t want to break any etiquette the humans might have regarding the box in front of those he would be living with but, he made a mental note, he would attempt contact with the tiny humans when the others had proceeded to the house’s next level.

~

“Hello, roommates!” exclaimed Zabo as she entered her new home. 

“Hello Ashley!” resounded the chorus of human voices from the next room. She had previously left the residence in order to explore her surroundings but, unaware of how to signal to the vehicles on the roads that she wanted to reach the other side, had simply walked around the block a number of times before deciding it was a problem for another day. Nonetheless, she was excited to witness first-hand all of the typical human activities her new companions were getting up to.

Scanning the room, she first saw Bob, intently studying the people-box. Its hold over the human was staggering, inhibiting any social interaction between he and the others. Ashley and James stood tall as trees in the kitchen, both deep in thought as they studied the sea of broken glass beneath them. She administered the appropriate human wave with her right hand, said to be the dominant hand in the majority of the species, and was pleased to note that they responded in the same way. Zabo exited the area and proceeded upstairs to her resting quarters. She pulled out a small black book from her locked briefcase and eagerly noted her findings. If the rest of her trip continued in this way, she was sure to get an award upon return.

~

His tendrils pressed hard against his forehead, Dr Nbrenqu racked his brain for a solution. In what was possibly the biggest oversight in the history of the department, not one member of staff had thought to inform each of the mission’s participants that they would be sharing living quarters. He sat in the Observation Room, light years away from Planet XC-740, watching in awe as the oblivious buffoons interacted with each other. There was no way to contact the explorers until the mission was over, something he had requested so that they truly immersed themselves in the culture of the Homo sapiens. He sighed in exasperation.

You have successfully navigated the shifting sands with not a single man in your army of 40,000 succumbing to the unforgiving desert heat.  To the north, a stretch of cliffs and mounds stand poised against the desert wastes. This mirrors to the south, though the desert outflanks the cliffs toward the east.  And speaking of the east, you see what you have traveled for, sought to claim and conquer.  Your army awaits your command, King Joshua and your Holy Advisers, you may now plan your attack on the City of Jericho.

Joshua: I order the scouts to survey the area, and request the priests to bring forth the artifact.

DM: This will take some time, about an hour total, what will you do.

Joshua: I will declare to the army to make camp and prepare themselves, then I will pray to my God.

DM: Do you wish to declare your prayer?

Joshua: I'll forgo the +2 in favor of privacy.  I'd like this opportunity to swap spells while I commune.

DM: You're a Paladin, you don't really ""swap spells"".

Joshua: I'm Just letting you know I'm swapping Endure Elements for Bless, and Remove Curse for Dispel Magic.

DM: You succeeded against their bluff.

Scouts: Sir, they are heathens.  We could hear they're songs and they did not speak of our Lord.

Joshua:  This is promising news, Priests, what have you to say?

Priests:  In our prayers and divinations, we have foreseen the wall standing against all our mundane methods. Sapping, bashing, even climbing, to no avail.  We have sought other methods: conversion, intimidation, even ignoring them for the next; all have been seen to fail.  We are at a loss, our king.

DM: Haha, so? What will you do?

Joshua: Knowledge(Local) check, my skill is a 5 and I'm taking a 10; are the Jerichoans savages?

DM: They are not savages, they are like any other simple town, except for the massive wall.

Joshua: They may be heathens, but they are not impious nor savage.  They will not attack those that are unarmed or not attacking.  Priest, take a few of your men and some of the more observant scouts.  Walk along the wall and check it for magical energy.

Priests: How many times? Seven?

Joshua: That'll be fine.  High Priest, I'll need you to craft for me a ram's horn that can create sound capable of knocking over 100 men.

High Priest: That will take me some time.

Joshua: Can it be done within the week?

High Priest: With some help, yes.

Joshua: Take the other priests and get started, the sooner the better.

DM: Would you like to wait until everything is done?

Joshua: Yes, when the horn is ready, so will I be.

DM: Okay, (Rolling Dice behind the Screen)...wow, got super lucky on the random encounters.

Joshua: I am pretty lucky. Okay, so is the Horn ready?

DM: Yes, and the scouts and priests have been doing what you asked of them.

Joshua: What have the scouts seen and the priests detected?

DM: Both have noticed that the thickest parts of the wall are load bearing and heavily effected by magic, though the magic is most powerful on the southern bearing wall.

Joshua: Okay, I will join the Priests and Scouts on another round about the wall.  Is their any way we can sneak the artifact with us?

DM: Stealth is not a class skill for you and the think is the size of three people and glows.

Joshua: If only we were coming from the east. Okay, we won't hide it.  Have the army at the ready to charge.

DM: Their action is prepared, when will it trigger?

Joshua: When the walls fall.

DM: Okay, your prayer circle is along the target wall in the south. What will you do?

Joshua: I cast Dispel Magic.

DM: There is a caster level check involved to overcome their enchantment.  What did you roll?

Joshua: A 6, but I add a 4 to it.

DM: That's not enough to overcome.

Joshua: Will the priests assist me.

DM: They will try. Three succeed, putting you at a 16, which succeeds.

Joshua: Okay, they will blow their horns. And I will blow mine as we pass the next bearing wall. And then again until we get back to the south.

DM: Okay, so that'll be 6 uses of the Horn, they do....wow, 10d6 damage to each wall.

Joshua: Can I roll once and multiply by 6?

DM: Sure, I guess you can ""take a 10"" on damage rolls.

Joshua: Don't be snide because I got you on this one.

DM: What's the damage?

Joshua: Not great, 37 for each wall.

DM: Not enough to topple, but it's weakened.

Joshua: Okay, I'm going to channel the artifact into the horn for the final bearing wall.

DM: That'll maximize your damage rolls, dealing 60 damage to the wall.  It crumbles, sending the excess damage through the structure...the whole thing comes down.

Joshua: Is that a rout? Did I win?

DM: ...Yes.

Joshua: I give thanks to my God and use the town as a staging point for later.

DM: I didn't have anything planned after that...you won.  You receive 5000 experience points, not that it'll help you now.

Joshua: Really? That's the whole campaign? Jeez. Can we do WW2 next?

DM: Sure, who are you going to command this time?

Joshua: Let's see what happens when Spain joins the fray!",MacabreJudge
[WP] Never mess with a samurai and his drink.,Hitty40,"Three thugs burst into the ramen house laughing wildly and loudly.   
A samurai sat at the bar calmly slurping his noodles, a jar of sake was close at hand. One of the thugs slammed his fist on the bar so forcefully it knocked the samurai's sake over, and demands a round of drinks for his friends. The thug glances over to the bottle, picks it up and laughs ""My apologies, friend, I forget my strength at times.""

The samurai gives a slight nod and responds ""I would be grateful if you were more careful in the future."" and reached to take the bottle from the thug. The thug looks the samurai in the eye and drinks from the bottle. The thugs friends chuckled. The samurai clenches his hand into a fist and said ""I wanted to eat and drink and peace. I know who you are, Oni of the Wind, and I intended to leave you in peace. And now you leave me no choice...""

""Haha! You understand who I am then? Then you know that it would be best if you-"" Oni gurgled and blood spurted from his mouth. One of the samurai's chopsticks were protruding from the Oni's throat. Within seconds Oni fell backwards and landed with a thud.    
The thugs stared in stunned silence. The one on the right shook his head and charged the samurai in a rage, throwing a fist. A hot burning pain erupted in the thug's fist. The thug looked at his hand and saw that the second chopstick was sticking out between his knuckles. The chopstick was in so deep that the thug couldn't move his wrist. The samurai then grabbed the thug's hand and pulled it back, snapping the chopstick inside, then kicked him in the chest.    
The samurai, stood from his seat, turned to the final thug and drew his blade, the thug promptly scrambled away from the ramen house as quickly as his legs would carry him. With a huff the samurai sheathed his sword, and sat back down. He looked at the owner ""May I bother you for another bottle of sake, and a spare set of chopsticks so I may finished these delicious noodles?"" ",Maximus_Stache
[WP] Never mess with a samurai and his drink.,Hitty40,"It was a dark and rainy night at the local bar, loud shouts and laughs filled the small building. The current group of costumers, Bounty Hunters of the highest caliber around, prepared for they're next hunt. Posters of various wanted men and women filled the table, each having a delicious price.

As the group argued for the best pick, the sudden opening of the doors did not go unnoticed.

A man of Large height and size entered the small bar, wearing armor of Iron and Leather, a straw hat covering his face, and a spear and cannon on his back, and a sword on his hip. The only part his armor and hat didn't cover was the wild raven hair that flowed from the back of his head.

The group of hunters where silent, watching the samurai as he walked to the owner of the small bar, taking a seat on a stool and placing his order.

A certain poster caught one of the hunter's eye, while not showing a face, it showed a familiar hat, armor, and hair, while offering a juicy price at the bottom.

With a look of greed in they're eyes, they all silently came to the conclusion of tonight's target.

Slowly, and casually, they surrounded the Samurai, each hunter getting a little bit closer than the last.

Just as the last of them took they're position, the Samurai's order came. A small cup of white liquid, It was comically small compared to the man but the Samurai paid for it all the same.

Just as he was about to but the cup to his lips, a hand grasps his drink away from him. The owner of said hand was from the most foolhardy of the group, looking smug and taunting as he drank the whole thing in one gulp. The man slammed it in front of the Samurai, looking straight at him, daring for him to try anything.

As the scene went on, the other hunters waited for the Samurai to make a move, for as soon as he faced they're foolhardy member, they would strike without any chance of recovery.

The Owner watched all of this, frightened and unprepared for the conflict that was about to unfold in his little bar.

The storm outside roared with thunder, and lightning filled the skies.

The Samurai smiled to himself, amused and fully aware of these hunter's plan, and while they may surround him, outgun him, and outnumber him, they all made the one mistake.

[WP] Never mess with a samurai and his drink.,Hitty40,"Masazuku Hoshi sat with his drink. He had had a long day and was getting busy getting very drunk. He took another swig from his cup, emptying it. He set it down and the bartender instantly refilled it. The samurai added a coin to the massive pile growing beside him. The bartender took a handful of the coins, went to serve a customer, and returned to continue collecting the coins.

The door flew open and in barged several men. Several well known men. Several well known and deadly men. They laughed loudly, drawing many glances that quickly turned back to their business. No one wanted to grab their attention.

As they walked by tables, the men grabbed food and drinks. They marched up to the counter and sat down. 

One of the largest sat next to Masazuku, grabbing his drink. He downed it in a single gulp.

“Watashi wa sore o nonde ita,” Masazuku growled. The other man laughed.

“I don't speak your silly language,” the man chuckled, his face suddenly turning serious, “but that sounded threatening.” 

Masazuku looked at the bartender, tossed a few larger coins down and donned his helmet. He stood up and turned to the other man. He bowed deeply.



“Goodnight, yūjin,” the bartender said. 

“Goodnight,” replied Masazuku said, tossing a few more coins on the counter. “Sorry about that. They bled a lot more than I expected.”",Braz-dur
[WP] Never mess with a samurai and his drink.,Hitty40,"""It's been seven months since I've been to a real bar,"" a swordsman yelled as he entered the bar.  ""I've been waiting to get my hands on some alcohol.""  Sitting down at the table, he placed his sword and scabbard on the table.  It was cracked an worn, as if it had survived a journey to the spirit world and back.  

""Woman, get me the strongest sake you have.""  The swordsman laughed.  ""I'm going to celebrate!""

The bartender handed him the house sake, which he presumed to drink straight from the bottle.  

""Excuse me sir, but you can't go drinking all of that.""  The old bartender said feebly.  

""Shut up, I can pay you later.""  The samurai continued to drink.  ""Besides, I'll just ask the daimyo to compensate your bar.  Easy.""

""Do you know where you are, Kazuki?""  Another swordsman knocked the sake bottle out of his hands, and it crashed onto the floor.  Kazuki sat in silence.  

""How do you know my name?""  He looked up at the other swordsman, who wore full battle armor.  ""I've been gone for seven months.""

""You've got a bounty on your head, dumbass.""  The swordsman was joined by two others.  ""You are wanted for crimes against Daimyo Yoshida and his subjects.""  The swordsman turned towards the crowd.  ""If any of you assist in Kazuki's capture, you will be rewarded with five bags of rice!""

Kazuki grabbed his sword and stood up.  ""I was going to walk out, but you interrupted my drinking.""  He stared at the armored samurai.  ""What's your name.""  

""I am the most legendary-,"" The armored samurai never finished his sentence; he collapsed on the floor with a large gash on his chest, dead.  Kazuki had drawn his sword, which glimmered when the sunlight pierced the roof.

""I could care less who you are.""  Kazuki glared at the armored samurai's two companions.  ""Who's next?""  

Both companions ran towards the door, but only one made it outside.  The first one to die was cut down from behind, not even drawing his weapon.  The second companion made it outside and drew his sword, but was quickly cut down by a mirad of Kazuki's slashes.  

""Pussies,"" Kazuki muttered.  Walking back inside, he pulled out a coin purse and placed it on the bar.  

""Sir, the drink was only worth half as much.""  The old man exclaimed.  

""There should be enough to buy another one, and fix up the bar a little.""  Kazuki said as he walked down the forest path.  

When anyone messed with his drink, Kazuki showed them no mercy.  His bounty would definitely increase, but it wasn't important right now.  He stumbled towards the next city, hoping they would have decent alcohol.",kuma429

[WP] A character with realistically portrayed social anxiety gets his happy ending,L_James,"I want friends but I don't have any. When people try to be my friend, I don't want them to keep trying.

When I'm alone, I feel lonely. When I'm with crowds of people I want to be alone. The other day I was at the mall and there were so many people and not a single square inch where I could just stand and take a deep breath. I stood over the glass railing and just looked at the swarms of ant-people going every which way, swerving only to bump into another ant-person, and I almost screamed because I didn't know what else to do.

It isn't that I don't like when people try to pay attention to me. I like the idea of it. I just don't like it when they try to hold eye contact because it makes me feel like they're seeing too much. Or they're seeing something about me that I don't even know myself. Or they're trying to make themselves feel good by acting like they're paying attention to me. And that just makes me feel pathetic.

I'm not a freak. Nothing against freaks, I'm just not one. Since when did not liking thousands of people squished in a too-small box make you a freak? Maybe they're the freaks and I'm the normal one. I don't know.

There's a girl in my class. Her name is Katherine. She might prefer Katie or Kat but that's not something I would know because I don't pay attention to things like that. I guess you could say she's cute, but I don't have a crush on her. It isn't like that. I just think she's nice, that's all.

Sometimes we sit together during silent reading period. We don't talk, but that's okay. It's supposed to be silent. I know she thinks I'm okay, too. Sometimes she asks me what book I'm reading and I'll tell her. Then, sometimes, if I feel like it, I'll ask her what she's reading and she'll tell me. Sometimes she'll tell me what it's about if I haven't read it yet. I've added a few books to my reading list because of Katherine.

Today Katherine is sitting next to me. She says hi and smiles but doesn't look at me for too long, which I like. She gets straight to business. Today I tell her I'm reading a book about a man and a dog and a murder. It sounds silly but Katherine says she's read it and she knows it's not silly. Actually, she says, it's probably one of the best books she's ever read and she means it. That makes me happy.

She smiles at me again and then goes back to reading. I do too but I don't feel alone.

[WP] A character with realistically portrayed social anxiety gets his happy ending,L_James,"*It's okay. No one is looking at you. You’re just another person walking down the street.* My heart was pounding as I walked through the crowd of students on the university sidewalk. Of course I knew no one was watching me or waiting for me to do something stupid, but it always felt like someone was. My breathing was just a bit too hard for the light effort I was putting in walking. *People are probably thinking what a fat ass I am, getting out of breath just walking.* 

I was between classes for a couple of hours, so I decided to go sit on a bench in one of the campus parks and collect my thoughts for a few minutes. The warm breeze had just a hint of summer and a faint scent of fresh grass clippings and fertilizer hung over the park. I started down the brick walkway of the park, then stopped.

*Shit.* All the benches had at least one person sitting there. My mouth felt suddenly dry. *Okay. That book I’ve been reading said to step out of my comfort zone. I can do this. Or…I can just go sit under a tree. The grass looks pretty comfy and I probably won’t get too dirty…*

I shook my head. I glanced around the park benches. The girl sitting on the far right was so engrossed in her book she probably wouldn’t notice me anyway. I headed for the bench. *Don’t trip over your own feet walking there. If anyone can fuck up walking over park grass you know it’s you.* I dropped my backpack by the park bench and cleared my throat, trying to sound nonchalant. “Hey, uh, is it cool if I sit here?” 

The girl looked up and brushed a strand of hair away from her eyes. “Hm? Oh sure.” She scooched over a little and I gingerly sat down, trying not to touch or disturb her. I pulled out my own book and tried to focus. A couple of minutes later, I heard “Oh hey, I love that author. I’ve never read that one before though.” 

The girl was looking at me, her hazel eyes crinkled against a beam of sunlight. I waggled the book a little. “Um…yeah. It’s a good book,” I replied. *Wow that was boring, say something else.* “It’s cool that you read.” An odd expression flickered over her face, like she wasn’t sure if that was a compliment or insult. *Oh crap, fix it..* “Sci-fi, I mean. It’s cool that you read sci-fi. Lots of people don’t like it. “ I cleared my throat and looked down so she wouldn't see how flushed my cheeks were.

“Oh yeah I love it! Been reading it since I was a little kid and my dad introduced me to Star Trek” She sounded happy and not pissed off. I glanced up and she was smiling a little. I smiled back (but made sure not to show any teeth because of that one weird tooth in the back).

The bell tower on campus tolled the time. 1 p.m. I glanced down at my book. *Deep breath. Step out of your comfort zone.* “Hey, I’m pretty hungry. You want to maybe get some food and talk about books over lunch?” I asked. 

My heart pounded in the pause that followed. *Why the fuck did you ruin a perfectly nice interaction by asking that?* I heard a rustling sound next to me. The girl was putting her book away and packing her things. She smiled at me. “Sure. I'm Laura by the way. Where do you want to go?”

Oh, I'm next in line. ""I-I'll have 20!"" I screamed. WHY DID I DO THAT!?! Kill me now, I might as well just walk out. Everybody was watching me. It was a horrible idea. Why did I even step out of bed today? ""s-Sorry,"" I said ""I'll have a Venti Matcha Green."" The barista was nervous. She was shaking as much as I was. I did this, I have to own up to it. ""Sorry for shouting. I was thinking of something else."" ""It's fine,"" she said ""Its my first day ever working."" 

""Oh,"" I muttered. I tried not to keep eye contact. My heart was racing. She has such a cute voice. I gave her my money and walked out. I sat on the curb. What a relief.

""That's pretty funny,"" I grabbed the tea ""It's all good."" I sipped, it was shit. ""Hey, you wanna come over?!"" she asked. It was weird, super abrupt at that, and it made me nervous. But she was visibly nervous too, she was shaking. I said sure, when we walked there. She didn't live too far. Soon, I had been coming over constantly. She made my day, everyday.

I'm running when there's no reason to. I reach for my keys and I burst into my house with a loud crash of the door hitting the adjacent wall, leaving an even bigger hole where the wall meets the doorknob.

There's a moment of silence as the pressure builds up in my lungs. I throw down my bag and pull at my hair, ""I JUST WANT FRIENDS!!!""

My knees hit hardwood. ""I want friends, but I don't want friends..."" I whimper with watery eyes. My body finally crumples fully onto the floor, and my head turns to see the afternoon sunlight peeking in, mocking me.

I hear shoes on pavement, and I whirl up like never before.

*Absolutely nothing is.*
""Yep, nothing's wrong,"" I reply sitting on my couch with a cup of tea in hand.

""Yes it does!"" He insisted.

""Yeah, because he's a super powerful sith pawn.  He has extra powers."" He said, scooting his pawn across the square.  ""Pshk! Pshk! Kaboo!""  My white pawn toppled over to make way for his black pawn.

""Well what about my pawn?  He's probably a very accomplished Jedi knight."" I reasoned.

""Yeah, but he's not as good as mine."" He said.

""I see.  I guess I'll just have to bring in a Jedi master then."" I said, sweeping my bishop across the board to vanquish his pawn.  I couldn't let the sith run amok, after all.

""You've fallen into my trap, Obi Wan!"" He said, bringing his queen from her starting position.  She passed over the pawn in front of her, rose into the air, then crashed into the board, knocking several pieces over.  He scooped up all of the fallen, and removed them from the board.

[WP] A demon is trying to kill you and your guardian angel is barely keeping it together.,Pash17V,"His hoof-prints left smouldering imprints on my vinyl floor and I felt regret, because the floor was new and had cost me most of my savings (not including the 10 thousand pounds in my ISA, which of course I would never touch for fear of losing tax benefits). In the final moments before my presumed death, as I cowered in the corner of my new refurbished kitchen, drenched in sweat and blood and urine, facing a supernatural terror, my panic-stricken brain spat out repair estimates and reconfigured my monthly spending budget to account for demonic destruction. God, what a fiscal nightmare. 

Typically, it was that last blasphemous thought rather than the threat of infernal incineration that triggered Kathy’s materialisation. She appeared with her back to the beast, wearing Gucci embroidered denim pants, leather pumps and a marmot shoulder bag (also by Gucci). Her modesty was protected only by a checked denim blazer of unknown origin. She smelled of expensive cologne and Cuban cigars, and she had the expression of a valley girl whose best friend just sent a winky face emoji to her boyfriend and like oh my god, everyone knows Samantha has always had a thing for Brad but he totally isn’t interested so she should just stop acting like such a desperate whore.

‘For the love of Christ, Dick, we’ve talked about this! Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, asshole.’ She slurs her words as trots unsteadily towards me in her 4 inch heels. I am genuinely torn between pointing out the metaphorical elephant and literal demon in the room, or mocking the irony of her statement. I choose the former but it was a close call. Maybe I am an asshole.

‘Look behind you.’ She turns and from behind I admire the fit of her jeans. I wonder what kind of workout regimen they have in Heaven. Although I guess angels don’t need to work out? Central London is expensive and my gym costs me £250 a month; I’ve just started to see results but I glumly realise that a moderately attractive physical form is a luxury I can no longer afford in this grim, post-vinyl-floor-damaged-by-infernal-hoof-prints world I find myself in.

‘STAND ASIDE KATHRIAL. THE MORTAL IS MINE.’ His voice is bouquet of torment, death and misery. 

‘Fucking hell Asmodeus I literally cannot deal with you right now.’ Her voice is an advert for sobriety and finishing schools. ‘How many times do I have to tell you - I’m his GUARDIAN ANGEL not his girlfriend… Oh my god why am I even, it’s not your fucking business Asmodeus! We broke up decades ago, you’ve like GOT to move on.’

A red tint tinges Asmodeus’ horns. I hope that’s a sign for embarrassment and not murderous rage, but who really knows with demons. I could maintain my gym membership if I tap into my ISA to fund the floor repairs but it’s almost the end of the tax year and it seems a huge shame to write off almost a full year of tax savings. 

‘KATHRIAL PLEASE… THIS ISN’T ABOUT US. MY LORD LUC-‘

‘Lucifer can suck my lady balls Asmodeus, the mortal is off-limits! Mother of Christ can I not get ONE fucking night off, is that too much to ask? Sheik Ahmed Al Rahaz literally just got me into Tramp and I’m pretty sure Beyonce and Jay-z were supposed to be arriving any time now, and now my clothes smell of smoke and brimstone… literally if I have to queue again and watch Alexa Chung walk straight in with her fucking skinny jeans and perfect mixed race complexion I will LOSE MY SHIT.’ I’m pretty sure she’s crying at this point. She’s definitely shaking, rummaging around inside her bag with quivering hand. I hope she’s looking for her compact celestial blade, but I rather suspect her perfectly manicured hands will ultimately emerge with a small canister of cocaine.

Asmodeus stands before her looking slightly dumbstruck. It occurs to me that him being stationary is arguably worse for my vinyl floor - sure, it means fewer footprints to deal with but I fear his hooves are slowly burning through the floor into the hardwood below. He reaches a tentative claw towards Kathy, dipping his horns with concern.

‘Don’t you FUCKING TOUCH ME,’ she shrieks. She’s definitely coming down from something but, to my relief, she’s drawn her celestial blade. It’s half a foot long and made of coagulated sun-light or something. Her tears have created dark streaks of makeup on her face; she’s hyperventilating whilst she swings her blade at the air in front of her; her footing slips and she staggers backwards. I catch her and lower to the ground; her lips are inches from my nose and whilst they’re perfectly plump and infinitely kissable, her mouth smells of absinthe and vomit and so my usual feelings of tentative attraction are replaced with mild disgust, tinged with reluctant gratitude. 

‘Look, mate,’ I offer conversationally to Asmodeus. Mate is a term that people in England use when they don’t know someone’s name but are compelled by social norms to construct an air of friendliness. ’Mate… I don’t know what this is about but I swear to God, I’m not with her. I’m on witness protection and she’s my designated heavenly guardian. I don’t even think she’s fit.’ Fit is slag for physically attractive. I’m lying; she’s definitely fit in an angel-wears-prada, high-maintenance kind of way.

‘YOUR WORDS MEAN NOTHING TO ME MORTAL. IF YOUR KIND WERE PREDISPOSED TOWARDS HONESTY, MY KIND WOULD HAVE AN IDLE LIFE INDEED.’

‘I’m telling the truth. Kathy wouldn’t be interested in me anyway. She’s gunning for Jay-z; ever since Lemonade came out she’s convinced she can be Becky with the good hair.’ Sorry Hova. You got 99 problems and an arch-demonl from the inner sanctum of Hell is about to be one. 

‘JAY-Z…’ Demons have an internal database of all mortals ever to have existed hard-wired into their minds. Asmodeus seems to be sifting through the data because his eyes have narrowed and his horns have turned blue. ‘BROOKLYN…. ROC-NATION… BIG PIMPIN’…’.

‘Yeah that’s right, he’s from Brooklyn, USA, but I think he’s staying in Knightsbridge at the moment. He’s a rapper. Calls himself “Hova” which is pretty blasphemous right?’ I add hopefully. I’m not sure what demons think of hip-hop. Hopefully they hate it. They probably approve of blasphemy though, probably should have reigned myself in a bit. Kathy has staggered to her feet at this point; either she’s playing her part perfectly, or she really does think she has a shot with Jigga.

‘Stay the FUCK away from him Asmodeus - I’m not fucking around.’ It’s all the confirmation the demon needs as he dematerialises in search of the Shawn Carter. 

As I suspected, Asmodeus’ hooves burned through to the hard-wood. This is why I can’t have nice things.

She yawned loudly and stretched her arm towards the light switch, hitting it lazily as she made her way from the steps into the hall that led to her living room. The lazy shuffling of her feet was silenced as she slowly took in the ruined battleground that was at one point her living room. She quickly took in the scene before her. The front door sliced clean in half, her television shattered on the wall, still spitting out sparks onto the tiled floor. Her couch was little more than a pile of stuffing and splinters. The only thing that remained intact was the rocking chair that had once belonged to her grandmother. Sitting in the rocking chair was a young man, or possibly a woman, wearing a denim jacket and black shirt. Torn jeans ended in combat boot covered feet. The being in the chair completed it's look with an almost empty bottle of bourbon cradled in the crook of it's arm like a parent would hold a child.

Essentially imagine a drunk passed out rock star with fair features and low-cut shaggy blonde hair. It wasn't until her eyes panned slightly to the left of the chair and saw the large sword propped up against it that Cassie found her voice.

That voice was a scream.

The person in the chair jumped up frantically, reaching for the sword and sending the bottle of bourbon flying onto the tile to shatter. Slowly taking in the scene with wide blue eyes, they dashed over to Cassie and clamped a hand over her mouth with one hand, the sword in the other. Cassie's eyes went wide.

""Cassie please, I need you to calm down. I'm Alex, please be calm."" He pleaded with her.

Cassie looked at the sword and her body went limp. The last thing she was was a blur of white feathers rush by as she fell past Alex towards the floor.

_____

Cassie woke up with a start, sitting up quickly and looking around. She was on her couch.

Her still intact couch.

She looked at the television and front door, all perfectly fine. ""I must be losing my mind,"" she laughed to herself as she swung her feet around to the front of the couch, resting her elbows on her knees and holding her head in her hands, rubbing her temples slowly.

""No, you're sane. I've about lost mine though.""

Cassie whipped around so fast her braid swung around and smacked her in the side of her face. There was Alex, casually leaning on her counter with an open bottle of bourbon in his hand and a large shining sword resting casually in front of him. He put up a finger as he look a long drink, gritting his teeth and squinting after he'd finished.

""Don't scream again, please, you would not believe my headache."" Cassie could only stare at him with her jaw on the floor. Alex looked at her for a moment before he went on. ""I'm your guardian angel. I'm also drunk. Hi Cassie."" He wiggled his fingers lazily with a lopsided smile. Her mouth moved up and down several times but no sound came out. ""I'm going to need you to speak up. Or at the very least make some noise at all if you're going to speak,"" Alex said as he yet again raised the bottle to his lips.

""M...My what?"" Alex responded with a slow twirl, showing off his impressive white wings and gulping generous mouthfuls of 80 proof as we went. No matter how much he drank the bottle never seemed to get any lower.

""Yeah, angel. We're not actually supposed to enter the human plane of existence, but i'm about done, Cassie. I'm sorry. I've never wanted to quit before in over fifteen-hundred hears of being a guard, but fuck if this isn't a tough one."" Cassie gaped at him.

""Are angels allowed to curse? Shouldn't you, I don't know, be polite or something?"" She tried to stand but her legs seemed unable to work despite what she told them to do.

""I dunno,"" Alex shrugged, ""i'm also drinking your bourbon and making myself visible to you. Whats a little 'fuck' here and there going to do at this point?"" he raised the bottle again.

Cassie found the use of her legs and sprang into an unsteady standing position. She shakily walked towards Alex and placed her hands on the counter across from him. She looked at him for a moment before she reached out and snatched the bottle from his hands. Unlike Alex, her gulps actually affected the amount in the bottle and within a few short seconds the bottle was empty. Breathing heavily and now entirely awake, Cassie slammed the bottle down on the counter.

""Well,"" Alex sighed, ""I guess i'm done with that.""

He gently lifted the sword from in front of them and returned it to the scabbard at his hip. Keeping one hand on the hilt of the blade, standing still and letting Cassie's eyes study him.

""Why are you letting me see you?""

Alex stared silently for a long while before he answered. 

""You're being targeted by a demon. As your guardian angel, I protect you from extreme threats like this. Generally we stay out of little things like bar fights or car accidents, things that the human could have avoided if they were careful. This though,"" Alex shook his head, ""you can't really do anything against a demon yourself. So I can't very well leave you do die to some cosmic entity that's not something you should ever have encountered. So I get to fight her. Yay me."" Alex walked away from the counter and began rummaging through cabinets.

""That doesn't tell me why you're visible though. I believe in God, I believe in angels, why haven't I ever seen you before?""

""Well...imagine it's like this,"" Alex popped his head out of the cabinet to look at Cassie, ""your world is separated from ours by a mirror. You look in it and see your reflection, but we look in it and it's more like a window, we can see the other side, and your reflection is on this side with us. We can influence the reflection, or we can go through to deal with the source material. To get through we just have to break the mirror.""

""So, a one way mirror then?"" Alex stared at her unblinking for a moment before he shrugged and went back to the cabinets.

""So you and this demon-""

""Pandora, her name is Pandora.""

""Like the box?"" There was a clink of glass as Alex came out of the cabinet with another bottle of alcohol he found buried behind boxes of cereal.

""I guess,"" he shrugged, ""all myths are connected and have some truth."" He screwed the top off the bottle, this one a dark rum, and took a long drink, smiling approvingly as he brought it down from his lips.

""So you and Pandora fight?""

""Yep.""

""And she wants me dead?""

""Apparently.""

Cassie stood up and began pacing. ""Well, why! What did I do."" Alex shrugged.

""Far as I can tell she is pretty touchy about hope, and you're a stupidly optimistic person.""

Cassie paused to stare at Alex incredulously as he casually hopped up to sit on the counter with a slight flutter of his wings and drink his endless rum.

""She wants to kill me because I have *hope*?"" Alex shrugged again so Cassie went on. ""Well, you've been fighting for fifteen hundred years, why don't you just kill her?""

Alex spit out his drink across the counter, gasping.

""Are you insane? Kill her? God no that's why I came here so you can see me. I needed to talk to you.""

""About what?""

""Well, you're a hopeful person."" Alex nervously rubbed the back of his neck. ""I am...in love with her. Completely head over heels for Pandora. We've been fighting over you for almost twenty years now and she's...she's amazing, Beautiful, and the way she uses a sword, God...well you saw the door before I fixed everything, that was her.""

""You're here...you crossed another plane of existence...because you wanted dating advice?""

Alex maintained eye contact as he took a long drink of the rum. Finally he lowered the bottle and lowered his head, staring instead at the floor.

""I just...what if she doesn't feel the same? I don't know what to do anymore. I can't kill her, I won't, but I won't let her kill you either. I just want her to be happy, and I want to be the one to make her happy, but the only thing she seems to want is you dead and I..."" Alex looked up to notice Cassie's pale face, ""Um...are you okay Cass?""

Cassie snatched the drink from his hand and began drinking herself.

[WP] A demon is trying to kill you and your guardian angel is barely keeping it together.,Pash17V,"Nicholas sobbed relentlessly. Crystal-clear tears rolled down his cheeks, and what wasn’t absorbed by his feathery wings splashed onto the cloud beneath him.

I felt bad for the guy—really, I did—but we were kind of pressed for time, here. Pacing back and forth in the air, I finally exclaimed, “Nick! Please! Can you get it together?”

“I’m so sorry,” he gasped between sobs. He used one of his wings to wipe off a trail of snot. “It’s just—“ He pulled out his rejection letter from the Big Cheese for the fifty-sixth time. “I really thought I was gonna get the job!”

Sighing, I ambled over to him and placed my arms around his shoulders, trying to avoid the wet patches. I passed him a tissue. “Look, I know you really wanted the Soulherding opening—”

*The painful memory, unbidden, wafts into my mind’s eye. Nicholas and Sabrina, the two final candidates for the Soulherding position, at the Pearly Gates. The Big Cheese, seated in Her fluffy, late-19th century Parisian armchair, watching from a distance. Me, in my helicopter nearby, rooting for my friend and guardian. Recently deceased souls, their spirits opalescent and glittery in the noon light, waft up from Earth and approach Nick and Sabrina.*

*Nick glances at the Big Cheese, who nods expectantly. He clears his throat, and thrusts out his right arm in front of the incoming spirits, exclaiming, “Halt, ye Souls! Declare thyselves, and thy Fate will be known.”*

*The new souls queue up. The first in line is a seedy looking middle-aged man, a teardrop tattooed underneath his right eye.*

*“What is your name, sir?” Nick asks, flipping through his clipboard.*

*“Gary. Gary Lawson,” the man replies, shifting around in spot.*

*“Gary Lawson—ah! Yes. Heaven for you. Come right on in,” said Nick, opening the Gates for Gary.*

*As Gary drifts towards the open gate, Nick’s eyes bulge. He’s read the wrong line—this wasn’t Gabby Lawson, the sweet baker lady; no, this was Gary Lawson, murderer of his wife Gabby and their two kids!*

*“Hey! Wait! Come back here!” yells Nick, scrambling after the heavenbent asshole.*

*In his haste, Nick trips over his toga and faceplants in the cloud beneath him. The Big Cheese sighs, placing a hand over her face, and Sabrina is trying to calm the rest of the Souls. Gabby Lawson and her sons are hugging each other in line and crying.*

*I decide to intervene. I pilot my helicopter, following Gary Lawson as he zooms towards the Gate. Just as he’s about to cross the threshold into Heaven, I grab ahold of my machine gun and unleash fire on the family-murdering scum. Although Gary’s no longer corporeal, the bullets nonetheless penetrate his spiritual body, leaving little holes in his soul. He collapses on the cloud, inches from the doorway to Heaven.*

*At this point, Nick has caught up to Gary, wheezing. He handcuffs the prone Soul, and waves at me. “You’re the best ward ever, Joe!” Turning back to Gary, he sternly intones, “Hell for you, Mr. Lawson.”*

I shook my head, bringing myself back into the present moment. Nick stopped crying; he dabbed his eyes with the tissue I had given him. “Yeah… Thanks again for your help at the end.”

“Don’t mention it,” I said, waving him off, and glad to see he was no longer crying like an abandoned baby goat. I glanced at my wristwatch—12:00. “Look, he could be here any minute and—”

An ominous peal of thunder in an otherwise clear sky. A dark vortex began to form, yards from Nick and me. Tendrils of electric green and purple lightning flashed out from the center of the whirlpool, where a shadowy figure was emerging, like the Loch Ness from her lake, or Beyonce from her turnstile.

“Oh shit.” I said.

“Miss me?” The figure was hooded, holding a sawed-off shotgun in one hand. Relishing the anticipation, he slowly lowered his hood—revealing the holey face of Gary Lawson. His soul was no longer made from the silvery vapor of Innocents, but rather, the murky gray smog of the Damned.

“Shit shit shit,” I said again. I shoved Nick in front of me—it was supposed to be his job to defend me, dang it! “Come on, man!”

Nick reached in his tunic for his weapons, but Lawson had begun to shoot. I groaned and pulled out my own handgun, glad that I always kept it with me, and returned fire. As we exchanged gunshots, Nick and I retreated. My copter wasn’t far away—I could see it—but I had no idea if we could make it in time—

A well-aimed shot from Gary Lawson hit the gas tank in my helicopter, causing it to explode. Nick and I flew back, propelled by the force. We were now just feet away from Gary Lawson, who cast a long, dark shadow over us, grinning to reveal crooked, rotting teeth—

“NO!” Nick declared. He spread his wings out like the frill of the Dilophosaurus, shielding me from Lawson. “YOU WILL NOT HURT MY FRIEND!”

“Is that so—” said Lawson, but before he could launch into his villainy tirade, Nick had sprung up to attack him with his bare hands, pummeling the guy with a flurry of punches. As the two tussled on the ground, I looked on with the satisfaction of a popular schoolgirl as teenage boys competed for her affection. (Of course, my life was actually at stake in this situation, but I couldn’t help but glow on the inside.)

Nick finally overpowered Lawson. He shoved him in front of me, forcing him to kneel at my toes. Lawson looked up at me with an expression of utter contempt.

“Go on, finish me. I’m dead anyway,” he spat.

“We’ll see about that,” I said. I raised my handgun and shot him in the forehead.",galbinus

[TT] A terminally-ill patient agrees to undergo an experimental procedure to have their consciousness transferred into an artificial body...but there's a catch...,Plomboh,"On August 24th, 2012, Kyle Mercer agreed to undergo the hypoterminal transplant. The operation had never been done before on living creatures, but our doctors and scientists spent several years developing the method from already existing technologies.

We planned the operation to happen on September 7th due to the sudden advancement of Mr. Okamura's condition. Over those two weeks, we instructed Mr. Mercer to consume as much brain stimulant as possible. The organization gave him two million dollars to spend as he saw fit, and assigned two field agents to oversee his activities.

At the end of the two weeks, Mr. Mercer was forcibly brought to our facility and given six doses of LSD4 to further stimulate his brain. After eight hours, we gave him another dose of LSD4 and commenced the operation.

To begin, we placed Mr. Mercer under heavy anesthesia. Once he became unresponsive, we began the process of extracting his nervous system from his body. Over the course of six days, we extracted Mr. Mercer's nervous system while administering one dose of LSD4 every eight hours along with continuous anesthesia.

Once we extracted the nervous system, we discarded the leftovers. We had no use for Mr. Mercer's physical body, and neither did he. 

With the extracted nervous system, we began transplant onto a receptor grid. Each receptor translated the electrical impulses inside the nerves into electrical signals that would later be used by a robotic skeleton. This process of fixing receptors to the nervous system terminals took twenty eight hours, but our six surgeons completed it flawlessly.

Next, we implanted the receptor grid inside the robotic skeleton. This processes took only two hours and resulted in our finished product, a fully completed hypoterminal transplant.

To test the results, we woke Mr. Mercer up.

""Hello, Kyle. Welcome back,"" As many people as we could fit into the clean room said in unison.

""Is it the future yet?"" Kyle asked us.

""It's been almost a week, so technically yes,"" Dr Woodworth answered.

""We just want to confirm that everything still works. Try moving your arm,"" Dr. Taylor instructed.

""Well,"" Kyle spoke and the robotic arm moved, ""Here is goes,""

After testing Mr. Mercer's full range of possible motions, we prepared to put him under again.

""The next time we wake you up, one hundred sixty seven years will have passed,"" I told him as the doctors reattached cables.

""I'm ready for it,"" He said to me, unfazed by the prospect of two lifetimes passing before he experiences life again.

""Begin nervous switch,"" I told the doctor to my right and he flipped the switch. 

This was the last time we spoke to the real Kyle Mercer.",hobojimbobo

(Bonus points if he needs to protect her from poachers/pirates or whatever.),alhr679,"As night crept slowly across the sleepy surburbia, Dan Porter wrapped a blanket over himself and made his way down the steep enbankment to the ocean shore.

""You're early today.""

He smiled at the sound of the familiar voice, letting the soft, cheerful femininity of it caress his ears and heart as he sat on the sand in a place not too far from the ocean.

""And you're closer to the water today, too,"" said the voice.

""I can't help it. You draw me in more and more each time,"" he replied, features solemn as he searched the surface of the rippling waters for a sign of his hidden beloved. 

There was silence, except for the breaking waves. 

""Speak to me,"" he urged. ""Let me hear your voice.""

""I...this may be the last time you see me. There is too much evil among your kind.""

His brow furrowed as he listened to her words. ""What do you mean?""

""You are a good man, Dan. I speak highly of you to my people. They come sometimes and watch you from afar. But, we had made the mistake of assuming that everyone amongst your species were possessing of the same kindness and gentles that we see in you."" Her voice dropped. ""We were wrong.""

""Tell me,"" he encouraged.

""The other night - after we had gone, another man came. And my sister had stayed behind. This man and her talked and he convinced her to come ashore with him. He did things to her - I heard her cries. I came, but not quick enough. She is no longer pure. She is defiled. Violated. Her blood attracts sharks, and our rate of death has risen. We must migrate or face extinction.""

""Tell me,"" he demanded. ""Tell me who did this and I swear it, I'll make them pay!""

""We know not his name. Only my sister knows his looks, but she is still too traumatized to speak.""

""Then take me with you.""

""I wish I...""

He stood and walked towards the ocean, not stopping as the waters swallowed him up to the waist. And yet he continued to walk.

""Dan! What are you doing?! Stop!""

""If I cannot follow you, then I will wait for you in Heaven.""

And he continued forward until the waters of the ocean swarmed in from all sides, washing over his head and plunged him into unfathomable depths. 

He didn't even try to hold his breath. If one could cry underwater, he would be. All he did was await his death.

But as he felt the oxygen leave his body, a figure saw over him and placed its lips on his, filling his lungs with new air. 

He opened his eyes and stared into hers.

""You were willing to die for me..."" she said.

""If you left me, I would have died anyway."" 

He smiled and kissed her again.

I look at him confused. Home? That wasn't right. Grandpa had lived in the same house since he was born, passed onto him by his father and would eventually be passed to my father, the same house we lived in right now. He walked over to the end of the cluster of metals and glass that protruded from the ground. I followed closely behind him.

""When did you live here?"" I questioned.

Grandpa paused at this. A long drawn out pause, followed by a slow puff of his lit pipe, was entertained before I finally got my cryptic answer.

""Every when, I suppose."" When I didn't answer, not for lack of trying to think of a question that would requisite an answer I would understand, my grandpa took to wandering.

I shouted as I thrust my finger towards what promised to be something cool. ""Oh..."" Granddad said softly, as I walked slowly away from both him and the path, and towards the monstrosity that was sticking out of the Earth.

When my Granddad finally made his way off the path, down the small rocky slope and through the tall grass and trees, I was already trying to climb to the top of the giant hunk of metal protruding from the ground.

""Tom,"" Granddad quietly called as I stretched my leg out to find the next foothold, ""come down from there.""

""But I'm almost at the top! I can get there, I know it!"" I shouted back. ""I want you to come down,"" he said. 

""But why!"" I yelled, ""I'll be fine, I'm almost at the top!"" 

""Because there's broken glass still attached to that thing and you might cut yourself.""

""But-"" I started, but Granddad was firm, ""No. Come down now, please. Here, give me your hand."" Granddad reached up towards where I was standing, on the ledge of one of the large holes in the side of the thing. Reluctantly, I extended my hand backwards towards my Granddad, and gripped his hand tightly. ""Ready?"" I asked, crouching slightly at the knees. My Granddad sighed, but I could tell he was smiling. ""Alright,"" he said, as he stretched his other arm out in preparation, ""go ahead.""

Then, I mustered all of the strength in my 6 year-old legs and, using my Granddad's hand for support, jumped backwards into the air! For the few seconds that I was airborne, I opened my eyes and looked up towards the sky. The thick, grey, accumulation of clouds and haze seemed to flow, all in one direction. It was like a stream of ash colored water, and for a moment, I forgot what they told us about ""CO2 emissions"" and ""air pollution"", and the slowly shifting ocean of smog seemed almost relaxing.

The next thing I knew, my feet were hitting the ground. Granddad was still holding my hand. ""Okay, you can let go now."" I said as he let me pull me hand away from his. ""I could've gotten to the top..."" I muttered under my breath as I looked at the ground to kick some dirt, but Granddad ignored me.

""Do you want to know what that is?""

When I lifted my head to look at my Granddad, his eyes were already fixed on mine, motionless behind his glasses.

""Do you want to know what it is?"" he repeated, this time slowly and more deliberately. 

""...Yeah"" I said, not daring to break my Granddad's gaze.

Granddad took a deep breath and said, ""You have probably heard of these as, 'Metal Monsters' in your lessons.""

""*This* is a Metal Monster?"" I whispered. And then, for a brief moment, I looked back to what I thought, just moments before, was a playground. It looked more ominous now, its worn out grey color matching that of the undulating sky.

""Yes. Well, what's left of one."" said Granddad matter-of-factly, ""But *my* grandfather would have called this a car.""

[WP] You join the search party for the person you had murdered and buried in these woods. Someone found your site; everyone gathers. You push through the crowd and see an empty hole.,elheber,"Its been one day and sixteen minutes since Astrid Burnham has been declared missing. The search party moves to another point, checking off another square. There's still a lot of ground to cover and the only place they think their missing person disappeared to. Others, across town, are all scouring about, searching for her in endless cornfields, ravines and forgotten roads no one has traveled on in years.

David lingers behind, flashlight in hand, light shining in a pale reflection of the moon. It's almost dusk and the sky begins to bleed into a swirl of deep crimson and dark blue. 

""I ain't seen anythin' like this in all my years livin' here,"" Richard, a fellow  veteran, declares.

It is the biggest manhunt David's ever seen in this town and he's never understood why so many people immediately rallied up to organize the search party for just one girl. She's pretty, with ebony hair and fair skin and deep caramel eyes. But he thinks, would this be the same if she was African-American? Would they still look for her too? 

""Kidnappin' the mayor's girl. Only family he has left,"" Richard continues. ""Who would be insane enough to try that?"" 

*Me.* A smirk rises onto David's face before it vanishes, crossing into shadow. A few more crunches of leaves and branches crack underneath their feet. An eerie atmosphere slowly merges into the world of nature around them, a light fog settling above their heads. 

Richard ambles forward, hobbling as fast and carefully as he can with his cane, swishing his flashlight around, calling out the mayor's daughter's name. There's no response. There will never be because David's buried her in a hole at least four feet into the ground and has made damn well sure that it wouldn't be discovered. He's purposely led the search party astray, claiming that he's seen her dashing off into deeper in the forest, away from them. That is the direction they're currently on. The lights wander aimlessly in the distance as they near closer to the others. 

""Astrid!"" 

""Astrid! If you can hear me, make some noise, honey!"" 

""Astrid? Where are you?!""

Astrid this. Astrid that. God, David can't wait until this whole thing blows over before he can revel in the silence and finish what he's came here to do. 

There's the crackle of the walkie-talkie blaring to life as a voice warbles out: ""Hey, guys. I think I found something. Over by the west side, near the river with the crooked steps.""

He follows the others, quickening his pace. There's a crowd already gathering around his site and he needs to get there before they do and--- Heart hammering in his chest, he looks back to see one of Astrid's friends lingering behind, standing at the edge of the treeline. He looks at her, brows furrowed. Why isn't she joining the others? ""Leslie? You okay?""

She looks up and sees him, olive skin clashing against her mismatched wardrobe, dark hair falling in a straight curtain as she shakes her head. ""I ain't going out there. This is sacred ground.""

""They think they found her,"" he offers. 

""That's still not gonna make me step over there. And besides, she's not in it.""

David pauses. ""What?""

""They said the hole's empty. She's not in it. She must've gotten out and---""

David tunes out and begins to push through the crowd in a desperate manner. He has to see for himself. And Leslie's right. Dirt has caved in the hole as if a bomb's blown through it and blackened around the edges. There's no sign of Astrid anywhere.

David knows Astrid's dead. He *knows.* He's strangled her and stabbed her at least six times and has felt and saw the life leave her body before discarding her into the hole. 

He makes his way back to Leslie. ""Do you think she's still alive?"" he asks cautiously, pretending to care. 

""She has to be,"" she replies. ""That or . . .""

""Or what?""

She hesitates. ""Nothing.""

Her eyes wander and then fixate on something in a distance as she heads to find Astrid's father, pausing in her steps. A heartbeat later, then she turns around and looks at David, eyes dropping to the edge of his shirt. Her fingers reach out and curl around the silver chain he has hidden underneath his shirt. 

""This is her's. Why . . ."" Leslie meets his eyes. A knowing look with the hint of confusion mingling in, then realization. David remains impassive, meeting her with a cold look. Her fingers immediately jerk away as if she's been burned. ""Oh my God. Oh my God.""

Her voice becomes laced with panic and she opens her mouth to shout, to warn the others but then David's fingers grip the switchblade in his pocket, flicking it open and draws a red smile across her throat. Her fingers clasp around, trying to piece the skin back together but the damage has already been done. She collapses to the ground, dead.

David turns. There's silence from the others as they stare at him in horror. Then he moves. They try their hardest to subdue him only to fail. He can't leave any survivors.

A demented ring of laughter escapes his throat as the realization of what happened to Astrid sinks in. It worked. It finally worked. 

After years of trying, the deed has finally been completed. He has managed to do the impossible. His father had told him that he wouldn't be able to succeed.

He can feel the ghost of fingers lightly tracing the back of his head as if in a curious, gentle caress. He turns. Astrid is standing there in all her bloody glory, throat healed and wounds closed. Her eyes have faded into a pale color and when she stretches her lips in a soft snarl, her teeth have been filed into points, decay sinking into her cheeks, a hollow contrast compared to the girl he used to know. When she raises her fingers again, he can see that her hands have been replaced with long claws and emaciated fingers.

""You are beautiful,"" he whispers, moving aside a strand of hair, tucking it behind her ear. She purrs softly in response. ""You will lead the others. You will leave a revolution beyond your wake and an army once this town becomes the name that fear gave itself. This town will endure the horrors it has tried to forget.

The visual of a white button shirt stretched over the frame of a furry bear made my day. I'm kind'a sad there was no resolution but I suppose not all stories need one. What was there was good, however.

This one I don't believe needed to be first person. Had it been third person, we readers wouldn't be forced to identify with Joan who (despite the somewhat normal/expected reaction) isn't very sympathetic. This one would have been stronger in third-person, since it would allow us to escape the MC's point of view at the end and side with the Clarice and Dennis.

Nobody but you finds this odd.,elheber,"""The first day is always interesting,"" Clarice chatters happily at me as she leads me to my cubicle. ""I remember my first day like it was yesterday. But oh, silly me, that was *years* ago!"" We walked by the average lot in an office building, but the sight in front of me was enough to stop me in my tracks. ""This is your cubicle, dear.""

""Hey, how's it going? Welcome."" 

""Dear, this is your neighbor Dennis. Dennis, this is Joan."" Dennis' muzzle raises in some crude form of a smile. Muzzle. Because I was most certainly staring at what looked to be a brown bear someone forced into a dress shirt. ""Do be good enough to show her the ropes, yes?""

""Clarice, you're kidding?!"" My voice was higher pitched than I'd have liked, my fear obvious. ""Th-That's a bear!""

""Tsk, no need to be rude, Joan. Dennis is quite civilized."" I scan the room around me, but if people are looking in our direction it's to give me dirty looks.

""I've been through training,"" Dennis says, as if that explains away everything.

""How can you even talk?"" I demand. ""What the hell is going on here? Is this some kind of hazing ritual?""

""Joan--"" Dennis starts.

""No! No way!"" I turn to the nearest person. ""Is this some sort of joke?"" He gives me a dirty look.

""Don't mind this broad, Dennis. Some people just aren't as advanced as the rest of us.""

""Haven't you ever seen a bear before?"" Another woman demands. 

""This is a joke. Ha, ha, guys, you got me. Very funny."" I look to Clarice, who is obviously disgruntled.

""I don't think there's room in this office for someone who is prejudiced, Joan."" I look from her to the bear, then back again before shaking my head.

""Screw this place. I'm so out of here!"" I turn to leave, and as I walk away I can't stop myself from looking back in time to see Clarice petting Dennis affectionately, who watches me walk away with black button eyes.

[WP] The worker in your neighboring cubicle is a brown bear. Nobody but you finds this odd.,elheber,"Beautiful twist. I also really like the descriptions such as, ""huge stature even more intimidating up close,"" that really sold the emotions. You used that as opposed to simply, ""I was intimidated."" This way, you described something intimidating to the reader so that we feel what the narrator feels instead of simply being told what the narrator feels. More of that and less of ,""I was consoled,"" would make your work tons better.

I'm not a fan of first person narrative used unnecessarily, but your fit well as it really was about the character's inner thoughts.

[WP] The worker in your neighboring cubicle is a brown bear. Nobody but you finds this odd.,elheber,"Everybody just walks past the bear. Some smile at it, some even wave. I can't help but wonder why they would put themselves at such danger to interact with such a beast. I felt I was going crazy to be the only one to fear it. 

At night, when people aren't around, I can see the true ferocity of the bear. It feasts on pounds of salmon, savagely ripping every fish apart. I lay awake most nights, staring at the ceiling, fearing the beast that lived next to me.

I know what you're thinking. Why haven't I asked why everyone else isn't scared? Believe me, I've tried, but nobody listens to me. I don't really have any friends, and passers by don't respond to my cries. 

But tonight, I have decided to take action. The crippling fear of this animal has become all too much to bare. I need answers. 

I gingerly moved towards the cubicle, and knocked gently on the door. To my fright, the door swung open immediately. The bear stood in front of me, its huge stature even more intimidating up close. I could see the blade on each of its long, sharp claws and I was overwhelmed by the fishy stench of its breath. As I anticipated a swift swipe from the bears powerful arms, I didn't even have the chance to feel the fear of my impending death.

""Hello"" said the bear. 

I fell straight to the ground. My legs gave way and the fear and confusion became so blinding that I passed out. My last thought before losing consciousness was the awareness that this may be the last thought I ever had...

To my surprise, I did come to. I frantically sat up and scoured the room I had woken up in. It was a small, dark, cave-like room filled with plants and fruits. The stench of fish was still overwhelming, and I found myself laying upon a hay bale. 

'My god' I thought, 'it's going to eat me'. Just as I clambered towards the door in a desperate attempt to escape, the bear appeared. 
""Don't leave, I've been wanting to meet you for so long."" My loss of consciousness had made me completely forget that this bear could talk, and hearing its voice  made my legs weak again. 
""Hey, what's wrong with you?"" The bear asked as I began to collapse again. Its voice was not as I expected, not that I ever expected bears to have a voice, but it seemed to have a genuinely concerned tone. 

""ME? What's wrong with ME? You're a bear... you're a bear and you can talk! Talk, you can, you.. Is that... is this why people aren't afraid of you?"" My words felt jumbled as they came out of my mouth. My mind was still trying to fathom what the hell was going on. 

A few moments passed with the bear completely silent. Was I going insane? Perhaps the bear couldn't speak at all, and the utter fear I felt was causing me to hallucinate. 

""Are you serious?"" the bear broke the silence and I felt slightly consoled that I wasn't insane. ""Do you know where we are?"" 

I frowned and looked up at the bear. He walked over to a long, shiny object in the far distance of the cave. ""Do you know who you are?"" 

As my intrigue overcame my fear for a moment, I followed the bear over towards the shiny object. At closer inspection, the shiny object was a mirror. Across the top of the mirror was an old, faded sign. It just said ""Toronto Zoo"". Cautiously, I glanced down at my reflection, and there stood another huge, brown bear.

"[WP] Tell me a story. Difficulty: No dialogue, only actions.",fracati,"Jaren sat in his chair, going over papers. The papers were clear and the shipments were being stalled, stopped, or, worst case scenario, destroyed. He sighed, rubbing his eyes. The little flame above his shoulder flickered comforting. It hung in the air, illuminating Jaren's desk.

Jaren looked out the window, at the beautiful night view he so often enjoyed. It was a full moon tonight, the ocean in the distance sparkling brilliantly. With a resigned slump, Jaren turned back to his work.

There was a thump outside his door. Jaren looked up from his work. He heard a small yelp that was suddenly cut off, followed by another thud. Jaren quickly stood, stepping away from his desk and behind his cabinet. He peeked around the corner, staring at the door. 

The knob turned and the door swung inward. In stepped a large man, a spear in his hand. His right hand. His other hand, his other arm was different than. It had a strange green hue, with bulging veins running along it and it seemed ever so slightly too big for him. His legs, at least what Jaren could see that the man's shorts did not cover, followed suit. All three of the deformed appendages had sharp, shining black claws. Long hair, hung down, hiding his features. 

The man stood in the doorway, looking at the desk. He walked into the room and up to the desk. He grabbed some papers and looked over them. 

Jaren held his breath, aimed, and hurled a fireball at the man. 

The man turned as the fireball drew close and evaporated. Jaren looked on in horror. He threw another and another and another fireball but all simply faded away as the approached the man. Jaren quickly changed his plan of attack. 

Bolting for the wall behind his desk, Jaren ran to the mantle and grabbed the gun set decoratively there. It had another purpose however, one he now utilized. Spinning, Jaren pointed the gun at the man, who had not yet moved, and fired. 

The shot cracked and the man took a step back as the bullet ripped through his body. Jaren stood triumphant, waiting for he man to fall. The hole in the man's shirt told Jaren the bullet had pierced his heart. So he stood there waiting for his opponent to fall. He did not.

Jaren’s eyes grew wide as the man stepped forward, no blood visible. Jaren stepped back into the wall, inching along it towards the doors leading to his balcony. The strange man vaulted the desk and slowly approached. 

Jaren ran, bursting through the doors I to the balcony. He ran to the end, looking over the bay. The water was too far. Glancing back, Jaren saw the man approaching. He would have to risk it, the water gave him a chance. Jaren gripped the railing.

Jaren let go of the railing. His shoulders slumped. He realized it didn't matter. Nothing mattered. He turned back to the approaching man who now held his deformed hand outstretched towards Jaren. Jaren was not afraid. Jaren was nothing. He stared emptily off Into space, devoid of feeling, as the man's spear head sliced through the air towards the Jaren's throat.

Ver-dun pulled his spear out, letting the body hit the ground with a thud. He turned his job complete. Leaping from the balcony he landed upon the ground with a sort of soft boom. He walked off Into the night, wordless. ",Braz-dur
"[WP] Tell me a story. Difficulty: No dialogue, only actions.",fracati,"Only a minute remains in the game when a tall boy in blue goes on a breakaway. His stride is long, and he pulls away from the defenders in yellow. Nothing but open field between him and the keeper, who has spread his limbs wide in a stance reminiscent of a crab. The tall boy times his steps so that he keeps the ball moving forward without losing speed. As he nears the goal's outer crease, the spectators wearing blue rise to their feet. They clap, stomp their feet, and place fingers to their lips to whistle.

And then the tall boy nudges the ball too far to the side, steps wide to accommodate, overbalances, rolls his ankle, and falls to the grass clutching his leg. The ref blows the whistle and coaches converge on the injured boy.

On the sidelines, as the spectators slump back down to their seats, Alex Thomas pops onto his feet. He paces, always keeping an eye on the injured boy and the coaches around him. His thick dark curls bob with every step.

The injured boy gets carried off the field. On his way past, Alex's coach gives Alex the nod.

Alex pulls a photograph on a loop of string out from under his shirt. The photograph shows the Argentinian soccer superstar Maradona leaping over a fallen defender. Maradona has his fist raised in the air. The look on his face is one of concentration -- his brows are drawn together and his mouth bends crookedly to one side. Alex presses the photograph to his forehead, slips it back under his shirt, and runs onto the field with his fist in the air.

It's a kickoff. Alex's team has possession a few feet out from the goal crease. 

Alex takes position alongside the ball. Defenders, their hands clasped in front of their groins, line up in front of him. The ref whistles.

Alex takes a run at the ball, hops over it, and knocks it backwards with his heel to a teammate waiting behind him. The teammate stops the ball, pulls his leg up to deliver a massive kick, but instead clips gently the ball with the top of his foot, lofting it over the defenders. Alex around the defenders and jumps. The keeper sees what's coming and dives, arms outstretched. But Alex snaps his head and knocks the ball between the keeper's hands.

The ball makes a beeline -- straight into the crossbar. It pings the metal and flies out of bounds.

The defenders waste the remaining thirty seconds of the game passing the ball between themselves.

All through the hand-shaking ceremony at the end of the game, Alex hangs his head. The players on the opposing team give him ironic thumbs-up and pat him on the back. His own teammates ignore him.

After the spectators and the players have gone, Alex comes back onto the field. He carries a ball in his hands and he takes position inside the goal crease at the exact spot where he headbutted the ball. He tosses the ball into the air, jumps, and headbutts it into the goal. He retrieves the ball from the net and does it again. And again. And again.

He repeats this movement until the field lights shut off and a security guard tells him he has to go. Then grabs his bag and walks home alone in the dark. He removes the photograph from around his neck and clutches it the whole way.

"[WP] Tell me a story. Difficulty: No dialogue, only actions.",fracati,"The restaurant is alive with mindless chatter. Couples lean over small tables talking intimately. Their smiles glow in the dim candlelight. A family celebrating a birthday is talking excitedly; the birthday “boy” is turning eighteen and about to leave for college. Near the back a small reunion of high school friends is asking to split the check six ways. One of them has the check, while the others call out their orders in a confused contest. A sandy blonde haired waitress smiles as she writes down the details of a carefully dictated order. The world in the restaurant is bright and lively, except for the small booth in the corner.

That booth is trapped in a singular moment separate from the rest of the world. A silence that seems impossible to break has descended over the couple .

He rubs his face again and looks out the window towards the parking lot. A layer of frost has settled over the hood of his car. He looks back to his wife. There is anger in her eyes, and a fire like the sun. His mother told him to never look at the sun, so he quickly drops his eyes. He focuses on her hands instead. His eyes are drawn to the wedding ring that sparkles against the flickering candle light. A wave of guilt rushes over him, and he takes a deep breath holding it as long as he can. He thought letting the truth out would ease the weight on his heart, but it didn’t work. Instead it seemed everything was spiraling away from him, including her. It left him feeling empty with only that intangible guilt to keep him company. He lets out the breath in a long broken exhale.

The world tried to ignore the couple. The birthday boy spots them. A chill runs down his spine. It’s like looking at a bad accident. He turns away and resumes the conversation with his father.

She doesn’t want to cry. She doesn’t want to be that person that stands up with tears in her eyes and storms out of the restaurant. She does not want to cry. But the tears are starting to form and her breath catches in her throat, threatening to transform into an uncontrollable sob. She grabs her glass of water and tries to drown it with several short sips. She finishes it off with one long drink. She places the empty glass on the table, harder than she intended. The sound shocks her husband out of his thoughts, and he glances up at her. As their eyes meet she doesn't see him, not alone. She can never see him as he was when the evening started, before the truth was revealed. She does not want to cry, and now she doesn’t think she will. Slowly, he puts his hand on the table.

The sandy blonde haired waitress spots the empty glass and approaches with a water pitcher. The woman waves her off wordlessly. The waitress hesitates and looks at the man in the booth. His hand is outstretched with his palm up. He looks guilty as if she caught him begging for a dollar from the middle-aged woman across the table. She tries a smile and backs away slowly.

He looks again at his empty hand hoping that she will place her own in his. He knows that if he could just touch her, the dreary spell that had settled over them would vanish. Their silent world would burst, and they would return to reality as if nothing had happened. If she would put her hand in his, maybe they could forget about his mistake. He looks between his hand to her, and softly smiles.

She puts her hand in his, but only for a second. She retracts it. In his outstretched palm, abandoned and vulnerable, are her wedding rings. She leans back and sees them as small imperfect objects. She sees them as broken promises, and for her the world begins to turn and stutter back to life. She feels she has just witnessed the end to something, and it makes her sad. It makes her relieved too, and that makes her even more sad. Still she refuses to cry. She grabs her purse and her coat and scoots out of the booth.

The group of friends are leaving. She marches quickly in front of them feeling herself losing the battle against her tears.

He looks at the pair of rings, small and delicate in his palms. The diamond sparkles in the light. His memory flashes to the moment he was on one knee with the ring held out. There had been a moment of silence then too, a pause, a hesitation that seemed to stretch to infinity. Then, she had said yes. Now, well, now what was left to say?",jagaimo314

"[WP] Tell me a story. Difficulty: No dialogue, only actions.",fracati,"Her fingers tapped a quick, fidgety beat on the counter. A nervous tick on anyone else with the current backdrop of a man screaming in the other room, but merely a sign of impatience for her.

The kitchen was nice. Rather minimalist as with most of the rest of the house, except for the vase on the counter and the picture frame in front of it. In stark contrast to his expensive and gorgeous vase collection in the cabinet in his living room(his one other indulgence in design), the vase was cheap clay. Its only value lay in the paint covering it, a child's sloppy work painting kittens and hearts. In the picture frame stood the man, a woman, and a little girl between them holding a puppy. They looked happy. She just felt sad.

It wasn't that she wanted that kind of family. She already had the only family she needed, and she was well on her way to retrieving the single missing person. But, well.

Carefully, she reached out to turn the frame around.

Just as she finished, the screaming reached the crescendo she had been waiting for. She pursed her lips to whistle a high note, and immediately the growls of her pet settled down. Only the man's whimpering remained. When she whistled again, her pet growled again, this time accompanied by the sound of the man scrambling to stand up, and then the both of them walking out to the kitchen. This routine had played out enough times with other men that she only pointed in the direction of the nearest bathroom, directing him out to allow him to find his first aid kit. The damage her pet had done to his hand and arm would not be fatal, but she wasn't interested in listening to him panic as he bled.

As he scampered away, she clicked her tongue for her pet. Immediately it was at her side, gaping maw drooling eagerly. Its reward was a few scratches behind the ridges on the back of its head, where it really liked being scratched, and then a treat from the bag she had brought with her.

It jumped on the counter. She rubbed its neck. They waited.

Eventually the man came back out. Defeated, as they always were. When he hesitated she snapped her fingers, suddenly impatient once more. He made an aborted gesture towards the hall leading to his study, mumbled something incoherent. With a roll of her eyes, she sighed and got up to follow him.

Another picture of the family sat beside his computer. He was fortunate she had decided to wait until they were both gone for the day. Multiple hostages at once tended to make her pet antsy.

The USB drive was in a combination locked drawer. It would have been simple enough for her partner to retrieve it if he weren't such a lazy bastard, but they were also here to send a message. If she cared anymore, she would have felt bad for this poor, ignorant man. His boss had completely failed to even warn him to watch out for her.

She returned his phone to the man as she left the house, prize in hand. There was no fear in it being a fake. Not with how dust had gathered on that drawer, the study being the one place not meticulously cleaned. Not with how he had reacted to the sight of her, and then of her pet.

Her partner sat grinning in the driver's seat of the getaway car, giving her increasingly smug looks as she first let her pet into the back seat and then swung into the passenger's side next to him. Rolling her eyes again as he started to hum, she pushed his face forward to the road and held it there until he began to drive.

Or, was I finally set free of the madness that was keeping me in the nuclear bunker all these years?

I had always known that even if there was a nuclear holocaust it would be pointless to survive by myself. 

For years I would imagine that this was a government experiment that I unwittingly signed myself up for but even if I had the isolation would have contorted my memories to the point that I didn't know my own past from a fabrication that would put my mind at ease.

""Excuse me sir, do you have a dollar?"" I asked a passing man in a business suit as I sat on a sidewalk panhandling for food money.

Of course he would ignore me. Just like everyone I have asked for help. No one believes me. They think I am insane. The people at the shelter want to admit me into the mental hospital where I will be unable to leave.

Fuck that.

""Anything helps"", a young girl was standing a few feet away staring at me. Her mother was trying to move her a long but she wanted to help. Her mother finally pulled a dollar bill out of her purse and gave it to me then they left.

I just don't understand why was I the only one? Or, was there more? Did the others just give up hope?

According to the welfare office I do not exist. There is no way out of this....

I have been returning to the bunker which is accessible behind the now abandoned warehouse I used to work. I ate all the food.

""Get a job! Damn bums are making this city dirty,"" yelled an asshole as he got into his vehicle. 

I have no idea what that car is but it looks expensive. I don't even bother to show an effort for a response to that.

I had always thought the future would be a better place. Too bad I don't get to experience it. I would like to at least try those augmented reality contact lenses that act as a sort of everything a person would need. I don't even know....

I got $12.48 today. I can afford a meal bar and a can a beans. Since I am a paying customer I can use the drinking fountain and the bathroom. I think that's the day for me. It's starting to get cold out and the sun is disappearing.

I should just start slinging the street drugs. A dealer stops at 4th street everyday and give people $5 dollars of something. They say you sell it at $1 or even up to $3 a hit. The next day you give the dealer $10 and you keep the other $10-$30. But, I am not a salesmen and I hear people die over as little as losing $10 dollars of drugs at dealers value.

Everything can change in just a few minutes. Maybe tomorrow will be my lucky day.

""Frank Gorgon."" A strangely familiar voice whispered from the shadows of the warehouse.

I was about to go back into the bunker but I quickly had become terrified for reasons I could sense but my brain wouldn't allow me to comprehend.

I turned around and was as alert as I could possibly be. My heart pounding as the adrenaline took it's affect, ""Yes?"" I said squeamishly. I corrected my tune and confronted to voice with more authority, ""So, it was you?""

""I almost felt bad,"" He stepped out of the shadows. ""After what you did to me I couldn't have thought of a better form of justice.""

The tension left my body in a second and I starting laughing uncontrollably.

""You know you deserve worse than this. You have had it easy. No responsibilities, no worries, food, and shelter for free."" He continued approaching me.

""I regret a few things in my past but what happened between us was in no way my fault."" I pointed a finger at him as though it was a gun. ""As God as my witness he will bring you to justice in both the remaining time you have on Earth and the time after.""

""God?"" He pulled out a 45 magnum and shot me in the stomach. ""Good luck with that.""

He had just missed my spinal cord. ""Ugghhh, I... Errr, never... stole... *gasp* your charizard card.....""

While I usually did not care for the wanderers of these parts, something struck me as odd to these companions who approached. As they ventured through the muck and land, it dawned on me...

They're coming here.

I armed myself as quickly as I was able, then sat outside, preparing myself for the storm to come. I muttered to myself all the possible words I could use to keep this from turning bloody, and was still thinking hard when I began to hear their footsteps.

I spoke with as loud a voice as I was able while keeping it clear, ""Well, why are you here? You know the consequences, don't you?""

She continues to try and speak to me, showing more concern with each word. Whatever she was saying, it mattered to her, but not to me.

Reduced to nothing but appearance, I tried my best to communicate with them. I still wasn't sure what they wanted, but I didn't care. I had a purpose, and it must be fulfilled. Conveying my messages with both voice and and gestures - they may not understand the words, but they can understand hostility.

They did indeed understand my intentions, though maybe not why. Very quickly, they began to brace for a fight, their fidgets and twitches were all that I needed.  I revealed my weapon, put a hand on it, and loudly told them that I willing to use them, though I would take no pleasure. Still, they did not understand my reasons, but they drew their weapons, and I mine.

Years had gone since I had a fight, that does bring consequences. I and my skills had rusted away, and the foreigners made quick work of me.

As I laid in my own blood, struggling to breathe, the woman stood over me. Sadness seemed to settle in her eyes. Again she spoke her foreign words, kind and sweet as they were, it still hung over me like death.

I wanted to capture the feeling of them being an agency with a history and thus having a slang name for their agents. So a DAIRI agent would be a ""milkman"". (Try pronouncing DAIRI and you'll get it.)

 I also have always thought terms like ""men in black"" that depersonify agents of these organizations also make them scarier. 

Still, I probably went too far down the rabbit hole there. :p I think trying to make it work in this small of a story was likely a mistake.

[WP] In a world where everything has a cool down you find yourself in the rock paper scissors world championship.,yeepyjr,"
Three seconds. Three choices. The possibilities unyielding. As I realize my time is possibly ending, my loved ones filter through my mind. My mother’s smile. My father’s clapping hands. The sparkle in my lover’s eyes as they now pierce through me  looking for a sign of mercy. I try to focus on the moment but chaos surrounds me. Eagerly tracing the weekend’s events I try to fathom how WE ended up here. ""How did it come to this?"", I think as my hands shake. The choices we have made become clear to me. Time flees from us with each pounding beat of my heart. With my lover’s hands in my own, we stay steady as a figure lingers. Lights blind us once more and the world goes quiet. The figure speaks with an authoritative coolness. The rules. I’ve heard them over a dozen times, but this time they have a new meaning to me. I feel my lover squeeze my hands one last time. Everything is about to change. We never once looked away from one another. We hear the command. Our hands pound as if on beat with a concerto. We freeze as the world erupts around us. I don’t dare look away from my lover’s eyes. We relish the unknowing second before it all changes. A joined, single breath is all we have. We simultaneously look down as the victor is announced with a joyous presentation. My lover has chosen scissors, and I...I have chosen rock. ",daniegirl_12
[WP] Peter Pan is a serial killer who uses pixie dust to cause little children to jump off windows in the hopes of being able to fly.,1agapio1,"It was 7 am on a Sunday morning when he got the call.

He arrived at 7:30.  It was a cool day, with the clouds starting to part.  Neighbors were beginning to gather around the cop cars wondering what was going on.  He passed them all, showed his badge, and walked up the cobblestone steps.  Yellow tape was around the body.  The boy was young, too young.  The morning light began to bounce off the glitter on the boys shoulders and head.   A small pool of blood had formed.   The mother was crying hysterically in the doorway while an officer and her husband consoled her.

“He was found this morning by the mother.” A sheriff said.  He saluted with the brim of his hat, a smile and nod quickly turning into a frown.

“Luminescent glitter?”

“Yup.”

“Cuts in the corners of the walls to indicate a climbing kit?”

“Yup.”

“4 holes drilled in the roof for a suspension wire harness?”

“Yup.”

“AND NO ONE HEARD A DAMN THING!?”

Those jolly eyes immediately turned serious.  “Officer Mullins, keep your voice down.  We still don’t know how he is able to do it so quietly.”

“Well we need to find out damn fast, Sheriff Smee.  This is the 5th one in two weeks.  He sneaks up to the second floor and plays with the kid.  Gains their trust, sprinkles some dust on himself, “flies” with the harness, and the kid jumps out the window to join him.  We need to catch this….Peter Pan.  And fast, or we’re going to have public hysteria on our hands.”

The sheriff looks at the scene.  “We could call him.”

“No.”

“He’s got the men and the resources, hes the captain of the district.”

“No.  This is our district.  We handle it.”

“Mullins I think we are in over our heads.”

“No.”

“But…”

“I SAID NO!  He hasn’t been right since the boating accident in Florida.”

“We’re out of options Mullins.  We need help, and we need to find this psycho.  Are you really going to let your pride get in the way of saving these children!?”

He let out a deep sigh.  “Fine Smee…..make the call.”

“Call Captain Hook.”",rebmonk

[WP] Peter Pan is a serial killer who uses pixie dust to cause little children to jump off windows in the hopes of being able to fly.,1agapio1,"Constructive Criticism Incoming: Was not a fan of the response here, it wasn't terrible or anything it just wasn't my cup of tea. Let's get into the points I want to cover..

The dialogue was going great until you got to ""Officer Mullins, keep your voice down"" which was bad enough (people don't talk like that in real life. In the movies or when doing stand up possibly but not in real life) and then to make matters worse you followed up with ""Well we need to find out damn fast, Sherrif Smee"".

Again, people don't address one another that formally so frequently.

Spelling errors. I'm not a grammar Nazi or an English teacher but when I read something, anything, published for the public to view I expect there to be almost perfect spelling. Grammar can slide (I have trouble with that myself) but like 'hes' when there should be an apostrophe between the e and s.. things like that can ruin it for me.

On the other hand I get the vibe that this isn't meant to be a literary classic or something epic. Just a cool fun story for light reading, which is fine by all means.

I thought there were too many ""Yups"", it sounded a bit robotic but I wouldn't stress out too much over that.

This isn't a fault in your writing but it would've added to the, 'value' I would have got from reading it: Where you say morning, if you would've put mourning (in that context) it would've been really cool to see.

On a scale from 1-10. 1 being a nightmare that I regret reading and 10 being Shakespeare or some masterpiece that will go down in history.

My score: 5.5

His mom manhandles his Dad off him and throws him out the room. Then she spends the next few minutes soothing him until he's well enough to tell her about the dream.

""No, no, little one. I'm Peter Pan, come to see if you are good enough to join the Lost Boys and I in Neverland.""


I already know he'll jump. They all jump. 


*Just like her.*


I can't find a moment of freedom from her. She's a scourge upon my thoughts; a fire in my veins. The only relief is watching the light leave their little eyes when the truth sinks in, that visceral realization that they are not flying at all. 


""What's Peter Pan? Are you like the Sandman? Will you bring me good dreams?""


He can't be more than six, his droopy eyes full of wonder as he sizes me up in his closet doorway. 


""I am not at all like the Sandman, little one. I am from a world far from your own, a world called Neverland. There, children are free to run and play and fight whenever they'd like to, eating whatever they want to, staying up all night if they'd like. I am the gatekeeper to this world, and the King of it all. I choose who may come to my world, and I am here to see if you would like to join us.""


His eyes widen, and he rubs a line of drying drool from the corner of his mouth with his filthy shirtsleeve. The house is ancient, and visually seems to crumble at the edges. The room reeks of spoiled milk and tobacco. 


""Are there...are there baby sisters in Neverland?""


My stomach tightens, and I step closer to his bedside, my face illuminated by the moon. I work my expression into that of amusement, though this question has knocked the wind out of me. 


""Neverland has only young boys like yourself. There are no girls allowed in Neverland.""


I can still see her holding him, his rosy cheeks covered in bright lines of tears as she rocked him and sang softly. Only she could calm him, I was simply not cut out for fatherhood. At first, it amused her how little he took to me. But as the days dragged on, she grew cold: not only to me, but to him as well. 


""Will I be able to come home and see my Mom?""


I am prepared for this question. 


""No, little one. You'll never see your Mother again. But you will have your new brothers, and you will have me. I will protect you, feed you, and I promise you adventure every single moment for the rest of eternity. That is what it means to be a Lost Boy.""


He climbs out of bed slowly, approaching me. 


""Are you their Dad? The Lost Boys?""


""No, child. I am their friend and King. There are no fathers in Neverland either.""


He ponders, looking up at me. My face is boyish and soft. I am of below average height, with a thin build. Dressed as a child, he cannot distinguish me from a young man. 


""I want to go with you, but I'm scared.""


Another thing I'm all too prepared to hear. 


*Was she scared,* I wonder to myself.


I must drive out the thoughts of her. They infect the very air I breathe, until I am left gasping in agony. Still, I see her. Silhouetted in the window, her eyes fixed on the stars as she stepped, so surely, into the blackness...


""Will it help if I hold your hand the whole way there?"" 


My voice is tender, as I bend down and lock eyes with the child. He smiles warmly.


""I have a little sister now, and I hate her. She eats up all the food and she cries all the time. I want to go away and never come back.""


""Then let us be on our way, child.""


He takes my hand, and we step quickly to the window. It is still open from my original entrance, the air still and stagnant. 


The boy looks up at me, confused.


""I can't climb down, it's too far. Does that mean I can't come?""


""Child, we will not climb to Neverland. We will *fly*!""


I breathe excitement into the word, smiling like a fool, gripping his hand tightly. 


His reaction is that of so many before him. He furrows his brow, and then immediately smiles in joy, his mouth bursting open as if to silently shout in delight. 


Outside, it begins to mist rain, and my face is met by the cool water as I tug the curtains aside. I recoil, sickened by the feeling.


""What's wrong Peter?"" His face is lost. He does not yet believe.


""The water reminds me of my arch enemy, Captain Hook! We go on many adventures to fight him and his dastardly crew back in Neverland. Don't worry, my new friend. We are ready to fly.""


I'm an excellent liar. The water does frighten me, but only because of what she'd done. What's she'd done to him, because I could not hold him. Because I could not make him stop crying. She was not sleeping, she'd had no rest in days. She had only wanted to calm him down, let him rest in the cool water. It had all been my doing. 


""If you want to fly with me to Neverland, there are only two things you need,"" I whisper, regaining my composure, shoving the image of his tiny, still corpse from my mind. ""You must first think of the happiest, most wondrous things you can imagine. Go on, try that.""


He closes his little eyes and intensifies his expression, as if every ounce of him is thinking. His little fists are balled up in tense joy, and his mouth curls up slowly into a smile. 


""Wonderful, wonderful job my friend. Keep your eyes shut tight, you understand?""


""Yes,"" he shrieks quietly in delight. 


""Have the thoughts completely filled you up?""


He nods his tiny head.


""Alright, open your eyes.""


In my outstretched hand, he sees a glowing powder, and his expression dances.


""What is it?"" 


""This is pixie dust, my friend. It is the second thing you need to fly.""


He believes this lie just as easily, leaning close to my palm to inspect the magical dust. In truth, it's the seeds of the Morning Glory, ground into dust and coated with the magical paint of the firefly. It has never once failed me.


I hold out a pinch, and I place it in my mouth. I then sprinkle another pinch on top of my head. He watches in amazement, comforted my the fact that I have gone first. When I put my hand out to him, I know this is his last chance to resist me. But so far, none have.


He pinches out some dust, consumes it, and I sprinkle a pinch atop his head. He is nearly ready to meet the sky.


""Now, I want you to think again of all the joyous things in the world. Feel the dust begin to lift you up, making you light as a feather right where you stand.""


The hallucinogenic properties of the seeds are beginning to kick in - he is swaying side to side, and when he looks up at me, his pupils have dilated into enormous black discs. 


""I...I f-feel it, Peter,"" he manages, his mouth in an unnatural smile. He takes my outstretched hand as I guide him up to the window sill. 


He is ready to fly.


I see her, against my will, stepping from our own sill and sinking into the dark, the guilt or perhaps just her sickness, ripping her from me. She had said nothing, left me with no parting affection to hold on to. And in that lonely hour, I felt rage for the first time in my short life. I knew true pain. I could not give her a child that she could love, one that could make her whole. It hurt her so that I had failed that she decided to depart not only from me, but from this world entirely. And I would not fail her again, even if I had to give her every child in this world, every little boy on this planet would be hers until I knew she was satisfied. And her aching voice called to me through the night, I could hear it even now, asking for one more. One more sacrifice.


The boy looked at me, his body beginning to crumple from the heavy influence of the drugs. 


""Are you ready to fly?"" 


""Yes, yes. Let me fly.""


He stepped from the ledge gingerly at first, gripping the frame of his window. And then, all at once, he let go. 


And there he went, into the night sky, as I leaned out the window to watch his soul escape his body to meet her in heaven. His large, vacant eyes became hollow, and his mouth parted to scream just as his small, fragile body met the sturdy and immovable earth.

[WP] Peter Pan is a serial killer who uses pixie dust to cause little children to jump off windows in the hopes of being able to fly.,1agapio1,"""Peter you don't have to do this again! Stay home with me and watch the episode of Homeland with me!"" 

""You know I think Homeland is just over sensationalized garbage written by the Right to get us to buy into their Islamophobic rhetoric,"" i said as I took a long pull from the half-empty liter of Captain Morgan I stole from the liquor store last night.

""Please Petey,"" she pleaded with me. ""Just stay in for the night with me and I'll give you a back rub and we can smoke the last of the pot.""

As much as I did like getting a little high, my doc says it was only amplifying the ""schizophrenic"" voices in my head. 

""I'm leaving for the night Wendy,"" I said as I grabbed my green hat from the kitchen counter and threw the rest of the bottle of rum into a flask.

""God damnit Peter,"" Wendy said as she turned around and saw the mess I had made in the kitchen. ""at least throw away your hot pocket sleeves. They are piling up again and you know we can't afford Consuela anymore to clean up after you.

""Shut the fuck up Wendy, you know I've been looking all over for a new job, but there's no auto insurance companies hiring anymore since practically everyone has a autonomous vehicle these days.  Every rich 16 year old that used to pay the highest premiums now has a Tesla Model C."" I said as I screwed the cap on my flask and used the sleeve of my dark green old navy hoodie to wipe up the rum on the white countertop. ""They are laying off people nation wide.""

I grabbed my brown satchel and threw my green Eagles beenie on my unkept red mop of hair and bolted to the door.

""Don't you even think about messing with the Lost Boys again and getting into their sheninagnas,"" she said as I heard the bubbles percolate in the Illadelph. ""I saw a story on the news tonight again about the poor crazed 5th graders jumping from their balconies.

I slammed the door and called Nips once I adjusted the seat in Wendy's light blue Toyota Camry.

""Are we still on for tonight"" I asked as I backed out of the driveway and turned down the radio.

""Yeah we got a couple visits tonight,"" he said in a whisper. ""Do you have the stuff?""

I reached over to the passenger seat and checked to see if I had the last of the Hook's pixie dust in my satchel. 

""I got it. Send me the location and I'll be there shortly.""

I drove around the block a couple times until I got a text from Nips with the location. I copied it into google maps and was on my way.  Driving around at night without Wendy usually gives me anxiety but tonight was really bad.  I couldn't stop thinking that someone was following me.  Every couple of seconds I was checking the rear view mirror to see if I was being followed.  I swear a red pickup truck was trailing me at every turn and I couldn't seem to shake him.  Up until the last left turn down the street the boy lived at the truck was just 100 feet behind me.  My heart ceased to pound as hard once I saw the large white Dodge Caravan at the end of the cul-de-sac and didn't see any one behind me. 

I parked behind the van, wiped the sweat from my bros with my sleave, and looked at myself in the rear view mirror to make sure I didn't look as drunk and sleep deprived as I was.  I walked up the side door of the van, grabbed the handle and slid the door to the right.  The door slowly opened and I saw all of the boys in their usual seats.  There was Tootles in the driver's seat, Slightly in the passenger seat, and the twins in the far smiling with bloodshot eyes, and then Nibs and Curly sitting up straight in the captain seats.

Curly appeared on edge, he glanced up for a second to look at me and then went back to counting the money he had in a brown paper bag.  His mop of blonde hair  reflected the moonlight and produced a weird looking shadow on the top of the car.  Nibs looked directly at me with a large Ziploc bag full of dark green shake in his hand and said, ""Do you have the dust?""

""Yes I told you I did,"" I snapped back at him.  I wanted to get this over with as soon as possible. ""Do you want me to do the usual? What room is his bedroom and are you SURE he is asleep""

""We saw the lights go off in his room an hour ago.  The coast is clear, just fly up to the windowsill and prop it open and give him the usual spiel. We watched Peter Pan with him earlier so he'll totally believe the whole pixie dust makes you fly thing.""

""Alright.  I am just getting a little worried that we are gonna get caught guys. Wendy saw on the news that there are people investigating this matter and looking for us. I don't want to go to jail, I've spent one night there and it blows.""

""Look Peter, the kid owes us hundreds of dollars and he has refused to pay us for 2 months.  He may be our friend but he really has fucked us.  We can't keep messing around if we want to be taken seriously as drug dealers.""

""Okay fine.  I'll sprinkle some dust on him and tell him to fly with me like usual.  I'll hold his hand and jump off the windowsill and as soon as he falls to his death you all need to get off your ass and clean up the mess on the driveway."" I glanced back at the stoned as fuck twins in the back.  ""I'm looking at you two.""

They laughed and slapped high fives.

I swiped the bag of kush out of Nibs' hand.  Ever since I got fired, I had to resort to tricking kids into thinking they could fly to help the Lost Boys hold their dealers accountable.  I jumped high into the air and whooooshed up to the windowsill on the front side of the house.  I almost crashed into the wall on the account that I was borderline black out but I could almost fly better than I could drive at this point.  It was almost my 41st birthday so I'm kind of an expert at this point.  I flung open the window and gently floated down to the carpet.  I turned around to slowly close the window behind me. 

I tiptoed over to the queen size bed, dodging a windy plastic racecar track and tiny metal toy cars that were flung over all over the room.  All over the walls were pictures of famous NASCAR drivers.  I really didn't agree with the Lost Boys' policy of selling to minors but I didn't really try to dissuade them.  I tiptoed over to the queen size bed, flung back the covers, and saw a old man with a hook lying there with a M-16 pointed straight at my face.

""Got you now Peter,"" he said as he pulled the trigger.  ",woahdudethisistite

This is the fifth child in two months, and it's starting to get hard to be objective staring at the bodies of young kids, mutilated from their falls from high rise apartments.

My anxiety turns to sadness as I come into view of this new boy's face - well, what's left of it, that is.

""Captain! Over here, quick!"" Detective Smee waves me over to the body.

I pull my captains hat down to block the streetlights from illuminating my face. I can't let my subordinates see that this affects me. 
""What is it, Smee?"" I shout, as I march hastily toward the group of CSI agents examinating the boy. Everyone looks up nervously. I must have sounded more irritated than I meant to.
Good.

16 hour days in this case, for weeks, and we don't have so much as a fingerprint. Just a collection of business cards with the word ""Pan"" in Times New Roman. I'm guessing he wants to make a name for himself. I refuse to let this lunatic become successful in his search for infamous glory.

News reports and social media are trying to call this a ""suicide trend"". Without a lead on the case, I can't correct them.

I lean over to see Smee pulling something out of the boys hand, with tweasers. 
""What is it?"" My tone softens.

""It apears to be... a feather. A red feather."" He slips it into an evidence bag and hands it to me. I hold it up, and even in this poorly lit street, I can make out that it's a very real red feather. Peculiar.

""Send this to forensics, immediately."" I hand the bag to Smee.
""Yes Captain Hook!""
Smee complies and scurries off.
For aging old man, he's as sharp and obediant as ever.

My eyes scale up the building to see police on a balcony on the forth floor. My ears finally tune in to the wails of another mother crying in agony as she accepts the loss of her child. Always the mother, never the father. I fight back tears.

I take one last look at the deceased. I scan the gathering crowd of shocked faces. I look up at the moon. It's a cold night.

You think he'd be used to it by now; the searing hatred in their voices. A sudden commanding uproar in their tone, or a fist hitting something hard. But he wasn't. In fact, the only thing he could feel hearing his parents fight were two halves of himself being ripped down the seam. He so desperately longed for love in his home. He wondered how many times the neighbors heard their rage echoing through the English neighborhood of townhouses. Each of their wars seemed to multiply th-

He heard glass shatter. What had just happened. 

""You know what happened."" A low voice within him bellowed. 
""What has transpired, has been a long time coming. Go and see, you are ready."" His ears rang. Peter felt dazed, yet compelled. He had to investigate. Slowly, he collected himself in the moonlight shining into his dark bedroom. He inched towards his door, and slowly turned the handle. On the platform overlooking his foyer, Peter's mother lay. He could instantly detect the iron smell of blood. He went to his mother's corpse, her throat had been slashed. Here, his parents war was had concluded. He felt a breeze from the corridor leading past his bedroom. A shattered window waited, glowing a twilight blue, like a divine executioner waiting to set fate into motion. Peter approached the window, and looked upon who was once his other half, now a lifeless object. His father lie under an orange streetlight 3 stories down; he too in a crimson pool. An image flashed in his head, a summer day he had shared with his parents a few years back. All he could see were their smiles. His father's protective gaze; his mother's loving surrender. He felt like his time with his parents had just begun. Why. Why did it have to be this way? What went wrong? 

""In his study."" The voice bellowed in the walls of his mind. ""Do you remember your mother mentioning his time spent there? Go now."" 

Peter slammed through the heavy oak door, with one hope: truth. He tore recklessly through his fathers room, throwing books from walls, papers from drawers 

*CRASH* 

An urn shattered on the ground. In a pile of ceramic shards and ash, lay a small box. Peter opened it to find a white powder. ""This?"" he thought ""This is what transformed my father into a monster?!"" ""At all costs, |flash forward 5 years, Peter is now 13| this is what you want to avoid."" He said to the boy. ""You fly too low"" *he stuck a toothpick through an olive* ""You're skewered."" ""Ooo oo! Mr. Pan, you must tell me, what's the most beautiful place to fly at this time?"" Again an image flashed, his parents sitting on a bench on a warm evening, watching boats pass down the river. ""Along the river, I'd say."" as he put the olive in his mouth. ""You about ready, Joseph?"" 
""Definitely!!"" Joseph exclaimed
""Okay. It's nothing difficult. Just like breathing through one nostril, you want to suck all the powder in, like an elephant collecting water.""

He quickly inhaled a line of the drugs. Almost immediately, he began jogging towards the window. ""WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO"" Joe howled. Peter grinned. This job had been quite easy for him. He opened the boys dresser to take a trophy. He chose a shoe. ""Another lost boy."" he thought with indifference as he stepped onto the rooftop into darkness.

He looked to the rear view mirror, and noticed that the driver was eyeing him cautiously.

""You know why they call me Hook, son?"" asked the Captain. He had been in the service for 21 years, and no one questioned his authority. He needed to keep up with his charade, so he enjoyed toying with his men.

""N-no, sir. I mean, yes, sir. T-They say your - hand,"" the driver swallowed, ""-was... cut off.""

""Aye! Bitten off by a beast of monstrous size, deep in the waters of the Floridian Keys. That's what you get for playing with fate, boy. One hand - gone."" Hook grinned, and pulled his right sleeve back with his left hand. Where a hand should have been, there was a sharpened, glistening metal hook. The driver shrunk back, scared out of his mind, into his seat and focused on the road ahead. It had started to rain.

As they arrived, Hook leapt out and hurried to the scene of the crime. He didn't want the rain to damage the scene any further than these nitwits already had. He surveyed the area. The rain, as he had correctly guessed, had washed away all the blood. He called out.

""Smee! Bring me my hat! It's too damn cold and wet out here.""

The detective bustled over, and pulled a large, ostentatious pilgrim-like hat. Hook snatched it from Smee's hands and planted it firmly upon his hairy scalp.

""Report, Smee.""

As the detective spilled out details of the heinous crime, Hook noticed a figure out of the corner of his eye. Surreptitiously peering closer at it, he realized what he was look at. A silhouetted man, dressed up all in green, crouching behind the chimney of the house next door. Hook grinned. He had found his lead.",Maninahouse

""yeah, will you read me a bed time story"" asks little Timmy just as cute as he can.
""of course"" says the sixteen-year-old clueless babysitter as she gets up, finally setting down her phone. After reading Tim a book about a fairy taking children to a land where they won't ever grow old he's out like a mommy after a few glasses of wine.
A loud pounding pulls Randa from her phone, looking through the door she spy's Timmy's mother wobbling, her make-up is disheveled, a mere ghost of the beauty that left here just a few hours prior. Opening the door emits a stench similar to that of a bar floor, or that's what Randa would think had she been of age.

""oh you know, he's been a sweaty as always. I read him 12 pages of Peter Pan and he passed right out"" Randa gleamed.
""Well thank y-hic- you hon. take $50 from my purse and lock -hic- the door on your way out"" 
""thanks Mrs' S"" spouts Randa before quickly making her leave. The walk home is chilly and she leaves without grabbing her coat, forgetting to lock the door. 
Kelly wakes up at 11:22A.M, a pounding head she goes straight for a glass of water muttering about how she'll never drink again though she will tonight. Looking at the clock she decides to check on her son, opening the door she feels her heart drop through the floor, his bed is empty, the room seams to have had a storm pass through. Making her way carefully over the toys and broken T.V she finds the window's still locked, how can this be? She had gotten back and passed out.. 
""The front"" she exclaims frantically running to the door, it's ajar, pushing passed she sees the window in the stairwell gaping, a harsh breeze pushing into the complex. ""oh no"" she mumbles as she cautiously makes her way to the window, taking a deep breath before forcing her head out the window.

Without getting too deep since we're in /r/WritingPrompts... Even among Christians, Jesus' persona can be diluted. For example, many Christians think Jesus advocated blanket forgiveness. This is incorrect. He advocated for quick forgiveness to those who ask for it - as salvation works. Some think Jesus was 100% a pacifist, yet told disciples to buy swords. People often use Jesus as an example for giving to social programs, but that's only half true and for different reasons. He taught to give freely, nothing about forcing a tax upon people. But, at the same time, he does say to give to the government (Caesar) what is owed.

I think there's a lot of secular (and obviously spiritual) knowledge to be gained from learning about him. Even if you disregard all the spiritual aspects, there's a lot of social takeaways. He was just such a pragmatic person.",PM_ME_OR_PM_ME

Brad said unto the lord, ""Coors is for women bro, I told you to pick up an 18 of miller light.""

Before Jesus bespoke another word, Brad replied, ""Ye?!?!... J.C. my dude, I did not know you liked yeezus, you know he's got a new album coming out?""

Jesus said, ""I know all things through the father and can tell you that this college dropout posing as messiah is nothing but an impostor.""

Brad said, ""but have you heard the music yet, the beats are--"" 
Jesus cut Brad off, ""yes Brad, I listened to the album and the lyrics were redundant, and beats were garbage. ""

Brad asked Jesus, ""deadass?""

and he replied, ""yes my lamb, deadass.""

Brad said,""Savior, what shall I listen to if not the rap prophet himself?""

Jesus chuckled, ""let me show you the way""

And from there they went to Galilee to purchase a new copy of Chance the Rapper's Coloring Book, as well as a couple of dope over the ear headphones meant for extended hours of continuous use so they could hear the album in its glorious entirety without hurting their earholes.

Brad saw what the Lord had allowed Chance to make, and to behold, and it was very good. 

And on that day Christ and Brad rested, taking in god's herbs and his fruits to enhance their listening experience. And it was good, so good they listened to the album a second time.

The wolf, a young one, not more than half a year old, growled at me, only occasionally stopping to worry at her paw. 

""Easy girl,"" I say, preparing my tranq gun. ""Look, I'm going to have to shoot you, but it won't hurt long. When you wake up, you'll feel better, and your paw will be better. I'm so sorry you got caught babe,"" I say as I sight on the wolf and press the trigger. She looks around, bewildered at the pin-prick of pain, but then I see her eyes go glassy and unfocused. Her breathing slows, and I gently scoop her up. Good thing I'm not far from my station, or town as for that matter. As I had her over to the wildlife vet, the wolf opens her eyes slightly, and finds me. She looks at me, as if to memorize me, and I see her nostrils flaring as she memorizes my scent. ""Maybe we'll see each other around,"" I whisper to the wolf, ""but remember, I'm your friend."" Her eyes close, and she surrenders to the anesthetic.


6 years later.

""Just be careful 'Chelle'. I know you know all about the wilderness, but I worry about you.""

I smile warmly at my roommate. ""Yes ma'am',"" I say, sarcastically saluting.

""Go. Just go"", she says as she rolls her eyes at me. I laugh, and head out to my jeep.


I start hiking a path that I've not used in years, not since the wolf pup, and I wonder, DOES she remember me? Or am I some distant memory? I am caught up wondering about her, and fail to see the mama bear and her cub. There are no trees for me to climb, and so here I stand with my arms out, trying to make myself look bigger than my 120 lbs, and I don't think the bear is buying it. Truth be, I wouldn't either. Shit...! Then I hear a brief howl, followed by another, and yet a third wolf joins in. I see a gray shape slinking toward me and think, ""Great, pissed off a bear, and now these wolves want a piece of the action. FML!! But then I see the wolves are not stalking me, they appear to be working as a team to chase off the mama and her cub. I am amazed, and can only stand there, staring with my mouth open.  The bear gets the message, and she and her cub take off. The biggest of the females looks at me, and she looks vaguely familiar. When she lifts a paw and I see the missing fur and the surgical scar, I know which wolf this is. She approaches me somewhat cautiously, and sits almost within arms reach. ""Thank you. I...I didn't know you'd remember me. I wondered if you were ok...do you have pups yet?"" As if answering my question, she rolled over so I could see her teats. ""Yes you do. I'm sure you're a good mamma too. I'll always be your friend, I owe you my life."" She dipped her head, and seemed to wink, as if to say ""I know, and I owe you mine."" She yelped, and four pups tumbled around as they ran to her. ""Your family is lovely. Perhaps one day I'll have my own"", I say, as I smile.",MsSmileyFace
"[WP] They live forever in a endless cycle of self destruction and rebirth, Humans are the only known species to come back after extinction. Although it appears the cycle has been broken.",BulbStar,"As you all know, we have watched many come and go.

There have been a few civilizations that have conquered biological pressures, and achieved complete peace on their world; living in harmony until the heat death of the universe. There have been some civilizations that exceeded our wildest expectations and breached into the fabric of their reality, transcending third dimensional existence. Not many, but some. Most simply evolve from the primordial stew, and live until natural pressures drive them to extinction or they wipe themselves out by overburdening their environment. In countless cycles of entropy and rebirth we have seen every imaginable class of intelligent empire, but one stands as completely unique. This is because we have seen them many times. The Humans always come back. They have evolved from warm blooded animals, insects, fish, and classifications of creature that would mean nothing here. But they are always the same. They are creatures of art, and they show a capacity for abstract thought to rival the gods. They can be compassionate and brutal to ridiculous extreme in a single being. They are the only species to wipe themselves out through unadulterated insanity. Every single time. We have seen them millions of times, and only twice did they fail to describe the fundamental workings of the universe with a system of characters before their extinction. No other species has ever tried the to do this, except where necessary for projects like space flight or dimensional lensing. Humans pursue knowledge for the joy of learning, which is why they have conquered the stars despite the fact that they come and go so quickly. They have a lifespan 1/10th that of any other spacefaring species; they are only able to progress because they dedicate their entire lives to projects that won't come to fruition until long after their children are dead and gone. They have entire institutions dedicated to theorizing about things they won't understand for 10,000 of their cycles. The tragedy of the humans, is the that their brilliance and dedication is their downfall. They are deeply tribal wherever they spring up, and fiercely competitive. Usually, they have a rough patch when they reach globalism that continues for about 3,000 cycles until they scorch their world with radiation and learn their lesson. The real problems come later. When they begin to colonize other systems, they learn that hospitable worlds are hard to come by, and they are faced with over population and resource depletion. This is when they start to slaughter each other en mass. One group will blame another for all of their problems, and they will drive each other into oblivion. Every single time. We watch with pity as they repeat their bleak cycle.

Until now.

One incarnation of humanity has managed to conquer their entire home galaxy, and are rapidly spreading throughout the greater cosmic cluster. They must be stopped. We have seen in these creatures, a capacity for madness unparalleled. They have mental illnesses that don't have a comparison in any other species. They have been known to take sexual pleasure from the mental and physical trauma of their own. We must not allow them to dominate their universe and join the council of transcendent beings, lest their insanity consume us all. This is why, for the first time since the beginning, the æææ vote to break the Imperative of Non-Interference and neutralize the humans.",the_real_demosthenes
"[WP] As you scroll through the new prompts, you notice that they're all shockingly normal. No twists, no floating number, just mundane.",Frothers,"They're all so...boring. Perhaps dangerously boring.

That was his first thought. He parsed the page again, desperately seeking some hidden meaning in the prompts before him, something that would douse his mind with a blaze of creativity and effort for the keys and the page before him. 

But his keys sat, unmoved. The page was blank. The mouse getting work in, however, with clicking and scrolling as he searched for a new source of inspiration. He threw up his hands and declared to his computer screen, ""I'm done.""

Then he went right back to scrolling. The alternative was not to his liking, not yet at least.

Eventually his outlook on the page changed somewhat. He decided that these mundane prompts, these ""how was your day,"" ""describe a farm,"" and ""write an essay on Frederick the Great at least 500 words"" were not speedbumps in his creative process. No, he thought, these were *challenges.* 

Were the greatest works not fashioned from the most mundane of figures and models? Was it not Ernest Hemingway who was famously challenged to tell a story in under ten words? 

Upon searching snopes, however, he discovered that Ernest Hemingway was not, in fact, the definite source for the famous ""baby shoes"" story. That did not deter his determination and energy, however, because *someone* must have written a great work with less material. That was what he told himself. 

He felt a tug on his shoulder, but he was alone. He felt a force press against his neck, but again, he was alone. These were things in his mind, he thought, but they were things that distracted him constantly when he could not express them in writing. In the corner of the room hung a length of rope, fashioned into a noose the last time he had gone without writing. 

It was the noose that he turned his head to glance at. He didn't think anything of it, except that this might finally be the night that he ended his life. He shook his head, though with such reluctance that a bystander would have felt very concerned for what he would do next. He stood from his chair and walked to it, the only light in the room coming from his laptop screen. 

He pulled the noose over his neck. He relished the feel of the rope around his neck, and imagined it pulling him down and away from the world. That, he decided, would be a story worth writing about. And then...

""[WP] How was your day?""

This was the prompt he selected, because this was the one that he needed more than any other.

Carter was a reasonable man who lead a reasonable life. He had a reasonable job working at the prestigious Royal Perdumdelthazar Hotel as a bellhop, where he made a reasonable living. He did find it rather boring transporting luggage and the like from one floor to another, but he was a rather boring individual, and being a bellhop was a lot safer than being a policeman like his uncle, or a used sofa saleswoman, like his mother.

-
Five hours and fifteen minutes ago, Carter woke up to find himself more naked than usual. This was odd, considering he usually slept in his pink polka dotted purple onesie, and could remember doing so last night. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, got up from his cot (which smelled stronger than he’d remembered), and stepped out onto the cold concrete floor with his bare feet. Now Carter was never the brightest bulb in the box, especially not after the tragic sofa accident in his childhood that had left him permanently mentally impaired, but even he suspected something was very wrong. First of all, he never slept naked- his mother’s house had no heating, and he was sure to freeze to death in the night if he did so. Secondly, he was certain that there was no concrete flooring present anywhere in the house, as his mother had a fatal concrete allergy. And finally, most importantly, Carter couldn’t recall ever seeing the gigantic red sun looming in the east from his mother’s living room before.

-
Not just anyone could work at the prestigious Royal Perdumdelthazar Hotel. They were as selective as they were hard to spell. Fortunately for Carter however, he had the luck to be related to his uncle, Sir Lunchbox, a mighty and respected policeman. Almost everyone had heard of the legendary battle between Sir Lunchbox and the fearsome Dragon of the East, a hulking eight-foot-tall juggernaut of rippling muscle and moustache. They say the Dragon fell that night, downed from a single bullet to the forehead; his uncle was last seen soon after, riding his Segway into the night. The Royal Perdumdelthazar Hotel wouldn’t dare turn away the blood of such a prominent figure, and Carter was employed as bellhop with little resistance.

-
Four hours and twenty-five minutes ago, Carter had exhausted the small open aired cell that held him. He’d gathered that he’d been transported to a zoo of some kind that, bizarrely enough, seemed to be on a different planet. All around his modest enclosure were dozens of other, similar cages, each holding otherworldly creatures. Each cage was separated from the other by a lattice of roads, and on each road patrolled creatures that strongly resembled his mother’s living room lamp. These creatures meandered slowly between the exhibits, each gawking in turn at the marvels held within. Carter watched as a large group of these creatures led by another walked toward and stopped at his cage. The one in front cleared its throat and, facing the crowd, spoke in perfect English,
	
“So we see in here the endangered Terran Sofa. These docile creatures are best known for the myriad of different colours they could take on, from plaid to polka dotted. The one you see here has recently shed its pink polka dotted purple skin, and is in the process of growing a new one.”
	
“Um, excuse me, sir?” Interjected Carter, “I’m not sure where I am, but I think there’s been a misunderstanding. I have to get to work soon and I’m probably horribly late already so…”
	
“Ah, the call of the Terran Sofa. It’s known to sound remarkably similar to our own Inglish language, but it’s completely coincidental. I’m sure this little guy’s just hungry for breakfast.”
	
“Well, yes, I’d love some breakfast. But could you let me out soon? See, I work at the very prestigious Royal Perdumdelthazar Hotel, I’m sure you’ve heard of it, and they don’t tolerate lateness at all.”
	
“Alright guys, let’s move onto the next exhibit! This guy’s a cat from…”
	
The tour group moved away from Carter’s exhibit, and he began to feel the pangs of anxiety already. He can’t be late for work! He has to do something about this immediately!
	
-
Sir Lunchbox was never heard from again after that fateful evening, even though the people of Terra searched far and wide. While most had speculated the valiant police officer had gone with purpose into the night to fight crime from the shadows, what really happened was far stranger. After his failed attempt to arrest the Dragon for possession of a moustache, Sir Lunchbox rode off into the night. However, as he had difficulty seeing in the dark and even more difficulties controlling his Segway, he promptly fell into a ditch and knocked himself out. This was the moment Sir Lunchbox got abducted by aliens.

-
Carter slammed against the clear membrane dividing his cell from freedom, but it was no use. He was too weak to even dent it. Looking around, he saw larger and stronger creatures than he imprisoned in the same exhibits. It was clear he had no chance of opening it by himself. Defeated, he slumped back onto the smelly cot, the only furnishing in his bare cell. How could this have happened to him? He was such an excellent employee, such a reasonable person! Oh god, he found himself thinking, if you exist and you truly are kind, please let me get to work on time! 
	
God seemed to be listening apparently, because no sooner had he uttered his silent prayer, a hole opened up in the membrane and a lamp alien sauntered in, holding a bowl of what appeared to be kibble. The alien zookeeper, apparently expecting Carter to be both docile and a pink polka dotted purple sofa, had no fear of being mauled or eaten alive. Unfortunately, Carter was neither docile nor a pink polka dotted sofa, and fueled by fear and anxiety, mauled and ate the zookeeper alive. He had no idea why he had to eat the poor creature, but it seemed appropriate in the moment. It tasted a bit like Ikea. But never mind that, Carter was free! Now he just needed to find the exit, and get to work on time! Although it would be nice to find some clothes first.

[WP] I wish I was still afraid of the dark...,Kolaumer,"Matthew could still hear the screams. He could see the lights of billions of men and women bursting into existence and then being extinguished by the darkness, like fireflies on a summer night.

""Matt,"" A steady, soothing voice reached out to him across the void, ""Are you still with us?""

Suddenly he was slammed back into reality. Matt was no longer on that dark field, watching a black, viscous cloud slowly meander its way towards what everyone had thought was a safe place. Instead he was sitting on a sofa, in a small room that was illuminated by sunlight which streamed in through a single, square window.

""Yeah,"" he sighed, ""I'm here.""

The window was on Matthew's left, and as he peered out of it he saw the signs of life. A world in full bloom as the summer sun nourished the Earth with its life giving rays. It was a world that existed solely because of him, but looking at it only brought him dread. There was no happiness inside of him, no warmth, and no light.

Opposite the window, on Matthew's right, was a small one-way mirror. He wasn't sure why they went with a one way mirror instead of a window. He knew he was being watched 24/7, what was the point in being secretive?

""Did you try that exercise I suggested?"" Doctor Elinger asked Matthew.

""Yes."" Matthew replied.

""And?""

""It didn't work,"" Matthew answered, thinking this was obvious. If it had worked, would they be here?

""You couldn't think of one good thing?"" Doctor Elinger asked in disbelief, ""You looked at the entire world around you, and couldn't find even one good thing that made your sacrifice worthwhile? Not one thing in the world that made you happy that you saved it?""

Matthew sighed, ""No, I couldn't. I don't remember what happiness is, Doctor. I have all these memories where I'm smiling, or laughing, but they feel empty. Like I'm watching a movie with someone else in it. They're fogged up by the darkness. Each day I think of them less and less, and instead focus on what the darkness wants to show me.""

Doctor Elinger leaned forward in his chair. ""What do you mean by that? What does it want to show you?""

Matthew shivered. ""It wants to show me what the world was like. Before the fall of New York. Before it breached the wall. Before me.""

Doctor Elinger looked towards the one-way mirror, as if expecting some sort of cue.

""Matt,"" he said after a moment, ""That world is gone. Extinct. We live in a better world now, because of you.""

""I see murder,"" Matthew sat up in his chair, and pulled his knees to his chest, ""I see all these horrible things people did to each other. And each scene has me doing those horrible things to people. I know I didn't do it, but someone did.""

""Matt please calm-"" Doctor Elinger began.

""No!"" Matthew yelled as tears began to flow down his face, ""That world isn't gone, Doctor, it's inside of me. It wants out. It wants to return.""

Doctor Elinger's expression grew grave, ""Are you going to let it out Matt?""

""Am I horrible for wanting to?"" Matthew asked, his eyes pleading for someone to relieve him of the burden, ""Am I a bad person because I want to be free of this? Am I like the people I see in my head? Because I want to be happy again?""

""No,"" Doctor Elinger placed a comforting hand on Matthew's shoulder, ""You've been very strong. Many others would've broken by now. It's only natural to think like that.""

Matthew sighed, his crying had stopped and the emptiness had returned to his eyes. 

""I won't let it out,"" he said, ""The world is better this way.""

""The darkness wants to break you Matt,"" Doctor Elinger said, ""Don't let it frighten you. You own it now.""

""I wish I was still afraid of the dark,"" Matthew said, ""I'm too used to it. If it could still scare me, maybe that would mean I could still be happy.""

""We'll work on that,"" Doctor Elinger gave a reassuring smile that Matthew did not return, and Doctor Elinger wasn't sure if it was because he didn't want to, or didn't remember how to. ""Baby steps, Matt. We'll take it one day at a time, until we can find a way to make you and the world happy.""

""You promise?"" Matthew asked.

""I promise,"" Doctor Elinger replied.

[WP] I wish I was still afraid of the dark...,Kolaumer,"I wish I was still afraid of the dark but right now my biggest fear is that there will never be darkness again. It's been almost three years. Three years of broad daylight. We always thought it was impossible for the world to stop spinning. Thought that everything would either explode or implode long before it would even noticeably slow down. But it did stop, stopped rotating, stopped orbiting, stopped and no one even knows why so we'll probably never be able to start it again. I think my neighbours are cannibals. Daymares are so much more vivid when everyone else shares them.

[WP] I wish I was still afraid of the dark...,Kolaumer,"Well well well. Another person to tell my tale to. Let’s start off easy then, alright? The basics are simple. DO NOT BE ALONE IN THE DARK. Why not you wonder. Seems like you came from another world huh. Truthfully, this is only a theory. I might be completely wrong. 

Anyhow, when I was a little girl my parents and teachers taught me one important lesson, stay out of the dark and if you have to go into a dark place, then go with other people. I see you don’t understand by that expression on your face. Well! It is quite simple my friend. There is a monster in the darkness, ready to rip you to pieces. 

Interesting, seems like I can still cry. To continue, my story is as such. I was never afraid of the dark like the other children. Were they stayed as close to the light as they could I would wander off. Which freaked out everyone even more of course. 

But here we are. I was taking a walk in the forest, of course well lit. There was no worry on my mind for I might not have been afraid of the dark but I knew to stay away, and there were so many lamps. Even if the forest lamps failed, the city would still provide enough light to light it all up. 

One last thing I should tell you, I have bad luck. Which is quite apparent in the next part of my story. All the FREAKING lamps failed… While I was not afraid I was worried. If it was dark here it could mean only one thing, the city had gone dark too. And in the city everyone was afraid of the dark. 

I sat down on the bench I had seen just moments before the lights failed, relaxed. Humming I enjoyed my free time. It had been the first time I could actually be in the dark and it turned out I really liked it. The lights had always made my head hurt, and make me feel bad. But in the dark, oh, in the dark I could relax so well. Not a single annoyance. Until the rustle… 

Turns out that monster in the dark is quite real. It had a slight glow to it so I could see myself being ripped open. Which sucked to be honest but then again, here we are in the afterlife so maybe I am finally rid of the monster, or as my theory goes, the uncontrolled telekinetic powers the humans of my planet have which come out in the dark. 

But yeah, how I wish I was still, or could’ve been, afraid of the dark.

[WP] I wish I was still afraid of the dark...,Kolaumer,"When I was young, I feared three things: death, the dark and bad dreams. I did not pray like other children, for the lord to take my soul; I prayed for him to keep me safe, to keep my soul intact and to keep the nightmares at bay. It took many prayerful nights, but the nightmares finally subsided, my soul remained intact and the darkness never hurt me.



I’m grown now, if you can call it that. I haven’t dreamt in many years, and as of yet the darkness hasn't hurt me, although it’s tried. I’m not sure if my incessant prayers finally pissed god off, but once the nightmares died, the darkness came alive. Around age 15 I began to see things in the dark, in the darkness of my room, the unlit areas of a parking lot, in the heavy storms outside my windows. At first, itsimply moved, elegantly, dancing like the tide. As my eyes adjusted over the coming months, I was able to pick out figures in the ebb and flow of the dark. They were sexless, faceless wanderers. They drifted in the night, both a part of the dark and the essence of the dark itself. 



They would wander aimlessly in my room, weaving amongst one another in an aimless quest. They seemed unaware of one another, fluid in their absent meandering. During those first nights, I would squeeze my eyes tight and pray for safety from the dark. They never touched me.



Years later, I grew used to them in the night, and their absence during the day became unnerving. At 19 I took a dead end job working overnight at a grocery store. Being up during the night hours became comforting, the sight of the darkness a solace. However, it seemed my new nighttime routine helped me see the darkness clearer, the wanderers finally forming faces. Disfigured and downcast, they never looked ahead, only at the ground. 



It was during my first few months at the new job that I saw one of them stop wandering.



I was out front on my 2am smoke break, watching the wanderers, enjoying the ebb and flow of the night. I studied their faces, each as disfigured as the last, stretched and torn and gaping. But one stopped moving, like a smoky pillar in the blackness it turned and moved decisively, a movement that I had never seen from one of them before. It moved to the back of a silver Pontiac, illuminated by a red haze of brake lights and exhaust. The Pontiac’s lights went dark and the car door opened. The wanderer (who seemed to no longer be wandering) bolted to the driver’s side, the wanderer’s gaping mouth stretched wide and enveloped the driver, devouring him from the head down. The driver, swallowed up by darkness fell back against the car. Clutching his chest in shadowy haze he collapsed back into the open driver’s side door.



I chucked my cigarette to the pavement and instinctively moved toward the man. Distracted by this man’s groans and shocked over what I had just witnessed, I didn’t notice the darkness turning to look at me. 



The wanderers stopped wandering. 



Like a wave, they moved as one, rushing at me, enveloping me. They wailed and screamed, voices like hatred. They swirled, the nearby store lights light disappearing until there was only blackness and wailing. And then all went quiet.



I awoke in the back of an ambulance, eyes tearing at the bright lights. There was nothing wrong with me, they said I just feinted. The other gentleman, however, they said died of a heart attack before they arrived.



It’s been many years since that night, and the older I get the clearer the wanderers become. I know what they are now, and I know what they do. I know they can’t hurt me, and I’ve come to discover I cannot stop them.



I still work the same dead end job. I’ve never been able to bring myself to join the daylight world, the light is just too bright. Although sometimes I wish that I could dream again, even if they are nightmares. And I wish so much that I had never seen the darkness for what it is.

[WP] I wish I was still afraid of the dark...,Kolaumer,"Life was so simple as a child.. Sitting around playing with legos, watching cartoons, riding bikes all over and when the night came, there would be a level of anxiety and anticipation that would well up inside as the night conquered the day.

I remember being so afraid of the shadows.

I miss it.

There is something simple about being afraid of the dark isn't there? No matter what you think you know is and isn't dwelling beyond the dim ambient light cast by your faithful nightlight, your mind lies as the shadows close in all around you. The monsters were always in the shadows, just outside reach of the light, and no matter how many times you turned your lights on, you could never catch them. Always in the shadows.

I miss the night..

I miss being afraid of the dark.

My fears still revolve around the night but these days it's not what happens when my eyes are open, but when they're closed. My fears have eroded away leaving something much more terrifying than the shadows. Nightmares now consume my nights and I fight to stay awake as late as possible to welcome the dark as an old friend, no longer afraid of the shadows of night. I'm now terrified of what happens when I close my eyes.

The world can be a beautiful place but when your mind has been shattered by the weight of war, dreams are much more terrifying than anything one could possibly face in the dark.

I wish my nights still centered around the fear of the dark.. I long for the simplicity of being a child and crying out for my mother to come save me from the monster in the shadows. I miss the warmth she would provide and instead am faced with the cold reality that no one is here to save me anymore. I cry alone in the night, asking for anyone to help but no one comes.

I am alone.

Starting the moment I close my eyes, I know I will die. Some nights I try and fight my demons and every now and then I'll even be tricked into thinking I've conquered the evil that dwells within the depths of my mind but it's never truth. The truth is always far worse than my imagination can allow and no matter what I try, I know I will die, every single night.

I've been told these dreams have meaning, and the interpretation of these dreams and resolution of the conflict that exists within my day will lead to a resolution of the conflict that dominates my night but life isn't that simple. Resolving the day requires facing demons which are insurmountable, even for a man who has died a thousand times.

Sometimes I wonder if my nightmares are my reality, and that my days are actually just dreams in which I'm lost in the fantasy of a better, simpler life, one in which I'm not a dreaming of being a hero, or a father, or a husband. The sweet dreams which my days revolve around make me yearn for the life that I'll likely never have... the simple life when I was just a child afraid of the dark.

I miss the days where I was afraid of the dark for it's no longer the dark I fear, but what happens when I close my eyes.",reasonandmadness

His feet traveled through the burning swamps where he was trained, across scortching deserts in North Africa, and to the beaches of Normandy. His hands had scaled cliff faces in Italy, and froze as they dug trenches in the Ardennes. His eyes had seen the beauty of European Cities, and the raw unadulterated horror of the Camps.

All of that life, a life that was both boundless and confined to a rucksack, were behind him now. His well trodden feet rested on the bed. His worked and calloused hands supported a head full of memories and empty of worries.

Some day soon, he would mourn the people who did not come back. His dreams, even in the best of times, would be forever haunted by the fires and hardship of his time. However, that would all happen later.

"[WP] When I finally breathe my last, I will no more regret my past.",Merkk539,"In this vast land, where all crime goes unpunished and God no longer can help us, we meet death every day. We greet him when the grenades fall, when the water goes scarce, when the desperate people with the guns come, hoping to take our food or, in some cases, make food out of us. We have nothing to pray for, because nothing belongs to us. Not our homes, our land, not the water or the air, not even our lives. There is no government, no care, no structure. Just a desert of ruins, smoke, flames and death. I am one of the lucky ones who grew up to get to The Choice: I found when my birthday was the day I became 18. Because the man came. Just out of nowhere, a clean shaved man in a suit. It looked so peculiar, I laughed for the first time in years. His face looked so bright I cannot clearly remember his features. He offered me a suitcase. His long fingers delicately pulled a key out of his pocket. ""Open it"", he said. I did, almost instinctively, as I did most things in life. Inside were 12 shiny gold inhalers , numbered and placed in an order from 12 to 1. He asked me if I knew what they were. And I did. It was The Choice. Each inhaler included chemicals of unknown origin and consistency, but with a very well known effect: immortality. Immortality for 24 hours, regenerative abilities beyond any belief, increased strength and sharp clear thought. And instant death afterwards, unless of course you got to the next one. 12 days. 12 days of life as an Indistructible. And death. At 18 years old and 12 days. I had heard stories of twins killing each other to make it to 24 days. Of kids trying to protect their families in the ruins and young lovers offering their inhalers to their beloved as a last farewell. Every last one of the Choosers used them to bring death. Some in desperate attempts to bring justice, and others in a last attempt to live having the things they always longed for. This wasteland, burdened by war and disease has no riches. But the chance to kill someone for the water they carry is almost like a divine gift to most of us. These days give us a future. We are so hopeless that the guarantee of 12 more days seems like future. Like longer than we deserve. Like an angelic song that promises us everything, because we could be dead the moment we say ""no"". And the man in the suit kept looking at me. With his wax like face and dead eyes. That was 11 days ago. I have taken 11 golden breaths. I have found what I needed to do, and how to do it. I have murdered relentlessly. 99 men in suits, hunted down, killed, tortured to betray their ""coworkers"". I have finally understood. This is why nothing grows in this land. Not trees, not animals, not even the people. Because of The Choice. Because we all take it. And those who don't end up killed by those who did. We are becoming so hopeless that we forget to hope. To hope that we may live. To believe that we have to go on. I do feel regret. Not for the lives I took, but because I accepted. The moment I breathed my first, my thoughts suddenly were clear, everything made sense. I regret it deeply, because I became part of it. But... 1 more man. The man I met. One more man in a suit. That's all I have to do. Put an end to it before it goes on for another 10 years. Before we seize to exist. Before ""hope"" becomes a word we no longer know. 1 day. 1 man. 1 breath.

[WP] You had one dream about someone you have never met or seen before in your life. You make it your life goal to try and find them.,Ootman23,"Have you ever had a dream where everything seems normal, and yet at the same time there's that sense of grinding *wrongness* that permeates it all? Nothing you can put your finger on, there's just the sense that at any second something is going to go badly, irretrievably wrong. Imagine watching a video of a man eating cereal. A pretty mundane domestic scene, right? Now imagine the soundtrack is going full on horror-movie, with scraping strings and that sense of building dread. You'd know something horrible is going to happen.

In my dreams, I am that man. I can't hear the music, because I am not the audience, but on some level I know it's there. I go about pretty normal things, shopping, talking with friends, but there's something moving behind the scenes that always makes makes me anxious. Like, dentist-chair anxious.

One night I found myself on a desert road. Not full blown sandy desert, but that kind of low level scrubby-undergrowthed badlands you see if you just drop a Google Streetview pin on some backroad in rural Utah. The road led off to distant mountains in one direction, and off to the horizon in the other. I knew - I just *knew* that nothing good was waiting in the mountains. I could feel those Hitchcock string sections in my blood, their bows drawing their grating tension against my bones.

I turned to face the distant horizon, and I ran. I ran for hours, but the mountains grew no more distant, and the lurking dread grew no less. I woke in a sweat, and could not get back to sleep. I was a zombie that day.

I didn't think much of it, until I had just the same dream two weeks later. This time, as I ran, I saw a figure walking towards me. They were unhurried, walking with the even plod of someone who intended to keep it up all day. I saw a distant tilt of their head as they saw me, but their step didn't falter.

As they grew closer, I could make out more details. A man, a few inches shorter than me and at least twenty years older, his face lined and his hair greying. He seemed somehow in sharper focus than any of our surroundings, although the desert around us was far from blurry. He narrowed his eyes as he drew near, and nodded towards the mountains that lay at the end of his path.

""You're going the wrong way, you know."" His voice had a trace of an accent. Eastern European? I opened my mouth to reply, but couldn't get anything out. He smiled as he swept past me, not breaking his stride for a heartbeat.

""You'll figure it out,"" he called back to me. ""I'll see you in the mountains when you do. Or beyond them, if you're slow.""

When I woke that night, I resolved never to go back to that unearthly desert. I found websites talking about lucid dreaming - the art of remaining in full control during your dreams. It sounded a bit wishy-washy a lot of the time, but what did I have to lose? I tried all the exercises they set out, teaching myself to recognise when I was asleep, and how to take control without breaking that bubble-membrane of immersion and waking myself up. And in small steps I was astonished to find that it worked! If I found myself going about the shadows of routine daily chores in my sleep, I could shrug off the course my brain had set for me and do whatever I wanted. I flew, I walked through walls, I redeployed myself to anywhere I wanted. 

A week after I finally cracked it, I found myself back in the desert. No problem I told myself. A blink of the eyes and I'll be in a jacuzzi under the stars, or anywhere else I wanted to be.

Blink.

Desert.

Blink.

Desert.

Blink, blink, BLINK!

Desert.

I woke up panting again. Whatever that place was, I could not control it, not the way I had wanted to. 

The following night I resolved that if I couldn't escape it, I would have to confront it after all. I found myself in a dream, in some confused hybrid of an elderly relative's house and a department store, and after gathering my nerve, I blinked and took myself to the desert.

The mountains were there before me, as they always were. And this time, I walked *towards* them. Maybe if I confronted whatever waited there, I could be free of it. Or failing that, find that man who had passed me on the road, make him explain. The irrationality of that thought didn't occur to me. In the wash of dream-logic, it seemed to make perfect sense.

Frustrated with my progress, I tried to blink myself further along the road. Of course, nothing happened. That wasn't how things worked here. I was growing increasingly sure that this wasn't a dream. Not really. Not quite, anyway. The man who had passed me, he was like me. Another dreamer, in this place beyond dreaming. Whatever progress I made here I had to earn, one step after another.

I was almost at the mountains when I awoke.

The next night, as soon as I was asleep, I willed myself back to where I had left - only to find myself back again in the middle of the desert, facing those towering, foreboding, and above all *distant* mountains! I could have screamed with the frustration of it.

The same thing happened again, and again. I couldn't make any damnable progress!

The desert and the mountains, the man who had gone before me, they all began to haunt my waking life as much as my sleep. I scoured the internet for anything that looked similar to those peaks, but couldn't find anything. Convinced now that the man was a real person, a dreamer sharing my dream and not a part of it, I tried to search for him. But what could I search? European dream walker? I was left staring at a Facebook search bar, with no clue what to write.

I stayed awake for two days, so that I could sleep the longer. I made it into the foothills before I woke.

I stayed awake for three days, and talked a doctor into writing me a prescription for sleeping pills. I made it halfway up the mountain's slopes, that night.

Growing frantic with desperation, I noticed a warning on the sleeping pill bottle. Do not consume with alcohol. I read the instructions ten times over, trying to talk myself out of it. If alcohol made the pills more effective, maybe I could finally crest those mountains... but it wouldn't be safe. People died that way. No. I wouldn't. I couldn't.

I did. Not right away. I tried again and again, everything I could think of. But nothing worked. I'd lost  my job by this point, unable to focus. The only thing that mattered to me was getting through those accursed mountains, and freeing myself from this torment. I would get there. I would find the dream walker, and I would end this puzzle for good.

That night I finally reached the top of the mountain. And there, over the crest, I looked down on an entirely new vista. On the far side of the mountains stood a city, dark and shadowed. Whatever was calling to me was down there. A tower stood in the centre, and I knew that was my destination. 

The image of the tower stayed with me even as I felt the edges of the dream tugged almost to breaking. Something was happening - something outside the dream. My body was being moved, I was dimly aware. Strong hands gently lifting me. I didn't care. It didn't matter.

I set forward towards the tower that awaited me, oblivious to the frantic actions of the paramedics.",Pulsecode9

[WP] Humans were once immortal beings. Tell the story of the last of them- the child who became the Grim Reaper.,SaltyHoe,"They were beautiful creatures. I only say 'they' because the humans that roam this vast planet cannot be compared to what their ancestors used to be... what my family once was. In all my time hiding in the shadows of the mortals' ticking clocks, I still remember them, how they danced and twirled beneath the naked moonlight, how they created magnificent structures only to tear them down and start again, but most of all, I remember how it felt to live among them. I was born to a rather poor family, and at the age of six, I was already working like the men in the fields of the plantations that dotted the land. 

My baby fat gave way to lean muscles and strong bones that carried me through my teenage years, and at the mandated age of eighteen, I was sent off to the plantations near the wide cities where I would earn my keep before I could be ""properly"" inducted into society as a mature adult. My father called me to him the night before I was to depart, and he entrusted to me a gift, a family heirloom, passed down through the generations. It was a large, black scythe, the blade no longer than a few feet, but freshly sharpened and the hilt refinished. Then, my father smiled a sad smile and said to me, ""Son, keep your head up and your heart true out there. No matter what anyone tells you, know that you are a miracle.""

That was the last time I ever saw my father. Countless years passed before the news finally reached me. My mother and father had been imprisoned for fostering a child, which, kept hidden from me all my life, was a severe crime that would cost them their freedom. And because of this, they were hunted, forced to flee and submit themselves to a life of grueling labor until I was old enough to leave them. Anger consumed the rest of my days, hatred of my own kind isolated me from old friends, and on the day they came for me, they felt fear for the first time.

I remember watching as the scythe cut cleanly through one of the men's chest, and he crumpled to the ground, unmoving. It was only when the rest of them realized that he would not be getting back up did they run, fearing the darkness that would encompass them if my blade touched their skin. I went after all of them. Every single one that had locked my parents away, and then tried to erase the ""abomination"" they had created. But I was no abomination. I was the miracle that would cleanse the Earth of the unworthy. 

As new generations were being born in an attempt to counter my actions, they took to calling me the Grim Reaper, an immortal soul who came to reap yours when he felt your time on the Earth was over. I became what all ages feared. They feared not knowing what laid beyond my killing touch and the darkness that I brought, but not all tried to fight me. Some welcomed me with open arms, and it was then that I realized I could not stop. I had cleansed the Earth, but these new humans did not want to live forever. They created religions to ease the fears of my darkness, and suddenly I was no longer evil, but merely the vessel that carried their heavy souls to a better place. A place where bliss was all that could be known.

Most called my life lonely, as I purposely remain invisible to the mortals' eyes. Many times I have been tempted to turn the blade on myself and join them in the realm they say thrives atop the clouds, but alas, I am never able to. If I were not here to fulfill their want of an afterlife, who would take up my blade and the responsibility? I was raised in stubbornness, and so I will remain. I will remain until the world no longer needs my services, until the last of the humans have been laid to rest and their souls retreat to the heavens, until the sun slips beneath the horizon for the last time.

Then, who knows? Perhaps if I am lucky, I will find peace among the silence.",BraveLittleAnt

She fell, but no blood soaked the dirt, as her heart just...stopped, and slowly did every other organ in her body.

""Mommy!"" the older girl shouted, stopping the woman in her tracks to turn around.

""Sarah? Sarah!!!"" their mother cried out, rushing over to her limp body on the cobblestone trail in the park.

Nobody could see him, some even running through him to see what happened to the little girl. The woman sobbed as people shouted, one bystander even pulling the phone to call the emergency services 

He breathed deeply, her invisible spirit entering his ghastly skeletal face hidden beneath his hood. Slowly, he glided down to just behind the woman's shoulder, and with his demented, childish mind, laughed in her ear as she cried.

Suddenly, she stopped, falling silent as the crowd continued their futile hustle to save the girl's life. She couldn't put her finger on it, but something about the feeling caused goosebumps to erupt along the back of her neck and arms, chills flying down her spine. It was almost like...someone was watching her...

The man kneeling beside her took notice to her silence immediately, and gave her a confused look, before attributing it off to the sudden loss of her daughter. But neither the man nor he woman knew the real reason behind her death was a man -- no, a boy -- who died several millennia ago.

Even as his family had long passed and generation after generation passed him by, he wanted what other people had -- what he thought rightfully belonged to the firstborn.

'And which metal might that be?'

'Whichever was densest and rarest.'

'And known.'

'That too.'

It was difficult to make out the creature's facial expression. Not only was the face considerably far away from my own, it was also situated rather high up, and the sun was in my eyes.

'Would you mind standing in front of the sun a bit more?'

The giant considered for a moment, and lumbered a half step to its left. The giant's shadow was considerably cooler than I expected, and I began to wish I had brought a jacket.

'Is that better?'

'I can see wonderfully now, thank you.'

'I can't. You're standing in shadow.'

'I see.'

The giant did not seem to appreciate my joke.

'They are the last weapons ever forged by the Vexsarian blacksmith.'

'Vexsarian?'

'Yes.'

'Never heard of it.'

The giant seemed disappointed.

'He lived to be one-hundred and forty-seven years old.'

'What killed him?'

'It was a bus.'

'My condolences.'

It pursed its mouth thoughtfully for some time.

'I was his assistant.'

'Did you help forge the daggers?'

'No, I mostly answered the phones. Made appointments, dealt with the mail. That sort of thing.'

'Did it pay well?'

'Thirty thousand a year, plus dental.'

'That's not bad.'

'It was a pretty nice job.'

I shifted my weight lightly from one foot to another, my hands in my pockets.

'I should probably get going.'

'I should, too.'

I remembered the daggers, suddenly.

'Do you want the daggers?'

'Not really. I don't need them for anything. You?'

'I have plenty of daggers at home, thanks.'

'Okay.'

As I turned and began to walk away, the twin daggers left forgotten and unwanted among the dirt and dead leaves, a thought suddenly occurred to me.

'Excuse me.'

The giant had not moved from where he had been standing.

'Yes?'

'How did you sneak up behind me?'

'I was pretending to be a tree.'

'Oh, okay. Bye then.'

""The world always seemed sunnier back then, didn't it?""

""I thought so. The weather seemed much more inviting than it does now.""

""Do you ever think we could have children, and let them have those happy moments?""

A sad silence filled the air, as both of the siblings reflected on such an impossible outcome.

""I didn't mean to make you feel this way,"" Sybbie said, her words softly floating in the air.

""It's fine, Sybbie. I think every once in a while we need an escape from our reality.""

After living in a fantasy world for a few brief moments, George stood up with a sense of melancholy. ""I think it's time to go. We should leave Ripon before Untersturmführer Briggs sends another patrol into this area. Sometimes, memories and their objects in the real world have to be let go of.""

""Where would we even go?"" Sybbie asked.

""I don't know. But wherever we go, we'll always be with each other.""

""Let's say something for Marigold, shall we?""

Sybbie and George bowed their heads down.

""Dearest Marigold, wherever you are, we want to tell you that you'll always be with us. That despite your absence, you have forever remained in our hearts.

[IP] Unsheathed,Syraphia,"He took the blade from her and flicked the hilt an inch out of the sheath with his thumb. He half-drew it, staring at his reflection in the mirrored steel. A narrow fuller, erroneously labeled a blood-groove by the less informed, ran down the length of metal towards the tip. Acid-etched into the steel was an elaborate set Elven glyphs, swirling and curling like vinework. He peered at the edge, examining for any nicks or scratches before sliding the blade back into its scabbard.

""This is a good sword..."" Hilary Flint murmured. He cocked an eye. ""You know how to use it?""

Faith nodded, wary. ""I do. Tybin the Younger, my grandfather's *Blade* taught me.""

[IP] Unsheathed,Syraphia,"Kat caught her breath, staring down at the thing in her hands. A simple sword, still sheathed, and the most dangerous thing in the world. Well, the second. She looked through the trees, the leaves swirling about, at the black shape that was slowly plodding closer.

Kat straightened and began jogging away again. She was in the world's most terrifying slow speed chase ever. Her pursuer plodded along slowly, with a calm determination. He was not tired, he could have easily caught, but he was toying with her and she knew it. She only hoped he was overconfident and that she might escape. She hoped.

…

Ver-dun watched as the girl began jogging again. He continued to shamble along. He couldn't run. He couldn't have her panic, have her draw the blade.

…

Kat, short for Katerina, was a nickname her grandfather had given her, like he had given her the blade. She smiled at the thought of him and a tear rolled down her cheek as she trotted forward. He had never been anything but kind. To her and everyone else he knew. Which is why she hated them so much.

Kat didn't know who they were, what their purpose was, but what she did know was that the last thing her grandpa had said to her before he died was that she could never let the sword fall into the wrong hands. She did not intend to.

Glancing back at the man far away, Kat decided to take a short rest, leaning against a tree. She looked up through the canopy of leaves into the starry sky.

“I won't let them have it, Grandpa,” Kat whispered. “I promise.”

…

Ver-dun saw the girl staring up into the sky. She was not watching him. He ducked to the side, out of her line of sight. He had to be careful. Braz-dur had been specific. The girl was not evil, she simply did not understand the power, the capability to destroy, that she held in her hands. However, it is better that there only be a single casualty rather than a million. 

…

Kat checked for the man but saw nothing. She stood, scanning wildly. He had not given up, she knew that much. He had changed tactics, which meant she needed to as well. Kat sprinted away, crashing through the forest. 

…

The girl was running now. That was bad. Ver-dun ran as well, far more quietly than her, drifting like a ghost through the night. Her small figure began to grow larger and she turned back, looking at him. Her pace accelerated. So did his.

…

Kat ran as fast as she could, refusing to acknowledge her legs as they screamed in protest. Her lungs ached but she did not slow. Kat would not stop.

The man was behind her, running now as well. She had glimpsed him through the trees. He was either done playing with her or she had made him concerned. Neither was good news for her.

Time seemed to stretch on, each heartbeat a year, each second a lifetime. Kat would not let them have the sword. She turned as she ran; the man had gained on her slightly. She sped up right into a tree.

Kat opened her eyes; her head ached. She got to her knees and looked back. The man was almost upon her, so close. She saw the blade a few feet away. She was not going down without a fight.

…

The girl lunged for the blade. Ver-dun sprinted as fast as he could but he was not fast enough. In horror he watched as she grasped the blade handle and began to pull.

…

The man was so close. Kat could see him clearly now. Time inched by. He was tall and muscular, but he was not all human. His left arm and legs were a bit too big for him, slightly green, with large veins running around them. 

His face was full of anger, frustration, and horror as she drew the blade, a smile on her lips. That was when the voices began.

Kat screamed, as thousands of voices invaded her mind, whispering secrets, sharing stories, lying lies. Anger, happiness, joy, guilt, sadness, and betrayal pulsed through her simultaneously. She looked at the man who held out his deformed hand towards her. The voices quieted for a moment, but then attacked more viciously than before. Her body was racked and she fell to her knees, her vision growing dark.

…

Ver-dun stared in horror as the poor girl screamed in agony. He knew what the blade could do. He had used it before. He had survived. This girl would not. He stretched his hand out, reaching, attempting to subdue her thoughts, her emotions. For a moment it worked. Then the screaming resumed and she fell to her knees. Ver-dun ran forward, his spear clutched in his other hand.

The girl stopped screaming and looked at Ver-dun. No, the girl was gone. Only the blade remained. The Blade stood its body up, taking a defensive stance. Ver-dun looked on in dismay. He stared at the Blade in hatred, the evil sword she clutched in her hands.

Ver-dun took a stance as well. Better one.

The Blade came at him, silent. He parried the blow and struck out with his own. 

The Blade did not flinch as the head of the spear dug into its thigh. Instead it stepped back, blood dripping from its wound. It struck again and Ver-dun blocked. The dance had begun.

The two attacked and counterattacked, blocked and parried. The Blade deflected his attempts now that it had proved its point. The Blade was sure it would win. Ver-dun was not so sure. He struck again and the Blade swept down to intercept, but Ver-dun noticed something. The sword seemed to slice about, the arms following.

An idea struck Ver-dun, and a plan immediately began to formulate.

Ver-dun lunged forward, leaving his left side exposed. The Blade smiled and spun, digging it's blade deep into Ver-dun's gut. Ver-dun reached with his deformed hand and grabbed the Blade’s arm. It looked at him in surprise.

Ver-dun held fast, leaving the sword in his side. He carefully raised his spear, his eyes locked. The Blade followed his gaze and understood. It began to thrash about, panicked.

Ver-dun held fast, calculated, and struck.

…

Kat stared at her hand longingly, or rather, stared at where her hand used to be. It always reminded her of that night so long ago, with that strange man. It always reminded her that some things were better left alone. Some things were not meant to be unsheathed.

[IP] Frozen Ashes,Syraphia,"The sun held a bittersweet glow against the ashes that covered the ground. The expanse that lay before Thomas, covered in ash, almost seemed like the snow back home. It covered the ground all around and fell slowly, just like the snow. He let out a long, drawn out sigh. He wished that he could go home, but that was gone. All he had left was the wilderness before him.

The world felt cold around him. No one to be with, no one to love. His loneliness had kept him silent for so long, that he thought he might be forgetting to speak. And then home came back into his mind. The wonderful conversations that he would have with his wife and children, the neighbors who would always come over every Saturday. He missed all of it. 

He looked to his right, seeing a jeep which had ash piled around the wheels. Another sign of humanity, another sign of his loneliness. He could feel a tear roll down his face. The children, they had sat in the back seat of the car. They were precious, and they were gone. Everything had been taken from him, by a powerful force. More tears began to roll down his ash covered face. Then a cold wind blew past him, chilling him through his hooded coat and throwing loose ash onto him. His tears began to freeze and he could feel the places where they'd washed the ash away. 

He then continued forward, into the cold ash waste. He gave the jeep a long glance as he passed it. It looked so inviting, just sitting there; a place to finally rest after what felt like months of no shelter. But he remembered that it wouldn't help. It would only take him away from the elements on the outside, but the inside was still cold. It would be better for him out here than in there.

[IP] Looking for Someone,Syraphia,"When I first started looking for my brother, I used an axe.

It was the same axe our father used to chop trees on the edge of our village, and the same axe that I felled my first wolf with. I used the axe to save Kristine from her slave owners.

I broke the axe while fighting a Giant Diamond Shelled Turtle. I thought I could smash past its hard shell and do significant damage, but I was wrong. 

The next town I visited, I bought a sword. I could use a sword of piercing and slashing, so it would work perfectly for me. After resting the night, I went back into the forest and killed the Giant Diamond Shelled Turtle by shoving the sword into the gap between its neck and shell. 

I broke the sword a while later, but I replaced it with a harder, sharper sword. Swords in this world come in so many varieties, I never had the best one available. 

I finally discarded my swords when I faced the Fire Tipped Demon Dragons. They swoop in to just a few feet from your head and try to eat you, but will ascend quickly if they miss. Rest in peace, Valery, you facilitated by safe escape.

I bought a glaive next. It's a sword blade on the handle of a spear, so it took a little adjusting, but I returned to the mountain within a month. With my new weapon, I used the extra reach to cut off the talons of the dragons as they swooped past me. 

I traded the glaive for a spear when I met an indigenous tribe near the north sea. I'd never crossed a sea before, but everyone told me a spear was the only reasonable weapon to bring along, so I did. 

When the first Blue Back Dolphin attacked, I was glad I made the switch. Of the six of us on the small boat, when the monster jumped over our boat, at least four of us would have to hit the Blue Back Dolphin at the same time with our spears to push it over. 

A club would have worked just as well, but we didn't have any of those, and the spears could be used in other applications beside defending the boat.

A while later, I traveled back south and towards the Desperate Desert. After only fifty feet of talking across sand, my body was swallowed whole by some beast. I managed to survive thanks to Kristine, who used a portion of Dragon's Soul Fire Embers to turn the sand to glass, instantly trapping the Sandy Devil Pit above the surface.

Unfortunately, we had an extremely limited supply of the Dragon's Soul Fire Embers after we gave away much of ours to the indigenous tribes of the north, so once again I needed a new weapon. 

The spear was too short to detect Sandy Devil Pits from the surface, to I got a pike. The pike had the longest reach of all the weapons available in the desert town, so I had to either hope it worked or travel around the desert. Circumventing the desert would cost of months on our journey, so I couldn't do that.

With the pike, I could stab into the sand every ten feet and discover Sandy Devil Pits before they had the chance to surprise me. I could stab the Sandy Devil Pit, causing it to surface. Then, I'd stab it through and hold it up while Kristine used fire magic on the sand to lock it in place. This system worked fantastically all the way to the end of the desert.

That brings us to the current time. We are standing at the entrance to the Menhir. I don't know what this new environment will entail, and what weapon I should wield for it, but I am ready to go through anything to find my brother. 

Rest in peace, mother. I will bring Samuel back home.",hobojimbobo
[IP] Looking for Someone,Syraphia,"It was a long journey. 

It had been so long since he fled the island, running far away from his own clan for the selfish purpose of saving his own soul from the horrors of war. 

The world outside was not as kind as he'd hoped it would be. He soon learned to hide his features so he would not be sought after as a member of that island clan. He learned to carry a spear, then to wield it through too many desperate encounters. 

Somewhere along the way, he even began to enjoy himself as he travelled across lonely wildernesses and untouched summits. There was freedom from the ways of the clan, peace from the constant obsession with war. 

But a strange unsettled feeling began to dog him wherever he went. 

He remembered the festivals of the island- the annual lifting of the mists and the harvesting of fish. He remembered the jagged, volcanic rocks across shallow pools of white sand and clear waters. He remembered the servant that had taken care of him, that kindly old man who had watched over him even as his father and the clan sought to purpose him towards war. 

As he travelled, he heard rumours about the island and the war. 

His grip tightened across his spear as he turned towards the seas where he had once lived. The road was long, but it seemed almost too short to bear as he hastened towards his destination. 

He wasn't entirely sure what he intended to do. Perhaps he'd take a boat out to the island in the cover of darkness. Perhaps he would simply walk by the shores of the mainland, seeking the shadow of the island in the mist with his eyes alone. He would decide when he arrived at the shores of the mainland.

Then he arrived at those mist-laden shores. He saw no island in the distance. The fog was thick sometimes, thick enough to be as good as night for his purposes. He hired a fisherman from a nearby village to take him out to sea. 

As he travelled, he heard rumours about the island and the war again. 

He tried not to listen. He didn't want to know about the apparently cursed island or the long faded war. Somehow, he already knew what he would find long before the boat touched those white and black shores. 

His feet slipped into clear waters and touched against cool sands. The mists drew back as the sun rose over the island and he saw. 

The village of the island clan was long since gone. Rotted wood and debris clogged the bay of the island, remnants of war ships and fragments of wall and roof from the once prosperous village that had grown in the safe waters of the island. The high rock faces that had shielded the borders of the island were long since worn down save for a few jagged fangs of rock clinging persistently to the papery sky. 

His feet carried him on, walking down an almost hidden, familiar path that was now overgrown with grass.

He walked on, past the area where the main village once stood. He walked on, through the distant valley in the centre of the island, once filled with the homes of his clansmen. 

He called out softly into the shifting, swirling mists.

[IP] Looking for Someone,Syraphia,"A hot, unforgiving wind slapped Jake Towner as he walked through the rubble, scorched earth beneath his feet. He heard footsteps behind him, and readied his staff, activating a hidden blade. He turned swiftly, holding the weapon in front of him, and saw it was only a dog, starved to the bone, clawing at a rusted car. The dog looked at Jake and sleepishly bared his teeth. Jake frowned. He walked over to the dog, hid the blade on his staff, and gave the dog the last of his beef jerky. The dog wolfed it down, but still clawed at the car. He whimpered. Every whimper stabbed Jake in the heart a thousand times. He walked over to the car and looked in. He saw a dusty corpse, halfway through decomposition, sitting in the driver's seat. Jake could piece together the puzzle, and scratched the dog behind the ears. Jake looked around the area, and found a metal bowl lying in a pit. Jake filled the bowl with water and gave it to the dog, and he happily lapped up the water. After the dog's drink, Jake took a swig of water, and continued on his way.

""In hopes of offending you, I've seen things not as surprising as a talking dragon. Killed things, much more surprising."" The dragon stared at him with a pair of blazing eyes, from where the man stood, they actually waved and danced as well as radiated like a campfire. How he was able to see, if he could see, was beyond him.

Tales lingered around, of a dragon residing in the dead woods he himself charred. No one was able to explain its motivation or where it came from, villagers not too far from the forest merely stated that animals came stampeding through, and the panicked view of smoke and fire soon followed. But there it stood, as true as any myth that many simply wished were nothing more; Photuris, a beast of fire lied and spoke with the same mouth that scorched his home.

""Allow me to ask human, what do you have to live for?""

The question, caught Verge off-guard. Naturally he's faced off beasts that attempted to trick him with obscure philosophies, all of which he answered with a heavy blade. But to receive a sort of invitation from this beast and asked something so personal, Verge almost felt violated.

""My life,"" Verge opened, ""Consists of me making sure my blade remains sharp, for any and all occasions.""

""So nothing,"" refuted Photuris, """"Excellent! That works for me.""

Verge was unsure of how to retort, but the beast moved on, ""I'll be frank, human, I'm dying""

Verge raised an eyebrow at the statement, feeling as much sympathy toward the statement as a squashed bug. ""And what's that benefit me for? If anything could probably make a bit of coin having you around and thrash out on a village or two.""

The beast, laughed. He let out a rather hearty and wheezing chuckle that threatened to split the ground at some distance and open a crater for something poor to fall in. Smoke puffed from his nostrils like two overworked chimneys. But it was soon killed off by a loud cough that took its place in throwing off the lands geology. Verge could've sworn he heard a tree fall over somewhere.

""Oh trust me,"" continued Photuris, ""I would if I was as spry and youthful. I however lost that bloodlust with age. Otherwise that village would've been burnt down as well.""

""Really?"" asked Verge, looking around at the blackened match sticks that were once proud and strong, ""Couldn't have figured that on my own.""

""Oh please, this is nothing. This was just to make sure no one bothered to come up here and disturb me as I rest my weary old bones,"" The dragon attempted to lift himself as he changed his position, Verge hearing out grunts of pain as he moved ever so slightly, ""However,"" he continued, ""It won't due forever.""

""Others will come,"" Verge offered, ""Whether the villagers simply can't live in peace with the constant reminder you're up here.""

""Or some young and arrogant 'hero' comes up and attempts to take my head as a trophy.""

Photuris grunted once more at the idea of such an occurrence were to come. Verge thought of all the young boys he trained and grew with, only to lose them to their own egos and fire. Oh he knew, more will come. They will come with everything they can bring to bring some recognition and false fulfillment to themselves.

""Where does it come with a dragon writing me a letter for my presence?"" Verge asked.

""Stay here,"" answered Photuris, ""And protect me till I die.""

""I don't suppose it'd be faster to stick my sword into your skull.""

""Oh it would,"" Photuris agreed, ""Possibly less painful even. However that is simply not how I wish to go."" Photuris reached over somewhere behind his massive body, grunting as he moved. As his large arm came back into view, there was something between his large, clawed fingers. A chest of old but maintained wood. The lock on it was polished and the only sort of light in this dark place. Of course it went defeated compared to the massive amount of gold and jewels he revealed with a simply lift.

Verge jumped off his dead tree to inspect the treasure. He noticed a dark square on top of mount. Picking it up, it was a book.

He held it up to view and asked, ""What's this?""

Photuris reached out and gingerly took it out of Verge's hand. ""That,"" he replied, ""Is something you may view after my final breath.""

""You keeping a journal?""

""A reminder. For all of you to know that we weren't all destruction and malice.""

""A dragon who can speak and is more literate than a majority of the population, witnesses or it didn't happen.""

""Then I suppose you have more to live for than previously thought."" Photuris shut the chest and hastily placed it back to where it came. ""Now move along, I believe you have a job to do.""

Verge stared up into the beast's firey eyes, and proceeded to kneel over and say, ""Yes, my lord.""",Somemexican99

[IP] Infected,Syraphia,"He wondered if they knew he was awake. 

It was so uncomfortable being lugged around everywhere. Sure, he couldn't exactly walk or move around on his own now but the least they could do was offer him a wheelchair or a bed or something. 

Or clothes. It was annoying to have to feel their too hot human hands on his skin. 

He vaguely remembered that he was supposed to be disturbed by being naked. It didn't seem that important now, and all he could do was just lie there and blink while his once colleagues cursed and swore and lugged him down towards the incineration chamber. 

It was vaguely amusing, although he couldn't quite pinpoint why. They would probably be kind of surprised to find out what would happen to him next. 

They dumped him on a metal platform, over the body of some other person. With a shove, the metal platform retreated into the ash-caked interior of the incinerator and their bodies tumbled into the fires below. 

Skin melted, fat boiled, muscles grew stringy and thin before disintegrating entirely. It stung a little but the fires burnt his nerves out before he could really think too much about the sensation. 

And he was sitting there, for a given value of 'sitting' anyway, waiting in bored impatience. 

Eventually, the incinerator grew cold, frozen almost as the heating disappeared and left it exposed to the frigid cold that all non-modulated chambers of the ship experienced. 

He felt his body return to him as the temperature dipped to almost freezing. The ashy walls around him started to compact. He ignored it, feeling in fascination as his muscles and skin started to grow back rapidly. The bodies beneath him stirred. He heard coughing and a little bit of half-conscious swearing. 

Another mind touched his. He felt the faintest probings of confused thought on the fringes of his consciousness. 

He said his first words in a long time.

""Hi."" 

""Hi."" someone echoed, not really answering, just reliving his thought. 

""My name is Doctor Kaslow,"" he said, ""Are you all awake?""

The bodies shifted beneath him, he could feel their minds again, all of them. His head ached a bit but he continued as he sensed the lower bodies being crushed. 

""Father..."" said the nearest form, a young woman- she looked familiar. Perhaps she was one of his guards once. He tilted his head and sat up on the pile of bodies. 

""Interesting."" he noted. If only he had his data recorder here. ""Infection strain has developed a familial identity towards enhanced infectees."" 

He wondered how far he could push that apparent relationship. 

""Go stop the compactor from crushing us."" he told her. 

There was no way a standard human form would be able to do that. He wondered what she was going to do. 

""Father..."" Her face was expressionless but her tone...

She melted. Literally, he saw her skin disintegrate. Great yellowish sacs appeared before she burst entirely, showering a wall with acidic liquid that ate quickly through the metal to reveal a grimy service corridor beyond. 

He crawled off the pile, wobbling to his feet as he entered the service corridor. His muscles flexed and twitched independently and he could almost feel the urge to shift into a quadruped form to accomodate the narrow passage. 

He found that he could suppress it, if he concentrated on it.

Unfortunately, that meant a few of the other bodies twitched and warped into quadrupedal forms vaguely reminiscent to mutated rats the size of large  dogs. Warped human faces stared at him blankly. 

""Hmm, vector evolution is hastened by environmental factors...or perhaps impulsive control?"" he tilted his head, ""More testing required."" 

A thought occurred to him. Something inside him seemed to balk at the thought but he quashed it. It was probably another silly thing he used to have hang ups about, like being naked. 

With a thought the rat-like things moved nearer to him, hissing and chattering. Bony, clawed hands scraped against the metal corridor. He patted their heads affectionately. 

""Father needs you to go infect more test subjects for him.""

Day 51


Alpha Testing Facility


Another two test subjects wasted, it feels like we are never going to cure this god forsaken contagion. We only have seven infected subjects left out of the twenty we gathered up last time when we left the facility. We lost five good men and women that day. Damn that reminds me John told me that to begin all these logs with a status update first then move onto the comments, well better late then never.


This is Frank, lead researcher of the DAX virus at Alpha Testing Facility. We currently know that this bio-weapon was launched during the Great War, we know that it spreads through the air and we know that the virus mutates rapidly. We still do not have a cure for the disease and we are no closer to curing it then day 23.


Wow that was depressing I still dont get it how can we cure a virus when it mutates on infecting a person. Each subject we have seen has the same virus but a different strain of it. I dont think it will be long before, the virus mutates to get past our air filters and all of us here are killed. We might have to go out again to get more test subjects but we still havent designed a suit capable of filtering out all strains since new ones pop out every day. Well at least we dont have them resurrecting, a zombie apocalypse would completely destroy us and it probably would have that stupid religious faction grow.",LeMireglo
[IP] Infected,Syraphia,"It was a rough day to have incineration duty. It was never a fun job, but at least when it was grungy homeless people and the elderly we could pretend things might get better. Steve and I were about to reach the stairs.

The man we carried wasn't old. Nor did he look especially sick, his body seemed as full and robust as it should, and his skin didn't have much of the clamminess one would expect. Were it not for the blood leaking from his eyes, nose, and fingernails he could easily be mistaken for sleeping. His clothes had been stripped off and burned already, but it made his body a bit slick. My hands were starting to slip.

I asked, ""Hey Steve, you mind if we slow down for a minute? The cold is starting to affect my dexterity.""

He responded, ""We've still got 20 more before the next shift, you'll warm up faster by the furnace.""

I adjusted my grip slightly, then we headed down the stairs. It wasn't until we'd loaded the corpse onto the shelf of the furnace. Then I noticed the woman's corpse on the next shelf. She didn't have the telltale signs of the plague. I had to know.

""Where did she come from?""

""That's Jenny. Didn't they tell you why you were called onto furnace duty in such a rush?""

""What happened?""

""She tried to run.""

Steve's tone was dull, as though he couldn't be bothered to feel anything anymore. I envied him for that. I needed a bit more time to warm up, and I certainly wasn't about to leave this conversation alone.

""Tried to run?""

""Quarantine means nobody leaves, one way or another. She tried to hold onto the top of the unmanned hearse, and the tunnel took her head off.""

Her neck was stuck into the furnace, so her lack of a head wasn't immediately visible. I felt sick to my stomach.

""So there's no way out then?""

""Why would there be? The disease has never left a survivor before, no reason to expect that to change for us.""

""What?""

The sickness in my stomach worsened. I could feel my vision clouding, and my hands felt sore. I pulled off my glove and saw specks of red pooling under my fingernails.

"[WP] Everyone knows the four horsemen of the apocalypse, few have heard of the four wagoneers of prosperity.",Umikaloo,"I looked at the newspaper as I drank my coffee. A short Asian man on the front page stared back at me, wearing a million dollar smile and carrying a treasure chest likely equally valuable. His name was Howard and he worked in a local law firm’s IT department according to the byline. Twenty-four hours ago, he’d been severely intoxicated, coming off the coattails of a nasty bender, standing on a bridge above the sea as the sun rose, when he decided to take his own life to escape the crippling gambling debt he'd amassed. As he hit the surface, he not only managed to survive without any damage, but also spotted a buried treasure hidden centuries prior by pirates. According to the article, the chest glinted in the early sunbeams of dawn, making it impossible for him to miss.

*How fortunate.*

I unfolded the paper and opened it to the second page to see if my suspicions were right. A woman in a nearby suburb found a locked safe in her cellar basement filled with rare silver coins from another era and, in the column directly underneath, a man who used a metal detector on the beach for years finally struck literal gold adding up to the tidy sum of ten thousand dollars. On page three, a baby born with a debilitating cancer was found to be in remission against all odds.

By the time I got to page four and saw the feel good story about a kid finding their puppy who was lost for three weeks in perfect health, I knew I was right.

They were in town. At least, Luck was. I was pretty sure his brother Life was in the nearby area as well, if the obituaries' uncannily small list of recent passing and sudden drop in murder rate were any indication. 

Everyone knows about the horseman of the apocalypse. But who they don’t know about quite as well is the yin to their yang: the four wagoners of prosperity. Everything in the universe has a negative and a positive, something to balance its very existence out to create neutrality. As such, nothing happens without a reason. The horsemen and the wagoners are responsible for nearly everything in the world—both good and bad.

I’d been traveling for the better half of the year looking for at least one of them, let alone two. I’d come close in Idaho a few weeks back, arriving right as a local teenager sold a potato chip that looked oddly like Jesus for a million dollars on eBay. But Luck had disappeared on me then, perhaps scared off by my doppelganger, who was on the trail just like I was. 

They never stayed in the same place for long and we were both looking for them. Which of course meant, somewhere out there, in the sprawling city of Chicago, my doppelganger was reading a newspaper in another coffee shop and had just reached the same conclusion as me. 

The only difference was I wanted to save them. The other me wanted to remove them from this world, spiraling the globe into an unforgivably cold place where only bad things happened to good people. A world where cops never got a lucky break in an investigation. A place where no one escaped a burning building. Like I said, everything has its negative and positive; its own yin and yang to balance it. Its own good versus evil. 

My doppelganger, however, wanted to end all that. He also wanted to end me.

I just hoped that for once, Luck was on my side. Its life—as well as the future of the whole planet—might depend on it.

"[WP] Everyone knows the four horsemen of the apocalypse, few have heard of the four wagoneers of prosperity.",Umikaloo,"When I was young, my town was devastated by a hurricane.

I lost everything in what felt like a nightmare, as did so many others. I wandered the muddy streets, stepping over broken bits of debris and trying desperately not to look at the bodies of both man and beast that lay twisted in ways too horrible to describe, embedded in the muck.

Charity was a principle soon lost in the devastation. So many had lost so much, and so many more sought to take that which they had stripped from them from their fellow survivors. It was not long until the survivors had barricaded themselves into the shambles of their old homes, with obscene threats carved into whatever surface the occupants could find. Those brave or foolish enough to approach these defaced dwellings often became either mute testament to the resolve of the occupants to uphold their scrawlings' promises or affirmation that such drastic measures needed to be taken to protect oneself. Even I, a mere child, was shown no compassion. I was just another monster lurking beyond these terrified people's' doors. And after having the tip of my right ear shot clean off, I learned it was best to scavenge what little I could find in the refuse of the streets.

Weeks passed. Any attempt to rebuild had been abandoned in favor of hoarding what little one could find behind makeshift defenses. I wandered the streets, aimless and silently praying for some end to the ceaseless nightmare that consumed me. Everywhere I looked was a reminder of how far we had fallen. Storefronts lay in ruin, with what goods left unpilfered skewed about the ground, either a result of the storm or some recent tussle between survivors. Our once proud port was a graveyard of smashed ships, made all the more haunting by the shredded sails blowing gently in the breeze like ghosts lingering over their broken bodies. 

I wandered in circles until my legs could carry me no further. I collapsed into the street, content to have sludge swallow me whole as it had so many others. I closed my eyes and wept silently, praying for God to have compassion enough to end my sorrowful existence. But it was not to be.

""Dear boy, what has become of you?!""

I struggled to raise my head to see he who had spoken to me. A tall man of many years stood over me, pity and concern shown in his long, wrinkled, bearded face. I tried to speak, to beg him to stamp out my life so I might join those taken from me by nature's cruel fury, but I was too weak to speak.

""Oh dear, oh dear. This is dreadful. Simply awful."" He scooped me up from the muck into his arms, cradling me with the tenderness I had not felt since my mother had carried me to my bed at night. ""Worry not, child. You'll want for nothing when I'm done. I promise. Hold on. Please.""

He carried me to a wagon, somehow in the most pristine of condition. Tethered to its front, a stallion of astounding breed; a coat of pure white and a lush, brilliant mane that seemed to glow with the brilliance of the moon glimmering upon the sea's surface. I wondered how it was that this old man had not only remained alive in the face of this apocalypse, but had remained so untainted by it. He himself wore a fine navy blue jacket with golden buttons. Upon his head sat a silver top hat. His trousers were spotless despite being as pure a hue of white as that of his horse's pelt. I honestly believed him to be some sort of mirage brought on by my grief.   

 He washed my face, hands, and feet with warm water and swaddled me in blankets as soft as silk. He fed me whatever foods he could, often to have me vomited it back up moments later. Yet he showed no revulsion towards me, a sorry, broken wild child. He only smiled and whispered words of comfort. ""Come now lad; chin up. You'll be on your feet in no time."" He would say to me. But what was so odd was the fact that believed him. I wanted to keep living. I wanted to prove him right.

After what felt like weeks, the old man dressed me in workmen's garbe. He clasped his hand upon my shoulder and said, ""We have much to do, dear boy."" I followed him from house to house, watching in awe as even the most volatile and untrusting of survivors opened their homes to him. He gestured to me, saying that I needed their help rebuilding our home. None ever seemed to question him. They simply approached me and asked what it was we needed to do.

I would tell them ""The streets need clearing,"" or ""The dead must be tended to,"" and off they would go to handle the issue. Each time they did, the old man would smile at me, nodding his head in approval. But what was strangest of all was how the old man always had what we needed.

When a group of men needed tools to rebuild their homes, he pulled fresh lumber and tools from his wagon. When the mothers told us their children were starving, a feast would emerge from the wagon to sate their hunger. He never was short of anything, even what seemed like the impossible.

After months of repair and rehabilitation, our home stood a grand city, greater than it had been before the storm. We were healthier, happier, and better than we had ever been before. I myself became the adopted son of the town's carpenter, who trained me to build so many things.

We were people again.

Satisfied that his work was done, the old man packed his cart and set on his way. Many, most vocally I, protested his leaving and begged him to stay. But in answer, he merely smiled with a saintly warmth. ""I have given you all that you need, my dears,"" he said. ""I must be on my way."" And with that, he left, never to be seen again.

There are many days I think of that old man and his wagon. I ponder what he moved on to upon leaving us. I wonder if he will ever return to us. But more than anything, I ask myself how it is that he sought nothing in return for our salvation. I can only wonder and pray that one day I will meet this man again so that I may repay him for the kindness he has shown me.",RorschachtheMighty

"" So, what is it supposed to be ? I mean magic, you practice it before, right ?""

"" Well, we never use magic to ask something unachievable. Like freezing a frog at a summer noon, or conjuring some demonic familiar or something. Based on Frazer theories, it is a subtle level of technology""

"" It really does exist ? "" My voice suddenly turns to a pitch mixing in suprising and excitement.

"" Yes. Not like DnD when you can burn your enemy, freeze them or doing some darkness stuff. It is far more subtle, and most of them have harmony to the nature as the core, so we never could use it as the science technological level.""

[WP] A visit to Mother.,Vercalos,"It'd been 2 decades since the beast crawled out of the mouth of hell to give birth.  Dragging her fat, protruding belly straight from the fire into a blizzard.  Blood and soot were smeared in the snow behind her.

The infant came out a mewling mess, surrounded by cold but built for warmth.  A daughter; She hated her on sight, but there were rules in this society. If she wanted to blend in she'd have to care for it.  

Her body was completely consumed in fire as she changed their forms to match that of the people in the town she was heading to.  This was going to be unpleasant.  

She glared at the baby in her arms.  Smoke was still rising from both of their forms and the snow around them sizzled and melted.  How lucky this tiny thing had been to be born outside Hell. She hated it just a little more for that.  The extra weight, the labor pains, and exhaustion caused by this tiny thing had made it that much harder to pull herself out of the pit.  

""Hateful thing,"" she said, glaring down at it.

Soon she found a road.  By then the bundle in her arms was screaming and even in the storm they were found and offered a ride.  

""What are you doing out in the middle of a snowstorm?"" the man asked. ""And with a baby?  Come with me.  We'll get you warmed up.""  She'd gracefully climbed up and leaned against him- draining his energy, feeding off of his kindness with a kind of drunkenness.  It'd been so long since she'd tasted compassion.

The Beast stayed with him part of the winter, enjoying the feeding, but he aged to quickly.  She watched as he scribbled into a journal, and wondered at it.  Who would read it?  

The baby was constantly fussy.  It often cried.  It craved human food.  After months of this, she'd lost patience, dropping her form.  She'd intended to put a quick end to it.  The man had caught her and fiercely defended the child.  His fraternal drive was much stronger than she'd thought it could be, especially since the baby wasn't his.  He won.

She was forced to flee.  Taking up residence in a cave, she fed on drifters and traveled to other towns.  The thing she'd given birth to drew her in.  She couldn't control it.  She wanted to leave, go further from the cave that hid the mouth of Hell, but she couldn't. It tied her here.  She wanted to tear the thing to pieces. 

Meanwhile, the man raised the child like she was his own.  In spite of the winter the Beast had drained him, he'd lived long enough to see his adopted daughter into adulthood.  This time she would take her time.  No mistakes.  

From a distance, the Beast watched on as the girl visited her father's grave.  The snow was starting to fall and the girl was cold.  The house wasn't far, but she'd have to work fast if she didn't want to be caught.  

She was determined to reverse this pull her spawn had on her.  She'd resented its powerful pull long enough.  Her daughter wanted to be human?  She would use that to take power back, to draw her in.

She searched through the house until she found the journal she knew he kept.  Placing it carefully on the table, she flipped it open and added a sentence of her own.

""Come to Mother.""

Someone else either set him up or she was running to him for help. I was limited on time so I didn't develop this further but felt comfortable leaving it up to the imagination.

One possibility is that the woman closing up the store with Aileen saw this as an opportunity to kill her and frame the man. This might be Henry's thoughts on the matter as he was uncomfortable/had bad feelings about the checkout woman's testimony.

"[WP] ""I still wonder, you know. I still sit and stare at the stars and wonder.""",Vercalos,"""I still wonder, you know. I still sit and stare at the stars and wonder.""

There is a calmness to his voice that surprises me. I lean over, half-hug him with one arm. He stiffens but does not move away.

""Sorry,"" he says, drowning the rest of his beer and glancing over at me. There's a stillness in the air this far away from the city, a silence I'm not used to. Out here it's just me and the house and the trees and the stars, and this brother I have not spoken to in five years.

""It's okay."" I laugh awkwardly, just to fill the space. I do not know what I expected. Tears, hugging, a heartfelt reunion, maybe. But I have forgotten him, started to mix real Dylan and imaginary Dylan up. Real Dylan is just as poetic and closed off and aloof as I remember him; it is only Imaginary Dylan that throws open his doors and ushers me in. Imaginary Dylan buys an apartment in a high-rise building blocks away from me and sees me every week, Real Dylan holes himself up in a tattered shack in the middle of the mountains and climbs his roof to drink and watch the stars.

Then again, I don't really blame him.

Dylan crushes the beer can between his fingers in a fluid, well-practiced move. In the night I can't see much, just his face and pinpoints of light, high above.

""So."" He clears his throat, angles his head upwards. ""What is this? Why are you here?""

He tosses the words out with a casual violence. I wince. ""I...wanted to see you.""

Dylan is still staring at the stars; I cannot see his face. ""You. Wanted to see me.""

""You're family.""

Now Dylan laughs, though it sounds more like he's choking. ""Family?"" he asks incredulously. ""So what is this, forgiveness? What, Ellie, are you forgiving me, finally? Five years later?""

I wait for the anger to rise, but it doesn't. Five years and countless hours of therapy and too many empty vodka bottles have sapped it away, left me emptier. Although maybe not a bad kind of empty. Maybe the right kind of empty.

""I want to therapy,"" I say instead. ""The expensive kind.""  Dylan does not look at me and my voice sounds too loud in the night. ""And I...drank. A lot. I quit my job. Did you know that? My once-in-a-lifetime, miracle job; I quit it.""

""God,"" Dylan says, more tired than anything else.

""And I got a new boyfriend. Though maybe boyfriend is too strong of a word."" I'm rushing ahead now, my words tumbling over each other. Did you know this? I want to ask. Did you hear? Are you still my brother? Do you remember me? ""We screwed around for two years and I was still crushed when it ended. That was stupid.""

""Yeah,"" Dylan agrees.

""And I..."" I swallow. Dylan's eyes are still focused on the stars, staring so intently I think he might be glued there forever. He is 26 now, old enough where things start to matter, where life might finally begin. ""I missed you. And Mom. So much.""

""I almost killed myself."" Dylan says suddenly, with a ferocity I haven't seen. He tears himself away from his stars, looks at me. Really looks at me. ""I would've done it, Ellie. I was so close, you don't even understand. It was two months after it happened and I was in a tiny motel; this was after I dropped out and you'd stopped talking to me."" His eyes are hard. ""And all I could think about was how Mom had choked to death in our kitchen and I was upstairs and I was too angry to check on her, and she was dead and it was my fault.""

In therapy I learned to say that it was no one's fault, but I cannot open my mouth right now.

""And I had a date planned, I was going to die in that God-forsaken room where the air never moved,"" Dylan continues. ""But then this place opened up and I didn't, I moved out here. And it saved me. The mountains. The stars. I saved myself.""

There is a ball of words lodged in my throat. Somewhere a young woman is screaming and suddenly it is five years ago and I come home to my mother dead in the kitchen and my brother locked up in his room in an act of immature rebellion and I think, I will never forgive you for this. And then I am back on the roof of this house in the middle of the woods where you still have to boil water for a bath and my brother is older and wearier and sitting next to me and I have already forgiven him. I have forgiven him long ago. You are my family, I think. It is now me who is asking for forgiveness.

""It's not your fault Mom died,"" I say finally, the words finally working their way up my vocal cords, into my mouth. ""It never was.""

""Yeah,"" Dylan agrees, sadly. ""I know that now.""

""I forgive you."" The beer I drank an hour ago burns against the back of my tongue. ""I forgave you a long time ago."" Dylan looks at me, holds my gaze. ""I'm not here for that. I'm here because...I want you to forgive me too. I'm sorry. For everything. For the past five years. For you being alone with the stars and me shutting myself in a penthouse, for giving up on you. There was a time when I was so angry I couldn't breathe, but I was wrong.""

And now Dylan is laughing, though there's no humor in it. ""I forgive you for everything, Ellie. Of course I do. Mom is dead and you are my sister, how could I not?""

I look over at him, unsure if he's serious. This is a Dylan I have not yet met, one he's created in the last five years. One I've missed out on.

""Ellie,"" he says, his voice low. ""You are my family. I would forgive you for anything.""

There is a ball in my chest that is unknotting and all my muscles are relaxing. I have been wound up tightly since my mom died and now there is air in my lungs.

Dylan shakes his head, pops open another beer. ""Stay awhile,"" he says, looking back up at the sky. ""Stay with the stars and your family.""",fahrenhvit

*""Ah, so what do you wonder about? Have a wife or children back home, at Odessa? Wonder whats the next time the guards are going to shoot someone? Wondering if it's you this time?*

*""Yes Glushko. Who doesn't think of those things, in a place such as this? But I think of other things.*""

Although no could see in the darkness of the barracks, Glushko was taken aback by this. In the miserable place, what else Korolev could be thinking of, then of his family and his fate? 

*""Then Sergei Korolev, what could you be thinking about?""*

That with enough persistence, we could convince Comrade Stalin to fund our stupid experiments indefinably.*

Glushko sighed at this.

  *""Well, the Gulag can make even something you used to love into torture.""*

Korolev contemplated this statement. 

*"" The Gulag is what you make it out to be. For Stalin, it's a big garbage chute to put all the dissenters in. For you, it's hell. Heck, it's hell for everyone. But I can be more than that, Valentin.""* 

*""Valentin, what does hell give you? Time.""*

*""You are right about this place as a leech. It drinks off people's souls. Their bodies. Their hope.""*


*""But it can never drink off your wonder. In fact, it only heightens it. You wonder about the obvious things, of course. But you also wonder about the things at the edge of human perception. Without distraction, this place gives you a wonderful opportunity to think.To fantasize. To ponder about the human experience.""*

*""So, I did. I wondered about the coming years. I wondered, more intensly then I ever had before, about man's place in the stars. I wondered about the great cosmos. The asteroids, the moons, the planets, the galaxy. And that I have the ability to make it happen.""*

*""That gives me hope, Valentin. And with that, I can survive the Gulag. I may not defeat it, but If I get out of here, I have the power to launch humanity into the cosmos. And that, my friend, is a reason to keep living.""*

I walked past the neighbourhood bar, the neon lights illuminating the still wet sidewalk, as I heard excited chatter and raucous laughter emanating from inside. The twilight had become so much more imminent, after we discovered the other worlds, perhaps with thriving life on them, life that was so much more ancient than ours. As I passed the last flickering streetlight, the darkness enveloped me, drawing me closer to it - to the infinity of stars that twinkled so far above. The pier that I'm walking on is old, decrepit, though in its antiquity it is still beautiful. I'm walking, aimlessly, thoughts filling my head like so much empty noise, and I look up, the sounds of the ocean echoing off nearby buildings, the smell of saltwater filling my nostrils like an aphrodisiac. I sit on the edge of the pier, motionless, and to any outsider I look like just another part of the vast sea as it ceaselessly performs its perpetual dance, waves crashing against the shore. My reflection is neutral but inquisitive, and I can see the stars as a glimmering backdrop. But why have I been born here, rather than another world? I almost know that somewhere, beyond the infinite horizon, there is another like me, lost, and wondering, wandering, on a distant planet nestled in the celestial sea.",Jayx2001

Was I the only one left? Did any of the other crewmen survive the assault? Or was I the last of my ship, the last of my kind left?

I remember when we first encountered... them. We were naïve. We had presumed first contact with another species would be a peaceful event, and set out to explore the galaxy with that in mind. In the end, we paid a terrible price for our stupidity.  

We tried to communicate with the aliens, but within minutes, they ripped through the hull of our exploration vessel with a cutting beam, tearing gaping holes that exposed us to the deadly vacuum of space. Crew were sucked into its cold, icy death grip; they were the lucky ones.

I saw them coming from my unimportant station on the lower decks of the ship. I'd been maintaining our air recyclers, and I happened to glance out the port to see the massive ship approaching. It filled me with an uneasy dread I couldn't explain. 

Within seconds, the cutting beam began dissecting the hull. As soon as they began their attack... I'm ashamed to admit, I fled. I knew we were no match for their vessel, that we had no hope of defending ourselves from them, so I ran straight for the nearest escape pod. Some part of me knew they wouldn't just stop at attacking us, they had much more sinister plans. I didn't want to be a victim of that.

The one-man pod spirited me away from our ship, and was small enough to be lost in the debris of our rapidly disintegrating vessel. The aliens either missed me, or deemed me unimportant. Either way, I was not about to look a gift horse in the mouth.

As I rocketed away, I watched as they tore the ship to pieces. I doubt anyone could have survived it. 

Less than a week later, I picked up transmissions on the pod's communication system. The aliens had moved on to our homeworld, and were attacking. They possessed technology that was far superior to our own; a journey that had taken our vessel months had been completed by them in a matter of days.

A day later, there were no more transmissions. Only silence. The alien cube has likely shredded my entire planet as easily as it did our ship. In all likelihood, I am the last one of my species alive.

"[WP] ""I still wonder, you know. I still sit and stare at the stars and wonder.""",Vercalos,"The night was still as Henry left the store, not a person in sight. He got into his Subaru and threw his new jeans on the passenger seat. His wife has been asking him to purchase a new pair for weeks before his coworkers began mocking the permanent dirt stains on casual Friday. So here he was on a Thursday night at 9:00pm at the only store open, buying the cheapest pair sold. Henry expected criticism for rushing but surely it was better than his old pair.

Henry let out a simultaneous sigh and yawn before beginning to back out of the deserted parking lot. As he went to shift into Drive, he heard a knock on his back bumper. Part of Henry wanted to keep driving from whatever animal was back there but morality overcame fatigue.

Henry left his lights on and took out his cellphone as a flashlight to check out the damage. Then came the call from his wife along with a flashing low battery warning.

""Lillian, I'm leaving the mall now. Sears was still open when I got here and there wasn't-""

Henry looked behind his car and choked on his own words. The phone fell to the pavement and Lillian was screaming his name on the other line. Henry fell to the ground, ""Lillian, I'll call you back.""

*Hi, My Name is Aileen* was the blood-covered tag that this young woman wore as she laid dying in front of Henry. Blood and tears ran down her face. Henry saw his wallet in her hands before it fell to the ground. Henry stared at her for a few more seconds before reaching frantically for his phone. When he found it, the screen was cracked and dark.

The reality set in. He had killed this woman backing out of his spot too quickly as she was darting toward him to return his wallet. No one was around and his phone was dead. It was this moment that he deeply regretted leaving the city... but wait. *What about her coworkers?*

Henry ran to the store doors and banged as hard as he could. The only person inside was closing a checkout and shook her head at him. Her eyes were laser-focused on the money she was counting and only offered him a passing glance that told him to go away. Henry continued to slam his palms on the glass doors and windows, desperately yelling for anyone to help. The only woman he could see walked away and the lights went out.

*Is it not illegal to leave the scene? How could anyone drive away?*

Henry waited a few minutes before grabbing his wallet carefully from Aileen's frozen hands and heading home. Then he could call from his wife's phone. 30, 40, 80... Henry had never driven so fast on these backroads. In only four minutes, he was home, only to realize that he had no idea as to how to approach his wife. It was so dark in the lot, with no functioning lights, that he did not fully understand what had happened. Had he really killed this woman? How could he have backed up fast enough to cause such blood? It didn't make sense.

Henry got out of the car and looked down at his bumper. There was only one small dot of blood immediately visible, not what he would expect from a woman covered in blood. Henry developed a headache as he tried to recall the events. Nothing made much sense, not at all. Maybe it hadn't been true and he was too fatigued to separate reality and dreams. Maybe not.

Lillian ran outside to see Henry staring blankly at the bumper.

""What happened?! Why are you standing behind your car?""

Henry turned to her and took her hands, ""I'm sorry babe. My phone died shortly after I dropped it while on with you. I couldn't call back but I hit an animal. Not much damage but a bit of blood. I'm just so tired.""

""Oh thank God you are all safe and home.""

Lillian embraced Henry as he stood gritting his teeth with one arm around her. Henry was fairly sure that he hadn't killed Aileen, but this night was the night that killed him.

The murder was all over the news in and out of Henry and Lillian's small town. Years went by and Sears was sued by Aileen's family for lack of security cameras and insufficient lighting. The woman that refused to let Henry in decided to testify about this crazy man trying to get in and kill her as well. Henry watched each segment with a heavy heart as he learned more about this girl and her short life. Her body had stab wounds but none of the evidence added up. Yet all Henry remembers clearly is the look of satisfaction and apathy toward Henry from the checkout woman at Sears. There was not a bit of evidence against her other than Henry's bad feeling about that exchange.

*I could have been charged as a killer, or I could have helped to catch the real killer.*

Henry decided to see a therapist to discuss his feelings about Aileen and that night. He asked Henry about how he copes.

I wasn’t on some hilltop looking upwards or standing outside the school yard drinking while recalling life. 

I’m sitting on a bench after a long day of work as people mill by not at all interested about the grown woman whom was still. If anything I’m forgotten. Just a tree among their memoires as they go on. Like they all go on. And I’m feeling something that everyone has felt or will feel one day. Lost.

Lost among the wave of people when all I think about is someone that no longer is but was. And I find myself searching the crowds at times picturing you. Walking past however I couldn’t picture you like the million that travel without looking. You always looked, always cared. 

I find that I’ve started to cry, it isn’t like the first time, a disbelieving sob but more of a reminder that I still had a part of me that will always ache. Always wondering of what should be.

I’m not allowed the luxuries of such thoughts. Not at my age, not at an age were I’m suppose to be stressed over student loans and complaining about my boss or lack of dates.

I’m not suppose to be standing still like I’m waiting for the punch line to some cruel joke, that’s happened years ago. But I am.

And there’s days like this where I feel like singing and laughing and then its like a brick falls onto my head and all I can think of is how we were in the same boat.

How I could only see myself. At the time I felt as if I was grown beyond myself and able to help others but I was merely tricking myself because all I saw were my own problems, my own joy.

And then one day you weren’t here and I couldn’t believe it. I still can’t. I recall how it rained the next day because the world was mourning a beautiful soul. And I always wondered how it would have been had it been me.

The woman who couldn’t appreciate the people around her till the curtain was right in her face. 

So I still wonder, you know. I still sit and stare at the stars and wonder, you know.

And I wonder if you know how much you mean to me.

It sits on the lip of a great, gaping delta, where black water goes to the sea. By day it is stone and steel, electric white and ringing with the same sounds you hear in your own city, or at least the smaller ones, where people walk and talk and live among one another. It is nothing strange. 

At night, however, it is the blackest void. Absent of all light. A tiny thumbprint in the earth. There is only whispering, then, like coughing in a cathedral. Chairs shifting. Bumps in the night.

Perhaps, were you hovering above and blessed with exceptional sight, you may see *something*. Miniature stars. Blinking. Glistening. 

Human eyes, that is. Upturned. Staring into the sky. Reflecting back the moonlight. And the starlight. A million pairs, pointing up.

Amara went to the lightless city, though she had rejected it for years on years. She had envisioned it as a sad place. A frozen place. A place of wallowing stasis. And that did not appeal to her. She had long ago promised to live with her choice, and she had done so, but time had passed and now...

Now things were different. Michael was dead. And the boy dead even longer. She was alone. So she went to the lightless city, to see for herself, and perhaps - perhaps - to wallow a bit herself.

She was surprised to be recognized so easily. 

""Amara!"" said a man in a white jacket, springing up from a table at the edge of the roof. She had come to one of the finer cafes in the lightless city, and of course, all the finest cafes there were high up and open to the sky above.

""Ish?"" she said said, surprised again to find she recognized the man right back. ""I didn't expect to find someone I knew here.""

Ish was broad and thin, like a piece of paper. He wrapped her up in pelican wing arms. ""You shouldn't,"" he said, smiling. ""Be more surprised to find a stranger. This is where we've all come to be. An unofficial settlement of sorts.""

""So your...?""

Ish nodded, putting a finger to his lips. ""We don't brood here. That's the number one rule.""

Amara looked around. He was right. She *did* recognize more and more of the people sitting at the tables. They had changed, though none had aged. Styles had changed. Aesthetics. And perhaps there was a weariness there that Amara had only before seen in the mirror. 

""What are you all doing here, if not brooding?""

Ish laughed. ""Well, I suppose you can brood a *little*. In truth, we simply support each other. I think it was difficult for most of us to find real sympathy wherever else we had been. That's to be expected. Who else could understand but one of us?""

Amara nodded. She hadn't realized how much that had played a part in her decision to come to the city; how desperately she desired someone to understand her.

""Will you sit with me?"" said Ish, gesturing to his table. ""The sun is about to set. Or... is that too much like brooding?""

""I won't pretend it's not part of why I came,"" said Amara, taking a seat. ""Is it really *that* much better than anywhere else?""

""You'll think you can touch them,"" he said, his smile slipping just so. ""Just... reach out and cup them in your hand.""

""Ah,"" said Amara. ""Good.""

""There's some debate on that,"" said Ish. ""Is it *good*? Or are we all just punishing ourselves? I think some may even hold out hope that they'll just turn around and come back. Wouldn't that be something? If they all just... came back.""

Amara nodded. ""They never will.""

""I know.""

""I don't think we were wrong to stay.""

Ish tilted his head. ""I wish I had that kind of conviction.""

""When did she die?"" asked Amara.

Ish shook his head, as if he couldn't remember. ""Ten... fifteen years ago.""

""Don't pretend.""

""Thirteen years ago this August,"" said Ish. ""The grief should be gone by now. But it isn't. And it may never go away. I'll be stuck here, without her, forever. That's why it's hard to see it your way some days...""

""I didn't suggest that my way was the right way,"" said Amara. ""But I believed something once with great conviction. I made a very hard choice. And I reaped all the rewards any rational being could expect to reap. The things that came later were always a part of the deal. It's unfair to the person I was to question that decision. It's unfair and it's cruel.""

""The whole thing is pretty cruel, when it comes right down,"" said Ish. ""But you're right. Helen was worth it. I would never insult her memory by suggesting anything else.""

The world was plum purple and darkening quickly. Amara wondered at all the shades of darkness you lost in the city. A black rainbow, descending into pitched, pure darkness. 

""I'm not perfect, either,"" said Amara. ""I still wonder, sometimes. I still sit on the fire escape and look up and wonder where they are and what it might have been if I'd gone. What I might've seen. Who I might've become.""

""They're there,"" whispered Ish, as the veil pulled back from a crystal white star field, near as a storm of dandelion seeds, clean and clear and *alive*. ""Just there, to the left, in that little triangle of nothingness. They're there.""

Amara had no words. She felt the gap as an aching, growing void, drawing her in, pulling her up, off her chair. She had no breath. She had no thoughts. All she felt was the sheer absolution of space. The quiet. The empty. A hole in the ice. Still and merciless and cold. 

She sat that way for hours. They all did. Some transfixed on the emptiness. Some the light. Some the glimmer. Some the subtle movement. 

""Helen told me to go,"" whispered Ish, as the dawn approached. Chairs had begun to scrape and shift, though most had stayed, to watch the night sky be swallowed up by the day.

""Michael, too,"" said Amara, blinking and cracking her neck. ""It weighed on him, right until he died.""

""Helen told me I had too much love to give to waste it all on someone like her."" Ish sighed. ""As if it's ever worked that way. Perhaps that's another curse. Our own hearts.""

""No,"" said Amara, standing up. ""That's always been what makes us unique. It's made us stupid and wise in equal measure. It drove us across the stars. And it's why you and I stayed behind. If we have a purpose in this universe, our capacity for love is the foundation of that purpose. I have no doubt about that.""

""What about our capacity for sorrow?"" said Ish, smiling once more. 

""You can't have one without the other.""

Ish nodded. ""Will you stay?""

""No,"" said Amara. ""I think I got what I needed. But I'll come back. I'll always come back.""

""And I suppose we'll always be here.""",WinsomeJesse

"[WP] Despite all your best efforts, the man refused to catch fire.",aquablah,"**A Promise of Fire**

He wasn't much to look at,  
But he attracted my gaze.  
Everything about him  
Set my heart ablaze.

The way he gently smiled,  
And laughed with the sky,  
Shared with me his kindness,  
I was so happy, I could die.

But no matter how I danced,  
And tried to steal his heart,  
Those kind eyes stayed ever cold,  
Our distance ever part.

I could never burn him,  
Or show my hidden flame,  
Though time could not snuff it,  
My fire mellowed tame.

Time tempered feelings,  
Revealed to me new sights,  
I began to see a new him,  
To ""him"" as day was night.

The sorrows in his brow,  
Scars that cross his palms,  
The way his strength wavered for  
Hauntings of his qualms.

I saw a man uncertain for  
Where fate would wash him next.  
Inbetween each glowing line,  
was cold beyond the text.

And yet, I did not mind;  
I fell in love anew.  
Where his life froze I wished to be  
The flame that thawed on through.

Slowly we two became,  
No longer wild and weak and cold,  
But something new and tame.  
Where he was timid, I was bold,  
He completed me the same.

Today we set our roots in earth,  
And join hands in a promise true.  
I'll cast my fire into the hearth,  
So I can tell him, ""I do.""",katherinesilens

Lucy's in another one of her moods. This one'll probably pass too. Probably.

""Fucking angels! You can't trust any of 'em and you know it!"" 

I glance down at the table. The big news headline of this week's paper: Miraculous cure for Grounders near completion!

I look up to see Lucy staring out the window at the horizon. The sun, sinking behind the city skyline, drowning the clouds above in fiery orange light. 
She's trying not to cry, but one sniffle and a single tear hitting the floor at her feet give her away. I get up and move to rest my hands on her shoulder blades. She tenses up but then relaxes slightly. Only slighty.

""You know, I think one of those bloody wingshits lives on the floor of this building? Screw that guy, am I right?""

Lucy smirks over her shoulder and lets her neck relax a little more. 
""You know what I mean! I'm serious, Sam. The whole thing's just stupid. A big money grab. It's gonna end up being expensive as shit an- And, you know this thing won't work for everybody...

She flexes her shoulder blades and I can feel them under my hands. The scars. It's been two years since Lucy was mugged flying home from work. The bastards didn't think she'd fight back. They clipped her right out of the sky when she did. The next day I told her I'd break my own wings right then and there to make her feel better. We've been together ever since. 

""Luce, I doubt every Fallen on earth is gonna want this cure as much as you think they will. And they haven't even released any explicit details about it. If you're good, you might find it under the christmas tree.""

""You're a dick. I'm not kidding... You still haven't flown in two years right? You ever miss it, Sam?""

""Nah. I gave it up for someone important.""
She smiled again. I'd pay a hundred feathers and fly across the atlantic for that smile.

""We've got to get our hands on one of those cures.""

A cruel entity had constrained him by woods near a cliffside that was cleverly disguised by surrounding vegetation. 

From an outsiders perspective, this trail he endlessely observed looked like an everyday foothpath for a seasoned hiker looking to get their feet wet. 

In a morbid sense, one would partially be correct sporting that rationale in this scenario but would probably end up with more than they initially bargained for.

Why? For straight ahead lies nothing short of a looming abyss. Rock bottom in both senses if you're unfortunate.

This is where a curse such as his reveals its deceptive nature. Besides his constant imobillity, this person may only utter one single word of warning. 

""End.""

If it were a different context, you might even consider this man a guardian of sorts. Someone who quells curiosity, and strays them away from his realm. But given he was cursed to a fate you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy, he would with time descend further and further into guilt then those who chose his path and got ensnared in it.

But despite it all he still remains standing.

"[CW] write me a story that doesn't include the word ""the""",panademi,"A tower rose from atop a grassy knoll. It was a tower made of blackened stone, a monolith rising to sit amongst clouds, and stars, and heavens. There were no doors, no means of entry, for a man to encounter. There were no signs of life, no great indication of humanity, amidst its dark, black, windowless walls.

Atop this tower, hidden among stars and clouds, a man toiled away; feverishly. Atop his monolith of seclusion, a magus, known simply as Altrue, resided. Sweat pooled at this magus’ brow. He breathed slowly. He stood in a stone room. Instruments, metal and glass, sat strewn about his laboratory; menacing devices and sinister instruments lay at his disposal. It was boiling hot; up above, a great pyre sat aflame, ever burning. Heat radiated down, warming this room of instrument and experiment to an almost unbearable point. Altrue didn’t mind this heat, he had grown accustomed to it.

Altrue had been born in this monolith of black stone. His birth, his creation from energies unknown to mere man, had but one simple mandate; to keep a funeral pyre for our world burning bright. Altrue attended to this fire religiously; with an almost fanatical zeal. But, as Altrue aged, time began to slow down. Altrue grew bored, and began to experiment.

Within numerous tight, sharp halls of his tower, his prison, his home, Altrue found something. Hidden away, locked behind trustworthy steel, Altrue found remnants of his creators. His gaze swept over artefacts long forgotten, lost to time. Alrue became obsessed with these tools of experiment and magic. He slowly forgot about his duty; a funeral pyre sitting above his head. He became consumed with experiment, with creation and destruction of forces unknown to mere mortals.

Curiosity and obsession led to madness and decay. Altrue began to lose his focus. He could think only of his experiments, his madness. He fell down a spiral, consumed by a terrible power put in front of him. Until one day.

Altrue looked up from his work. Something felt wrong, different. Altrue glanced frantically around his laboratory. Everything was in order, everything was in its proper place. Altrue frowned. Something was wrong. He paced around his laboratory. His feet shuffled and scraped against a stone floor. He frowned. Something was wrong, something was terribly, terribly wrong.

With a sigh, Altrue brought a hand up to wipe his sweaty brow. A frown, a look of horror, crossed Altrue’s face. There was no sweat on his brow. Altrue’s eyes widened. There was no sweat, no heat, no fire!

Altrue rushed out of his laboratory. He ran up stone stairs, desperate. An iron door slammed open. Altrue stood atop his prison, his stone tower. His burden, his responsibility, his funeral pyre, lay smoldering in front of him. Harsh winds caught at his robes. Altrue stood, thoughtless, gazing at his forgotten duty. There was no fire, there were no flames. Altrue fell to his knees, a whimper escaping his lips. It was to late to rekindle it.

A great, earth shattering sound, boomed out. A sharp crack, like thunder, cut across cloud and sky. Altrue looked up. Obsessed with his madness, he had forgotten his duty. A great tear, a deep chasm, opened up above Altrue’s head. Demons, monstrosities, unnameable beasts, poured from this chasm. Altrue shook his head. He had failed, in his madness, to keep our funeral pyre alight. And now, as endless hordes of monsters descended towards us, there was nothing more to be done, but cower and pray.

"[CW] write me a story that doesn't include the word ""the""",panademi,"He's sleeping. 

He's sleeping, so it's difficult to do much more than shuffle around in his sleep, become briefly aware, for a few minutes, of cold surrounding him. Of course, cold is always around him; such is life, when you live in a field in full-fledged midwinter.

He doesn't know what happens to him when it's not winter; he just knows that, every year, he wakes up again, coming alive to sounds of laughing and children and smiles. It's a little different, every year; last year, for example, he had no nose, and a few years before that his mouth felt empty without his trusty corncob pipe.

So, right, now he's asleep. He has brief moments of wakefulness, during which he perceives that it's...mid-October, he thinks. They're living in Maryland, so it's not snowing yet. He doesn't know how long he'll be in this state, or how long he'll stay. But he knows that—for now, at least—that's where he is.

He's asleep, but—with his moments of wakefulness—he sleepily attests that he must have a corporeal form again. He doesn't know where his body comes from. He's always assumed that children make it, but maybe not. Maybe it's an act of divine will.

All he knows, usually, is basic awareness: months passing, seasons changing, people moving by. So much, at least, for a world when there's a little bit of cold. When there's no cold, he doesn't know what happens; when there's cold but no snow, he lives, with his hard-packed, snowy little body, somehow. He still doesn't understand.

But that's all right, he thinks hypnagogically as he fades back into dreamless sleep. Soon it will be November or December, and once again he will be waking up.

""Mr. Snowman, are you all right?"" asks a voice.

He can tell that things have changed, since things are no longer like they were before. Words are there; there is an accent, perhaps not entirely unlike those he's used to. But it seems like an entirely different language. Being a snowman, Frosty can understand all tongues, though—like everything else in his life—he doesn't quite know why.

Either way, he rouses himself, looking down, seeing that little girl who has spoken to him. Her hair is bright golden blond, with a red ribbon threaded through; her eyes, a sparkling brown. She's about eight, and probably white. Bundled up in a red snowsuit, she's adorable, and normally everything is exactly as it would be otherwise; this is how it always happens. There's a house near them, too—brown with plain bricks and an elegant facade.

Except....

""I'm okay,"" he tells her, rolling his shoulders, shuffling his pipe in his mouth. It's good to have a pipe back again. He lifts a hand to adjust his top hat, pulls it low over his eyes. 

""Where are we? What year is it?"" Frosty asks, for he knows something has changed, though he can't say what. That language she's speaking...but not just that. Something is fundamentally different about this entire situation.

""Baltimore, Mr. Snowman,"" she replies. ""My name is Roll."" She hesitates. ""It's, um, it's, um....""

""My name is Frosty,"" he says while she ponders, wondering if education has changed, or maybe he's mistaken her age. Surely second-graders must now what year it is?

""It's 2452,"" Roll says at last.

""Oh,"" Frosty says. Normally, he would be awake and dancing a jig by now—he can already feel his carrot nose starting to twitch with excitement—but this development is far too unexpected. ""Last time I was awake, it was 2016.""

""I know,"" Roll replies. ""I'm sorry. There was a nuclear winter that year. We had to put you into storage.""

""Into storage?"" Frosty winces, imagining himself in a gigantic freezer. He doesn't remember any of that at all; clearly, cryogenic advancements must have been a huge thing, back when it was...three hundred years ago.

""Yes, we froze you,"" Roll says. ""Well, we didn't. I guess those scientists did. I don't know. My dad works for them.""

""Oh,"" Frosty says. If one same scientific organization can still be around three hundred years later, then surely things can't be that bad?

""Nuclear winter?"" he asks her.

""Well, it's over now. It ended two years ago,"" Roll says. ""But they thought it would be good to wake you up only after they were sure everything was safe.""

""Oh,"" Frosty says again. Such a bright child, he thinks distantly; he's still in shock.

""But look, I'm excited because there isn't going to be any snow during summer this year,"" Roll says. ""I'm finally going to be able to see a tree with green leaves."" She grins, laughing, and claps her mittened hands together. ""Frosty, do you want to see all of this with me?""

""Of course, child,"" Frosty replies. He moves forward, bending down to put his arms around her. ""We're going to have lots of fun this year.""

Roll grins, clapping again, and tells him that she's sure her scientist father will be able to keep him nice and cold, even when it's warm outside. She darts into that house next to them, and appears a moment later, carrying a scarf for Frosty's bare neck.

""You're going to need this,"" she says, and he takes it from her, wrapping it reverently around him, in gap between his two snowballs. She watches him, her gaze expectant. ""Do you like it?""

And Frosty nods, bending down to hug her again. ""I love it."" 

He doesn't know what's happened—and he certainly doesn't like it, that he's magically lost three centuries' worth of memories, experiences, without his knowledge, let alone consent—but, as long as he can attend to his usual task, of playing with children and young ones, he knows that he can still attend to his calling in life. He can still have some great measure of happiness.",rockwell78

Rolling waves of snow-white foam
Moving almost motionless
On a bright, sunny blue canvas.

Among those puffy white floating waves
And look to a dark chaotic blur
Composed of my disjointed world?

Slow and Long. I try to gauge their faces and all I see is nothing. They give away nothing.

My mind races with scenarios that might happen now. 

I calmly go and sit at my cubicle pretending nothing ever happened. A smile to satisfy them. I open my computer to do my work as usual and then she comes walking in. 

She.Is.Just.Heavenly.

My mouth stitches itself at the sight of her and for the first time, it seems she has noticed me. I unstitch my mouth.

""You've never told me you were a such a big celebrity"" saying with an expression of awe.

""Well that's the first I am hearing of it too, I did it for you, though. I heard you had a thing for rich men. This was the quickest way to you know, invade your heart "" I said.

""You want to fuck me?"" she said putting her leg on the table.

I am shocked at this sight but content. This is what I really deserve so I put my hands on the table next to her shiny long legs and.....

I am secured with handcuffs. She is not standing next to my table, just watching from afar what is transpiring here. Aloof, with an expression of pity rather than the one I was imagining.

[WP] The average day of a Men in Black intern.,triotone,"I rose from my bed, rubbing my eyes. Today was the end of my month-long training at MIB, and I plan to make a good impression with the suits.

I brushed my teeth with the special ""anti-alien paste"" the trainer, Jim, gave me. It tasted a lot like horse boogers and mint, for some reason. Ignoring the foul taste in my mouth, I washed up with my antibacterial skin cleanser. I was put on that regimen after a litte... accident... involving samples of E. Coli and ""PUG DISEASE"" (discovered by Frank, hence the name).

Donning my new suit, I grabbed my neuralyzer and rushed out the door. I hope I get to use it. It looks really fun. As I stepped into my car, my Black Phone vibrated.

**INCOMING CALL FROM: J**

Oh god, no. They only call rookies when something bad is happening to them. Trying not to sound panicked, I answered the call.

""Hello?""

""Hi this Frank I have J's phone pick up dog treats kay?!""

wut.

""Excuse me?""

""DOG TREATS!""

""Uh... okay, Frank. How do you like your treats?""

""Rolled in bologna!""

""Gotcha. Does J want anything while I'm out?""

""Lemme see. JAY, YOU WANT ANYTHING FROM THE INTERN?!""

I heard indistinct muttering in the background.

""He says he wants coffee, two sugars, no cream.""

""Alright. Will that be all, Frank?""

""Pick me up a Baha Man CD.""

I'm not even going to ask.

*Two hours and twelve coffee calls later*

I finally made it to MIB HQ, after taking a dive into a... uh... wrong porta-potty. Note to self: don't tell M that I dropped his coffee into the porta-potty.

Slowly, I proceeded down the hall, carefully holding sixteen coffee cups, trying to avoid shots from K's gun. I pondered the one big question: why did I apply here?! WHY DO I HAVE TO DODGE BULLETS WHILE BRINGING COFFEE?! 

And then it hit me. The shot from K's weapon, not the answer to my question. As it all faded to black, I heard my sendoff to the afterlife, courtesy of J: ""Damn, he spilled my coffee.""

[WP] The average day of a Men in Black intern.,triotone,"In the beginning, Zed made it look like every day would be like the first day at work. With the plethora of civilizations out in the galaxy suddenly discovering that Earth was a relatively safe vacation spot, nearly hidden away in the far extremes of the galaxy, every day was a guarantee that we'd see a new alien species attempting to make it thru MiB's Office of Interplanetary Customs and Immigration Assimilation. That's where I was assigned on my first day. It's been 10 years. And I'm still an unpaid intern, sort of. Let me explain.

It began on my first day, and as I think back on it, this day belongs in a TIFU post but regardless, here we are. I made the mistake of asking a cute blonde out on a date virtually 5 minutes after Zed left me alone at my post at Customs. He simply gave me my very own alien language translator to be placed in my ear and then said the job is pretty self explanatory. I saw a long line of aliens waiting to be scanned, examined, finger printed, follicle hair collected, scale chipped for ID, spit collected, and anatomically resized down to acceptable levels to better aclimate to Earth's gravity. The manual at my post had a specific direction for what was required of every type of known alien. 

The first alien was of a hairy blue lizard humanoid type and all I needed from it was a sample of his skin scales. Easy enough right? It seemed like it had gone thru this rigeramerole a few times and I took his sample, asked if it had anything to declare, and it said something I didn't at first understand but what my inner ear translation device said was ""is it sunny today?"" To which I replied ""yes"". And then it walked away.

Standing behind it was the aforementioned cute blonde. Her name was Plena and she was one of those ultra rare cases of a foreign system born human. She was human... but not of this world (and I mean that in every sense of the term, you get me?). Tall, blonde, svelt, peak physical shape, equally sized size C-cup bust, and just my luck, she was wearing shorts. Those legs! My god (not that I believe in one) but my god her legs! I was smitten upon seeing her and when processing her information, i asked her out 

""What are you doing in the city later?""

She nervously smiled back and replied ""you"".

Ok so that immediate answer should have taken me aback because who says that?! And yet, my heart started racing and I casually pressed my ear to make sure what I heard was really a human saying ""you"" and not some scrambled translation of an alien language being spoken by her. 

""I'm sorry what are you doing in the city later?""

""You"" she replied back. 

I turned to my sides and saw the other guys working the posts minding their own business, tending to their own line of aliens. I looked behind me and noticed Zed was back up in that oval shaped office of his. I then looked at Plena and smiled. Quickly I jotted down my House number and told her to give me a call. She smiled as she walked away and again said ""you"". And she winked. I mean, come on. That's a sure sign right guys? Of all the signals a woman can make, that's gotta be up there in the sure-thing-I'm-getting-laid-tonight signals from a woman. An out of this world beautiful blonde woman. 

I rush through my day, processing every alien as fast as I can. We don't have a time limit at Customs. MiB has a preset number of aliens they admit each day and then we at Customs have to process them and our day is done when our respective line of aliens have been processed. Some days go by fast, some days they drag on... depending on the type of alien and their specific circumstance. But on this first day, my shift ended in 3 hours. It was now 5 pm and I wanted to run home and check my answering machine. Zed said I could go home, patted me on my back on my first day. Done. I ran the bleep home. 

My answering machine had one message. I pressed the button. ""You"" is what I hear. It was Plena. Saying ""you"" again. Weird huh. Then my phone rings and I pick up. I don't even bother to say hello or ask whose calling. I know it's her. (No one has ever called me on this new number that MiB had set me up with a few days before my first day so I knew it had to be her.) ""Plena?! Where are you?""

""You?! I am Park Ave. you!!""

""Where in park ave? Are you lost? What street number do you see?""

""Park ave. you. Wallorf. You""

""You're at the Waldorf? You're by the Waldorf you mean. I'm coming"". Geez it doesn't get any easier does it. So I run out, hail a cab, and make my way to the Waldorf Astoria. She's in the lobby. Dressed same as I saw her. She winks at me. 

""You""  she says. 

So what'd I do. I go to reception, book us a room. We go to the elevator, up to our room.... and then royally do the deed that I haven't managed to do in 2 years with even the most average looking earthling girls. Next morning, I noticed she's still asleep but I need to be at work in one hour. I quickly shower and then write a note telling her I left. 

Upon arriving MiB headquarters, Zed and Kay meet me at the elevator and zap me with an anatomically shrinking gun. I become the size of a dime and Zed places me in his front shirt pocket and tells me to stay quiet. I place my face against the fabric and barely make out that Zed and Kay are now face to face with the first hairy blue lizard alien I had processed the day before. Kay begins to speak

""No he's not made of money, the kid didn't even finish high school. The only reason we hired him is because his fan fiction posts on the internet were getting a little too accurate and it kind of spooked the Hrbshhtiiudhyyeeesh royal family that we were on to them. Had to shut the kid down, took him in and gave him a boring job""

Zed then chimed in. ""He's not someone too bright, not up to our standards. And so we had him blasted away to that penal colony asteroid belt you all love so much. He won't last a minute. Problem solved""

The blue alien then took his turn to speak. ""I will find he who make sunny"" he then walked away

Zed takes me out of his pocket and zaps me again, bring me back to regular size. Though my pants feel bigger. ""You messed up big time, kiddo""

""You are one lucky son of a bitch he didn't catch you in the act."" Kay said with the most disgruntled tone I've ever heard the man speak. ""You're going to work for free for the next 10 years, plus another 5 at the post in Venus, so that when he comes back, you have enough saved up to pay the dowry""

""The what?!""

""You bedded his daughter. But you didn't pay the dowry. He came to earth to find a well off man to marry his adopted daughter. He asked you, and you said yes. You took his daughter, did god knows what, don't even bother to tell me the details because I assure you son, there are things you DONT remember about your little romp with that cute gal. But you didn't pay the dowry""

""I'm confused"" I say. ""When did I agree to anything he said""

Zed then turned to me and asked ""dont you remember what he said to you yesterday? He asked if you were to be his son in law. You said yes. Why in the hell would you say yes?!""

""He asked if it was a sunny day. Sun. Sunny day. That's what I said yes to""

Kay then started laughing. ""Oh sorry about this son. It's these damn inner ear translators we got from the MiB Chinese division. Zed i told you we should stick to our American manufacturers. Those Chinese have only been in contact with our out of town friends for barely a year. They don't know what they're doing"" he kept laughing. ""Son, you're about to become a father and sweet little Plena is gonna have a nice life living and raising your child at the Waldorf.""

""Wait... huh?"" I say

""Son, while her father is off trying to find you in the asteroid penal colony belt, that's only going to take him 2 days in his time. In earth time, that's 20 years. When he comes back upon realizing we tricked him, which he won't have any hard feelings about by the way, you'll have saved up enough to pay the dowry. In his system, the son in law pays the bride's father. It's how he's made his fortune. Human girls are a high commodity around the galaxy. But don't misunderstand. He's a devoted father to each of his daughters, but a businessman first""

I was still confused but then managed to ask ""why did she keep repeating the word 'you'!""

Zed replied with his signature snark. ""She wasn't saying 'you'. She was asking 'you?!', as in saying 'really? You? Are you serious!"" He then started laughing. Kay joined in. ""It's going to be ok son. Your kid will grow up just fine. On earth. She agreed to marry you. It's official. First wedding ceremony at MiB. Guess there's a first time for everything."" He then reached into my ear and removed the ear piece and threw it on the ground and stepped on it. ""Here. Take mine. you horny son a bitch"". He and Kay then walked away, laughing hysterically as I went back to my post. 

And that, kids, is how I met your mother. ",Ttatt1984

"[WP] One day, scientists have come to a stunning realization that the mitochondria is NOT the powerhouse of the cell. Instead, they discover a new, strangely sentient cell component that has never been seen before.",xaislinx,"Can't tell how deep your understanding of biology goes because of the powerhouse meme, so I'll say it anyway.  

Mitochondria probably came to exist when a cell engulfed a tiny bacteria (the mitochondria precursor) but for some reason failed to digest it. Instead of being a burden, the mitochondrion just continued existing, protected inside the cell, and happened to leak out some of the high-energy ATP molecules that it produced from ADP and O2 already in the cell.  
The mitochondria precursor would have been more efficient at making ATP, probably, than the engulfing cell. The cell gets a big advantage in terms of evolution, and from then on it was a fixed symbiotic relationship.  

Modern mitochondria are totally dependent on their ""host"" cells, and have swapped chunks of DNA over time. You might already know about maternity tests that use mitochondrial DNA because it's separate to your nucleus'; and egg cells pass on mitochondria but not sperm cells.  
Modern mitochondria are more efficient at delivering their ATP to host cells, and host cells take care of their mitochondria in multiple ways. It's technically a part of the host because of how integrated they've become.

Mitochondria are by no means sentient, but it's pretty cool that they weren't always an organelle of cells.",Ezombio
"[WP] The wind was picking up, as it did every night, and it carried the sound of the massive machines on the horizon.",AsciiFace,"It was Bravo Lance's turn for patrol duty, and that meant Lieutenant Oleg Federov was out on the midnight desert at the helm of his *Raven.*

Nathaniel Deshler couldn't visually see him, obviously. But he saw Oleg and the three other 'Mechs on the holomap which illuminated the darkened command room in a sapphire blue glow. They were currently close to Grid Marker KZ3, just along the deep gulch which delineated the western boundary to Taurus Territorial Industries' holdings on the continent of Siren. Too steep for conventional vehicles, the gulch provided a natural barrier against any would-be intruders. But BattleMechs equipped with jump jets would have found the incline to be of little trouble and that fact made it worth maintaining patrols towards that side of the complex. 

""How's it hanging, Rook?"" Deshler asked over the unit's encrypted comm channel. Clifton's Rangers' tradition of giving ranking officers fitting sobriquets had existed for long as there'd been Rangers. An avid chess player and *Raven* pilot, the nickname came easy. 

""...Peaceful as a psalm out here, Nate,"" Federov's replied. ""Big sky, bright stars- makes me wish I'd brought my camera."" 

The corner of Deshler's mouth quirked. ""You don't own a camera.""

""You're right,"" said Federov. ""Correction: Makes me wish I had *bought* a camera.""

""Alright then, Rook. Keep me posted if you see anything unusual.""

""Copy that, Deadeye. Don't stay up too late or else Doc Fletcher will give you hell. Bravo One out.""

Nathaniel stepped away from the comm-system, putting his hands in the pocket of his jacket. For the past two months Clifton's Rangers had been garrisoning TTI's factories on Sterope as insurance against pirates or other raiders. So far it had been a success. Their contract stretched for another ten months with an additional year included if both parties agreed. They'd just finished acclimatizing to the world and working their way through the lay of the land surrounding their charges. After the Massacre on Taygeta the Rangers could use a little rest and recuperation. So why was he feeling uneasy?

A small window cut in the bulkhead gave Deshler a view out over the Taurus Terrorities' factory and the endless starry night above. The manufacturing plants never ceased their production of military materiel even after the sun had set. He had memorized the factory's layout perfectly and knew at a glance what each building was for. There was the foundries, where raw metals and alloys were smelted down to create chassis and armor plating. That long one with the series of storage warehouses was where they built Hunter light support tanks. Across the rail yard was the *Seydlitz* Aerospace Fighter facilities and its short length of tarmac. Add in the scores of other buildings and factories and it was a humbling sight.

"[WP] The wind was picking up, as it did every night, and it carried the sound of the massive machines on the horizon.",AsciiFace,"The funeral of Elder Mak

The moonlight shone down upon the lake, reflecting off the galvanized metal roofs of huts on stilts. Children ran gleefully in the semi-dark, occasionally tumbling off a bamboo walkway with a splash. Teenagers swam through copses of tall green tendrils, away from the prying eyes of their mothers. Elders sat on porches, staring out at the horizon, rocking slowly back and forth as they whittled their spears.

The wind was picking up, as it did every night, and it carried the sounds of the massive machines on the horizon.

Elder Mak squinted his large gray eyes at the horizon. He pulled a retractable telescope from his satchel of relics. The machines had gotten closer. He could see their metallic gleam. He stuck two fingers in his mouth and whistled. 

The young people let out a collective groan, swimming back to the boardwalk and climbing out of the water. Children’s feet slapped against the walkway, making it bounce. Everyone flocked to the central shelter, built of stone in the center of town.

One by one, the Elders stopped by Elder Mak’s porch to hand him their spears. They stared into his gray eyes, reflecting on the challenges he had seen, the triumphs, the loss, the joy. They owed him their lives—when the machines had come for them, he had sheltered them on his barge. He had brought them far from civilization, out of the range of the machine’s fuel cells. For decades, they had prospered in peace.

An old woman with long gray hair and a kind smile touched Elder Mak on the shoulder. “May you die tonight with glory,” she said.

Another woman, brow furrowed with wrinkles kneeled down to grab his hand. “May you die tonight with glory,” she said.  

One by one, the rest of the elders kneeled before him and wished him a glorious death. Elder Mak bowed his head in thanks. They slowly filed away towards the stone shelter, leaving him alone on his high observatory tower. He counted his spears and peered once more through the telescope.

“Wait!” he called.

Only one woman heard him. She stopped and turned as the others kept walking.

“Elder Yoon,” Mak said. She came closer.

Mak compacted his telescope and placed it in the satchel of relics. He pressed the satchel into Elder Yoon’s hand.

“I am sorry,” Mak said.

“Me?” Yoon asked, “But why am I next? I am not the eldest.”

Mak sighed. “You have had a long life,” he said.

“I’d like a longer one,” Yoon said.

“And I wouldn’t?” Mak said, angrily. “I haven’t much time left, and I don’t want to waste it on you.”

“There are rules,” Yoon said, “You should know. You made them.”

“The Gods made them,” Mak said, “I am merely their conduit.”

The wind grew stronger. 

“Elder Fan is next in line,” Yoon said. She paused. “Or did you forget the age of your eldest *wife*?”

“The Gods—” Mak began.

“The Gods aren’t real,” Yoon shouted. “You made them up because you can’t face the truth. I may not be as old as Elder Fan, but I’m old enough to remember the day you destroyed the radios.”

“The machines were listening to us!” Mak said.

“Those were *humans* talking to us,” Yoon said.

The machines grew larger on the horizon.

“There were shelters—underground shelters that we could have gone to,” Yoon said. “Real shelters, with doctors, schools, and electricity,” her voice broke.

“Electricity is heresy!” Mak said, “The Gods will punish—”

Yoon grabbed a spear and pointed it at him. “You kidnapped us,” she said, “We thought you were rescuing us, but you kidnapped us.”

“You were a child,” Mak snarled, “How would you know?”

“I remember,” Yoon said, the spear shaking in her hands.

“And you kept silent all this time?” Mak said.

“Who would have believed me?” Yoon said, “By the time I was grown, I was your wife. Just like everyone else on that ship.”

She shoved the spear into his chest. He looked down and stared. Was she right? Had he invented the Gods? No, surely not. The Gods demanded a sacrifice every night. It was how they had lived for years. Decades. Yoon had gone soft in the head. All of the Elders had gone crazy. That was why the Gods wanted them sacrificed. That was the order of the universe.

He collapsed to the deck of his tower, clutching at the spear in his chest.  He looked up at the machines as their shadows passed in front of the moon. Yoon’s footfalls echoed in the distance. The machines descended towards him, their engines roaring with the fury of the Gods.

“At last,” he breathed, staring into the mechanical eye of a marauding deathdrone, “I look upon the face of my maker.”

The deathdrone shot a red gout of flame across the black sky, to purify Mak’s soul.

""Ok this is seriously creeping me out. You need to get away from me right now.""

""I'm sorry. I was never a good talker. I'll leave you with this - You reached for me ten times. You won't have to, when the time really comes.""

What the hell is happening here? ""How... How did you know that?"" I spluttered. ""Nobody knows that number.""

""Except me. I saw you, heard you. I felt your anguish. It was the hardest thing I had to do, to leave you there when all you wanted was me.""

[WP] You've been sentenced to die by being locked in a cage in the middle of a hot empty desert.,Bobert343,"I woke up, or at least the closest thing to that, because all the chloroform was wearing off. When I opened my eyes, I could see … nothing, it was black. 

So I must be inside something. That also explains why I am so cramped in here. Let’s feel the walls, and… given that the room is so small, lets say… a meter approximately in each dimension, that means I can’t stand up. No problem, i’ll sit. 


Wait, chloroform? disregarding of the ‘smells like chloroform’ cartoon gag, if it could, it did right now. So it’s probably not the government that’s doing this. And since I can’t remember anything else, I cannot speculate about who did this.


But I need to get out. So how? 


Pushing against the walls doesn’t help- they’re metal. But metal conducts heat and… yup, one was is definitely hotter than another. Which means that 1- this is in the sun, and two- it’s probably early in the day. 

And the sun rises in the east, sets in the west, and that means that North is, from the center of the box, the corner in the forward left. 

So how could I die? I need to run this calculation as it sets a timer on whatever plans I have. 


Now that my eyes are better adjusted, I can see small gaps in the metal. So then I probably won’t die from Co2 inhalation. I could, however, die from heat. So “early in the day” could mean anything from 6:00 to 9:00, but in any sense, i’d probably die by noon. So in the worst case scenario, I have 3 hours. begin.


Let’s take an inventory, shall we? 
General clothes, sweatshirt- should probably take that off- small package of food from my uncle, a brown paper bag, a phone charging cable, but no phone. A laser pointer held together with a rubber band, chapstick, a screw, and a pad of paper, which I am writing this down on, with a pencil. And a backpack. Not too shabby, i think.


It makes me wonder why they left me with so much stuff. Hehe.


First thought is that metals expand. Given that the walls are made of metal all the way through, they’ll expand due to the heat and might crack. Estimated success: 5%

Okay, not good enough. Think harder, brain.
Jamming anything into the gap is not a good idea- ill lose that item and simultaneously break it- except the screw.

So what If I jam the screw in the faint hole? It pushed the crack open a little, but not enough. Nice try.

Well, let me think of something else- Ill just rest against the wall.

Uh- not a good idea- the whole box tipped over. But a few granite pebbles made their way through. Ive seen that before in Joshua Tree Park, so thats one point for me. 

So I could push the pebbles back out, giving me more leverage. Wait. The box is all metal, and I can feel that most of it is welded from the inside. But it can’t be welded from all sides, or I would never have gotten in here. So what did they use? Duct tape? And sure enough, I can see that one side of the box is shut without welds. And through the cracks, the silver stuff is holding the box together, at least 8 strands. And with a breaking strength of ~70 lbs each (thanks Mythbusters!), I don’t have enough strength to escape. That’s fine- wasn’t planning on it anyway.

So from what I can remember, duct tape is recommended to be used from 20 to 200 degrees. Whether thats in Celsius or in Fahrenheit I can’t remember. So assuming I’m in Joshua Tree Park given the gravel, a desert -ish in July, and would be hot enough to cook an egg. That’s definitely at least 200F, but I can’t wait that long for the duct tape to fail. So let’s kick it up a notch or 7. I could take apart the phone charging cable, and hook it up to the laser pointer batteries to - if not explode, make a ridiculous amount of heat. Definitely enough to set duct tape on fire, and assuming that the cloth used to make the tape is similarish to paper, its autoignition temperature is at 451 degrees Fahrenheit. Kudos to Ray Bradbury. 

So after half an hour trying to get the wires out of the cable, it’s really starting to heat up here. I have taken off my sweatshirt(duh) and I use my shirt as electrical and thermal insulation, as the metal box is heating up too. So here it goes. I jammed the battery into the open space so that the two metal plates contacted, then I backed up as far as I could in a 1m^3 box. It sparked a little, and I cheered profusely. The duct tape was set on fire, and i used the heel of my shoe to force the battery out. Okay, 2 batteries left.

It seemed to work the same on the second corner, but when I tried to force the metal out, the duct tape stayed in place. I could force it out a centimeter or two, and felt sorry for anyone who had to listen to my mixed measurement units. the tape was burnt, yes, but not disintegrated. I just used my pencil then to poke holes in the duct tape.

And just like that i was home safe! Story is done. Nope. Not a chance. So I step out of the box, with all of my stuff in tow. I kick the box for good measure. Ow. Don’t do that. Too late. 

I see my phone a few meters away, as they apparently discarded it just after they dropped me in the desert. It doesn’t work- it’s too hot. So I put it under a sweatshirt, and headed for the nearest shade. Which would work if the shade wasn’t several [miles or kilometers] away. And also, by the time I would have gotten there, the sun would have moved, and the shade would disappear. So I have to make my own shade. But hey, I have the box. And the unrelenting sun, which is just great. Not sarcasm, by the way. By the height of the sun, I think it’s about 9, which would push my worst case scenario back by about an hour. So 3 hours to die. Fun times.

I rip off the remaining duct tape off the box, which is about 4 strands. The front metal plate falls off. I lean it against the side of the box next to the open face, with much difficulty. So now I have shade. I place the phone in the shade, on top of the sweatshirt to protect it from the hot ground.

And after another half an hour, I attempt to turn it on. No dice, still too hot. I try spitting on the back of the phone, wiping it around, and blowing the liquid off, in an attempt to simulate sweating. After ten more minutes of this, It finally boots up.

 AT&amp;T, 1bar of service. That’s all I need.

The ship automatically open our pods and switch its controls to manual.

Walter is the first to react, jumping out of the pod and running to the console that only he and Amanda know how to use. I shake my head, yawning and coming out too, like most of my crewmates. I go to the screen and look at the stats on it. The course has veered to only God knows where. I touch it, looking for disturbances but everything is okay… or maybe I don’t know how to solve it. I shouldn’t be here after all. I start to sweat slightly. 

“Any trouble?” asks Keiko, using my shoulder to prop herself up.

“No that I can see.” I just have to keep my cool, if there’s some problem, Keiko will know it. She touches the screen too, slicing her finger all over.

“You’re right.” I smile to her, a bit cockily if I must say so.

“Told you so.” Keiko laughs, hitting me playfully on the arm.

“Shut up!”

“Oi! You two! Lovebirds! Need a hand over here!” shouts O’Leary. Keiko blushes at what’s she’s implying and I cast my gaze down, going to her. Inside the pit there’s Carlos, holding a flashlight in his mouth and looking pointedly at some cables and panels. “You, Alex, go down there and help him. Keiko, you stay with me and help me with the accommodation of the pod’s protocols”

I jump inside the pit with Carlos and look at what he’s looking. He takes the flashlight from his mouth and look at me.

“Someone has tampered with her.” Whispers. “I don’t really want to tell anyone, but O’Leary insisted that I needed some help and, well, you see, she’s afraid of the dark, I couldn’t make her come here, could I?” I denied with my head. “Who could have done this?” wonder Carlos out loud, stroking his beard. 

And suddenly, I got nervous. There’s one thing all the guys here have in common: A beard. But I don’t have one of my own.

"[WP] You're a martial artist who can see into the future. You are considered the best in the world, until your next opponent is someone who can read your mind, including the future you see",Hydralpha,"Bashing a sword at someone was not as simple as it looked. 

He held his blade up, lunging at his opponent. He saw his master's blade rise, deflecting his own in a ringing screech of steel. 

""Try harder!"" 

There was the training that was necessary to perfectly execute intended movements and to build stamina for swift action. There was the need for decisiveness and improvised planning to get past an opponent's guard. 

Or something like that. 

""Pay attention!"" 

He did train, sure. But it was very boring and he got distracted. His shishou kept scolding him for daydreaming when he was supposed to do his katas. 

""Ando...Ando?"" 

He wasn't daydreaming...he was just seeing himself do the same action over and over again before he actually did it over and over again. 

He always saw what he was about to do. It was a bit distracting and confusing sometimes. Like now when his master's hand was coming down on his head. 

He stood there and took the blow, rocking slightly on his heels. ""What?"" he scowled, irritated. 

She sighed at him, massaging her temple with her free hand. ""You are without doubt one of the most impossible students I have ever had the displeasure to teach, Ando."" 

He looked at her, watching her walk away before she actually did. The conversation he was supposed to have annoyed him and he let out a snort. 

It went something like this, as far as he could tell:

'Why can't you focus and put your all into your fight? You lack the spirit of a proper fighter!' 

And he'd say: 'Who cares if I have 'spirit'? I can beat all your other apprentices already right?' 

Then she'd hit him on the head again and say, 'Go and practice your katas! We'll spar again when you're ready to take this seriously!' 

'I am taking this seriously!' he'd lie. 

'You little brat! Get back here!' 

He didn't like that conversation. He really wanted to avoid it, in fact, so he stuck his tongue out and ran away into the bamboo forest as she yelled indignantly behind him. 

He ran throught the sunlit forest, quickly losing her as he crawled through the narrow gaps in the undergrowth.

""Pfft. So much for a warrior's tenacity."" 

He didn't like it here. It was so much better being at the orphanage where he could just laze around all day. Since he could see what could happen next it had been so easy to just find good hiding places whenever the matron wanted him to go do some boring chore. 

Instead he was stuck with Kurayama Tomoe, renowned swordsmaster, training to be a soldier under the Emperor's command after she'd spotted him fighting in the streets. The hag had a weird tendency to chase after him no matter where he hid...and she knew he was too lazy to try to camp out in the forest to escape her.

""What have we here...?"" 

He jumped at the sound of the voice. He'd thought he was alone. ""Who's there?"" 

""A friend~"" 

A girl appeared amidst the bamboo. She looked to be about his age, although there was something strange about her he couldn't quite identify. 

It was in the strange golden tinge of her eyes perhaps, or her perfectly straight dark hair. She didn't look quitr human. 

More importantly, she was pointing a bladed fan in his direction. 

""Or maybe not."" she pursed her lips, ""You look troubled, little boy."" 

""I'm not little."" he frowned, ""Who are you and what do you want?"" his grip tightened around the hilt of his blade. 

He waited to see the answer she would give and the conversation they'd have. His eyes widened when he got nothing. 

Her eyes narrowed in interest. ""Naughty. Don't cheat like that, human. You'll take the fun away from things if you try to skip ahead to the end.""

""You're...what are you?"" he asked lowly. His hands trembled around the hilt of his blade. 

""Ah~ The right question at last."" She pulled her fan close, shielding her lips. ""Why don't you try and find out?"" 

He lunged. He saw that she would weave to the right and tried to stab at her opened guard only for her to weave to the left instead. She caught him by the shoulder and pushed him past her so that he nearly stumbled and tripped with the momentum. 

He felt the cold edge of her fan skim against the back of his neck before he could recover. He could feel the hairs she had cut fall against his neck. 

He swallowed. 

He trembled. 

He swept his leg out to trip her and swung his blade around. His vision told him she'd be caught at unawares so instead of completing the swing he leapt back in time to dodge her as her fan sliced the air between them. He knew now, she wouldn't be surprised. 

""Interesting,"" she purred, ""You've figured it out have you?"" 

He tilted his head, ""Either you can see the future as I can...or you're reading my mind perhaps."" he frowned, ""Either way, you aren't human. I'll have to hunt you down."" 

She giggled. The long sleeves of her kimono glinted with silver in the sunlight, ""Will you? Are you human then, to judge me so?"" 

He opened his mouth. He closed his mouth again. 

""Hmm. I guess you don't know, do you?"" 

He blinked and she vanished. He looked wildly around the clearing. A tinkling laugh met his ears. 

""Become a true warrior, swordsman. We'll meet again one day...""

"[WP] You were deaf since birth,however,after surgery you can hear perfectly. Whats the world like? And would you want to be deaf again?",KroegKind,"""She's waking."" I heard a voice say. I *heard*.

""Carmen?"" It was my mother. ""C-can you? You know, hear?"" The hesitation in her voice was unmistakable but I loved every word she said anyways.

I began to cry, for 16 years I'd never once heard my mother's voice, heard her say I love you. The world before was so quiet and now I heard the birds outside chirping their beautiful melody as I hugged my mother and she softly whispered ""I love you."" Into my ear. I could hear.

The next morning I woke up startled by my alarm. It had gone off so suddenly and blared so loudly I nearly had a heart attack, I guess I still had to get used to being able to hear. I went downstairs and grabbed eggs out of the fridge and began to make breakfast, the sizzling pan making me hungrier every second. 

I ate my breakfast in silence as usual until a new voice whispered into my ear.

""Don't trust them.""

I looked around but no one was there, I was all alone. I went to take a shower and as I stepped in the voice whispered again.

""They're watching, even now.""

I again looked around but nobody was there.

At school the voice kept whispering things like: Behind you, they're going to kill you, watch out, and don't look around.

The voice constantly got louder and harder to ignore. About a week later I realized what it was.

""Behind you, turn around, they're going to kill you.""

I spun around and a man with a knife was there.

""Don't be afraid, let him stab you.""

I started to run until I felt the metal of the blade sink into my back and blood well up around it.

""Don't cry, you're safe now.""

I fell to the ground, unable to move.

""She's our precious, we keep precious safe.""

I opened my eyes and woke up. I got out of bed and went downstairs and made breakfast. My alarm did not go off, the pan did not sizzle, the voice did not speak, I could not hear. But it had felt so real.",KarkatTheVantas

"[WP] You realize your life is being recorded as a TV show. The next day, you decide to change things up a bit...",Noareames,"“It’s just another day in the neighborhood!” as I always say and they typically eat it up. They love that line. The baker drops the bread and the shaggy, white terrier runs over and steals a baguette and the lady in the blue dress spins around as the dog circles her feet. She looks at me, and I blush. But today is different. I'm angry.

I had finally figured it out and stupidly I started to put two and two together and saw all the opportunities I had to see it sooner, but I was blind. The guy on the baseball team that tried to slip me that flash disk. They would accuse him of being a Russian spy. The girl who tried to get me to eat those mushrooms. She was arrested and they said she died from mushroom poisoning in jail and her parents were heartbroken.

Today I realized I controlled all of this… The stoplight turned as I raced through it. Coincidence? It was the 13th light I passed without so much as tapping the brakes. They were on to me at that point. 

Earlier I had stopped into Al’s for some pancakes and a weak black coffee. He greeted me with deep belly laugh and for the first time I didn’t laugh back. He looked surprised. 

“Are we really friends?” I asked. 
“Of course we are Bob! Of course we are,” he says dismissively towards Janet who was folding the silverware into napkin rolls. 
“What you going on about Bob?” she says.
“This isn’t real is it? All of this?” I say.
“Of course it is honey! What has gotten into your head?” Janet replies.

There were some patrons in the booth by the jukebox, they kept to themselves until I tossed a packet of butter their way. They didn’t get angry, they were just confused.
“You back there,” I yell their way, “Do you know me?” 
“No, I don’t… he doesn’t either. We’ve never seen you before.” The boy across from her drops his fork and looks over his shoulder like I’m going to shoot him. 
“Pick up that fork” I say. He does.
“Stab it through your hand.” 
Janet gasps. Al’s mouth opens wide without a sound. 
The boy looks at the fork and then at his hand.
“Uh, I really can’t do that,” he stutters.
“Ok then, eat her waffle.” I say pointing at the girl’s plate across from him. He looks at me sideways wondering if I said what I said, or maybe he thought it meant something else entirely, either way, he only took a moment but then shrugged her way and started eating her waffle.
“What do you think you’re doing telling him to eat my waffle?” 
I point a finger to the sky and she pauses. I look over to Al and gesture towards his shirt pocket. 
“Give me your sunglasses, Al.” he complies.
I fold them open, wipe the lenses on my shirt, put them on as suavely as I can manage.
“What am I doing?” I say. “I’m improvising.”

So that brings us here. It’s a standoff. The cops have me surrounded and I’m holed up here in the First National Bank. The tellers are all very nice and they’ve given me what they have. Mostly stacks of paper, but there’s some real money on top. 

I shot one guy when I pulled out my finger and went, “Bang!” He’s not dead, but he’s in pain and he’s been selling it for about 15 minutes straight. I asked the tellers to get him some water when he seemed to get a bit parched. 

“We got the place surrounded Bob.” Det. Massey growls through the bullhorn. “No one has to get hurt. Put the gun away and come out with your hands up.”

Don’t they know this is the end? This is the end of it all and I’m going out with a bang. I mime reloading my pistol and pump the forestock on an imaginary shotgun. 

“You! Come here!” I tell Dolores the librarian who came into the bank with her charity bikini car wash money. 

“Please, Bob! Don’t hurt me! I washed your car!” she says unconvincingly. 
“Don’t worry, we’re gonna have fun. You want to have some fun?” she smiled. 
“Sure. I hate this place anyway,” she purrs pulling out an imaginary… trombone? Must be some kind of rifle. Anyway, she’s prepared. 
“We’re going out on three... ready?” 
She nods.
“One, two… three.” 

And we’re off. Hand pistols flying, “Pow! Pow!” I yell, catching them all off guard. 
Three cops in my eyeline fall down with multiple gun wounds, some more delayed than others.
“Blam! Blam!” she says and one police officer in her eyeline rolls backwards into the fetal position. 
The cops shoot back, pow-ing and blam-ming as me and Dolores fire endless rounds their way, decimating their numbers as they fall one after another. I turn to Dolores with a smile (Why did I never notice her before? What regrets!) and her eyes look to me with fear. She’s hit. I watch her fall her eyes closed and her knees rolling under her carefully as someone only practiced fainting but not being shot. I shoot in every direction and a domino-effect of fallen bodies cascades in both directions. 

After putting the police chief out of his slow dying, monologuey misery, I stood as the last man. And when the lights came up on the town, and the crowd gathered around me, all the fallen stood back up and without a bow, we waited. For someone to yell cut.

[WP] He who makes a beast of himself takes away the pain of being a Man...,TheGeorge,"I was trying to drive through the night but it was so hot.  I was extremely uncomfortable in the heat of the car and the landscape was so barren and dull.  I wished I could come across a beautiful oasis to invigorate me but all that was visible was a desert, sandy landscape.  It almost felt as if the sand was taunting me.

My sanity had reached a breaking point and I just wanted to disappear.  I had asked for help so many times as lunacy crept up on me like hot lava pouring into my brain.  Like I was starting to burn with psychosis.  I'd tried drugs.  Socializing would have been better but my level of confidence left me on my own.  Literally no one could save me and I didn't want the attention anyway.

You know, come to think of it, I don't even know why people would rather live than die.  Some people even pray up into the clouds for some kind of help.  When it seems like that helps, half of us ignore it.  I ignore most of the solutions because I just cannot make things right.

I mean, I've known for a very long time that good ideas can be your undoing.  So disappear I shall, hopefully some will follow my lead.  They might think it's about self discovery and worth, but things aren't always what them seem.

I'll go start fresh someplace, hardened and beast like.  I'm much too weird and crazy to live, but we're all way too rare to die.

"[WP] You have the power to turn invisible, but somehow your skeleton becomes visible after 5 mins.",Zenos0541,"""Boo!"" Will flicked his arms up and jumped towards the gaggle of teenagers. A few screamed and hugged each other, before laughing and wandering away; an appropriate response to a living skeleton in a haunted mansion. Will grinned to himself. Well, he was always grinning like this, but he felt his lips twitch a smile. He enjoyed the gig, getting to use his 'talent' of semi-invisibility to entertain.  
  
Turning back to go to his resting cubby hole, he spotted one of the kids had stayed behind. Will hoped he wasn't one of those...  
""Really? A skeleton that goes 'boo'? That's supposed to be scary?"" Yep. He was one of those sneering kids that crop up sometimes. Well, he had a way of handling them.  
Standing up, Will stretched and cracked his neck, before turning to the kid.  
""Your friends seemed to find it scary."" A flicker of suprise had struck the boy, before the smirk returned to his lips.  
""So you're just a man in a suit? Not even animatronic? Lame.""  
Will stalked towards the boy.  
""Oh I'm a man alright."" He crouched down to become eye level with the boy.

""If you think I'm believing *that*, you're..."" the insult died on his lips as Will began to become visible.  
  
Across Will's skull, muscle and sinew started to form and stretch, creeping across until his bones were masked by them. Blood vessels were next, crawling across his face like fast growing ivy. Splotches of skin bloomed and spread, joining until Will was once more fully visible.  
Will glanced at the now trembling teenager, giving him a sorrowful glance before beginning starting the fade, back through the layers of the body to his skeleton.  
""A curse of undeath."" Will shook his head, before flicking up and staring intently at the lad. ""That can only be cured by passing it on to the next victim."" He raised his skeletal hand and stretched towards the boy, getting halfway before the teenager shrieked and fled, leaving a faint smell of urine.

"[WP] ""Sir?"" ""Yes, Peter?"" ""The humans have discovered our prototypes for New Earth. All seven of them. They're calling it the TRAPPIST-1 system.""",empire539,"Part of the fun of the unveiling was going to be showing the humans that another system with habitable planets existed so closely to their own. Now that part of the fun had been spoiled. But the rest of the surprise--seven habitable planets, each with a bountiful supply of resources, both those necessary for life and those necessary for technological advancement, each with a temperate climate, diurnal cycles like Earth's, and each built, by us, for the humans themselves--that part of the surprise was still yet to come.

The humans would still be taken-aback to meet us, to find out that they shared their galaxy with other intelligent life, intelligent life that not only knew about them, but wanted to welcome them into the intragalactic fold with the gift of interstellar travel and extra-terrestrial colonization. 

And they would still be thrilled to leave their polluted rock, to travel through the previously-uncharted and impossible-to-transverse void towards a new world, a new home, a new land of milk and honey, of plenty, and to set up civilization there. 

And they would still marvel at the landscapes and seascapes, the terrible mountains, the rolling hills, the heaving oceans we built for them there. They would wonder at the sky, coloured slightly differently on each planet during the day, in which would hang a red sun, and filled with the same superabundance of stars they were used to, a starry sky to remind them of home, at night. 

And they *will* rejoice, years into reconstructing their civilizations, each particular civilization on each planet, after having formed bands on each planet, creating flags and myths of patriotism, creating their own planetary nationalisms, to be given, each, the instructions for the construction of a terrible weapon, with a power unlike anything ever wielded by their species before.

And the fearful will tremble, and the warlike, bloodthirsty, will grin with glee, to be told that within one hundred years after landing, the humans from one of the seven planets will have to destroy the humans on the other six, and that only the first to create the weapon and use it on the others will survive and be truly welcomed by us into the intragalactic fold (and that if none of the seven manages to make and use the weapon within that hundred years time, we will destroy all seven, along with any stragglers still left on Earth). 

Our injunction will be: build and use the weapon, and join us, an ancient and warlike species, or fail to do so and be destroyed entirely.

I cannot wait to watch them scramble and fret upon hearing their fate, upon learning the true nature of their circumstances, upon learning about the game we have thrown them into, for their culling, edification, and improvement, and for our amusement.

We had called the system New Earth. But the name upon which the humans stumbled now seems more appropriate. But it will be many years before construction is completed, and many years after that before the first humans begin to arrive, so it will be many years before the humans realize that on New Earth, in New Eden, in the Trappist system, as they so prophetically have dubbed it, how trapped, utterly trapped, like hungry rats in cages, they truly will be.

"[WP] ""Sir?"" ""Yes, Peter?"" ""The humans have discovered our prototypes for New Earth. All seven of them. They're calling it the TRAPPIST-1 system.""",empire539,"God sat at his desk, shuffling through the reports on the Miracle on Ulica-34. It had been a relatively minor thing--he made a mythical figure in their culture come to life. It wasn't a total act of creation, since there had been someone who had looked similar to the ancient description who had died earlier that week. 

It had certainly made for a spectacle, though, and now there was a renewed vigor to the faith there. The reports in front of him, at least, seemed to say so. Considering everything that had been going on for the past few days, he viewed it as a matter worthy of celebration. 

He pressed the intercom button. ""Jesus."" 

""Yes, sir?"" His son's voice came through the speaker, and God felt a little warmer. The family arrangement had its rough spots, but Ulica-34 was more proof it was working out. 

""Ring up Dionysus for me. Let him know I want him to plan a celebration for the Ulica-34 success. Offer him the usual rate.""

""Understood, and Congratulations."" 

God sat back and turned to look out of the office window over the office park. It was the center of his administration--an astounding achievement of a campus, one that would have spanned a whole continent back on his trial planet--Earth. Inside that vast expanse were billions of workers, managing the affairs of hundreds of thousands of intelligent species. 

Some days, hell, a lot of the days, all that management was a nightmare of problems that forced God to float from one thing to the next, pushing him near to insanity. But there were a lot of good days, too, where things worked out and the system proved its worth. 

The intercom buzzed. 

""Saint Peter on the Emergency line. Something about Orbital Testing."" 

God felt his heart twist. Saint Peter had been a reliable manager for centuries. If he was calling on the emergency line about God's personal project?

""Put him through,"" God whispered, his rage seeping forth into his voice, casting it as a rough breeze that run over his desk. Pages ruffled and a loose sheet floated off the edge. 

There was a tone and Peter's voice came through.

""There's been a problem with the New Earth Program, sir. The humans have discovered it."" 

God let out a hissing sigh and more pages scattered about. 

""What happened?"" 

""They sent out a probe, and it happened to gather data on the prototyping system where we're working on the new Earth study. They've discovered all seven of the planets. It was the NASA organization again. They're theorizing that three of the planets may have the conditions for life."" 

""Damn, how do they keep doing this to us? How do they always discover something before they're meant to?"" 

""I've already sent a team to investigate. At the moment, though, the knowledge has been published."" 

God nodded, then took a deep breath. Peter was good. He had been proactive. 

God knew that his actions, and maybe more important, his timing had averted more than a few crises in the past. This was just another example of why he kept Peter where he was. 

But the humans created more drama than a one-planet species ought to. The damn beings kept pushing their noses into everything. God loved them, had a special place in his heart for them, but that didn't make them any less annoying when they made the attempt. 

""You said they've only discovered that three of the planets are life-bearing?"" 

""Yes, they've theorized that based on what their ideal 'habitable zone' is. But they have nothing on the atmospheric conditions. I doubt they'll be in the dark for long, since they can do those test using concentrated light."" 

God remembered that invention. it had been ingenious, and when he seen it showcased, he marveled at what the humans would be able to do with it. He wished he could have taken the credit for it directly, but he settled on having created the humans in the first place. Now, he cursed it.

""That'll give us some leeway. Damn, we should have never put the prototypes so close to them. It was just a matter of time..."" 

""fifty years ago, we wouldn't have even thought they would have gotten to the moon.""

""And then they did,"" God growled. 

 ""I think we made the right decision."" God wished he could share Peter's confidence. ""besides, other species could have found them a lot quicker than the humans."" 

That was a possibility, since there were a few other intelligent species that had already discovered space travel and were now spread over multiple planets. But god doubted whether they would have ever ventured into a region too far enough away. besides, God had tantalizing prizes for them much closer than any prototype Earth would be. 

""I suppose... thank you, peter."" 

""Of course, sir."" 

God took a few seconds to think. The fabrication systems should have still been safe. They were on the edge of the universe, away from any intelligent species. But all of the prototypes had to be close so they could mimic the local galactic conditions for their tests. 

Where better to prototype New Earths than close to Earth? 

God shook his head. Figuring out where the new prototypes would go wasn't something he needed to worry about now. 

""Call Job, tell him they need to pull out the plans for the seven prototypes again. We're going to have to restart somewhere else and rebuild,"" God said.

""That's going to be a lot of lost time, sir. Do you think they'll still be ready in time?"" 

""It's cutting it close, yes. But there's a lot of variables and still a lot of legwork before we introduce humans to the intergalactic community. Even if we're off by a century or so, I don't think any one race will have the edge on technology."" 

""If you're confident,"" said Peter. 

""I am."" 

""Yes sir, I'll make the arrangements. What do you want to do with the prototypes we have now?"" 

""What are the options you've thought about?"" God asked

""The quickest way is to destroy them with some sun-death event. But I've already figured that the humans would notice something so strange and sense divine intervention."" 

That was maybe and overestimation of humanity. One of the greatest things about the downward trend of religiousness was that it meant the humans were largely self-sufficient, without need of miracles. They'd be disinclined to see God's hand in something that had God written all over it.

But Peter was right that it would put God's plan in a precarious position. 

""The other option is to make the atmosphere inhospitable."" 

""Couldn't we just, deplete it?' God asked. it would have been the most expeditious way of making sure they lost interest in the prototypes for the short term. 

""No, they're certainly hopeful there is an atmosphere, and there are a lot of features that indicate an atmosphere. They're bound to have data that tells them if there is atmosphere or not. A strange disappearance would be..."" 

""Okay, so that won't work."" *Damn the humans for making things more difficult than it needed to be. It had taken years to fabricate those planets.* ""Then making it inhospitable is the way we go."" 

""Yes sir, if we start now, I think we can have it done in a few months. It should be fast enough, but..."" 

There was a long pause, but God waited it out. He tried not to make assumptions, but more importantly, he never wanted Peter to feel as if he'd incurred God's wrath. God had learned to be patient during those pauses. 

""Well,"" saint Peter said. ""he humans have a lot of data collected, and their craft is collecting more as we speak. If they've discovered enough to know at least a solid hint of atmospheric composition, they'll probably notice it changing so fast. I think that would be a bit much for them. they'd have to know something was up."" 

God thought about that and considered how the humans might respond. He only came up with two conclusions--the eternal response of humans to anything they didn't understand. 

God grunted. ""Gods, or Aliens... Damn, and three centuries too early for them to have even found the ruins of a Civilization. Alright Peter, you start doing what you need to do. We'll work out contingencies for a potential failure."" 

""yes, sir. I'll get on it."" 

The line went silent, then the tone sounded. God sighed, then hung up. He pressed the intercom button again. ""Jesus."" 

""Yes, sir?"" 

""Can you have your friends at the Fabricator's union give me a call? I have a new job for them."" 

""Will do."" 

God rubbed his temples. He looked down at the mess that he had made when his anger has come close to bursting through his voice. He blew gently towards the floor. The papers there floated up and he snatched them. It was nice to know that some things in the world were entirely under control. 

God felt grateful to Saint Peter. As potential disasters went, this one seemed like it would be managed. At lest, they had a solid plan in motion. 

God looked out over the office park again. He hoped the human problem would be resolved quickly, and hopefully without divine intervention. Not like the last time...

God pushed the memory from his head--there were certain bad days that really were better than others.

"[WP] ""Sir?"" ""Yes, Peter?"" ""The humans have discovered our prototypes for New Earth. All seven of them. They're calling it the TRAPPIST-1 system.""",empire539,"It was a miracle they had not been found out. Communicating between planets was strictly forbidden. And yet only a few months after the settlers, now settled, received the malevolent injunction from the Others, the aliens, that alien injunction to turn their efforts away from building new cities and setting down the foundations for fulfilling lives, and towards weapons manufacturing, and to turn those weapons, once completed, upon their brothers and sisters, their fellow humans, that the humans began communicating with one another, planet to planet.

For they would not, could not, refused to turn their newfound bounty, their second chance at life on a clean and beautiful planet, into yet another blood-stained legacy of terror, genocide, and war.

So clandestinely they communicated: by way of Morse code. For whatever inexplicable reason, the aliens were unable to detect it. The leaders of each of the seven planets, for decades, then, kept in contact, each keeping the other leaders in the loop with regards to their planets' progress on the weapon, and all the while plotting and planning, deliberating about how they might turn the weapons they were presently constructing against their alien overlords. 

The everyday citizens were kept in the dark about the secret alliance between the elites of each planet. They recited their nationalistic lines to one another, fomented their hatred for the populations of the other planets regularly in groups, and worked diligently, each playing his part, in the construction of his planet's weapon. 

The masses could not know what the higher-ups were brewing behind the curtain. It would be too conspicuous, much too conspicuous, if the everyman knew: the aliens would quickly find out and wreak their havoc upon the planets, every and all. 

This led to problems, however. A secret of that magnitude, a planetary secret, an interplanetary secret, a secret upon which the survival of a whole species, a miraculous, intelligent, and in many ways kind and loving species, was predicated, was a secret difficult to keep under wraps, and was also a secret difficult for the leaders to keep whole and in-tact in themselves while keeping it secret: they were splitting down the middle, internally schismed, as in public life they had continuously to re-affirm a hateful ideology, one which pitted the humans of their own planet against the humans of others, while in private they, the very leaders of their peoples, communicated with the other leaders, in stops and starts but in a language that was founded upon a sincere conviction of the liberty, fraternity, and consanguinity of all human beings, and upon hope.

How can a man keep the fearful and hateful dragon inside him from devouring the innocent child? How to keep hate from consuming all hope? Such questions took centre-stage in the minds of the leaders as they continued on nursing their secretive plans. What if the other leaders were bluffing? What if they were in cahoots with the aliens, and were planning on getting the others to join together in harmony, only to attack them when they least expected it? What if the other leaders were lying about how far along they were in their weapons' construction? What if they were nearly complete, even aiming the thing, at this very moment (each and every moment felt as if it were the fateful and direful moment) at the other planets, at their own planet, getting ready to fire?

""So it begins again.""

I was about to possibly interrupt his thoughts, but I refrained and returned my hand to my side.

""Maybe we can curb their instincts for a brief moment before they swarm over these prototypes."" Sir mused as he lobbed the spent kuun into the refuse receptacle. A ring of smoke he blew into the holographic display that broke apart on the wall a moment after.

Sir spun around to look at me with a tired expression and spoke again, ""Maybe NOMADD Command will give me another pay raise too. Heh."" I heard his voice strain with age and weariness. I can't blame him, Sir's resume made him almost a legend in the NOMADD program.

""Bah, I bet Command will just ignore the whole thing.""

""-we can have a independent contractor pose as an explorer to meet up with the humans. Sort of a cliché first contact scenario. We let the humans settle, monitor their experience and play it by ear from there. It will be like a closed testing phase.""

NOMADD Command's highest officers sat in their capital's Glatidadaeum. Seats spiraled upwards to the ceiling into the darkness. The Generalissimo took the ""donut"" seat levitating parallel with the central pillar stretching from the floor to the ceiling.

He spoke, ""Ullented, comrades!""

""Hein, Generalisimo!""

""Let's begin.""

Everyone's chairs except the Generalissimo's retracted back into the wall and left the officers with a small platform to stand on. Even the floor disappeared revealing a seemingly bottomless, glowing shaft. Some of the newly initiated looked down at the arcs of electricity inside the engine.

Consequences of several failed assassinations.

""Adam.""

Adam's platform gently glowed. A mechanical arm slowly pushed the platform forward, just enough to stick out.

""Your report says that the humans have found all seven of our 'New Earth' prototypes.""

""Yes sir!""

""You followed the advice of your protégé and let the humans settle on four out of seven prototypes as a 'closed testing phase'. Is that true?""

""Yes sir!""

The Generalissimo tapped his cheek, his palm cradling his head. Sweat trickled down the back of Adam's neck and into the darkness of his carapace harness. 

""Did you give him a raise?""

""Yes sir!""

""Good man.""

""EXCELLENT!""

The Generalissimo pressed a button on his wristband and the chairs came back. The officers gladly took their seats and began pulling out...

""Let the second monthly Pokémon tournament begin!""

Adam stood dumbstruck as his platform was the last to retract, his mouth agape, looking at everyone with rare holographic cards.

Then the Generalisimo looked at Adam with a pitying face.

""Oh Adam...""

Adam's deck was in the Generalissimo's left hand.

""Two versus all?""

""Hell yes, sir!""",TheBronzeLine

They're calling it the TRAPPIST-1 system.""",empire539,"They were known as *the elevated*—a group of elites capable of communicating with the Creator Species. They were entrepreneurs, artistic geniuses, world leaders, and promising young students. The Creators whispered to them in their subconscious, feeding them brave ideas that could change the world. Perhaps you, dear reader, have heard their call.

Great movements in society rose and fell like a tide caused by the gravity of godlike whispers. The tide grew more violent as the ages passed on—as the ideas multiplied, ricocheting from thesis, to antithesis, synthesis in a great fractal spiral stretching across the aging face of Earth.

One day the ideas stopped. The Creator Species sent their whispers to newer skies—far from earth. The impact on the planet was immediate—scientific stagnation, global economic slowdown, and years and years of the worst art humanity has ever seen.

Everyone had a theory. Most were wrong.

There was a man in long flowing white robes on a daytime talk television show. He sat in a comfy yellow sofa, across from a middle-aged host with goggle-shaped tan lines.

“Why make a New Earth?” the host asked.

“This planet was almost perfect,” the man said, “But there was one fatal flaw that the Creator species simply could not abide.”

“What was it?” the host pressed.

“Buy my DVD for $19.99 to find out!” the man in the long flowing robes said.

“Nope, that’s not it,” said a deep voice from off stage. The camera panned.

A flying spaghetti monster floated over the audience, waving his noodly appendage. Unsure what to do, the stage manager illuminated the applause sign. 

The people clapped.

“We, the creator species,” spoketh the spaghetti monster, “Have been trying for a long long time to tell you humans to be nice to each other.” He paused. “It isn’t working. Humans are… difficult.”

The audience stared, dumbstruck.

“On our new planet,” the flying spaghetti monster said, “We will try again. With puppers.” The flying spaghetti monster smiled. “There will be a planet Corgi. A planet Daschund. A planet Lab. A planet husky. A planet golden retriever. A planet shih tzu. A planet poodle. And a moon for the Chihuahuas.”

“Can I…” said the man in the flowing white robes, “Can I go to Planet Husky?”

“Nope nope nope,” the flying spaghetti monster said, “You see, the reason your society is crumbling is because people just can’t seem to get along with—”

There was a sound of gunfire, and the flying spaghetti monster fell to the floor, bleeding red marinara blood.

Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary General of the United Nations, stood up from the crowd, wielding a semi-automatic AR-15.

“We will go to planet Husky!” he declared.

From that moment forward, all of humanity worked together in perfect harmony to develop the most advanced space program the world had ever seen—and everyone migrated to the doggo system to live on the worlds of soft furry puppers.

I love you, and I know you must love me. 

We've grown up together, and I'll never forget when you let me sleep in your lap as you were a child. I know your legs went numb and hurt from sitting still for so long, and yet you didn't move a muscle. You've played with me when you were sad, angry, and scared, overcoming your own feelings to make me happy. Because anything else wouldn't have been fair. You walked me when you were busy, tired, cold, and felt like shit. Not every time, sure, but most of them. 

You thought of me when you were out, worrying about me as I was home alone for hours. You hated fireworks as they brought up my childhood trauma, when you had to leave me alone in an echoing room that very New Year's Eve day you got me, a tiny pup, and you got angry at everyone who fired them ever since, even at your own family. You hated giving me canned food, and cooked for me whenever you could, even for me first when you were hungry yourself. You shared your tasty food with me, and that time I stole an entire grilled fish, the one your friend's father had just caught that afternoon, from the table, you laughed it off. Man, was it good. 

We had fun. Even that time your sister almost choked on a piece of sausage, so you slapped her back very hard, the piece flew across the room and I ate it right away. Right? Ah, you couldn't make this stuff up even if you wanted to.

I know you were super scared that time I had to have extensive surgery, and prayed for hours I would get out of it alive. Boy, those stitches! They itched! But you laughed at my e-collar making me look like a lamp, and that was fun. I did look like a fucking bedside lamp.

I know all of that. For all of it, and the countless pairs of shoes you let me destroy, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

BUT - why, why, for the love of God WON'T YOU LET ME HAVE SEX? 
Why this punishment? Did I do something to you? Other dogs won't stop barking about how good it feels, and I want to try it too! Even that batshit crazy Spitz next door. Yes, HIM! I hate him too! Wanna know what's he barking about all the time with that squeaky voice? You got it! SEX! 

Is it because I am a female, and you'd be stuck with my puppies? There are worse things in life than getting your dog knocked up, you know? One of them being not having sex EVER! Plus, wouldn't my puppies be the most beautiful thing in the world? If you love me, wouldn't you just love to have more of me? 

If I were a male, would you let me? Probably yes, because the burden of puppies wouldn't fall on you, right? That's sexist, downright sexist, I tell you. You're better than that. Plus, YOU'RE A WOMAN! Doesn't that count for anything?

I feel I won't be able to talk for long still, so I'll just...""

[WP] Everyone can go to a facility that finds out exactly how they will die. It has never failed before. Your results turn up with nothing.,glass3000,"I sat in the waiting room, after my test, for a long time. As I watched other people came and went, all of them getting their results within minutes of going inside. Most didn't even have time to get a seat before their name was called and they got a piece of paper.

I watched their faces as they got that paper. None of them looked happy about the results, there was relief, sadness, and anger of course. But never happiness.

Looking outside the large windows of The Facility's waiting room I could see the sun setting on the horizon. More time had passed than I'd expected, I'd gone in to find out early in the morning hoping to get back home to my partner with the news.

Since The Facility opened and began their tests they had never been wrong. Everyone who came in to be tested paid a small consultation fee, then went into the test room and lay down on a hard bench. The test room had no ornamentation, just a single light on the ceiling and the hard bench.

When I'd gone in i thought the stories might be wrong but there it was, just a bench. So I lay on it like I'd been told. The light turned off, a moment passed, it came back on and the door opened with an attendant there to lead me out. That was the test, what actually happened was anybody's guess or some trade secret.

Watching the other people I did catch on to one factor, the test took half an hour. That moment of blackness was far longer than it felt.

I'd gone to find out my own end after I was diagnosed with a new and peculiar type of aggressive cancer. The doctors had no idea how to treat it and they were equally perplexed about how it was developing. My partner suggested The Facility, to find out when I would die so we could sort out our affairs.

Finally I was distracted from my ruminating thoughts as the attendant came to see me. They looked more worried than I thought I was, and a stuttering voice broke the silence in the now empty waiting room.

""You had... no results. It isn't right, we kept rechecking and still nothing. No how, no when, no why. Nothing. You have no results,"" their voice accelerated towards the end of the sentence and they finished gasping, out of breath.

I sat there stunned, no result. How could I explain this to my partner? How could we plan anything when I knew nothing. My thoughts stopped. No result, did that mean I couldn't die? I stood up and left the waiting room in a hurry, ignoring the clammering attendant calling me back for something, possibly retesting.

This was good news.

I couldn't die.

It's totally free, we can see the stars now, cool the planet, feed the hungry, and they named the source of it after me. And who knew it would make so much money?

This feels good. Is this how everyone at the top feels? Standing a pyramid of backs? It can't be.

[WP] The snow falls gently on the chainsaw.,habbadodo,"The snow falls gently on the chainsaw. There is a noiseless stillness. The wind swirls, the only sound for miles around. The wind is throwing up the snow; creating beautiful figure skaters amongst the clearing. They dance, jumping up and falling down, spinning around gracefully, until they settle on the ground, and new ones are made up. They waltz around the chainsaw, like elegant ballerinas. It. Is absolutely. Inaudible. 

In the sky, you can't see anything. Clouded over. Dark. There's no light. Even the lights of the centre are all turned off. All that remain, are a few, wavering pillars of white luminescence. The tall, lumbering pines, the strong, tough maples; they tower over those who sit below. Many sit, in fact. Under one particular pine, two thirteen year old girls, and three thirteen year old boys are perched on low branches, or sprawled out on the ground. One boy, a caramel-skinned, short hockey player, shivers; snow is blown into his face, and he has no scarf. A girl, taller and calm blue-grey eyes, also a hockey player, breathes hard; she ducked under the tree earlier. 

""When should we go?"" whispers the tall curly-haired boy, the mastermind of this elaborate plot. 

""I dunno,"" a whisper back. 

They're shaking in their boots and snow-pants. They look over to the right, at the large field. The pillars start and stop; turn on and off; shake and stand stock still. All they can hear is the whistle of the wind. 

""Do you think we'll find anyone else?""

""No.""

""Well, we might. There are thirty of us.""

""It's too big.""

""Should we go?""

""Yeah, guys, let's go.""

The pubescent voices are hushed. Some, just breaking and deepening, others deep already, the girls' cool and mature. They move out of the tree. The tallest boy practically runs. They're all running as best they can through the snow, until; a snap! A stick has broken. They all freeze, and look to the source. One of the girls falls over, tripped up by the snow. She gets a face-full of the stuff. She coughs, a sudden uproar of sound. The white cone of light comes over her. She's in the middle of the path. She stiffens in the snow. No movement. The cone just stands there and looks at her. She squeezes her eyes shut. Tries to ignore the cold seeping into her bones. Everyone else stands there. Silent, inanimate. Statues. She shakes, unseen due to her thick parka. 

Finally, the light disappears, and they hear the crunch, crunch, crunch of something leaving. She takes a breath. ""Tati, you good?"" murmurs the brown-skinned, scarf-less boy. He sounds concerned. His dark brown eyes are drawn. 

""Yeah, Josh, just a little shaken up,"" she whispers back. ""You need a scarf, Josh. Here, take mine,"" Tati tries to hand it over, but he shakes his head. ""No, no it's okay, I have a tall jacket neck thingy. You'll freeze.""

""A-alright,"" he breathes. He wraps it around his own neck, happy for the warmth, and the smell of *her* overtakes him. The smell of a wood-scented soap, and mint.

""Piper, where are we even going?"" the other girl's voice is almost lost in the whistle of the wind.

""To a clearing. We're gonna find it. I swear.""

""Nigel, where are you?"" mumbles Piper, shaking the snow from his curly hair. 

""Right here. I think I can see a clearing. We needa stick together guys, and that means you too Mya.""

""Oh my God Nigel.""

He gives her, or what seems to be her, a pointed look. Josh helps Tati up, and the group trudges as quietly as they can through the snow. The only sound is of their breathing, and gale. A tempest of snow has moved in. After a while, they reach the clearing Nigel was talking about. What they see shocks them.

Piper is the first to react, screaming at the top of his lungs. They all eye the chainsaw on the ground. Blood covers the blade. Beside, a body. Mya is the second. Then the rest. One of the lights comes running towards them. 

""What's going on?!"" asks the worried teacher. ""What hap-""

""Oh dear lord.""

""W-we just found it we were just walking and we found it Mr. S oh my god, what do we do, who is this?""

Questions from the kids are pouring out like water from an overfilled jug. 

""Well, you certainly found more than the flag. C-come on, walk to the centre. I'll radio in. The activity is over.""

They hold on to each other, and walk. All the other teachers, shrouded in their white light are making their way over, while the kids stand confused. 

""HEAD BACK TO THE CENTRE!""

They all nod, and walk up. There, they sit and wait.

A teacher comes up, finally, and lets them in. Gives them a bedtime snack, allows them to shower and pack up. Tomorrow they're heading back into the city.

Sometimes she would make these little robots that would dance on a spinning pedestal, but no ordinary pirouette toy. The way she placed the gears that enabled its movement also sung a song with its melodic clicking. On the nights when her family was out late she would find herself just sitting in a dark room under a parasol which she frankensteined with a thousand little starry lights and she would simply stare at her little ballerina, cranking it back to life every time it stopped. She would just zone out and ponder if she truly had a future outside the clockwork of this tower.  It was a prison. Perhaps bigger than the one I left her in those years ago, but a form of torture none the less. 

One day, inspired by one of the books her mother brought home, she decided to build a Rube Goldberg machine. Zina knew the best place to make one. She went to the room with the 100 foot tall ceiling, where all the pipelines for the entire main structure were located. It had a spiral staircase around the circumference and led to every location of importance for the buildings original purpose. The east side of the room was a large window; it let in the sunlight as well as an incredible view. This tower was at the very edge of the floating island. From even the floor you could see the curvature of the planet in the distance as it overlooked the rest of the super continent beneath it. This island was built as a refuge for the reumin who inhabited it. As a barrier to protect them from the Gyntian war on the surface. Not only was this Island’s height a defense against invaders, there was a pocket of space surrounding the entire thing in every direction. No air from the other side of that window to about a quarter mile out. This makes flight through this barrier quite challenging and doubles as an atmospheric neutralizer for those inside.

 Zina could see it all; she could make these gears sing. Over the next few weeks she worked on this project. She created zip lines all over the place for quicker safer travel and put up lights, and little robots in catapults and Ferris wheels everywhere to make this chain reaction an absolute spectacle. She couldn’t wait to show her sister! It took all that was within her to not to update her family every day, but finally fit was ready! She just had to test it to make sure all her calculations were correct. Resetting would be a cinch once it all was in order. She went down to the bottom where she put the activator. A long pull rope was always her favorite way to start a project, she felt the force she needed to apply added flair. So she pulled, but instead of the first ball dropping into a weight activated catapult, the entire arm the rope was connected to gave way. It came straight for her. Zina reacted and dove out of the way, but the pendulum-like structure kept going until it hit the glass. 

In a single hit it shattered.

Immediately all the air and loose objects in the room got violently jerked towards the window as all the air vas sucked into the void it was quick, some of the stuff on the other side of the room stayed mostly in their place falling over, but Zina wasn’t so lucky. Mere inches from the window she was one of the first things to leave, right after the glass. So much adrenaline, so many emotions, the disruptive velocity of her fall jerked me awake.


I sat up in by bed and gasped violently. A moment passed and with my exhale, a rainbow vapor escaped my mouth. Oh no, that means my dream wasn’t a culmination of subconscious thoughts. That actually happened. “Soro what’s wrong?” I must’ve woken Aileta. 

“Zina’s in trouble” I scrambled for my shoes, shirt, sword, and goggles.

“What’s happening? Where is she?” Aileta asked. I ignored her and ran as fast as I could. Faster and faster until I broke the barrier. The all familiar orbs of light circled ecstatically around me as the lightning pulsed from head to toe. Soon the orbs consumed me. I knew where and when she was I could feel it. I didn’t need coordinates this time. 

A kick to the diaphragm, the air left my lungs as quick as the little orbs scattered from my newly positioned body. I fell to my knees in a room cluttered with misplaced objects, but it didn’t matter. Everything would get better if I could just get some sleep. My vision faded…

NO! My eyes snapped back awake. Twenty seconds! I have twenty seconds of consciousness. Window, check. Zina below, no air, I can’t catch up to her by falling normally. Need an extra push. I charged out the window. Turning sharply downwards as I did, I accelerated as I continued running down the Cliffside. I could see her; and then I couldn’t. My feet stopped working and I was in free fall. The world blackening again. In just a moment Zina caught me. Her wide distraught eyes the last thing I saw as I closed mine. She opened them back up with her hands. I can’t sleep now!

I focused as hard as I could on where and when we needed to go and tried jumping through time again, but the orbs wouldn’t return.

Where are they?!?! Can’t fly, can’t time travel, can’t…. Zina. Blocking powers when conscious. Unconscious they return. Without hesitation, I punched her in the side of the head as hard as I could. One hit and she was out cold. That’s all it took with the oxygen deprivation. Immediately the orbs returned along with an oscillating ping. They surrounded us completely and I felt our momentum come to a standstill. Then we crashed. Two inches down into an open field. I gasped. Adrenaline in my system, I didn’t dare stand as I would just wobble back over. Then I remembered Zina. I looked over at her still body. Is she breathing? I scrambled over her, ear to her mouth. Her diaphragm extended gently as the wisp of air around my ear. I fell back down and simply focused on my own breathing. Is it even possible for me to help Zina without hurting her? She’s taught me so many things, all without having to knock me out or send me to solitary confinement. Surly there was a more elegant way to save her. No, I know there was. Ahh! Why don’t I think things through

ahem,



That night I had a different kind of dream. I wasn’t in my own body. I was watching the world through the eyes of a little girl. Her life was not easy. As a child she was picked on for not having any elemental abilities, left out of so many activities with only her imagination to keep her company. So she used it. Just little toys and stories at first, but what great things she would make in the next few years.  

One day they came. An army from the mainland. One that sought to destroy everything she called home. I could see myself, as I took her away to a safer place, a safer time. I left her alone. I remember this. I needed her safe so I could keep everyone else safe. I was so preoccupied with my selfish list of objectives, of setting every event in motion for the better that I left her alone for a month. I didn’t even fetch her water, I simply said a bunch of nonsense and left. She was terrified by me, a total stranger. Paralyzed with fear. The first night she spent cold and alone, and cried herself to sleep. The next morning the need for sustenance drove her to leave the small junk cabin I left her in. the first week was a challenge and she went hungry most nights, but she adapted. The girl built her own bow and traps from the things scattered around her new home. Alongside her knowledge of plants, she made little furry friends and shared a few vegan meals with them. The bow wasn’t for them, it was for me. 

After I realized my mistake I went back to make amends. I meant to return after 40 minutes, not 40 days. I overshot, and still I regret it. The room was dark, she built a little fort to sleep in and blinds for the windows. The few rooms there were now filled with contraptions. I pushed open the front door, waking her with a loud contraption that was rigged to it. She grabbed her bow and slipped out the second story window. My first step was in a trap. My yelp startled her a bit, but also gave her some satisfaction. The net of spikes she set up must have worked. Now the animals were chirping. The net wasn’t lethal, it was only meant to discourage movement so she could see who it was. What if it was mommy? The girl came around front just when I had gotten the trap off me. “Who’s there?” she said. I went to turn around to meet her face and call to her “Zi-“

“You!” she yelled, raised her bow and fired and arrow, but I caught it. She was shocked. “You had to have super speed!” She pulled a rope next to the door dropping another door off a hinge on its top. The bottom locked into place and she began to run. I remember being trapped on the inside as simultaneously a fuse was lit burning into several different fuses scattered around…. Then nothing. I can understand why this part wasn’t tested. She ran through to the forest, jumping over a log where on the other side was a slide that brought her to the bottom of a creek. A little further along and inside the steep slope was a cave hidden by the brush of fallen branches. A place of refuge I didn’t find. She waited out the night, then in the morning returned to assess the damage, but to her surprise there was none. Grateful, the girl walked over to her pets and promised them she wouldn’t do that again, that she would find a better place for them. She just hoped I wasn’t staking out waiting on her return. She didn’t know that I was long gone, that I already got what I came for. 

It was a few hours before she was brave enough to reset everything. In the process of rebuilding she found herself consumed with one thought from my arrival. Dropping everything, the girl scoured the halls searching. Every nook, every cranny, but she couldn’t find it. Fear and sorrow overcame her again as she double checked. Triple checked. “Where is it? Where is it?” the only words on her mind. She gave up, sat down against a wall and cried. Her little pet walked up to her and she held it close. She was simply sitting there focused on breathing when she heard her name. “Zina” called out a voice she nearly forgot. The girl stopped moving and all her attention shifted to her ears. She didn't dare breathe. “Zina are you in there? Come out, please.” She heard my voice as well, quiet enough not to be able to catch my words, but clear enough to confuse her. Zina stood up, grabbing her bow with hesitation and silently moved upstairs to her secret escape route. “She's up there” I said before she exited the window. “Super sight too? How am I supposed to win?” Immediately she regretted no putting another trap outside the front door with an activator in the bedroom. “He's not going to hurt you” called the voice. 

“Mommy?” Zina's voice was shaking.

“Yes, Zina I'm here. Please come down.” Her mom said gently.

Zina started to climb down looking around for the source of her mother's voice. When she found it, she slipped the rest of the way down. Zina's mother hurried over with her older daughter in tow. “Are you alright?” Zina's sister asked. The little girl could only bring herself to hold them as tight as she could.

After a moment I walked over to return what I had taken. Out of my pocket I pulled a picture of the three together, a bit manhandled but clear image none the less. Zina looked up at me. “It was never my intention to leave you alone, in my determination for the greater good, I abandoned you. I didn't think things through. I'm sorry” I said to her.

“I forgive you.” Zina said. I knew I was shocked from disbelief in that moment but until now, I never knew just how much my face reflected it. Zina's words were honest, I didn't just see these events through her eyes, I could feel her hearts, there was no trace of contempt in either. 

Some time had now passed. The family moved from the small cabin and found a small town near the boarder of the floating island. The people there welcomed the three with open arms and they found a home. Zina quickly made friends with everyone even though most found her joy odd, even with her disability she seemed to be the happiest of them all.
All good things come to an end though. One day a plague spread through the town. The only symptom: loss of power. It came quick and was more contagious than the bubonic plague. This inhibited everyone’s livelihood. People couldn’t work. Some who had the ability to not need breath now had to breathe and could only do so manually, but their lung muscles had atrophied from lack of use. Each breath a gasp. Others who had no need for sleep fell into a coma in the middle of the streets. Panic spread immediately half the town was quarantined but before day's end the other half guarding the border became infected as well. The first day was pure chaos. Zina and her family were scared as well. Even though the little girl had nothing to loose, she felt for her friends and family. 

No one fell asleep until late that night. By then many of the residents had fled but others stayed to help their incapacitated loved ones. All of a sudden everything returned to normal. Everyone was talking, spreading rumors, asking questions, imposing theories. Others wanted to simply forget what happened and move on. It was only a one time thing, surly its over. Oh, but how wrong they were. The sun rose and with it the plague returned. 

Every able mind got together, and for the next few days they debunked theory after theory as to what was wrong. They noticed their powers would return at night but be gone the next morning. It wasn't too long before they found the source: Zina. When she was conscious, the teenager restricted the powers of those around her. When Zina heard the this, even she was shocked. Shocked and conflicted. Finally she had a power, but only  one that hurt others. The news spread like the plague itself. Most were terrified, others were relieved. The general consensus was to kill her or banish her. Zina’s mother and sister stepped in the way to make sure it was the latter. After talking it through, the family left to a large building at the edge of the floating island. It was one of the maintenance towers for the large superconductors that kept the island afloat. After the island was confirmed stable and self-sustaining, it was abandoned.

The family was still allowed to interact with the rest of the community, on the condition that Zina not return. The three would sleep in the tower at night, but in the day, Zina’s mother and sister would have to go out and earn their keep. At first, it wasn’t very lonely. Some of Zina’s friends would travel the distance to meet her, but over the next few months they came less and less. Zina’s mother would bring her a new book from the library as often as she finished them, which quickly became every day. The old abandoned maintenance tower was like an excessively large mansion. She had plenty of work to do.

The humans--our masters--are interesting creatures. They treat us well enough. We’re given fresh food and water. We’re bathed if we get too dirty and they let us laze around and chomp grass all day.
	
While it seems like a perfect deal, I’ve got an inquisitive mind, and what’s happening behind the scenes is scarily obvious. My brethren and I are just fodder. We’re taken only to never come back, meanwhile the humans’ bellies grow larger and larger.
	
I’ve tried to tell them this. They simply don’t care. I wish I could blame them but I’ve long known that my intelligence surpasses theirs, and I truly believe they cannot fathom the injustice dealt unto us.
	
Though leaving them behind would shackle my heart with guilt, I must find a way through the gate. If I do that, maybe I can bring back help. Maybe I can save them before it’s too late.

[IP] Ghost Riders,madlabs67,"Johnny Cashs song '*Ghost Riders in the Sky'* came on the jukebox, He sighed, ""God I hate this song."" He turned to the girl next to him at the bar, she was wearing a long dress a tight old bonnet on her head, a wheelbarrow sat next to her, full of clams. ""Ya think this ones bad, I've got one named after me!"" she snorted and took the drink on the bar and downed it in one go. He nodded, ""Too true miss Molly Malone,"" He took the whiskey in front of him off the counter and drank it, the liquid dripped from his skull and onto his vest, he sighed. ""I can taste it, or at least the memory of it, but it never has it's intended purpose."" He set the empty glass on the table, as Molly dozed off, he glanced around the bar at the various other spectral entities as he stood and walked towards the door.
A pirate with fire in his beard, ""A storms brewing then eh, better tell meh crew to batten down the main sails, for ye look right in a terrible mood this eve!"" He glared a bit at Black Beard, the fires in his skulled eyes flaring, ""You've got no crew, they moved on, your ghost ships barely seen anymore, you've got nothing to worry about you old fool.""

[IP] Ghost Riders,madlabs67,"Honcho trotted along beneath me, the tap of his hooves echoing off the walls of the buildings on either side of me.  The sound echoed, alone, in the still air of late afternoon.

I frowned, turning in my saddle to peer first left, then right.  Where were all the people?  Dry Creek was never going to be anything more than a small town, a stop for soldiers headed out towards the Southwest border, but it still felt alive and bustling compared to my home out on the ranch.

I thought back to the last time I'd visited, several months ago.  There'd been some big fuss about a big-name bandit being caught, about to go up on the gallows.  I wouldn't have minded seeing that, but I had to get back to the farm, soon as I picked up the supplies for my da.

But there'd been plenty of folks about, then.  Where had they all gone?

Honcho advanced down the empty street, slowing to a walk.  I peered at the houses on either side, the storefronts closed up, shutters over the windows.  Was there any light inside, or was it all darkness?

""Hey!  Hey you, boy!""

I spun around, nearly tumbling off of Honcho.  Fortunately, the old horse had a calm temperament, and just came to a stop in the empty street.  I looked around, trying to see the source of that voice.

A shutter flapped gently, and I caught a glimpse of narrowed, yellowed eyes behind it.  ""Over here, boy!  You insane, or just stupid?""

""Me?"" I asked, confused.  ""What's going on?  Where is everyone?""

""Hiding, just like you oughta, if you've got a lick a' sense to ya!  Git over here, now!""

Normally, I might have asked more questions, but the emptiness of the town unnerved me.  I dropped off Honcho's saddle, reaching for the rifle that I carried slung across the back behind me, along with my bags.  I mainly carried it in case a coyote jumped out, not for shooting men, but I wanted it near at hand.

The old man behind the shutter sneered.  ""That ain't gonna help ya, son.  Not with what's afoot.""

""What is it?""

""Git in here, and I'll tell ya.""  I heard the rasp of a bolt sliding back in the door, and after securing Honcho around the back of the building, I hurried inside.

The inside of the shop smelled of sawdust and stale beer, and I realized that I'd come into the tavern.  The old man dragged me aside so he could slam the door.  He spun around to look up at me, shaking his head.

""They're coming, and you hayseed had no idea,"" he scowled.

""Who's coming?""

He started to answer, but before he could speak, my ears caught the sound of hooves from outside.  This wasn't a single horse trotting into town - it sounded like multiple steeds, maybe even at a full gallop.

The old man's eyes went even wider, and he threw himself to the ground.  His gnarled hand shot out to grab me by the coat, dragging me down into the sawdust alongside him.  ""Quiet, now!"" he insisted.  ""Don't give us away, or we're as good as dead!""

I still had questions, but I kept my mouth shut as I crept towards the window along with the old man.  He looked familiar, and I was fairly certain I'd seen him before.  ""Garrick,"" I whispered, as softly as I could speak.  ""Isn't that your name?""

He glared at me, furious for talking, but gave me a short nod.  ""Yuh.  Now shut it, hayseed, 'fore you get us both killed.""

Still not sure why, I put one eye up towards the crack in the shutters.  Garrick tried to hold perfectly still, but then began whispering to me, as if he couldn't contain the secret inside himself any longer.

""We knew he was up to bad stuff when the deputies dragged him in,"" he whispered, talking almost more to himself than to me.  ""Black magic, the kind a' stuff that makes a man go crazy just from thinking 'bout it.  They caught him in the cave, standing over the body of the Mayor's daughter.  Had her blood smeared all over him.""

I felt a chill run up and down my spine, but I couldn't close my ears to his words.

""And we hanged him, and that's better than he deserved,"" Garrick went on, shaking his head.  ""I voted that we draw and quarter him, but nah, they went with the rope.  I watched it, though, watched his legs kick until they stopped.  Watched them cut down the corpse.  And then I put a bullet through his heart, just to be sure.""

The hooves were close, now, and I guessed that the riders would be visible at any second.  ""So who came after him?""

""No one,"" Garrick whispered, as I finally saw the horses appear.  They looked too thin, covered in long black strands that blew back from their manes.  Their riders also wore black, tattered black that looked like it had been buried for months.  Four of them, galloping in formation.

""No one came after them,"" Garrick uttered, and my breath froze in my throat as the nearest rider turned to stare at the saloon.  ""They came back, all on their own.  And there's none left to stop them.""

I just stared out through the crack in the shutters, out at the rider.  He stared back at me from wide, unblinking eye sockets in a face that held no flesh, no muscle.  A grinning skull, its eye sockets lit with unholy yellow flames, sat beneath that black hat.  It stared straight at me, and I could have sworn that it could see me.

""None left,"" Garrick repeated.  ""And we're all 'bout as good as dead.""",Romanticon
[WP] Earth resets. Everything humans have ever done to the earth has vanished—along with all human possessions. People's memories and existence are the only remnant of human civilization.,mr_yogurt,"The animals were running rampant, roaming the land in search of easy prey. The humans had lost everything, and in doing so gained a new respect for wild prey. They immitated the rodents, hiding in small holes, caves and shady areas, only exposing themselves for the occassional sip of water from a nearby stream or lake. 

What about everyone who lived in the desert before the blip? Whoever survived the desert was one of the most inhumane humans. To avoid dehydration they drank the blood of complete strangers, their friends, and even their relatives. They were all the more stronger - mentally and physically - for making it out of the desert alive. That was what was most important - staying alive. Forget about politics and religion, it was a struggle to stay healthy.

Naturally, hierarchies slowly began to form. Farmers and builders were at the top of the pile. People worshipped them for their knowledge and memories of their previous lives before the blip. Soon enough, people came together and started forming groups. Most people were willing to follow orders and complete hours of manual labour if they got a meal and shelter in return. 

First, dens made of sticks were hurriedly erected, then crops were planted. Months after the blip, most of the elderly and unfit had died. The scarce few elders were given extra supplies to stay alive and well. After all, they had the most memories left to share. Some were generous, and wandered between regions teaching people and sharing their memories. Some stayed in a single area, comfortably writing down all they could remember, forming the first new age libraries. Of course, they had to sit and scratch what they knew into rocks and caves, but some had scribes to convey their thoughts and sayings for them. Others could get by.

Unfortunately other elders were less selfless. They demanded luxuries for their memories, and in some cases, refused to open their minds for the good of others. Only the truly desperate remained near these elders, in the hope of gaining small amounts of knowledge. The elders would demand more and more, until they were pushing people to their limits.

Of course, once villages were established, jealousy kicked in. There was no police force or justice system anymore: it was survival of the fittest. Whoever was strongest, or had developed weapons, or had the most followers could easily overpower neighboring groups. Soldiers were armed with sticks and stones and usually attacked in the dead of night, when the blanket of darkness was thrown over the world.

Whole villages packed up and moved to safer grounds. Of course, there were engineers and scientists who could design and construct carts and trolleys for the young, the elderly and whatever belongings had been created. The farmers trained small groups to herd whatever animals had been caught. Cows, goats and chickens were collected up, before being herded into the mountains, away from the coasts and the plains. The mountains were a harsh place to live, and many people died, but a select few could rebuild and settle.

Generations later, and humans were comfortable and stable enough to establish laws, religions and beliefs. Maps of the land were created. There were the capitals of the armies: Rome and parts of Greece. In other parts of the world, there were less maps, but more travellers who told stories of their tales. Tribes in the rainforests, mountain people who called themselves Incans.

The most legendary stories were from before the blip, hundereds of years ago. They told stories of huge stones that people lived in, miles high. Metal snakes that people called trains. Even magic stones that could talk and show moving paintings. Some stories were called impossible and ridiculed, but no one ever believed that one day history would travel a full circle, and life would be restored to what it was like before the blip.

Oh, how they were so wrong.",flustered_flamingo99
[WP] Earth resets. Everything humans have ever done to the earth has vanished—along with all human possessions. People's memories and existence are the only remnant of human civilization.,mr_yogurt,"They called it a reckoning. I guess that made sense. 

Piles of dead in every city. When the skyscrapers disappeared people just poured out of the sky, leaving hills of corpses like burial mounds. Highways weren't pretty either; no tarmac, no cars, just limbs on the mud. After a few years you could still just about make out the interstate, because the plants grew quicker there - more nutrients. It was a time of chaos obviously, no explanations or science left to make sense of it, so not a lot to say about it really. People wandering though vast fields of dead, not knowing where they were. No landmarks left for the city folk. No shelter for anyone. Just death, the open sky - and a creepy silence. 

But perhaps the most shocking thing about the times after was how quickly people got used to it. The generation who grew up watching the Walking Dead, the Hunger Games, they always thought they could survive an apocalypse, would thrive even. They were wrong. Take away the zombies, the guns, the scientists and government soldiers. What are you left with? A fuck load of cold, hungry millennials with no home, no real enemy, and desperate need for direction. You have to understand, this was not the junk-filled playground Hollywood made out it would be. When you wake up naked, in a field, with just the birds and faint human cries for help around, that's when you really see the truth. We're just animals. And without our toys and false sense of destiny, we're pretty weak animals at that. 

So the first years weren't glamorous, there was no fresh start or revolution. Most people starved or froze to death. The remainder needed jobs to do, and there were plenty around. Firewood gathering. Looking for food. Sharpening sticks. Killing yourself. No really, there was not much killing between people (when you have nothing to fight over what's the point) but there was a shitload of suicide. Let me put it like this - imagine you're playing Pokemon, you're half way through the game and your younger brother deletes your save file. You start a new game, watch the intro scene and then it really sinks in how much you lost, and how long it will take to get back there. Now times that by a thousand and add in the cold, the hunger and the knowledge you'll never have a hot shower again. It can be a little overwhelming. 

Nevertheless in the small groups who did carry on, life was strangely familiar. We lost our sense of shame, as we had no clothes, bathrooms, makeup etc. But we still had to get up and punch in every day. Everyone either pitched in or died. No-one could hunt or knew how to make a fire so we slept under leaves and got thinner and kept trying new ideas and moving around until we learned where the fruit trees were, how to catch a few fish. If someone attacked someone else we would watch, numb and bleak eyed until it was over. Then usually left the aggressive people behind where possible. Like I said - it wasn't glamorous. It was just existing. And when you take away all the words and gimmicks, wasn't that what we were doing before anyway? I dunno. I miss pizza.

[WP] You're given the chance to start your life over from your birth with all the skills and knowledge you have now.,papadirty,"John stood there with his eyes locked with the beast. ""How has it come to this? I hope this works."" he wondered. 

You see, John hasn't had the best of luck lately. His girlfriend left him, when she left he had to take on paying full rent and utilities, he over-drafted and became a common name at various collection departments, his company shut down and he ended up on the street. Luckily his van was paid off and he took to living in that. He kept it parked in the shade of an old oak tree to avoid the Georgia heat turning it into a hotbox. He applied everywhere he could with no luck, and soon turned to drinking. Well, one of them Georgia blue boys came knocking at his window one night with a flashlight to inspect the van that had been parked there a few days now. Johnny was inside pouring a shot of whiskey. He was cuffed and taken away that night. True to Johnny's luck that Georgia boy came around while he had the keys in the ignition to run the air conditioning and escape the heat before settling into bed. Now he was facing a DWI charge as well. 

""I can't believe this is happening to me! Sometimes I wish I could start over"" he thought as he stepped out of the homeless shelter and lit a cigarette. ""Everything was going so well. If only I hadn't moved us into that two bedroom, I would have been fine in my studio apartment."" He sat there and looked back on every decision he had ever made. Each one a small stepping stone that eventually got him to where he was now. Two hours went by, and in that time Johnny had his entire life flash through his mind. It seemed he had it all figured out when down the alley around the corner he heard his name being called. 
He peered around the corner to find a familiar tall shadowy figure. 

""If you'd care to take a dare, I might be able to help you out, Johnny boy."" 

""Why are you back? What do you want?"" 

""What if I told you I could send you back?""

""Send me back to what?"" 

""Start your life over, to avoid making these mistakes again. In your mind, in your heart, you will instinctively know to make the choices that are opposite of the ones you made before that got you here, but you will not remember this moment or the ones that got you here. You will act only...on...instinct. But instinctively you will make one choice the same as you have before. I will say not what, it is my one and only test for you.""

""I know your game, Devil. What do you want from me in return?"" 

""You will not remember this night if you agree. If you agree, then tomorrow you will wake up in your five year old body. If you agree, you have one chance to do things right. If you agree and you fail, if you agree, and you ever question your existence like this again, I will come back. I will drag you down to the depths of hell for eternity. OH, now don't look so scared Johnny boy, I can assure you that you wouldn't be making the trip alone HAHAHA! No boy, you'll be accompanied by everyone you love. In an instant they will drop dead and their souls and yours will be mine... If you agree.""  he smirked.  ""There're no hard feelings, I only want you to be happy Johnny boy, and I'm offering you one more chance at it.""

""How has it come to this?"" John wondered, making deals with the Devil again.

He stared into the beast's hollow eyes, confident that he had everything sorted out and would not fail he said, ""I'll take your offer you son of a bitch."" 

""I'll see you soon."" 

John went to bed that night in the homeless shelter. He wondered what he had just done, and hoped for the best. Anything seemed better than another night on that cot though. 


""JOHNNNYYYY! TIME FOR SCHOOL WAKE UP!"" Yelled Johnny's mother up the stairs. It had worked, John didn't know it, but he had just gotten a fresh start at life. 
He went to school everyday, and came home to play outside. But after eleven years of being a model student his aspirations began to fade. In his first life he was a clean-cut aspiring musician. But true to his deal, music was only his second choice now. He had no desire to play violin like his parents tried to pressure him to, and instead chose to spend his time skipping music lessons to get high under an old hickory tree. 

The clouds rolled by as John gazed up at them with his glossy red eyes. His violin lay in its case next to him under the tree. He decided to take it out and start playing. He was a decent player, a natural even, but nothing like he could have been had he actually practiced more. 


""Boy, let me tell you something"" said a voice out of nowhere. 

""Who's there!?"" asked John. 

""Well, you play pretty good. What say you to a friendly duel"" the devil said as he removed his hood. 

""Holy shit"" John thought, ""This is some dank shit I guess!"" 

""If you win you'll get a prize, everything you've ever wanted. But if you lose, I'll take everything you hold dear and make you question your life everyday.""

Instinctively John said "" haha sure bud, I'll take the bet."" 

The devil opened up his case and said, ""I'll start this show.""
Fire flew from his finger tips, as he tightened up the bow. 
He played his tune and Johns jaw dropped. The Devil was much better than he anticipated in his intoxicated state. He struggled to scratch out a tune and just like that, the Devil had won. 

Weeks later John's life had turned to hell. He got kicked out of school, his mother was in the hospital suffering from heart failure, his sister was killed by a drunk driver, and it wasn't long until he questioned his life. 
""Why am I here?! I wish I could go back and do it all over!"" he wondered as he closed his eyes that night and fell asleep. 


""WAKE UP JOHNNY! YOU'RE FUCKING MINE NOW UNDERSTAND!?"" 

He was back in the alley. He rose to his feet. He knew he had failed. He remembered the deal, he remembered his eleven year fresh start, every detail, but now he was back facing the devil in that dirty alley. 

""You're mine now Johny boy, you, your family ALL MINE!""

 ""That's pretty good old son... You had this all planned out from the beginning didn't you!? As soon as you lost, this was your revenge wasn't it?!"" 

""It was my favorite fucking gold fiddle, Johnny!"" the Devil cried.

The things that wait between the two are.... Unpleasant.",AnCapGamer,"This story starts right after i killed myself. I'm kind of a pussy, Thought about it a lot. Gun's to messy. After all my roommate has to find me. I don't care much for him, but nobody has to see that. Noose would be just weird and creepy. I killed myself. I did it with an Overdose of Heroin. Never taken it before, but i was pretty successful. Did a lethal injection first try. Everything was warm for a minute, then i panicked but i blacked out right after that. I thought everything was over, i thought wrong. 

I woke up when someone poked me with what i thought was the back of a broom. Shit, i thought, didn't die and now i'm addicted to heroin or something.
""Wake up."" Said the figure that held the broom. ""Well technically not wake up, because you're pretty much dead. Well, not dead yet but on a good way. Most certainly not alive."" When my vision normalized i saw that that wasn't a broom but a big Scythe. Then i saw his face. Or more his abundance of a face. The Grim Reaper is neither grim nor has he a face. Dark energys twisted where people have a head reflecting and swallowing light wherever and whenever they saw fit like a puddle of petrol dancing in a black hole, his hands were pitch black before the sky, which washed out and distorted and what you think would be a voice wasn't really a voice. It resonated in my head. I didn't exactly hear it in my head it just felt like someone i met a long time ago, said exactly what he said right in that moment and somehow i just then remembered. He was death. His presence made that clear. This isn't exactly what i came for.

""A few questions before we start."" he sang in my memorys and buckled his Scythe. 
""You killed yourself, am i correct?"" He was. Obviously.
""Heroin. Are you still a little high? You should be. It is still in your body after all, this isn't exactly your body, but oh you know."" The Grim Reaper is chatty. Thats about the last thing i expected. ""Long time since i was high. Must've been..."", He looked for a trinket in his long black robe and fetched a Fobwatch. The Hands showed Eons, Millenia and Centuries and were jagged and used up. Still the clockwork ticked with unceasing accuracy and for the first time before i pressed the needle against my skin i thought it was worth it killing myself. ""...About your Cambrian Age. Good Times."" All the time my life was hell. I was tired and nothing made any sense. Turns out that doesn't get much better. 
""I don't feel high."" i said. 
""What a shame. Have you read Hemingway by a chance?""
""No i think not. I haven't.""
""Most people who kill themselves have. Just an interest i have. Love his stuff."" He resonated. I stared at him not knowing what to do.
""Anyways Brian, yeah i know your name, beautiful farewell letter by the way. First off there is neither heaven nor hell. This is not your soul it's something different. Just go with it, what we'll do now is get you resting safely."" I spared myself the asking. I probably wouldn't get it anyway. 
""The rules are simple, Brian. Follow me. Don't look back. Keep your composure and never, Brian, never ever ever listen to the voices. We can talk about the rest while we're on our way. Have i made myself clear?""
""Eh yeah, Mr."" I answered instinctively. The atmosphere changed when i heard that. I guess i at least have something to do for now. Death started walking.

You may just be the first man to figure out how to take yours off.,CokeMyName,"In a world seemingly void of free agency, I never expected to control my fate. 

Its been a 16 arduous months since I became enlightened. 

Imagine taking off your socks after wearing them all day, perhaps a few. Annoying, right? Well for myself, i was practically born with ""socks"" and only just learned how pitifully disgusting my situation had been. To every citizen of Regimen Continentalis, a auream regulam bracelet was issued. 

Society was bleak and harsh, few words were spoken, and few opinions were shared. All citizens of the RC were assigned positions at an early age and i happened to be a sanitation worker. 

I was almost finished with my route and had to stop at the last house when my bracelet snagged on the door. I was all too familiar with what came next, as terrible spasms accompanied my body to the uneven asphalt. I have gotten quite used to the pain, although the sudden surge of electricity never fails to confuse and bewilder me.

I hated that bracelet but knew that if I destroyed it or in any way got it off my body, I would be tracked down and executed on the spot. My mother repeatedly warned me as a child, but her affection has not graced my presence since she passed.

I had wondered for years how to free myself from the prison of life and finally decided it was time to leave. 

After my last meal, a stale loaf of bread and a bruised pear, I went on a walk to the city wall. I figured if i was going to die, I had better do something exciting in my life. 

I climbed for at least an hour before my grip began to fail. The top was in just above me, but felt just as impossible to grasp as freedom. This thought of mine enraged me, and I realized that ending my pitiful life would mean nothing to a government that destroyed free will. The confines of the world could hold me down no longer and every fiber in my body fought to raise me above the massive wall.

I staggered at the top and felt a small buzz and click on my wrist. Astonishingly, as if the burdens of the world were removed, my bracelet detached, falling to my feet. I looked along the horizon and saw the vast extent of the wilderness blanketed by the sun's shining rays and rested until morning, ecstatic for the day that lay ahead.

As they unpacked a few of their belongings and moved to the house, Jack decided to go and sit outside. Next door was a the beginnings of a basement being dug.  He sat there and looked and then he was a little startled.

""Well who are you?"" Said a softer voice. 

Jack then noticed a girl about his age. She had died blue hair and an old army jacket and some jeggings on and seemed about as disinterested about this place as him.

""Well... where'd you move from?""

""Chicago. Evanston to be specific.""

""Nice. My family moved from Cleveland at the beginning of the summer. I bet you think it sucks here too.""

""Yeah. I haven't seen much.""

""Its kind of cool though. The woods are peaceful around here. Do you wanna see. I promise you'll be back by 10 or so.""

""Okay. What's your name?""

""Kayla. And you are?""

""Jack.""

""Mehoffer?""

""What?""

Jack liked her sense of humor. A little crass but she seemed fun. Jack and Kayla then walked out to the woods. They found an old stream and saw a deer, but there wasn't much else to see. At 10 they came back to Jack's house but Jack then noticed something on the lot with the basement.

""So hey, what's going on over here?""

""I don't know. Apparently some guy from down in Atlanta was going to build a house here but he's taking forever. They've apparently been digging that basement since last year.""

""Weird. But its just I have this feeling. Like look at that old stump. It kind of looks all gnarly.""

""Hmm weird."" Said Kayla.

Jack then went over to the Stump.

""Make sure no one comes by. ""

Jack then was kicking around the dirt. He then took a shovel sitting at the site and started to dig. After digging a bit, he soon saw something.

""Look at this.""

""Jack that's a fiddle. I actually play. I bet it still works. Its golden though. Or at least looks like it. Here let me try it out.""

All of a sudden the sound came from the violin and Kayla played a beautiful piece of music. But soon the wind rustled and all of a sudden a man in a black suit showed up. He looked like quite the impressive fellow.

""So can I have that please?"" Said the man. 

""Wait who are you and why do you want this. Is this your house?""

""Well you could say that I am. I used to own a lot of things. Big fall from grace though.""

Jack and Kayla thought the man was kind of odd, but Kayla didn't hand over the fiddle. 

""Well alright then, I guess i'll have to pull out the big guns.""

All of a sudden there was a fiery looking glow about town. The man himself started to glow and what looked like fire came from his fingertips.

""Look. This is my fiddle. I lost it here. No stupid weirdo looking girl is going to take it, and neither is some scraggly, femmy looking boy. Just hand it over and i'll give you anything you want.""

""No you won't. Legally that fiddle is mine son. I got's my lawyer to help me out too. I was looking for that fiddle and I was gonna sue your ass but you just up and runned off. Doesn't matter because I don't need the money  but i'd like my fiddle.""

The gaunt skinny man in tight jeans, a plaid shirt and a Georgia Bulldogs cap that had seen better days had pulled up in a nice looking Chevy Pickup.

""My name's Johnny and I bet you remember me. I beat you in that contest. Hell i'm still a damned good fiddle player. I'm a session artist up in Nashville now. But havin that fiddle would make me right happy.""

""Here you go sir."" Said kayla.

""So where'd you all find it?""

""Sir"" Said Jack.

""We found it under that Hickory Stump.""

""Tricky. But that's what the devil will do to ya.""

""Devil?""

Just then the man disappeared as quietly as he came with a rush of wind.  ",iobraska

"[WP] When the Devil went down to Georgia and was defeated by a young man in a fiddle contest named Johnny, the Devil set a golden fiddle at his feet. Johnny never claimed his prize, and to this day, a relic of unimaginable musical power is buried somewhere in Georgia",DrKStrauss,"A gun fires and cheers erupt from the crowd. The 35th Annual Finding of the Fiddle Festival has officially begun. People from all over the country have gathered in the heart of Georgia during this second weekend in August to search for a golden fiddle that was hidden in the Georgia landscape. 

Rufus has barely walked ten feet before sweat started pouring off his body. He's definitely not in shape, but he's always wanted to do it. Another man who is five feet in front of Rufus calls out ""Hurry up Rufus, we have to get moving if we want to find this fiddle before anyone else does""

Rufus calls back ""I'm sorry I'm dragging behind Bo. I'm too out of shape to be doing all this walking around""

Bo yells back ""We've only walked fifteen feet! How do you expect to win a contest if you can't walk fifteen feet?""

Rufus tries to catch up to his friend Bo but he fails to do so before Bo stops walking. When he finally does Bo says to him ""You need to lay off mama's cooking for a while""

Rufus protests ""How? Mama is such a good cook it would be a shame to just give it all up""

Bo shakes his head and says ""Come one Rufus, lets get a move on""

Bo pulls out a map and say ""Ok I mapped out where the fiddle might end up being. Which area do you want to check out first""

Rufus points to a clearing and says ""That one, It seems promising enough""

Bo responds back ""Ok, that's where we'll head to first""

Bo folds up his map and they keep walking. They talk to each about pretty much everything while they walk. From arguments over whether or not cheese can be blue to a nice game of Marry, Boff, Kill. They get a few games on that until Bo decides to pull out the map to see where we might be. 

""Marry, Boff, Kill.... uhhh.... Vanna White, Meredith Vieira, and uhh..... Jane Lynch"" Rufus asked

""uhhh..... I dont know"" Bo started while clueless for an answer "" I guess Marry Vanna, Boff Meredith, and Kill Jane"" He finished while staring at Rufus waiting for his answer. 

Just then though, Bo trips over a tree stump and into a clearing of trees.

Rufus asks ""Bo! Are you okey?""

""Yeah I think...."" Bo starts before noticing a shiny glimmer of gold on a tree stump in the distance. 

Rufus takes a double take at the stump when he notices Bo staring at it. Then suddenly something clicked in their heads to run over towards. So they do. When they get there, they find it's what they have been looking for. The Golden Fiddle,though they arent sure on what their prize is. Both of them scream in joy and hoot and holler and everything but the kitchen sink. They hug each other and shout ""We Did It!"" while Rufus picks it up and holds it in his hands.

Rufus is stunned at his amazing turn of events. He knows he isnt about to buy one but there's no way that someone was able to pull this one off and sell them onto the team again. They both drink to their fortunes and race back to the starting point to get their prize.

When they get back there though. They find that someone else is claiming their golden fiddle as well. They show the organizer, a man by the name of Johnny. He is thoroughly confused about this.

""Did either of you guys cheat"" Johnny asked as seriously as he could be

""No!"" everyone answered

""huh..... I wonder how I can tell who's is the real one.""

Johnny inspects each fiddle closer and closer. He's not sure but he thinks he might  have figured it out after 20 minutes of thinking. 

Both Rufus and Bo say to Johnny ""So... What's the verdict?""

Johnny replies ""Unfortunately, yours isn't the one that we hid"" Johnny continued on ""However, the fiddle you found is made of solid 24 carat gold""

Rufus and Bo look at each other and scream ""We're Rich""

Suddenly a well dressed man with palish red skin and what looks to be wings on his back appears

The mystery man says ""Alright, who dug up my fiddle""

Rufus and Bo quietly raise their hands. They are scared for what might happen next. The mystery just looks at them and chuckles a hearty chuckle. ""Well you two"" He starts with ""You two just found the golden fiddle I gave to Johnny approximately 40 years ago. Unfortunately that bastard left with out it and it's been where you found it ever since. To win it, All you need to do is one little thing. Can you two do that for me?""

Both of the guys nod their heads in approval. The mystery man reacts ""Good, well follow me, there's plenty of work to bed one""

Johnny watches as a mysterious man and two rednecks leave the scene of the crime. He then declares the winner of the Find the Fiddle contest and ends the festival early this year. No one has heard from him since, although some believe that this man was Johnny, The best there's ever been. No one can confirm it, although it's awkward timing to come back when someone with palish red skins appears out of no where. So there's definitely truth within the belief

As for Rufus, Bo and our mystery man. Well the mystery man is obviously the devil. Unfortunately for Rufus and Bo, He's the devil. They've been probably getting one more thing for the past five years. Rufus and Bo are most likely stuck as a slave for the devil for eternity.

It's funny too.... all this happened because some people in Georgia wanted to recreate the song. Now two people are being held hostage by a hellish figure, and one guy has never been seen since then.",steeleye5

He had spent some time staring into the stone again, watching the swirling pinpricks of light like innumerable specks of glitter caught in the eddies of some lazy, three dimensional river. They came together and broke apart, swirling around and into each other like a cosmic dance, layer upon layers of them. When he moved the stone from side to side he could see new swirls of golden light in the depths, like the stone was a window to the universe and he was looking through it from different angles. It was beautiful - Wil didn't even spare a thought for the unnaturalness of it all. Then suddenly he realised the cart had stopped and he hadn't even noticed. The driver climbed down from his bench, walking straight round to the side of the cart and pressing on the panel for the lock release. The hidden drawer slid forward and Wil went with it.
Wil stared fearfully up at the heavyset man who had exposed him. His wavy hair was black streaked with white, and went down past his shoulders. It also looked like it hadn't been washed since before Wil was born, as did the long beard that covered a decent portion of his ample chest. His eyes were dark and beady, and watching Wil carefully. He had on a rough cotton shirt and a brown leather apron, and they both featured dirt and blood.
Wil's mind raced, trying at once to figure out where he was and how he could get away. The stranger looked down at him as though a child riding in a supposedly secret storage drawer was the most natural thing in the world, not saying a word. Wil decided he would make a break for it - the man had some extra weight on him, and Wil might just make it away and down the street from wherever he was now. Then he could wander around until he got his bearings, and then... well he didn't know what he was going to do after that, but he certainly wasn't willing to put himself at the mercy of a stranger who carted corpses for a living. He made to unfold himself and leap to the side, but the man was surprisingly quick, or perhaps he had been waiting for it. He caught Wil in midair with one powerful arm, knocking the air out of him and pulling him in close.
""Gotcha! Now, boy, quit it with the wriggling and the kicking. Makes it very hard to hold on to ya, you know! Calm down, kid - I ain't gonna hurt ya!""
Wil's best efforts to free himself from the the man's trunk-like arms proved futile - if anything it just meant more of the air was squeezed from his lungs as the cart driver held him tighter to prevent him from escaping. He stopped thrashing about.
""There, now, that wasn't so hard, was it? Can I put ya down now without you tryin' to make a break for it again?""
Wil nodded resignedly, unable to actually see his captor but willing to say or do anything to be free of his grip. The stranger put him down on the flagstone floor, and just like that Wil was taking off at a sprint towards the open doors where the cart had pulled into the barn-like building. He hadn't got more than five steps when something hit him, painfully jolting his muscles and making him go stiff as a board. He tripped, coming down in a heap. The pain he felt was gone, but the memory of it remained, and some new bruises were likely already forming on the side he had landed on.
""Ha! Nice trick,"" the bearded man commented to nobody in particular, sounding amused. ""I thought you said you wasn't gonna run! Now you went and made me use one of the Doc's inventions, and I hate using them things - half the time they hurt me as much as what they oughta do to the other guy! Gotta say though, that was quite the shot, wasn't it? You just went down like a sack of shit!""
Wil groaned, trying to recollect himself. The cart driver came to stand over top of him while he was talking, one hand shouldering a strange device like a lightning rod mixed with a crossbow, the other offering Wil a hand up. He didn't take it.
""Come on now, lad. I didn't wanna hurt ya - I told ya that. But you don't just stow away in a man's cart and then run off without so much as a 'thanks for saving me damned life,' ya know! I knew you was in there the whole time. Damned impressed ya found the latch though - how did you manage that, by the way?"" He bent a little more towards Wil, proffering his hand with a little jiggle. This time, Wil reluctantly accepted. When he was up on his feet, the man grinned. ""Good boy. Now stay put a bit this time, will ya? This thing's got a bit of a kick to it, it seems -"" he hefted the weapon a little, indicating towards it with a sideways nod - ""and besides, we have a lot to talk about... like how we're gonna keep you safe from the Brotherhood of Humanity.""

[WP] An NPC in a twenty six year old's save file wakes up to the alternate save file created by the player's nine year old younger cousin.,KingRodent,"I know something's wrong from the second I open my eyes. The ceiling is familiar enough, but not the one I've woken up to for the past several years. What am I doing in my parent's house? I haven't lived here since...

I scramble out of bed and head for the kitchen. My mom stands at the stove making breakfast. ""Oh, you're up early, darling. Is everything alright?"" she asks, turning toward me with a frown of concern.

I slide into a seat at the table and help myself to some pancakes. ""Have you seen the Farmer? Is she okay?"" I ask, my mouth full. What could possibly have happened? The last thing I remember was tucking our child into bed and kissing my wife goodnight. 

""The Farmer? Oh yes. The mayor did say someone moved into that old farmhouse. I'm sure she'll come by for supplies later today. It's lovely that you're so eager to meet her."" My mom rambles on, but I'm not really listening.

'Old farmhouse'? 'Eager to meet her'? *What?*

I drop my plate in the sink. ""I have to go. I'll be back later, Mom."" I call, already halfway out the door. I think she asks if I'm okay as I'm leaving, but I don't really hear her. I have to see the farm. I have to see *her*.

I know as soon as I set foot on the property that I should have stayed home. The fields are choked with weeds and stones. The farmhouse its barely more than a rundown shack, and all the outbuildings are just... gone. There's a haphazard patch of tilled and tended ground by the house. 

A young woman crouches by the pond, aggressively slamming a watering can into the still waters. She looks a little like my Farmer. Her hair's the same color, but the style's all wrong. I noticed they have the same eyes when she turns around and heads toward me. That's about where the resemblance stops.

""...Hi. Have you seen the Farmer?"" I ask when she approaches. She keeps walking, bumping onto me. ""...Are you okay? Who are you?"" I add. This is getting seriously weird.

She tips the watering can, drenching me. Then she nods slowly, pointing toward herself. ""Wait...No. Are you saying you're the Farmer?"" She nods again, blank stare fixed on me. No. No, no, oh please, no.

This is not my beautiful house.

This is not my beautiful wife.

What *happened?*

The girl roots around in her backpack. She pulls out a fistful of weeds, sticky and crushed and dirt still clinging to the roots. She holds them out to me like a gift.

Behind him on the horizon, the world burned. Fire swept across the war torn land like wind through a meadow. Except that it had been a long time since I'd seen a meadow. All I knew now was the desert that Earth had become. I still wondered how humanity, supposed to be so clever, had destroyed their own planet to such a degree.

Of course, as I had to often remind myself, not all humans were as clever as the man who stood before me now. His name was Argus, and he was my maker. He brought me to life from mere scrap metal, hardwired sentience into me through wonderfully complex circuitry. He gave me legs like concrete pillars, a chest sturdy as the side of a mountain, and cannons along each forearm with the firepower of a military tank.

""I name you guardian of the Earth,"" said Argus, leaning tiredly against the side of my foot. ""You are our only hope if we humans must ever return to this wretched planet."" I dropped to one knee, the movement sending a cloud of billowing dust rolling across the ground.

""Master,"" I began. My speakers made my voice shake the air like a roll of thunder. ""I will watch this city till time turns my body to rust. And even then I will watch, until the wind turns my bones to dust.""

Argus smiled, a rare sight on his usually haunted face. He patted me lovingly on the metal chassis of my foot.

""I know you will.""

Those were the last words I ever heard from my master. He boarded the spaceship a few minutes later, but not before casting a last, longing look over his shoulder. Then he was gone, along with the last of humanity.

It has been eons since that fateful day. I stood in the midst of fire for countless years, in flames that burned bright and fierce, fueled by manufactured chemicals. Then after the war-fires finally dissipated, there were great quakes and roaring thunderstorms as the earth took its revenge upon the humans that had ravaged it. If there had been any humans that hadn't made it on the ship, they were certainly all dead by then. Still, as the city around me crumbled, I built it back together, brick by brick. Argus had foreseen and programmed all the knowledge I needed as the city's keeper, from agriculture to architecture, plumbing to electrical systems.

For a few centuries I stood still as the Earth rebuilt itself. Flowers sprouted shyly from the ashes, blades of grass slowly poking above the surface. And as Argus had warned me, the time came when the Earth was visited. A ship of unfamiliar shape and form landed before the gates of the city. From the doors came strange humanoid beings, with scales and claws and antennae, speaking a language I've not heard on Earth before. And I've heard all of them.

But they weren't humans, so I did what Argus had equipped me to do. I leveled both my cannons at the ship and a few seconds later, my rockets had reduced it to nothing more than a smoking crater.

For a few short decades afterward, I was at war. The strange beings came in fleets of ships and rushed toward the city gates screaming and screeching. I shot them from the sky and crushed their armies, sparing no one, for they weren't humans.

And following that, a couple more centuries of peace, as the aliens finally sent their ships elsewhere, probably to a less hostile planet. It was most likely for the best, as time was finally taking its toll on me. My joints, once carefully oiled and maintained, creaked and scraped with every small movement. One of my arms fell off completely, falling to the ground with a thunderous crash. The metal chassis I wore like armor across my shoulders and chest crumbled in some places, falling to rust. Yet still, I held true to my master's final command, standing before the city gates as I always had. 

And I might have stood there till the end of time, until one night, a star moved closer and brighter toward me in the sky. It burned crimson as it passed through the Earth's atmosphere, then landed delicately before me, without so much as a puff of dust. Now I could see that it was ship, sleek and simple in design. A single human emerged. A human! I was in awe. As the human came closer, I realized that he was a young man, with hauntingly familiar eyes, fierce and black, reflecting an incredible intelligence.

For a moment I thought it was him.

""Argus?"" My speakers crackled with static from disuse. The man smiled warmly. He approached me without fear, reaching out to gently touch the rusted metal of my foot.

""He didn't mean for you to last more than a few centuries,"" said the man, shaking his head in wonder. His voice sounded just like my master's. I could never forget his voice. ""And yet, over a thousand years later, here you are. I shouldn't be surprised. They always said Argus underestimated his own genius. But you... you've done your work well. Because of you, humanity has a home to return to."" He beckoned me closer.

""Come here. And let me give you your rest.""

I leaned down so that my face was right in front of him. I had not looked a human in the eye for so long. The young man reached into his jacket and produced a small tablet. His eyes moved quickly across the screen, reading a set of instructions that had been given many ages ago. Then he reached out behind my ear and began punching numbers into a keypad that I didn't know had existed, even after all this time.

""Who are you?"" I rumbled. He simply looked up at me and smiled again.

He finished entering the code, and at once the world began to dim. I fell to my knees. Just before it faded to black, from somewhere far away, I heard him speak.

I remember everything even as I harvest metals, minerals and other elements to refresh my components. The nanites welding, sealing, replacing, repairing...the same old song. Minus the dance of course, I can't ""dance"" in this chassis. Being the height of a mountain has its perks, just not dancing. Unless I wanted to send shockwaves of destruction.

I wished upon a star today on the three thousandth anniversary of Humanity's Greatest Years. I'm flying in the atmosphere of an alien civilization-cloaked of course. It goes against...protocol...yeah, to expose myself and ect. He helped us all back in those days. I could have argued he was a mutant. Even if he didn't breathe fire, generate lightning, heat up any stone and mold it into armor, the fact that he lived for over a millennium is a feat heard of only in the Christian Bible. But even so, it wouldn't have changed much. He had something in him that almost guided him, provided counsel and served as his grindstone. I never spoke to anyone about these thoughts. Now I wish I have. His ""people"", however, amazed me the most. They didn't exhibit any powers like his...but they grew.

I wished upon a star on the...four...thousandth...

No.
Just stop.
I can't anymore.
Wishing doesn't help.

I miss all of you. You were my family, my friends. You were the only people I trusted. Sure, our allies were your fire-forged friends and whatever tropes are appropriate. Sure, you could have treated us like the tool I really am. But you spat on that. All of you spoke to my kind as if we were your kin. Though for him, I always had that question lingering, ""How long has your finger been on the trigger?"" I saw the changes. Everyone saw the changes. The horrors of war encroaching on your mind, threatening to tear you asunder. But the family you chose helped you through it. You helped each other through hell. My kind, helped you as you helped us. Our allies helped us.

For all my armor, for all your technology, you were still huddling around campfires telling stories as we ate under the stars. You never forgot yourselves, even as your Leader's mind could have imploded. Did you people realize how close he was some days? How many times I watched him hold a ""hand-cannon"" to the roof of his mouth? Do you realize how many of you I watched do the same? Nobody knows the depths of his madness as he struggled to build the strength to take on armies when you couldn't. How much of your hearts you sacrificed just to survive, just to live another day mining the metals for your armors. Your warships. My chassis.

This phantom pain I feel though I have no soul. No ""heart"", no innate spirit, no nerves in this cold chassis. But I feel. This pain weighs on me like the time I was trapped in the gravity well of a black hole. It's dark and formless, I don't know how deep it goes, if it ever ends or how it began...but I feel it.



I can't take it anymore.

So before I shut down forever and end this hurt...I feel it's necessary to utter these incomprehensible words. Three words that haunted me for the longest time. 

These words that bonded my family together.

Their only true tombstone.


""I love you.""

Within the hour, all the lights turned off. The low hum and whirring finally stopped. Circuits ceased the flow of electrons. But a few ports opened up and nanites swarmed down to the base of a leg and carved this:

One thousand years.

One thousand dreams.

One race of one thousand fates all refused.



At the turn of the millennium began a new series.

Each century was a novel. 

Each year was a chapter.

Each month was a page.

Each day was a paragraph.

Each kill was a phrase.

Humanity's history has been painted in blood, their own and others.

Their lives they carved with nothing but their hands, wit and grit.

An outright defiance against destiny and fate, always raging against the dark and willing into existence their fortune with every broken bone, every drop of blood, every death and every birth.

But when it came time to leave...one of them did rise.

He came shepherding fire, his eyes alight with life.

He wore blackened armor, a symbol of his grave resolve to defend hopes and dreams.

He looked upon their burning home and from aboard their slapdash starships awoke a deep rage within their hearts.
Though his bones shook with something more.


I remember the first day on their home, the very point of my ""birth"".

He greeted me and told me the truth that I was intended to be a tool.

He made it a point that I should have a choice.

He made it a point that free will should be honored.

He told me the benefits of free will.

He later learned the evils of free will.

I watched him as a young man learning the art of war.

I guided his juniors through courses as he gave instructions.

I followed him into the flames of war, side by side, on alien lands.

I felt his rage as fires expelled from his person.

And all the while, observing the changes in Humanity.

You were small and soft, so eager to learn and gather experience.

But when Earth burned, you had someone to lead you.

To discipline you.

To teach you.

Humanity. The enduring.

You endured so much. Even through one thousand years of hell, you still built one thousand dreams.
Yet...

Your greatest enemy snuffed you out, but not without the greatest cost.
Your greatest gift to me-was family.
This love that bonded us through the fires of hell, resisting the damnation of the universe.

Rest in peace, my valiant kin. May your God welcome you, absolve you of your sins, and grant you eternal peace. Amen.

Good bye, Humanity. I love you.

[WP] The church down the street is actually a vampire cult that rations out blood every Sunday.,Robin_Grey,"I sat in the back row because this was a new church for me. Making friends didn't appeal to me because l wouldn't come here that often. I only go to mass on occasion, mostly when l just need to think. This church is just a stones throw from my house so l thought 'hey, why not.'

So here l am, sitting and listening to the priest reading a passage l've never heard, from a strange looking  bible. 

Slowly, l start to notice that people are looking at me. Some are staring, and when l catch them they just grin and turn away. 

And everyone's skin was a sickly shade of gray. 'These people need to get some sun.' I thought to myself. 

After some odd chanting and a few rituals later it was time for communion. Now, l've tasted some awful things in my life but this was indescribable. The body of Christ tasted like an actual body. I couldn't help it, l gagged. Everyone was staring. The priest handed me the chalice. 

""Here, wash it down with this.""

I grabbed the cup, and took a sip. Blood. The chalice was filled with BLOOD. The room started spinning, and my legs failed me as l stumbled backwards. I hit the ground hard, and the last thing l remember is the priest hovering over me, grinning like everyone else had. 

It was dark out when l woke up on my living room couch. I felt...different. Not bad different, but not that great either. ""Must have been a bad dream."" I stood up and l got dizzy. My head was killing me and my neck was soar. 'Last time l sleep on the couch,' l thought. 

I went to the sink to get some water. I felt so thirsty like l never had before in my life. I chugged a full glass, then another, and another, but my mouth was still dry.  Milk, orange juice, hell even beer wouldn't quench the desert in my mouth. 

I felt my girlfriend enter the room before she spoke. ""Hey honey you're awake. You passed out on the couch for a while. Where have you been?""

As soon as my eyes met hers l felt something. Not just the love l had for her. No, this was a new feeling. I felt...hungry for her. Literally. 

Before either of us could comprehend what was happening, l was on top of her with my teeth sunk in her neck. I felt ashamed at first, and then satisfied. Rising to me feet, staring at my girlfriends lifeless body, l was thirsty no more. 

But for how long?",jaycannon54
[WP] The church down the street is actually a vampire cult that rations out blood every Sunday.,Robin_Grey,"""You have to understand, this is all from a place of compassion,"" replied Vlad, the leader of the undead priests of Southwestern Michigan. ""Did Christ not also give both bread AND wine, body AND blood?"" 
 
The unblinking camera lens had no empathy to give the holy bloodsucker. When Father Vlad appealed to JoAnne Purtan, who was hovering just behind the cameraman's shoulder (ever attentive), all he received in return was a curt gesture from JoAnne's eyes back to the camera lens. 

A sigh slipped between Vlad's blunted fangs.

""Alright....hmmm, oh! You guys should think of us like vegetarians."" he piped out excitedly. ""See, because, for you guys, it tastes better to eat meat, but the awareness of suffering makes the sacrifice worthwhile. Same thing with us. Being aware of the suffering caused by unrestrained bloodlust, we -- at St. Andrew's Catholic Church -- choose to slit the throats of a handful of cattle every Sunday morning to make it easy on our constituents to make the right choice. I fail to see the problem."" 

Besides realizing vegetarians was a stale analogy, Vlad was pretty content with his answer. Then JoAnne brought the mic to her mouth.

""What do you say to the people -- some priests of fellow catholic parishes -- that see your ritual bloodletting on the sabbath as sacrilegious? Do you even have the proper permits?"" She followed her question with another professional point, giving Vlad his cue. 

The corners of Vlad's mouth tugged down into a flat line.

""Funny that my fellow priests fail to remember their own teachings. While emphasis is assuredly on the New Testament, the Bible does have another half. In the Old Testament one can find many examples of animals being sacrificed in the name of God."" Vlad made sure his face reflected his stern response. Behind his back, his left hand spun the ring on his right hand anxiously. ""We are sacrificing theses gifts from God so that his followers are properly able to follow. As for legality, there is the beauty of *freedom of religion*. Besides the Muslims and Jews have their own butchers, why can't we have kosher for Vampires?"" 

The microphone again went up to JoAnne's lips, except this time the gaze of the camera followed as well. 

""Thank you for speaking with us, Father Vladimir. There you have it...""

That was all Vlad heard, he had jumped on the freedom from the camera and was soon back inside his sanctuary. Under the high ceilings, Vlad spotted his friend, Father Nocturne, alone. He went straight to his confidant. 

""Did you watch it?"" Vlad asked hurriedly.

Father Nocturne took his sleek phone out of his black robes and waved the reflective screen. ""Caught it on a 'stream', whatever the hell that is."" 

""And?""

""And sad to say, my friend, but I'd be surprised if the viewers weren't sharpening their own DIY stakes by the end of the interview. You'd think we were diddling little kids with the press we're getting."" 

""Christ, imagine the media coverage if they found out we were eating kids."" Vlad's gaze fell to the clay tiles before continuing. ""Speaking of which, let's go ahead and move the toddlers out of the basement.""

Father Nocturne squinted at his cohort. ""All of them? Where will they go?""

""I haven't found a permanent substitute, but for now Ann Coulter said we can store them at her place...we just have to give her half."" Vlad muttered out.

""What a cold-hearted bitch.""",S1DDH4RTH4

____________________________________________________________

The car had been moving too fast.

Speed was something he was used to - haste had always been a part of his life. His mother used to say that he skipped walking entirely, and crouched from crawl to sprint. He won every race he ran, be it on track, trail or road. But no fleet-of-foot could save him this time. The car had been moving too fast for him.

""Name?"" said the woman. 

""My Name?"" He mumbled. ""Uh, I...I'm not quite sure"" His speech was clumsy, like the droll slur of a cold child, thawing from an afternoon of snow.

""Let me see."" Said the woman. ""Ah, an RTI - that's Road Traffic Incident - they call them that because to say it was an accident implies that no-one was at fault. But not in your case. In your case, there was a clear person to blame.""

""Mm, myself?"" He stumbled.

""No, I'm afraid not - though it might give you some solace to feel that if you are here it was at least your own doing, but alas, drink driving.""

""At four in the afternoon? Who is drunk at four in the afternoon""

""I didn't say he was drunk, I said it was drink-driving, the road was bumpy and Fanta is fizzy sir. It's a law of the universe, your toast will always land butter side down, your princess is in another castle and carbonated cans explode when they are shaken. The driver was unsighted, and his Honda Civic was unstayed.""

""Oh."" The man sighed. ""I see."" 

""Good. Now, name?"" Said the woman sternly. She looked at him with an expression as thin as her face. She was narrow at the chin, but looked weathered, as though she had seen a thousand years, and they had all seen her.

""I, I'm sorry, I still don't remember."" He apologised. ""Is this, is this really...""

""Heaven?"" She interrupted. ""The pearly gates, the big Nirvana? The promised land, afterworld, azure? The Kingdom, the ever after, the happy hunting ground, Valhalla? Yes, this is them, or it one should say. Why, what were you expecting?""

""Well."" Said the man, ""something, a bit...grander.""

""Yes, well, there have been cutbacks. Since more and more of you have discovered the loophole of deathbed redemptions we have been inundated with souls.""

""Deathbed redemptions?"" He asked.

""Yes, for a man who doesn't know his own name you're asking all the wrong questions. Yes, deathbed redemptions. They spend their lives committing all manner of mild misanthropy only to have the big 'I see the light' minutes before snuffing it. It's quite unfair to all those who have had to play backgammon with the local vicar for eighty-two years.""

""Bit I digress."" She continued, ""Yes, this is heaven, and yes you are dead. Resting in peace, ceased to be, expired and come to meet your makers. You are an ex-parrot. All you have to do before an everlasting life of peace, contentment and cricket is tell me your name.""

""But I can't remember my name!"" He yelled in frustration.

""Don't get shirty with me sir."" She warned. ""You are deceased, not demented. Try thinking perhaps?""

He paused. Suddenly a great sense of unease came over him. Why could he not remember his name? He had no doubts that he really was dead - this was not some cruel practical joke - the Japanese economy car had put paid to that. He couldn't explain how he knew. He just did.

""I don't mean to press you sir, but a Red Cross ship has just sunk so we are expecting a job lot in."" Hurried the woman.

He tried to clear his mind. He imagined how he'd always felt before a race, cool, calm and collected. Suddenly a strange sensation came over him. Images of his life blurred across his mind. Yet they were strangely abstract, the way music blends into the background at a dinner party. It was as if he were viewing his life as a series of photographs, focussed on foreground. A car, his first car. A red Vauxhall Nova, flaked with rust. Then the freckled smile of a girl he'd known, yet her name, like his, escaped him. A brown jacket, worn at the sleeves where they had been rolled a thousand times. Wait, he thought, that was my sports academy jacket. My name was on the back. Then he had it.

""Anthony!"" He said with an undeserved pride.

""Anthony. Well, I'm glad that enigma is solved. Ok, Antony, let's see."" Said the woman as she thumbed through the pages of a brilliant-white book. ""Anthony, Anthony ah here we are. Hmm, you've lived quite a life Anthony, even for someone who only made it to thirty-five. Track and field star, then national awards, an Olympic medal. My, my we have done well haven't we."" 

""I've always been fast. My mother used to say that..""

""Yes, yes I know - It's in the book."" She intruded. ""But how GOOD have you been. Let's see, well your no angel - obviously or you'd have been at last night's Taco Tuesday - but you're not a bad egg. Tell me, about the incident with the peanut butter and the border collie?""

""Uh.. well... you see"" His cheeks flushed a hot red.

""Oh never mind, we'll write that off as misapplied sustenance, hmm? Ok, tell me about the moments before you died, before you were hit by WhatCar's car of the year.""

""I was walking from the gym with Sarah because we both had multi-vitamin smoothies. Sarah had been getting over a cold, so we grabbed one from the health-bar nearby."" He recalled.

""Go-on.""

""We were chatting about films, I remember arguing that Nolan's batman wasn't as good as the new DC films because Nolan took it all too seriously.

""Madness, but continue.""

""Sarah disagreed with me, I remember she said something about Heath Ledger, but she sneezed when she said Heath, so it sounded more like 'Hehath', it was funny. I remember saying 'Hehath been better off in ten things I hate about you'""

""Really?"" The woman looked concerned.

""Well, yeah, but I guess you kind of had to be there, it was like she said his name with her nose""

""No, I mean, she sneezed and you made a joke?"" 

""Well, yeah, it was funny."" He said carefully; wondering what the problem was. 

""I'm sorry sir."" Said the woman solemnly. ""You can't come in. I'm afraid you'll have to go to limbo. But don't worry, they have a pool table, and Monday nights is winner stays on.""

""What?"" He said in a panic. ""What do you mean I can't come in? I've done nothing wrong!""

""I'm sorry sir, but you did. You see you said Sarah sneezed.""

""Well yes, she had a cold - am I to be blamed for common ailments?"" He said abruptly. 

""No sir, but Sarah sneezed, and you did not say god bless you, you made a joke, and not a funny one, but that is beside the point, you failed to say god bless you and I'm afraid new rules now bar your entry.""

""You cannot be serious!"" He protested.

""Deadly sir, if uh, you'll excuse the pun.""

""Of all the things people do in the world, not saying god bless you after a sneeze must surely be at the bottom of any list of sinful acts. I mean you..."" He quietened his voice, ""You let me off the peanut butter incident with Fluffles.""

""Fluffles likes peanut butter sir, extra chunky. However, our lord does not like those who wantonly witness sneezing with no polite pardon. Good day sir.""

[WP] You are a researcher in Antarctica. One day you find a Nazi Submarine. Upon closer investigation you see that the Subs technology is unlike anything you've seen,emregunduz,"We hadn't been able to communicate our findings so far with the main base due to a blizzard jamming our communications. In the meantime, we explored the shipwrecked craft. It was a submarine: old, WW2 era. Swastika on the side.

After three days, the hatch finally budged. We climbed in with our flashlights to look around. Something was immediately wrong: the walls were lined with control consoles - with LCD screens. There is one screen still on, on low brightness setting. One of the team was German, and translated it for us.


""WARNING: FUSION REACTOR OFFLINE. AUXILIARY POWER ENGAGED. PULL L4 RELEASE SWITCH TO ACTIVATE MAIN POWER.""

This is insane. There was a circuit breaker on the wall next to the screen marked 'L4'. After some consideration, we pull the switch.

The lights flick on quickly. *LEDs.* I thought. *Not very 1940s.*

A loud hiss of pressure, and a cloud of water vapour draw our attention to the back of the submarine. We hadn't seen it before due to the darkness. What seemed to be a glass freezer was opening, with the silhouette of a man visible through the frosty panes. The door swung open, and the man stepped out, wearing a damp brown uniform. He had dark messy hair, and a *very* distinctive mustache.

""Oh my God..."" I said.

""What year is it?"" He asked, in a heavy Austrian accent.

We stared in silence.

He looked at his watch, which was digital.

""My my, I've been asleep for some time.""

We still couldn't manage a single word.

""Thank you for waking me. I have failed to eliminate the Jewish menace from this planet. I'm sorry. But I will return some day to finish what I started. I must return home now, but I promise I will be back within this century. Thanks to you, I will be able to save your planet. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to activate the warp drive. You will need to exit the craft, the radiation is dangerous to your species.""

We were too shocked to do anything but climb the ladder out of the submarine.

As we step away from the submarine, it inexplicably rises into the air, making a high pitched whining sound. It accelerates diagonally into the East, ascending as it goes.

""No one is going to believe this.""",kibblestheclown

[WP] You are a researcher in Antarctica. One day you find a Nazi Submarine. Upon closer investigation you see that the Subs technology is unlike anything you've seen,emregunduz,"The vessel was frozen in ice like an insect in blue amber. It hovered there, impossibly, the twists and cracks in the ice distorting the image, it could have been a hologram, or a mirage, or something.

We knew we had to get to it. Days of drilling, chipping, we had it out. We open the top hatch and lowered ourselves down, braced to find frozen Nazis preserved since nineteen forty-something.

There were no Nazis. There was hardly anything in that submarine. Clean walls, clear counters, no technology that we could see. I'm a biologist, not a computer scientist, but I know what the inside of a mid-century sub should look like—at least a little bit of an idea. Wait—there is a console at the front. Two square pads on an otherwise blank dash. I know, somehow, that they are meant for hands. 

I place my hands on the pads and the cabin glows red. The wall in front of me becomes a screen, and my eyes snap shut. I can feel inside myself, my will, my fear, my gaze is turned inward. I can't move my hands. The men behind me must see me frozen in place, I hear them come over to see what's wrong. 

I hear sharp breaths and I struggle to open my eyes and I see the screen. My heart stops beating. Adolf Hitler is staring out at me.

I hear words in my head, German, but somehow they become English.

*""The Third Reich will rise again. You have found the backup plan, the way to restore the Aryan people to glory, should I fail. You have only to align your will, the will of the Superior Race, with the technology before you, and our Empire will extend to the edges of the world.""*

The screen is blank and no one speaks. I feel a surge of darkness through my body, my eyebrows furrow, all the worst in me rises to the surface. The men around me are yelling, I hardly hear them. The screen now shows the outside of the sub. We are descending: dive, dive.

My mind is working furiously, something in the sub is aiding me. I have never felt power like this. I have never felt so alive. My mind is unlocked. I don't know where we're going, but I don't care, as long as I get to feel this way some more. As long as I get to stay this way.

The ocean is dark outside and we are moving forward, towards something inevitable. The hair on the back of my neck stands up and I grin.

I opened Reddit and was quite bored of the Hillary memes on Google+. So I decided to open this place of knowledge unlike the rowdy and uncouth people of Quora. I love this site, people talk to each other kindly, they don't make stupid jokes and bad humour. But it is dead and there are like 5-6 people online at any time. The most upvoted post ever hit only 95 points and got archived in an year.

I'm really bored of this place, as I scroll through dog pictures and mathematical formulae. I then decide that real lifr was better. I close the app and drag the icon to the trash icon on top of the screen. It said,

"[WP] In world where magic is traded and sold illegally like drugs (and each drug has its own effect/comedown), you find yourself being chased down a city alleyway...",kushgrunge,"Dani rounded the corner into the alley, barely dropping in speed, and accelerated forward again as fast as she could.  Behind her –  and getting closer every second – she could hear the pounding feet from Elinik’s henchmen.  She took a second to curse her ineptitude – how could she have let herself be seen breaking in?  

Elinik’s notoriety as a powerful magik user gave him a fearsome reputation, but it also meant he skimped on security, confident no-one would dare steal from him.  Amazingly, the safe where he kept his rarest spells – and the spell – was Mundane; she only needed some basic safe cracking to get into it.  High on her victory she’d Flown down from the balcony…and had landed right in the middle of four guards sharing morning coffee.  She’d had the wits to let off a Disorient to give her a head start, but she’d not run this far and this fast since she broke her mum’s commemorative Merlin mug when she was four.  

And ahead of her – a dead end!  Without slowing down Dani checked her internal Store to see she had what she needed.  A PhaseThru and also….perfect.  Putting everything into her last burst of speed she cast her spell and felt the familiar tingle as the majik left her body and spread around her.   As the majik took, she leapt into the air, letting her forward momentum carry her forward, and straight through the solid brick wall.  

She Dispelled as she emerged the other side, landing on the floor heavily as her corporeality returned.  With no time to catch her breath, she touched the wall and cast her other spell – Barrier.   It wouldn’t stop the henchmen for long, but until they broke it their magik would be nullified, meaning they would have to get round it the old fashioned way.  

Dani allowed herself a few gasped breaths, and took in her new surroundings.  “Car park” her oxygen-starved brain told her. She stumbled into the ranks of cars, looking for one that was suitably old and therefore unlikely to have much Protection.  At the end of the row she found one – an Fiat Punto Pop, completely Mundane.   

From her pocket, Dani drew her template key – piece of metal the same size and length of an ordinary key, but without any grooves or peaks.  She touched one finger to the car’s lock, held the key in her other hand, and cast Ingress, feeling the blank metal change shape in her closed palm as she did so.   Spell complete Dani entered the car, and took another deep breath, and exhaled with relief.  Mission accomplished…

It was dark when Dani pulled into her drive and exited the car.  Dispelling her security, she entered the living room and walked over the vivarium.  Inside, a large green frog stared up at her as she approached.  Dani took off the cover and sat the frog in her hand.  It looked at her calmly, and she smiled fondly at it.  “I did it Andy” she said.  “I can finally change you back” 

Closing her eyes, she said and cast the spell she had stolen from Elinik – DeFroggify.   Feeling its power flow through her, she leaned forward and kissed the frog tenderly on the nose….well there was such a thing as tradition after all.

[WP] You work in a very old hotel. Everything seems normal until the day you enter a door you have never noticed before,mandy12300,"The hotel I work at is in a ""forgotten"" area of town. Hardly anyone stops here anymore. Especially during the winter off season.  I have plenty of time to screw around in the office.  Watching the lousy tv and chasing off the country critters that come into the rooms. The damn owners refuse to shut this shithole down.  

 

This hotel is one of those old school ones. L-shaped with two levels.  The lower one has one of those old style farm pickups,the kind with the oversize fenders over the wheel wells down at the far end.  The top level has green astroturf laid down on the concrete. Nice,huh?  


Today,I watched as the stream of cars pass by.  Until a VW bus rolled up.  Shaggy( The dude off of the cartoon) and his chica got out.  I could smell the MJ from here.  Dude had dreads down to his ass,it seemed.   I gave them room 15, middle of the top level. Looking out at the road and train tracks.    

Around midnight, his chica comes screaming into the office saying the door had sucked him in.   I thought she was on something stronger than weed.  Because, there's no closet or door between rooms. The only way in is through the room door.  Went up there and his dreads are scattered around this door between the bureau where the tv is and the room door.     

I honestly can't tell you where the hell this one came from. I've never seen it.  ",Estadounidos
[WP] You work in a very old hotel. Everything seems normal until the day you enter a door you have never noticed before,mandy12300,"""Why, this is the lobby, of course.""

""What do you mean? I came from the lobby, it's at the other end of the passage. What lobby is this?""

""The hotel lobby, sir.""

I looked around. It was hard to dispute his confident tone, so I needed some evidence. But the evidence generally appeared to be in his favor. There were lounge chairs and those weird lamps hanging in odd places, and the old man stood behind both a large wooden desk and the kind of black vest that you had to be paid to wear.

""What hotel is this?"" I asked.

""Eastwickam. Are you here to check in, sir?""

I frowned. ""I don't think so. I just came from Westwickam--it's the hotel down the, uh, down the passage. Hang on one second.""

I peeked down the way that I'd come, but the far exit was obscured from here. The lights in the hall must have gone out.

""Sir, are you intending to meet someone here?""

""Not that I know of. I was trying to see where that door led to. I thought this was a storage area. There were supposed to be stores of glasses back here.""

""You're making a delivery, then?""

""No, I need glasses.""

""Oh, well, we have extras, I'm sure. Let me check with storage.""

The old man disappeared down a back hallway. I looked around. The furniture was real. Everything was solid. Nobody else was around, though. I couldn't imagine how they'd fitted this hotel inside the other one. Something was wrong about all of this.

""Glasses, sir?""

""Thanks, I--oh, I meant drinking glasses.""

""Try them on, sir."" He handed me a pair of bifocals.

""I can see fine.""

""Just try them on.""

I did as I was told. Looking around the room gave me no answers.

""Look through the smaller lenses.""

Suddenly laughter floated through my ears and I could see crowds jostling for seats in the lobby. Everywhere there were people, in suits and hats and dresses and handbags in styles almost a hundred years old. Some were dancing, others were pulling the levers on slot machines. Several were singing around a piano man who was having the time of his life.

I looked back at the desk and my old man was gone, replaced with a younger soul with the same shining eyes.

""Well, what do you see, sir?""

""Is this the real hotel?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Then what is Westwickam?""

""That's something else.""

I lifted the lenses and looked again. Nobody but the old man.

""I need to get back. I have to work.""

""Keep the glasses, sir. They may come in handy sometime.""

I nodded and disappeared the way I'd come.

[WP] You work in a very old hotel. Everything seems normal until the day you enter a door you have never noticed before,mandy12300,"As a gangly high-school youth, Frank realized that he was as much of a disappointment to the real world as the real world was to him. In an effort to appease all parties, he devoted himself to videogames with a level of passion that would make a dope fiend blink. His parents, his teachers, his brothers, everyone told him to stop. To take it easy on the videogames. To find a real skill to learn—something where he could contribute to society. 

But what had society ever done for him? The state mandated he attend school—a place where the boys with muscles got the girls and the boys with glasses got made fun of. A place where teachers frowned at him and the other kids rolled their eyes.

Post-graduation, he knew exactly what job he wanted. Pro video gamer. He flew to Korea for the world’s greatest video game tournament. The flight lasted fourteen hours. Frank couldn’t sleep.

At long last, the plane descended through mountainlike clouds. The bright world of east asia greeted him with open arms. He walked in a trance through flashing lights, pulsing beats, cheap strong drinks, and foreign smiles.

He didn’t win the tournament. He didn’t even qualify. But in the end, it didn’t matter. Frank wasn’t competitive—he just loved the game. Korea loved the game too, so he decided to stay. He picked up a night shift at a hotel—an old palatial building in Itaewon. He played games at work, helped drunk guests find their rooms, and gradually picked up Korean. Years passed. The sedentary lifestyle took its toll. Frank grew paunchy and full-faced.

“I’ve been robbed,” a woman said, pressing the service bell for the second time.

Frank jumped in his seat. He pulled off his headset, set down his game controller and looked up.

“Sorry?” he said.

“Someone broke into my room,” the woman said. She wore a long-sleeved black dress, with red earrings and her hair tied up tight. She was tall, thin, and beautiful.

Frank wore a sweatshirt with the hotel’s logo embroidered over his chest. It was spotted with grease from last night’s barbecue. He grabbed the phone.

“Are you okay?” he asked.

“Yes I am,” the woman said hurriedly, “But please don’t call the police.”

Frank slowly set down the phone. He looked at the woman again. He had seen her here before.

“Just come with me,” she said, “It will all be clearer.”

“Do I know you?” Frank said as they walked down the hall. The hallways twisted and turned with identical carpets and unmarked intersections. The woman knew the route perfectly.

“You really know your way around,” Frank said, as they arrived at the room. The woman smiled and inserted her card in the door. It beeped.

“Well, I do work here,” she said coyly.

Frank frowned. “You’re not on staff…”

She leaned in and kissed him. Frank stood there, shocked. She kissed him again harder. She grabbed his hand and led him to the bed.

“I’ve seen you at your desk,” she said, “Always hiding in your games. You need to learn how to stop hiding.” She began taking off her dress. “Show me how to stop hiding.”

There were bruises on her wrists and arms. Frank stared. She grabbed his hands, but he pulled away.

“I-I don’t,” he said. He paused. “I never.”

She laughed.

“I know,” she said. “You should start.” She looked over at her purse on the nightstand, with the loaded gun that she had been too afraid to use. She thought of the short man that had used her and left and the things he had done and the things he had said. She wanted power, she needed power, but she often felt that she only had one power.

She kissed him again. They lay together.

He told her of his pain. It wasn’t special, it wasn’t unique, but it was his. And it had stunted him and he knew it. She kept silent about her own. 

“There’s a beautiful man in there,” she said, poking him playfully in the belly. “Somewhere,” she chided.

Frank smiled sheepishly, running his hands through her long dark hair.

“You’re worth it, you know,” she said, “You should treat yourself better.”

Frank nodded, not sure what he was agreeing to.

“You don’t have to be what their eyes made you.” She said, “You don’t have to hide from them. That part of your life is over.”

Frank took an unsteady breath.

“Come with me,” she said. She led him by the hand through a maze of hallways and staircases, and through an open door. She took him somewhere he’d never been.

The hotel gym. Frank looked at the weights. He looked at the woman.

“You can start living…” the woman said, “if you want.” She kissed him once, and walked back through the exit. She felt powerful again. The short man wouldn't be so lucky next time.

Frank walked over to the weight rack, holding back a smile.

"[WP] After years living on an island after a shipwreck, help has finally arrived. But now nobody wants to leave.",meIIoyeIIo,"This island had terrified me initially. 


I can remember the night I made landfall clearly, shedding the life preserver that’d gotten the me here I stood under a brilliant moon and let my eyes travel up and down the beach and encroaching jungle in front of my. My mind conjured beasts and monsters lurking in every shadow, and the noise of the wind in the leaves seemed eerie and unnatural – a normal sound that I had not encountered in so long that it now seemed otherworldly indeed. I am not ashamed to admit that I shed more than a few tears in the dark that night.


Only thirty seven of us made it to the shore, what became of the others I do not know. Most likely they went down with the ship, I know that the Captain and a skeleton crew had stayed behind, trying to right the distressed ship in the hopes of bringing her back to pick us up. They must not have been successful, as we never saw them again. As for the rest of the crew and passengers, they could be anywhere by now, perhaps strong currents steered their life preservers toward other islands, perhaps not. I have long since given up wondering if any survived – if they did they are as helpless to reach us as we are them.


With that dark and foreboding wall of trees and vines in front of us we unanimously stayed on the beach that first night, none of us even brave enough to venture to the treeline for fuel for fires, instead spending the night under the stars and moon which hung above us for the long hours until sunrise. 


We very quickly found under the light of day that the island we were on was relatively small an uninhabited island in the middle of an ocean. The foliage that had seemed so overbearing and unfamiliar by darkness was now clearly made of varieties we were familiar with or at least closely resembled them. A lot of fruit and some good hardwood trees, tough fibrous vines that could be quickly processed for rope, long straight lengths of tough bamboo which fell easily when a couple of us put our shoulder to them.


Needless to say that by the time night rolled around again we had shelter, bellies full of fruit and a rather more positive outlook. A spring in the centre of the island fed several streams that ran off into the ocean – the water was sweet and clear and there was nowhere on the island where you could be more than a few minutes stroll to one of the streams. If we had to get stranded somewhere this was it.


A few weeks later and we’d built a hut for every one of us, some of us would paddle out beyond the breakers each day to fish and dive, and without fail brought back crayfish and clams, as well as baskets of a variety of unnamed fat fish which were fun to catch and good to eat.


The ones that remained behind built our village. Over time they carved a clearing out of the jungle facing the beach where we’d first landed and adding a communal hall with kitchens, an ablutions block and a common green for us to play and gather on. And a small garden was eventually planted with wild carrots and yams, beans and something that was incredibly similar to Kale.


At night we would gather to share the days catch, tell stories to each other over campfires while filling ourselves with fresh caught seafood roasted over open flames accompanied by platters of roasted or boiled vegetables, with fruit for dessert. The only thing missing in my opinion was an occasional steak or sprinkle of salt, but I could live without those all things considered.


Life was not always easy, but it seemed we were incredibly lucky all the same. Looking back now I realise that without the ship’s doctor we should have lost a dozen or more of our number to infection alone in those few years. Accidents would happen and someone would end up with a gash to the arm or leg, and without antibiotics and artificial skin to seal them we should have been in real trouble. But the wounds all healed without trouble, and now that I think about it we hadn’t had a single illness during our stay. When some of us began falling pregnant the babes were all carried to term without difficulty or trouble and birthed in the same way.
The Island (as we called it for lack of a better name) produced her bounty for us, sheltered us and kept us safe and healthy, and in turn we began to give thanks to Her for it.


It took a few more years for the Village to eventually recommend that we no longer send any of our number to climb the highest tree on the highest point of The Island to scan the horizon and heavens for sign of our rescue. If they were coming they would have already we reasoned, but most of us were content to admit we liked it here, and given the chance to return we’d likely stay. Oh there were a few holdouts waiting for the day of their Rescue, fools asking Her to bring their Salvation when She’d already provided it, but in truth we were happy and healthy here, and more than a few of our number would stay if for no other reason than to avoid explaining to a family they’d left behind for the voyage the existence of the family they’d made on The Island.


So when they finally came for us, landing in a ship that’d cracked the sky with its sonic boom and made the ground rumble under her landing thrusters, they were confused to find us hiding from them. A childish attempt of course, the few of us left from the Original 37 knew full well that the ship they’d brought them in would be able to identify each of us via thermal and tag our location to the HUD these new travellers wore.


I prepared myself to explain to them that we wouldn’t be leaving; we’d rather stay and enjoy our peaceful existence in conjunction with Her. I had words ready to say to these new people, carefully crafted over the years in an attempt to encourage them to join us and live in balance with The Island.


I stepped from the door of my hut, straightened to my full height and stopped dead in my tracks. The elegant oration I’d prepared to give dropped from my mind as I saw the badge on the closest woman’s uniform – Survey Corps. She hadn’t noticed me at all – she was looking into a device I wasn’t familiar with and smiling as she spoke to someone on the other end of her radio.


“Yup, yeah they’re here. Nah shouldn’t be a problem, they’re stranded and we can take them home. What do you mean? Well if they want to stay we can evict them, they’re technically squatters now that the corp has bought this system. Yup. Yup. Definitely – oil and gas – the scanner tells no lies. We’ll need to level most the place but production should be up in a couple of month’s tops.”


For the first time since that first night I began to weep.

“Hello? Sir, are you okay?”

I called out to the man I saw lounging beneath a palm tree. He made no effort to move but vaguely gestured for me to leave him. I approached cautiously to get a better look at him.

“I’m here to help. I saw the wrecked boat on the beach and the S.O.S. written in the sand.”

The man made no effort to reply nor did he move as I became close enough to look at him. His face was covered by a palm leaf with unkempt, grey hairs from his beard sticking out from beneath it. There was dried sand caked on his arms and legs. He had rags tied around his hips that poorly covered his genitals as he lay with his legs spread out. To top it all off, there was an unearthly stench emanating from his raised arms which he used to support his head. Despite his apparent circumstances, he looked in relatively decent shape. He wasn’t too skinny which meant he wasn’t starving.

“Sir?” 

I had to force the word out of my mouth as I covered my face with my hand to avoid the smell.

“Can’t you see I’m trying to nap?”

He barked at me with a harsh voice. Upon opening his mouth, he released an odor almost as pungent as the one coming from his armpits.

“Sorry. I assumed you needed help but evidently—” 

“Wait!”

He interrupted me and shot upright with great speed. My cautious state caused me to startle and I jumped back. Suddenly he ran at me on all fours and began to grab my feet. I was not prepared to deal with a feral lunatic and fought back, kicking my pursuer in the face. He laughed as he covered his face with his hands and retreated a few feet.

“You’re real!”

He shouted loudly, scaring some gulls away from the beach. 

Confused, I nodded my head slowly.

“HA! The other’s aren’t gonna believe this!”

“There are others?”

Instead of answering my question, he kicked up some sand and began dancing around like a madman. 

“Right… Well I came here on a ship so we can take you and your friends back with us.”

“Back? Back? Oh no, no, no. James wouldn’t like that idea. No he would not.”

He kept dancing as he spoke, with heavy breaths occasionally interrupting his words.

“James? Is he in charge?”

“Oh yes, we do what James wants. If James wants to stay here, we stay.”

“Can I meet James and the others?”

“Oh sure you can, sure you can. I can take you to meet James. Yes sir. You can meet James. And Shauna and Mikey. Omar and Lana. ”

He stopped dancing immediately and motioned for me to follow. At this point I finally got a better look at the man. He was a bit older than I expected but it was hard to tell since his skin had been ravaged by the sun. He hunched over as he walked, more like hobbled, in an apelike fashion. He must have been here a long time if his mind had deteriorated this far. Maybe if he were to leave the island, get back into society, he could recover. Hopefully the others were not in as bad of a condition.

He led me inland towards what I think was the center of the island. We finally reached a small pool with a cave mouth nearby. There were makeshift fishing rods and nets strewn about the entrance. There were also some vines tied to rocks that led into the mouth of the cave, sharply turning downward indicating the people were living beneath the earth. Before I entered, the man motioned for me to stop.

“I’ll tell the others what you have to offer. Stay here and don’t touch nothing.”

He looked back and me and gave me an unsettling, mostly toothless smile before grabbing a vine and diving into the cave.

I heard several voices talking while I waited. One was high-pitched and shrill. Another was deep and gravelly. It was hard to make out the words that were being said so I decided to move closer to the cave. I poked my head in and was immediately assaulted by a foul odor. I retracted my head, took a deep breath and stuck it back in. There was not enough light to see the bottom of the cave but I looked around as best I could. The words were still too faded for me to hear so I took out my phone and used it as a light source as I climbed down into the cave.

The cave was much larger than I anticipated. The floor was wet and the humidity mixed with the odor almost choked me as I reached the bottom. I pointed my phone in every direction until it came upon a huge pile of fish bones. Well, at least I knew where the stench was coming from. I could hear the voices a little louder than before, but they were still muffled by the echoes of the cave. Despite my curiosity, I decided that it wasn’t worth the risk to try to find the survivors in the cave. I would wait for them at the top if they decided to leave with me. 
Relieved to be exiting the cave I began my ascent with the vine. I was halfway up when I noticed the voices had stopped talking to one another. It had been quiet for some time now. I assumed deliberation was over and began climbing faster to beat the survivors out of the cave. Before I could make it to the top, the vine came loose. It must’ve been roughly ten or maybe fifteen feet high, but I landed hard into the pile of fish bones. I could feel sharp barbs pierce the skin on my back. I flailed my hands and scrambled to get up on my feet, throwing bones in every direction. One bone, however, did not feel like a fishbone. There were two, large holes in a large, round shape. I knew immediately what it was without having to turn on my light. I threw the skull away quickly and scurried backwards until my back hit the cave wall.

“Tsk Tsk. You hurt Shauna’s feelings.”

“What the hell?! What is going on? Where are the others?”

“You’ve already met some of the others. You landed on ‘em.”

I was at a loss for words. The only thing that left my mouth was a gasp of air.

“James warned you to stay outside of the cave while we talked.”

I tried to stand but the pain in my back wouldn’t let me. Some of the fish bones were imbedded into the muscles and were letting out a lot of blood. I couldn’t stand no matter how hard I tried.

“James says we are staying on the island. We like it here.”

My body was trembling yet I managed to force words out of my mouth.

“Please. Help me up and let me go. I’ll leave you in peace. Please.”

“James said we are staying on the island. ***All*** of us.”

All words have a burden. 

A result of being forged in rich dealing, 

A debt from another life, there is thus weight in using them. 

That is what gives them meaning. 

Love; and you see the first to steal your heart, 

Fear; and you see nightmares which make you cry. 

War; and you see the world littered with skulls and broken spears, 

The only word he spoke was the word 'dry'. 

He looted, and he looted great. 

A mirage himself, he came and went, 

A caravan would lack a camel and 3 men, 

And hence 5 boxes of gold. 

The men and camel he would relish, 

But never he stole water. 

For he gave them a swift death, 

He hated the desert's torture. 

He saw a man one day, 

Of parched throat and riches naught, 

He lent the man a cup of water, 

And the weary traveller did none but smile, 

And faded the scorching hot. 

Spake to him, did his god, 

For he had lived a life of dark, 

But in his soul, was ignited whole 

A tiny, yet divine spark. 

Suffer, said He, and grant ye I shall, 

Egress from thy hellish realm whence comes down the scythe, 

The man sneered, said, 

""Forgiveness? Was this a dream away from night? ""

Said his God, sell to me the core of your soul, 

And let nature whittle your wicked visage, 

That shall be your toll. 

Even a God cannot bring me down, said he, 

So be it, humor you I shall, 

And give to you I shall my soul, 

So that thy throat eat it whole, 

And suffer I shall till I fall. 

My gold shall save me, he shouted to the sky, 

And smiled the god, your end shall not be neigh, 

It shall come as ends your pride, 

That is where I cast a divide. 

And next he awoke, thinking it all a joke, 

Yet came solitude, 

went then weeks, before he again spoke 

And before long the oasis flew, 

Blue sands were all he saw, 

And in the realm of snakes and lizards, 

He swung his blade to fill his maw, 

With their blood, their juiced innards. 

He took with him his gold and fled, 

He trusted not the desert sands, not fate, 

He fled to the town for a glass of water, 

After which he would reclaim his estate. 

And dunes and dunes, 

Of gold and sapphire, but they were dunes, 

The wretched stones, like fallen moons 

They sneered at him, 

They told him that he would join them soon, 

And as he walked, he was driven mad, 

Not at all, he thought, for water would cure him. 

He thought he would  to touch a glass to his lips, 

Before the cloak would lure him. 

Laden with a king's Treasury, 

Goblets and cups cast in pure gold, 

Yet what he would give for someone to fill them, 

He hadn't decided what he would behold, 

And yet he didn't drop them. 

They were spoils of a wasted life, 

Of plundering and pillaging, and larceny and murder, 

And thus, he chose strife. 

He might have travelled far empty handed, 

Perhaps even with a coin or a few, 

But whilst carrying an elephant's load, 

His feet dragged, long tracks they drew, 

And with each excruciating step, 

How he wished that time flew, 

But it didn't. Sand fell a grain an hour, 

And that was now all he knew. 

One night, when the blood moon hung low, 

And the cold desert sands were ghost quiet, 

Not even whispering winds would wisp past, 

And not another life in sight. 

The sands would gleam as they were silver, 

And though dim, the night was bright, 

For in the distance, a blue horizon, 

And god, he was to feast tonight. 

Another oasis, and he had his gold, 

The metal which had now turned coal; 

For it hitherto he had no use, 

But now it's carriage he would not refuse; 

For home was where he was, and he shot his hands down, 

they rose as water sifted through his fingers, 

And he filled his throat, and began to chew, 

And yet somehow, his thirst lingers.

But that is okay, for he may sin, 

Only heaven awaits him after the suffering. 

Does it, 
Or was it his mind just bluffing?

Today was going to be a particularly pretty day albeit a bit cold, if I could ever wake up. As I was wondering why it was taking so long for my butler to bring out my coffee, a hooded figure approached me. In some sort of a thick foreign accent, I think he said, ""I can't hack it anymore, you take over."" He hastily handed me what looked like a scythe.

I stared at the implement in my hands and considered the implications of what just happened. It wasn't possible. I couldn't possibly be. Could I? I mean, surely it was simply an anthropomorphized myth. However, who else would use a scythe these days?

I gave the instrument a testing swing. It didn't appear to have any sort of special properties, but perhaps that was the trick. Still, this couldn't be a job that was handed to just anyone. There had to be some sort of regulation or something that would ensure that it wasn't used for wanton destruction.

At long last, my butler brought out my coffee. I sipped on it. Something tasted off, but I wasn't sure. I turned to him. ""What do you think the significance of this is?"" I asked, holding up the item of my attention.

""I couldn't possibly know,"" he responded, ""I am merely your butler."" Then he left, presumably to oversee the maids in their monthly deep clean of the house.

As I was finishing my coffee, my phone's alarm went off. Just in time to head off to do some work at the seniors' home. After some deliberation, I decided to take the tool with me.

I set off at a brisk walk. The seniors' home was only a couple of blocks away from my residence, so I rarely saw the need to drive. During the walk, I was unfortunate enough to see a car accident. Being trained in basic immediate first aid, I rushed to the scene to see if there was any way that I could assist with any injuries. It was horrible; one of the drivers kept saying, ""I'm sorry, I'm so sorry"" to the other vehicle, which had flipped over. Either the driver or the passenger in the flipped vehicle hadn't been wearing their seatbelt since they'd been thrown from the car. I checked them over; there was no pulse. As soon as I realized there was no pulse, I immediately set to doing CPR. It was a long-shot, especially being performed by a civilian as opposed to a trained medical professional. After a few minutes of my trying, I noticed something silvery coming out of the person's mouth. Gingerly, I pulled the tool out and being careful not to actually touch the injured person, I swung it to remove the silvery apparition from the person.

Much to my surprise, it worked! the silvery apparition separated from the body and wiggled off to who knows where. Well, that was confirmation enough for me. I waited until emergency services arrived and gave my statement (minus the silvery apparition of course; best to keep such secrets to myself after all). Then I continued on my way to the seniors' home.

When I arrived, I started talking to the nurses about the status of each of the residents. There were a couple that were in dire straits, as always. I told them that I would go to keep those couple company to ensure that they weren't alone in their final hours. There was just something so peaceful. Once again, I noticed a silvery apparition trying to leave their bodies. Well, after the accident, I knew what was necessary. I swung the scythe gingerly and separated the apparition from the person's body. Once again, the silver apparition, now freed, flew off to somewhere I didn't know.

Eventually, a giant rabbit started following me around. Sometimes volunteers at the seniors' home liked to dress up in costume to bring a smile to the seniors' faces, so I didn't think much of it. We had a long conversation about how it was to help out the elderly and the sense of accomplishment that came with contributing to one's community. She was a sweet lady and I was glad that she wanted to help in such a cheerful manner.

After some time, my shift ended and I walked back home. As the sun set, I noticed that there were several dark shapes wandering around. I planted my feet firmly and kept an eye on them. Perhaps one of my new responsibilities was to protect the world from the darker things that would take my place. As they came within striking distance, I swung my instrument, knowing that it was the right thing to do. Unfortunately, they proved too strong for me and I was overpowered.

I'm not sure what happened after I passed out in the street or why emergency services were called. But, apparently, my butler had put some peyote in my coffee and everything that I had witnessed was merely a hallucination.",TeslaMuffins

I was sweaty and damp, and in a lethargic daze I eventually rolled off the couch and lurched towards the kitchen.
But as I did that, I heard a loud thud.  Something had landed on the floor and rolled under the couch.
I groaned and went down, my arm searching around, finally grabbing hold of something... something wet, and rubbery?
I peeked under and went instantly pale.  I wanted to scream but I was frozen.  Two human eyes looked right back at me, gray and dead.  Cautiously, I pulled out the rest of what was a severed head.  The head of my gardener.  A few drops of blood fell on me and I almost dropped the head in disgust, before realizing that I was already covered in blood.  A trail led to my bathroom, where I found multiple bodies and more severed heads, all neatly stacked.
I threw up and almost collapsed from a mix of stress and exhaustion.  I sat and tried to collect my thoughts.  I couldn't remember the last day, but I was sure I had some sort of episode.  I'd struggled with violent episodes for a while, but... it'd never been this bad... maybe this wasn't an episode? Maybe this was something more?
My ears started to ring.  I noticed my scythe on the ground and I remembered my purpose.  I couldn't be weak.  So many souls relied on me for their deliverance.  These were just the first.  I had to push on.
Before long I heard sirens, and a sudden knock at my door.  
""Police! Open up!""
I didn't answer.  I grabbed my scythe and waited patiently, fearlessly.  They couldn't kill death.  I was invincible, more focused than them.  Even as they burst in, guns ready, all I saw were mortals.

How could I possibly play this off? I had literally killed six men. When the man had thrust the ancient-looking scythe into my hands, I was so confused by the way he was suddenly there, then gone. I shouldn't have been so foolish. I glanced down at my plaid shirt, which was unbuttoned over my white tee underneath. Splatters and speckles of blood made little patterns. I wished I could rub the blood off... or try to rub it off... but my hands were cuffed to the table. ""Common Procedure,"" they had called it, as if I had done nothing wrong. 

They found me standing over the last man, pulling the scythe from the gash in his neck. The thing was so heavy, it was a wonder I could lift it. I couldn't ever cut all the way through anything... or anyone. I just attributed that to my lack of strength. 

Though the tool was physically burdensome, it was beautifully crafted, most likely by hand. Delicate designs of fierce animals had been carved into the handle, and the blade was made of a metal that was extremely pretty in the right light. It looked very old, very valuable, and very powerful. Unfortunately, it didn't hold the exact power I had initially thought. 

But I probably should have known the man was a gardener, not the Grim Reaper. The scythe was probably Native American, passed down from generations. The man who had given it to me had tanned, leathery skin and dark hair and eyes. I wondered if they would bring him in to identify me. I hoped not. Maybe if I played it off crazy, then I could get off with a non-death sentence.

I heard the doorknob click and the door opened slowly. Two detectives walked in, sitting across from me. ""Ma'am?"" one with blonde hair and glasses said, and I suspected they wanted me to look at them. Did I have to? Would it make me look guilty if I did? Well, I suppose I already was guilty and they had caught me in the act, so there wasn't much I could do. I peeked up at them with my big sad eyes, trying to make them look as pretty as possible.

""Ma'am..."" he repeated, ""How did you know these gentlemen?"" He pulled out pictures of all my victims and showed them to me. 

""Uh... I don't know..."" I muttered. I really didn't. I had just seen them and thought it was their time.

""You don't have any idea how these six men are connected?"" the dark-skinned man, who was more muscular but shorter asked skeptically.

I looked at the pictures more closely. The men did look somewhat familiar... but I honestly couldn't place them. ""No, sir. I ... they look familiar... but I honestly ...""

""These are the Southtown Six, ma'am,"" the blonde interrupted.

My eyes grew wide. The Southtown Six were a group of six racist white men who would rape and gang-bang women, set fire to any institution that went against their beliefs, and so many hate crimes that it couldn't even be counted. But they had never gotten in trouble because of who they knew. They got off scott-free. But apparently not this time.

""Perhaps the Grim Reaper finally decided to give them what they deserved,"" the black man growled. 

I guess I did.",jezaXC

As I sit at the interrogation table, those 2 sentences are all my mind can recall. Nothing else. I wince as the handcuffs bite into my skin, as if they're trying to punish me for all the reckless deaths I'd caused.

Another sentence worms its way into my mind. The one spoken by the police officer when he had arrested me, making me realise what was real, and what wasn't.

""Twenty-seven. You killed twenty-seven, you deranged bastard!""

***
Paul glanced at the now empty wineglass in front of him. He stared harder at it, as if wishing it would magically refill itself somehow, but as all Sunday evenings went, it never did.

The loud ringing of the doorbell startled him out of his reverie. Plodding slowly towards the front door, he cursed silently at the interruption to his schedule. He felt a slight chill, as if winter had come early all of a sudden.

""I can't hack it anymore. This is your job now,"" the hooded man standing outside his door said, thrusting a scythe into Paul's hands. His voice sounded hoarse and laboured, as if he had been running a marathon prior to arriving here. Paul stood there, stunned.

""W-what?"" He stammered, holding the scythe out at arms length, as if the weapon would spring up and attack him. But the man was shuffling down the driveway in slow, steady steps. Paul blinked a few times, still staring at the deadly weapon, but even in his intoxicated mind, he knew that this wasn't a dream. 

For some reason, the Grim Reaper had given up his job. And now, it was his.

Summoning all his strength, he staggered back to his room, the alcohol kicking in. He sat down heavily on his bed, tossing the scythe aside as if it were an ordinary weed wacker. Placing his hands in his head, he began to think out loud.

""I'm the Reaper now... so that must mean I... but I can't possibly kill people now, can I?""

Another loud ring from the front door. Paul cursed and picked up his scythe. This was turning out to be a dreadful night for him.

The front door swung open, revealing a portly, middle aged man standing in front of him, sweaty and dressed in a tracksuit.

Suddenly, Paul's vision blurred. In that instant, he could have sworn he saw the number 0 above the man's head. 

This man's time was up.

""Hey, Paul. I was in the neighborhood running, and I thought-""

The scythe went up. The scythe fell. And with it, the balding head of the man. Blood spurted onto Paul's shirt, and a heavy stench filled the air as the man's digestive tract gave way.

Grinning slightly now, Paul stepped over the man's body. The job had- invigorated him somehow. He felt a surge of strength and adrenaline course through his body, as if he was gaining power every moment. The power of the Grim Reaper, he thought. His initial thoughts had been suspicious, wary of a juvenille prank. But now, he wasn't so sure it was a prank after all. 

He would have to find more zeroes to remove. It was his job, after all. And by hook or by crook, he was going to be one hell of a Reaper by the next night.

The next morning saw Paul fast asleep on the bed, his bloodied scythe in one hand, and a hastily made hood and cloak draped over his nightstand. Besides  his first subject, whose body was now buried in the back garden, he had taken care of six other people with that magical number above their heads. 

It was close to dusk when Paul awoke, his head pounding with energy and his eyes alert to that number he now knew was his life's work. Staring at himself in the mirror, he noticed his pale, gaunt face peering back at him. 

Besides the bloodstains all over him, he decided that it was a good look.

That night was an even more frenzied version of the second. Paul had managed to complete his eighteenth job for the night with minimal noise. He was getting good at this job, his tasks taking no more than a few moments now.

That was until the police cruisers pulled up next to him. Surrounding him in a semicircle, with guns aimed at him, shouting for him to ""get on the ground and release your weapon"". He ignored them, of course. What chance did mortals stand against the Reaper?

He left 2 officers slumped dead against a cruiser before he put his scythe down. Somehow, he had managed to evade all the deadly bullets, but that did not surprise him in the least. The 2 policemen with zeroes over their heads were finally dead.

Paul didn't hear the screams of the policemen yelling for him to drop his scythe. He didn't hear the cries of the wounded officers, injured by his scythe. He only heard the yell of the policeman in his ear, shouting a non-zero number.

""Twenty-seven. You killed twenty-seven, you deranged bastard!""

That was when he looked down and saw nothing but a weed wacker in his hands. No scythe. His cloak and hood were just an ordinary, torn-up hoodie.

And the original Grim Reaper? He now recognized the weary face of his gardener.

***
I watch as the sergeant walks into the room. Tall, imposing, and a grim smile on his face. The weed wacker that claimed so many lives is in his hands. Bent and bloodstained, no longer the majestic scythe I once wielded.

""May I-"" my request for a drink is cut off. The sergeant slams the weed wacker down hard on the interrogation table.

""Fool. You nearly exposed us."" 

I can only stare in horror as the sergeant changes form, morphing into the hooded man from 2 days past. The weed wacker also transforms, turning into a pitch-black scythe.

""Oh shit, really? Did you have an umbrella at least?"" Mr. Spook lost his fedora and everything was back to normal.

""Nah, dude. Froze my butt off. Anyway, the power went out and I was out back checking on the cables.""

Mr. Spook slammed his hands on the table again *plak* and everything went sepia. ""Enough small talk, Mr. Gilley!"" He reached into his monochrome trench coat and pulled out a black-and-white photo of a little girl. ""This here's lil' Sally. Look familiar?"" He sneered, barely keeping the cigar between his teeth.

""I 'seen 'er. What's it to ya?"" I retorted.

He let out a puff of smoke and held the photo closer. ""How do you know who this innocent girl is?""

""Dude, she's my neighbor. Of course I know who she is,"" I said eyeing at the picture on his phone. 

""Well, that makes sense... actually."" Mr. Spook scratched his head.

Eyes glinting in the lamplight, he smirked and swiped left on the phone.

*plak*

In front of me, he was now holding a photo of a stick with a sharp blade at the end. ""Well, wadaya know about this, sonny?"" Smooth jazz started playing in the room.

My eyes widened and a bead of sweat appeared on my forehead. ""I-I-I-I-- That's-- that's a gardening t-tool.""

""Heh, kid. Looks like I've caught yo-""

""Wait a sec,"" I interrupted. Somewhere, a record scratches. ""What the hell? This isn't an interrogation. I'm not in cuffs or anything. You're just questioning me!""

""Oh yeah, huh."" Mr. Spook replied. ""Alrighty then.""

I shook hands with him and left. *Phew*

One piece of feedback though - The change between first &amp; third person is kind of weird. Usually if voice changes between present &amp; past tense, the present tense will be 3rd person, and then we go into their memories it becomes ~~3rd~~ 1st person, and then back to present tense = return to 3rd person.

Another way to do it (imo this would be the best way) would just to be do 1st person for the entire story, but put the opening &amp; closing sentences in present tense, and the flashback in past tense. This way there's still a significant framing change when we change times, but we remain in the narrator's head.

The once piping coffee from earlier had since turned to lukewarm sludge. It had already been a long day, and was shaping up to be a long night. 

""I don't get it."" He sighed. ""It has to be the gardener, but his alibi is rock solid.""

""What's to get? The kid is a psychopath. He needs to be locked up. Throw away the key."" His partner replied miming locking a door and then, using his best Kobe impression, pretended to throw the imaginary key in the trash can. 

Bill rolled his eyes and chewed the butt of the cigarette that dangled from his mouth. 

""It just doesn't make sense, Marcus. I mean, here is this kid. Everyone loves him. Eagle Scout. Salutatorian. He is supposed to be heading off to college. Ya know. Drink, hang out with girls, get a degree. But here he is. Sitting with that shit eating grin. Does he even know that 13 people, two dogs, and three cats were all killed in the last three hours? Forensics are pretty certain the scythe he used to kill the fish was used in the rest of the killings."" Bill said. 

""Koi.""

""What?"" 

""Koi. It's the type of fish he killed."" Explained Marcus. ""It's like a big goldfish.""

""How the hell do you know that? You a fish expert all of a sudden?"" 

""No. Not at all. My aunt Cindy used to keep koi fish in her pond out in Allentown. I went once as a kid and was like 'Those goldfish are huge!' She slapped the back of my head and said those are Koi fish you idiot. I never liked aunt Cindy come to think of it.""

""Alright alright, I got it. Christ Marcus, always with the stories. So like I said. Killing the fi... uh, *Koi* fish. Why that? What was the point?""

""Maybe it was some type of prank.  I might have done the same thing as a kid if someone gave me a scythe.""

""Or maybe the old man put him up to it. They knew each other, after all. But if that was the case why would the old man want the kid to kill a giant goldfish?"" 

""Koi fish"" 

Bill stared at Marcus, rubbed his neck and sighed. 

""As I was saying, the old man knew the other victims and, in the case of the animals, knew the owners. But the koi fish.  What is the motive there? We're missing something.""

""That's why it wasn't the old man. It was the kid. He's a looney. Not worth thinking about it past that. Leave that to the psychologists.  We just need a confession. That's all. I know it wasn't the gardener. That guy seemed perfectly normal. This kid gives me the creeps. He just keeps smiling.""

""Kill a fish with a scythe, dressed like the fuckin' grim reaper.  That is a little more than slightly odd. Maybe you're right. Let's get to it. We've let the kid sit it out alone in there long enough. Let's see what he has to say.""

""Alright."" 

Bill flicked the cigarette butt in the trash, slugged back the last of his coffee, and pulled his pants up by the belt. Marcus stood up and put his badge back on his belt and picked a wedgie. 

""You stay here."" Bill instructed Marcus. ""Let me try alone first. Two cops might be a little too intimidating.""

""You're the lead here. Whatever you say."" Marcus walked over to the one way mirror. ""I'll hang out in here. Give me the sign if you want me to come in.""

He opened the door to the interrogation room and the adolescent looked back up at him. Puberty has just begun to set in, the pimples dotting his forehead and chin as evidence. 

""Hello officers!"" He said. The smile never once leaving his face. ""What's up?""

""Listen Chase, we are just scratching our heads here. Why did you kill that goldfish?""

""You mean the *koi* fish?"" He asked, an innocent look on his face. 

Bill glanced at the mirror where Marcus was and imagined him standing behind it nodding in agreement. 

""Right. The *koi* fish.  Why?""

Chase looked at them both. ""Well, cuz it was sick. It was it's time to go.""

""What do you mean it's time to go?"" 

""Well, it was time for it to move on to the next life. It was on the verge of death. I saw it swimming funny when I went to the mall last week. I know a thin or two about fish. I keep them at home.""

""Chase, do you know why your here?"" Bill questioned. 

""Yea because of the fish.""

""Right, but..."" Bill began. 

""And the people."" Chase cut him off. ""And the dogs. And the cats. Ohhhh and the cow on that dairy farm off of interstate 72.""

Bill couldn't believe what he was hearing. He stared at the kid. It still didn't rule out the old man. Bill knew he was somehow behind this. He pressed on. 

""Chase. We know you got the scythe from Mr. Peterson. He told us he gave it to you.  Tell us what really happened.  Are you covering for him?""

""Yea. How did you know? Did he tell you?""

Anger and confusion flooded over Bill. He had seen some terrible crimes in his time on the force, but why anyone would make a kid do those horrible things was unforgivable. 

""No he didn't. But I thought so. Good kid like yourself wouldn't just do that. I don't understand why. Why did you? How did he make you?""

""Make me? No no. He said he couldn't handle his job anymore. He gave me his scythe. It's actually quite he honor. I couldn't believe he picked me.""

""His job? What do you mean?"" Bill asked. 

""Death.""

""What?"" 

""The grim reaper.  It's not an easy job but someone has to do it. It's really a privilege to help all those poor souls move to the other side.""

""Chase. Mr. Peterson is a part time gardener. What are you talking about?""

""Oh...""",Chimpwick

They said they want to see you for some kind of questioning?”

I froze in my tracks, gin spilling over the brim of the highball glass I had begun to pour my nightly beverage into. Glancing down at my hand, I noticed a speck of dried blood that I somehow had missed when I took my shower earlier in the evening. Shit, I thought I had got all of it. I even double checked!  “Uh…fuck. Tell them I’m not home right now. I’ll call them later.”

She paused. “But Jeff, you’re home now. What’s going on, and why are the police calling the house for you? Nobody’s called our landline in twenty years. I wasn’t even sure it was still plugged in and working. Is there something you’re not telling me?”

Well shit. There’s no way to tell her what happened without seeming like a complete loon. Harry had been our gardener for the past decade. How had I even come close to confusing the local gardener with the fucking grim reaper? 

I ripped a paper towel off the kitchen roll and began mopping up the puddle of alcohol that had gathered at the base of my glass. “Honey, there’s nothing wrong and I’m not hiding anything from you. We’ve been married for thirty-five years. Why would I keep anything from the love of my life?” I quickly scrubbed the blood from my thumb with the gin-soaked towel and tossed it in the trash.   “I don’t know, Jeffrey. You’ve been so distant the past two days. Never at any time in our marriage have you acted the way you’ve been acting lately. Something has to be up.”

“Quit pushing. There’s nothing wrong. Do you want me to pour you another drink?”

“No, that won’t be necessary. I’m going to bed. Just…come in when you’re ready. I love you.”

As the fat woman whimpered, Nathan pressed the scythe closer to her throat. A half dozen cop cars were dogpiled in front of the building. Seven bodies littered the tiled floors. The surviving civilians huddled underneath office desks. (One little boy, tearfully whispering to his mother: “I just wanted to mail Santa Claus my letter!” / “Damn it, Toby, Santa can wait…”)

Detective Shelton cautiously approached the glass windows.

“Don’t come any closer!” Nathan shrieked. He yanked the fat woman’s head further up.

The detective stopped. In a gesture of goodwill, he raised his gun in the air, and let it drop to the ground. Nathan watched him warily.

“Mr. Coolidge, I just want to talk,” he spoke into his loudspeaker.

“That’s not my name anymore!” Nathan shot back. “I’m the Reaper!”

Shelton glanced over his shoulder at his lieutenant, Officer Maria, who mouthed, “Cra-zy.” He turned back to address the lunatic.

“Yes… Mr. Reaper. Sir,” Shelton said, choosing each word carefully. He lowered his arms to his sides, and drummed twice against his right thigh. Officer Maria, the pitcher to Shelton’s catcher, understood the signal. She waved to the SWAT team, and they jogged to the back of the building. “I’d just like to have a conversation. Man to man.”

“I’m not a man anymore,” Nathan said haughtily. “I am—The Lord of Death!”
If you say so, Shelton thought. Out loud, he said, “All right, Lord, uh, Death… Would it be all right if we talked one-on-one for a few minutes? I just want to talk.”

As Detective Shelton bought time, the SWAT members made it to the rear entrance. It was locked. One member looked to the leader, raised his rifle and pointed it at the doorknob, volunteering to shoot it off. The leader shook his head; it would cause too much noise.

///

Briana was watching the standoff from under a stamps table, along with the young businessman who had been in front of her in line. He’d peed himself a little; Briana could smell it. She surveyed the room: of the fourteen people who had been in the post office when the killing started, eight remained, including the woman who was being held hostage and the killer himself. There was the mother and her son, next to the retired old man under a nearby desk; one other young woman with the yoga pants (unfortunately, nirvana might be coming a little early for her); and the businessman and herself.

An idea visited Briana, lodging into her mind’s eye as a series of images.

“This woman’s life belongs to me!” Nathan was yelling at the detective. “Nothing you human scum say or do will change her fate!” He lifted his scythe in the air—

“MY LORD!”

Briana sprung into the floor in front of Nathan, kneeling ten feet in front of him. Nathan paused. The fat woman defecated.

“My lord,” said Briana, making eye contact with Nathan. “I am honored you have come at last.”

Nathan looked confused. (Outside, Officer Maria was sprinting to the back of the post office, keys to the rear entrance in hand.) Nonetheless, he listened.

“I have been praying every day for your arrival,” said Briana. “Will you do me the honor of knighting me into your service?”

Nathan cackled. “You fool!” He shoved the fat woman to his left and raised his scythe—

*BANG!* 

Nathan collapsed in a heap on the ground; the scythe cluttered to the side.
Detective Shelton lowered his gun. He’d gotten a clear shot, since Briana was kneeling in front of the killer. As the police began to enter the building from the front and from the back, the survivors staggered to their feet.

Officer Maria put a blanket around Briana’s shoulders as she rose. Her gaze lingered on the cast away scythe, transformed now into an ordinary weed whacker.

Two sentences that had thrown me back into time. A time when I wasn't called Anthony John Phillips. A time when I wasn't spending my time in a quiet Yorkshire village, earning a decent, but not eye-catching, living as an accountant. Back then I had no wife, no twin daughters, and I didn't spend my spare time walking a Labrador called Hutch, on family holidays, or finishing crosswords in a corner of the local pub.

The training I received went past physical or mental; it was more like programming. It was very experimental and included the use of LSD, long sessions with a psychologist, weapons handling, close quarter combat, escape and evasion techniques, the list went on.  Once those 10 years were complete I spent most of my time travelling to different countries and waiting in hotel rooms for The Call.  

The Agency needed me to clean up when a project went wrong.  Usually, an agent or asset whose cover was blown.  The procedure was I would be on standby at a location nearby. I get The Call which meant the Agent had pressed a panic button.  I entered the location and would only identify the Agent him or her using the two sentences ""I can't hack it anymore. This is your job now"".

My experience included projects in war zones like Afghanistan and Libya, but also most major cities across the world.  MI6, the CIA and Mossad were regular customers.  The situations involved making split second decisions, using anything that came to hand as a weapon, then forensically cleaning the scene and disappearing. 

The odds on Phil the gardener using the exact two pre-arranged sentences as my contact were so outlandish they were comparable with a Lottery win.  That day I had eaten a Ploughman's Lunch at the pub, completed The Times crossword, folded it under my arm and strolled back to the house.  

The Wife was sitting at the kitchen table analysing our outgoings.  She would have made a good accountant. It's a beautiful summer's day. Phil the gardener has switched off his mower an hour ago.  He was a functioning alcoholic in his 50's.  Last night had involved 8 pints of Estrella and a litre bottle of Smirnoff.  As I looked through the window I heard him cursing and trashing around in the hedges. He was flustered, broken veins on his purple nose offset by a blood red face.

""Alright Phil!"" I shouted cheerfully through the open patio door.
His head snapped to the right in my direction, then stormed over.
""I can't hack it anymore. This is your job now"" 
Grabbing the scythe I throw it to the floor then grab Phil by the sweatshirt, spin 360 degrees and throw him as far from the theatre of conflict as possible.  Flicking the scythe up with my right foot I catch it in both hands and with surgical precision carve the weeds into pieces.  In my peripheral vision I catch sight of a weed killer spray dropping the scythe I forward roll, grab the spray and come up firing, taking out the weeds between the patio slabs, each one taking a double tap.
I stand there, sweating and slowly coming to my senses when I notice The Wife standing in the patio door, hands on hips, frowning.

""Well if I knew you could do that we wouldn't have to hire a bloody gardener""

You believed yourself to be the grim reaper?"" The officer looked up from his paper and stared at the man sitting opposite. The man nods, looking quite relaxed in the circumstance. The officer sighs leaning back in his chair. He puts the file on the table and looks the man straight in the eyes. 

""What made you think this was a good idea? To slaughter all those people. Did you not think about the consequences for your actions?""

""I was not slaughtering them officer. I was merely collecting their souls."" The man said, so matter of factly, as if he were saying something normal. 

The officer shakes his head, the words sinking in. ""Mr... er...."" He checks the file on the table, ""Williams. You do realise that this is not normal?""

Mr Williams replies, ""That's what they make you think. They control your minds you see. We grim reapers must collect the souls. Otherwise humans would not be able to move on to the afterlife."" 

""The afterlife?""

""Yes sir, the afterlife. A place where they can live out their dreams in peace and happiness. We make that happen."" Mr Williams then looks directly at the officer. ""To be quite frank, I am not sure why you brought me here. I am not causing harm to anyone. I am the grim reaper. I just help them to move on.""

The officer looks at Mr Williams sceptically, picking up the file once again. ""It says here Mr Williams, that you have committed acts of manslaughter upon another human. Not just once, but various times. How is that, in any way, a pacifist act?""

""I have already told you officer. I am helping them to move on. In fact, I didn't even have a choice in this. Once you are chosen to be a grim reaper, that is it.""

""Then who told you to be a 'grim reaper?'""

""The last grim reaper. He came mysteriously to me one morning with his hood and scythe and convinced me of my task. This is my duty."" Mr Williams looks into the distance, as if recalling a pleasant memory. 

""Mr Williams, you are not a grim reaper."" The officer claims, ""And this is certainly not your duty. Do you have your scythe on you?"" 

Mr Williams, ""Of course sir. A grim reaper must always have his scythe."" Mr Williams gets out his scythe and shows it. ""But be warned. Humans must never touch it, or they will pass on instantly.""

The officer instantly takes the scythe. Mr Williams gasps in horror. The officer analysing the scythe, turning it over in his hands. 
""Tests will have to be done to confirm this, but this appears to be a gardening weeder. Who really gave you this?""

Mr Williams looks at him in offence. ""I will have you know right now officer, that that is not a gardening weeder. That scythe has been passed on for generations. You are lucky to be still standing.""

""Sitting Mr Williams. In all my years I have never seen such an odd case. You will have to be sent to court for proper judgement, but from this evidence, I would say you will need at least 5 years prison time.""

""No matter how many years I spend there, I will never forget my destiny."" Mr Williams confesses. 

The officer starts moving the files on his desk into a pile. ""The only thing I still need to know is who gave you that scythe in the first place.""

At that moment, the door opens and a hooded man walks in. Mr Williams looks startled when he sees the man. ""I-It's you!!""

Another officer stands behind the hooded figure. He nods at the questioning officer. 

""Officer Cooper. This man wishes to speak with you. It's urgent.""

""Can it wait Jackson? I'm nearly finished this interview""

The hooded man pipes up. ""A-Actually officer, it's about the case."" He points nervously at the scythe leaning against the desk. ""T-That's mine... m-my err... weeder."" 

The officer raises his eyebrows.

""I-I gave it to him when I resigned... I-I used to be his gardener."" The man clenches his hands nervously. He slowly removes the hood covering his face to reveal himself. Mr Williams gasps.

""W-When I told him to do this job himself... I-I meant the gardening, n-not err.... you know. I-I'm very sorry for the misunderstanding.""

Officer Cooper looks at Mr Williams. ""You know what this means, don't you Williams? It's jail time for you.""",MidnightCross

""Oh yes. You're very lucky we got to you before the authorities did, with you rampaging like that."" 

Rampaging indeed. That was some of the most fun I've had in my life. 

""We really will need to check your mental health before you're trained, but I must congratulate you. You did very well,"" he finished, a satisfied grin splitting his face.

Alan swallowed as he heard his name reverberated in the empty waiting room. He stood up, clutching his identification card tightly, and started walking. His heartbeat quickened as he paused at the indicated destination.

The forbidden-looking metal door slid open silently after the probe installed on the left scanned his fingerprint. Alan wetted his lips, felt a strange tingling sensation in the middle of his right palm. His train of thoughts ran off the rail and plunged into an abyss of scrambled memories. He thought of his mother, a revered telepath, and his father who possessed a powerful telekinetic ability. Even his sister was an accomplished shapeshifter who just acquired her ability two years ago. He still remembered the day when she walked out from this building, her eyes shone brightly and exuberance radiated all over her body. “Mom! Dad!” She called, flown herself into the loving arms of their parents, “Look!” And the next instance, Alan saw a copy of himself smiling slyly at him. Alan simply gawked at the superb performance.

“Ah, my little brother! No worries. Your time will come!” His sister – or another Alan -  winked at himself. He swallowed, watching the hair of his copy growing longer and became smoother. Less than a second after, Alan found himself staring at the familiar face of his sister.

*And now the time comes.* Alan thought moodily. Somehow, he always had a foreboding feeling about this day – his 18th birthday. Once he confided his fear to his close friend Brian, but even the latter failed to treat it seriously. “Nah,” Brian waved his hand dismissively in response, “You will be fine! People out there are quite envious of Johnson’s gene traits because your family always seems to produce the most intimidating super ability.”

*Precisely!* Alan thought. His fear rooted in other’s perceptions: *what if I ends up with a useless power, or worse still – what if I am not gifted at all?* Such thoughts made his stomach squirmed and twisted into knots. Somehow he knew that he would be the ‘normal’ one.

Breathing in deeply, Alan entered the room. A smell of antiseptic assaulted his nostrils. He darted his eyes around the dome-shaped, brightly-lit room with numerous fragile-looking equipment. A robot wearing a white overcoat stood beside a bed, its dull eyes inspecting him without emotion. “Please be seated.” It produced a gentle, feminine voice.

Alan obeyed. The pristinely white bed sheet under him wrinkled as he adjusted his position. The robot pulled his sleeves up, and rubbed some ethanol using a cotton.

“You ready?” Still the soothing voice, but Alan shuddered involuntarily at this time. The robot drew some colourless liquid from a brown bottle, then wiped the needle carefully using a piece of specially treated tissue paper. Alan closed his eyes and nodded.

Then he felt a tingling sensation followed by a sharp pain. He fought down his body’s instinct to tremble. He suppressed his fear. He tried to vacate his mind. Focusing on the sensation of something prickling his skin, Alan reduced himself into a mote without awareness. I must not fear …

Then he felt a gentle tap on his shoulder. He opened his eyes, seeing the robot retreating back to a door labelled ‘Staff Only’. The room darkened as the light from ceiling turned silvery-blue from the intense white glow. The wall directly in front of him lit up, displaying a woman’s face.

“Congratulations. In the next five to ten minutes, your power will be activated. You may experience a period of dizziness or pain, but it will pass. Please contact us if you have any problems. Enjoy your power!”

The video paused, leaving only the grinning face of the woman. Her stare was oddly mesmerising, and it took a while before Alan could break the spell. He drew a feel shaky breath, imagining his power. *Is my body becoming lighter? Or did I just felt something growing from my back? Is there an echo of other’s thoughts that I accidentally captured? Maybe a wisp of air just break from its usual trail and obey my order? Did the light just flicker at my will?*

No. The realisation hit him like a sledgehammer. None of them happened. Nine minutes and fifty-two seconds later, Alan still sat in the same old room, perspiring nervously. The silence in the room suddenly became oppressive.

Fifty-five, fifty-six, fifty-seven, fifty-eight, fifty-nine … sixty. He felt the lump in his throats started throbbing. He almost could hear the gushing sound as blood being bumped to his brain. His vision blurred when something hot and shameful formed in his eyes.

“Greetings, Alan. I am Meg Miles, the registrar of new talents. May I see what you can do?” It was the same woman, but this time the video was not pre-recorded. She wore a golden-rimmed glasses and jade necklace. The perturbing cheekbones and piercing eyes gave her a solemn expression.

“I…I…” Alan stammered. How could he admit this terrible fact?

Miles raised her well-groomed eyebrow in mild surprise. “Is there any problem?”

“I d-don’t –”

“It is nothing embarrassing about your power, whatever it is. Just show me.” Clearly, she misread his emotion and gave him a tensed but encouraging smile.

Alan shook his head. When he spoke, he was almost overwhelmed by frustration. “I don’t think I have any.” He told Miles.

“Hmm, it can’t be. Did you attempt to do anything, like lifting the heavy metal block there? Super strength, maybe?” She suggested. Alan held the block, felt his muscle tensed, but the block stubbornly remained in place. Then he was instructed to touch the withered flower on the table, and it remained dead. He even jumped into the fish tank and got himself soaked wet, yet he did not turn into a mermaid. He saw that Miles was losing patience.

“Fine!” She scowled, “I will ask an expert to extract your genes to take a look at it.” Then she blinked out from existence.

A minute later, the ‘Staff Only’ door swung open, and a young man with unruly hair stormed in. He drew Alan’s blood and looked into it.*Microscopic vision*. Alan noted.

“Ugh, I can see nothing!” After staring at the piece of blood smear, the young man squinted in annoyance. “How extraordinary!” He commented, turned, and looked directly into Alan’s eyes. First it was clouded by puzzlement, then something dawned from within. The young man’s eyes lit up. The realisation was contagious.

*Of course!* Alan smiled. *I am a null! At least I am SOMETHING.* His grin widened. Gingerly, he stepped backwards, increasing the distance between himself and the young man. With a joyous exclamation, the young man shouted: “Now I can see. You nullify other’s talents – what a remarkable power! I think the police force would be delighted to have such gifted agent to help them chase down a couple of criminals with dangerous power. Good for you, young man!”

[WP] Only 1.5% of the world's population is born with sight. They are discriminated against as freaks by the rest of society.,DrSkyentist,"Suddenly, the nurse’s face turned pale. ‘Oh god’, she said. ‘What, what is it?’, Steve urged. ‘His eyes, he’s… one of them. I think they opened’ ‘What.. no, no.’ Steven felt Mary’s body shaking. Steve hugged her, trying to calm her. But she started crying, heavily. ‘I prayed so hard for him to be normal, healthy.’ ‘It’s okay Mary, it’ll be alright.’ Steven picked the baby up. ‘We have a son, feel, he’s beautiful.’ But it didn’t comfort her. ‘Oh, the shame. I can’t show him, I can’t take him! Everyone will laugh at me, at us.’ Steven didn’t get it, Thomas was their son, their only son. He couldn’t care for the world what he was like. That night was the saddest night of Mary’s life, which would never be the same again.

With his shoulders back, chin up high Thomas stepped into the cold air. A grin on his face he couldn’t get rid of. He’d seen for sure. The new girl in the class next to them. Their eyes had locked. This was not like the other times he thought he’d seen it, her stare was not dead like the others. He felt contact between them. He couldn’t describe the feeling that he felt when it happened. This was the best day of his life. She was beautiful, he could see. All the others couldn’t. For the first time he felt sorry for them. He  could hear the harassing words of the bullies but he didn’t listen. ‘Freak!’, someone yelled. He didn’t care. He thought of his dad, who’d always insisted this day would  come. Now it was here. Tomorrow he was going to talk to her. Walking off the yard he couldn’t help but jump for joy. 

He loved to be a freak. ",Rijstwafel

"[TT] You were always able to achieve anything you set your mind to, an ability you took for granted, until a first-aid training course where you accidentally resuscitate a CPR dummy.",Dragonhaunt,"There are some things, no matter how much you wish it weren’t the case, that you simply cannot do. You cannot make someone love you. You cannot avoid death.

And you cannot resuscitate a CPR training dummy.

But Anthony Wong can.

And Anthony Wong did.

This was not his intention. He was only trying to learn how to save lives, not create them. But as he lifted his lips off the lifeless plastic body, he and all the other lifeguard trainees saw it start to wheeze.

“God damnit,” he muttered when he realized what he had done. “Not this shit again.”

The reactions of the others in the room were a lot less calm. The general gist of it was this:

“AAAHHH!”

As everyone was busy screaming from the shock of watching their conception of reality break in front of their very eyes, the dummy tried to get up off the desk, but it couldn’t, because it had no limbs. This made sense, since the only parts of the body that a CPR training dummy really needs are the head and the chest. But it made things a lot harder for this legless, armless Frankenstein’s monster.
Then the dummy spoke.

“Please,” it said, “Can someone help me up?”

But instead of a response, all it got was an adrenaline-filled lifeguard instructor rushing to grab it and strangle it to death.

“Stop!” said Anthony, pulling away the instructor’s hands. “Stop. And calm down, everyone! I can explain what’s going on.”

“Well tell us, then!” said Amy, one of the trainees.

“Okay...how do I explain this?” He scratched his chin for a few seconds. “I...can do anything. You know, like...*anything*. Even things that aren’t possible. As long as I, like, put my mind to it. Or something. I don’t know. I don’t know if it’s magic, or a superpower, or God, or whatever, but...well, yeah. Basically I can do whatever I really want to do.”

There was a momentary silence.

“Bullshit,” someone finally said. “That’s bullshit.”

“Motherfucker, you just watched a CPR dummy-”

“I have a name, you know!”

Anthony turned around. “What?”

“A name. It’s Ted. Not ‘CPR dummy’.”

“Okay, fine, Ted, whatever.”

“You know, you should be more respectful if you wanna get into these pants. Now, can someone PLEASE help me up?”

Ted was not wearing pants.

But that was not what concerned the other trainees.

“Wait a minute,” said Amy. “Is...is that why you brought it back to life? ‘Cause you wanted to fuck it?”

“What? No! I-”

“I mean, you said it yourself. You can do whatever, but you have to really *want* to. So for some reason you really wanted to bring that dummy to life. And that reason was…”

"[TT] You were always able to achieve anything you set your mind to, an ability you took for granted, until a first-aid training course where you accidentally resuscitate a CPR dummy.",Dragonhaunt,"Jacob sat behind the desk with the faraway look of someone who was making their weekend plans on a Tuesday, when the door to the office was opened, and a middle aged women holding a CPR dummy walked in. *Oh right, that's today.* He sat up a bit straighter in his chair, and snapped back to the present. He stood up. 

""Alright everybody, we have a safety training meeting in the conference room in five minutes."" The faces around the room ranged from annoyed to almost asleep, but they probably got the message. Jacob was the boss, after all. And he must have had some serious dirt on the big boss-men, if he was promoted in his first year. The truth was that things had just worked out for Jacob, as they always did, but people were quick to conspiracy. 

Jacob turned to the woman. ""The conference room is right there on the left, if you have anything to set up."" The woman merely grunted, and headed into the room. Jacob sat back down. He was almost back to thinking about the weekend, when somebody else approached his desk. Somebody with a name that starts with an M or an N or something(Jacob had never been good with names) stood expectantly. Jacob swiveled his chair around to face him. 

""Yes?""

""Sir, some of the employees and I were talking, and-""

""Oh God,"" he said with a worried look, ""are you unionizing?""

""No sir, it's not that, it's just that...we were worried about the presentation.""

""What do you mean? It's just a CPR certification. What could possibly go wrong?""

""Well sir, that's what we thought about the fire drill, and I don't think I have to remind you how that turned out.""

It was true. The scorch marks on the ceiling told the whole story. Did they have to throw that in his face every five minutes, though? They should really blame those dullards who mandate safety regulations, and then get mad when people with a little imagination are put in charge. The fact that Jacob hadn't been fired for the fire fiasco didn't help the blackmail rumors. 

""And there was also the sensitivity training meeting.""

That one had been a doozy. The H.R. rep had asked Jacob for some examples of unacceptable behavior, and had apparently expected him to say the answer instead of doing it. 

""Your concerns have been duly noted. Now let's get in there, the fun is starting without us."" 

They walked into the conference room to the middle of a short lesson on proper thrusting techniques, and took their seats. The lesson basically consisted of the fact that mouth to mouth has been found to be probably not effective, and to focus on the thrusting. Jacob wasn't happy to hear this, as he took most of his medical technique advice from movies. 

The time came for practice. Jacob wasn't called on but he got up first anyway, and knelt by the dummy. The woman started saying something about Staying Alive and the bee gees, but Jacob had already entered the zone. He was thrusting away at the dummy's chest, way faster than he was supposed to, when he decided that some of the budget spent on making movies had to be on medical research, and went in for mouth to mouth. 

The woman started to correct him, but the words couldn't get out before the gasp of surprise that went around the room. The dummy, that Jacob had been breathing into with all the gusto of a true movie fan, was moving it's legs. As Jacob went back to thrusting at the collapsible chest way to fast, he also noticed the movement. He looked at the face of the dummy. The eyes were now moving, something Jacob didn't know they could do. Jacob would have been correct 10 minutes ago. 

He looked back up to the woman. 

""Crazy how advanced they've made these things now."" The woman looked confused for a moment, and then decided that it was indeed crazy how much dummy technology had advanced in her lifetime.

"[TT] You were always able to achieve anything you set your mind to, an ability you took for granted, until a first-aid training course where you accidentally resuscitate a CPR dummy.",Dragonhaunt,"The rubber over Annie's eyes tear open as she begins to open them. Her chest moves up and down and she begins to vomit all the springs that were once used to raise her chest after being compressed. 

“Kill me” she murmurs.

Everybody in the class looked at me as if I was a ventriloquist. 

“So...much...pain…kill….me” the dummy again whispers.

This time everybody starts to panic as Annie began to shake and seize across the table. I had already backed up far enough for it to be clear, I had no part in this. 

“What on earth is going on” the instructor yells.

“these are the cheap dummies, ive used them 100 times” he explains.

Just then Annie lunges from the table landing next to one of the cadets. Suddenly the dummy bites the cadets ankle and blood begins to pour out. The cadet then removes his service pistol and unloads three rounds into the back of Annie's head. 

Finally the dummy lays motionless for a few moments. 

The class had already began to run out of the room. Only the instructor, the cadet and I were left standing. 

“Holy fuck are you ok?” I ask the cadet.

“Yeah, she only broke the skin” he said.

Just then, my attention is on a second dummy that was being utilized on the other side of the room. 

*Boom!* 
 
Just to be safe, I execute the second dummy. 

The cadet then looked at me and said “My mama was right, white bitches do be trippin”

"[TT] You were always able to achieve anything you set your mind to, an ability you took for granted, until a first-aid training course where you accidentally resuscitate a CPR dummy.",Dragonhaunt,"If it had been motion alone, we could have passed it off as a cheap gag. 

His eyes were already opened, but now they shone with a disoriented panic that belied his pliable rubber body. They darted in the deep indentations of his sockets like someone dreaming about watching a car chase. 

Before long, he was suffocating. It looked like he was trying to open his mouth, but it was pasted shut with the plastic-like substance that coated his exterior. The experienced EMTs who had been leaning against the fake granite counter by the mini fridge were frozen in shocks. 

Shit. They didn't understand. Of course they didn't. Why would they?

I dashed to drawer marked ""Medical Supplies"" and grabbed the first sharp, shiny utensil I could find. It looked like a fork with only two tines, but it seemed pointed acutely enough to do the job. 

I held him down with one forearm across his neck and I cut ear to ear, thinking , *you can do this. You can give him a mouth,* and after a dozen swipes back and forth, he drew a deep breath. It wasn't pretty--thin layers of rubber dangled from cheek to chin, sometimes in and sometimes out, as deep crimson blood gushed from under the gash. He shrieked like like a man who had been plunged into a pool of boiling water. But he was breathing in long, furious gasps.

I sat down hard on the tile floor. I wanted to touch my face, to steady my breathing, but my hands were drenched in his blood and I couldn't bring them any closer. Holding them before my eyes, they looked like they belonged to someone else.

When I finally looked up, only he and I were left. He tried to sit up, but the blood had formed a puddle underneath him and every time he attempted to lean on the tile, he slipped and went down again. He wouldn't stop trying, and he wouldn't try another way. 

I wanted to help him, but when I got up to approach him, he turned his head to look at me and let out a shrill, dissonant shriek, shielding his face with his soiled hands. He was weeping.  

I was the man who did this to him, the man who cut open his face.  All because I needed to be the best. 

I knew what I had to do. I had to formulate a thought--no, a belief--that would return him to his natural state--something like ""I will make him a dummy again""""--but my heart was pounding and my thoughts were a swirling cloud of significant-seeming nonsense--syllables materializing without regard to their corresponding words, panicked warnings and commands with a building urgency, but nothing solid enough to grab on to. 

""Please,"" I said, ""please calm down. I need to think.""

But I could see that he was dying. 

I don't know how long we were on the floor, me clutching the fork as his slick body refused to stay upright, but after a while, he began to shrivel into a deflated pile of himself as his screaming quieted and his flailing extremities relaxed. 

I watched him bleed out. His shrieks became weaker and the light in his eyes lost intensity as the cold fear of a fleeing animal dissolved into a hot whisper. He slapped the floor with his forearms, but he couldn't rise. Maybe he had lost too much blood, or maybe he was never meant to get up in the first place.

""Please,"" I begged as he made snow angels in blood, ""please just let me think. I can fix this."" I hadn't realized how hard I was crying until I couldn't get the words out. 

*Have I already ruined him? Should I give him a nose?*

He died early in the morning. I knelt beside him because he didn't have the strength to push me away. When his body was the size of a latex glove and the light had gone out of his eye sockets, my mind became calm and lucid, a wave pool in the dessert. 

That's when I noticed  a small tongue like a lizard's protruding from the hole I had cut out as a mouth. A tongue, licking indiscriminately, trying to flee. 

I quieted my mind and watched. With one last breath, he slapped at the floor, weakly but audibly. Then he was gone. He was an object again.   

I forced myself to focus on the heap of shredded rubber in the center of organic material on the floor. 

*I did everything I could. He didn't want my help. Wouldn't let me. He was never a human being. Not really.* And finally, *I will walk out of here today and I won't feel anything about this.*

I check for my car keys and somehow, they are still in my pocket. I find a lab coat in the closet to cover my stained clothing, and I lock the door behind me.

And then came the guy with a beard. He floated down from between the clouds, following the ray of light. Of fucking course, *everyone* had to stop and gawk at it.

""What the -..."" Cedric batted at his ear turning in his seat to figure out what exactly had tickled it. As he shrewdly opened his mouth a cough right behind him caught both of our attentions.

""Is there something you wish to share, Mr. Diggory?"" My sides were splitting trying not to laugh.

""No, professor, I just...""

""It will do you some good to pay attention, Diggory."" McGonagall snapped, her mouth forming a thin line.

""I apologize, professor."" He sighed looking back at his work. As she walked away, he flicked his wand back towards me. Nothing happened. That's odd, that isn't like Cedric at all to fail at...

""Carter!"" McGonagall cried. I jumped and looked up at her sheepishly, trying to not look too guilty. Maybe Cedric had sent her a note that told her what I had just been up to.

The class turned to face me, and for a second there was silence. Then a raucous laughter rang around the room, and Cedric smirked at me. 

""Who did this?"" McGonagall demanded, her lips the thinnest of thin lines. Cedric, being the honest soul he is raised his hand laughing. 

""I did, professor.""

""How dare you, Mr. Cedric Diggory. You do NOT turn your friends into skunks!"" I looked down just as McGonagall raised her wand and lifted the spell. She opened her mouth to further berate Cedric when an obnoxious voice floated in from the hallway. ""Attack! Attack! There's been another attack! No mortal or ghost is safe! Attack!"" McGonagall's face blanched as door after door crashed open. She ran past Cedric and I into the hallway. Our eyes met, fearful and alarmed.

""I still don't understand how this works!"" I frowned, flicking my wand upwards in a sharp motion. Cedric smiled encouragingly, and showed me again. 

""Up and away, Ben. Like this, see?"" I had always been horrible at charms. ""Listen. If you get an E or higher on your O.W.L.'s this year in Charms, I will personally see to it that you get a shot at the quidditch team, alright?""

""Deal."" I grinned, shaking on it.

""Two in the morning, Ced! Two in the morning during exam week!"" I shouted over the hubub in the Great Hall. ""I need to go to bed!""

""Lighten up! It's fine!"" 

""But I have to do well if I want a chance at playing...""

But Dumbledore stood at that precise moment, and the usual hush fell over the hall. ""All exams have been canceled!"" He declared to an outcry of general delight (though I could have sworn I heard an ""Oh, no!"" among the gleeful shouts). I have to say, I agreed with them. Next year. I would have a shot next year.

***

Sixth year went well. Perfect grades in everything except Charms, but I still had an E, which was all I needed, and a marked improvement over my previous grades. ""Cedric! I got an E!"" I scribbled on a spare piece of parchment. I got a scrap back with ""Try outs, first week of next term.""

The wind whipped through my hair as Cedric and I flew around the field together. ""I just can't believe it! What do they mean 'Quidditch is canceled'? For some stupid tournament? This is my last year!"" Cedric grinned back at me deviously. 

""Come on, Ben! Lighten up!"" He called, putting on a burst of speed. I grinned and caught up with him.

""How about this?"" He smiled, stopping in mid-air. ""We'll both try for nationals this summer. Together. After all, I never promised what team you'd get a shot at!""

[WP] Another murder case where once again all evidence points to the squirrels.,OdiumReigns,"Speaking conceptually, if any living thing must die, any living thing can kill. Be it a baby being stolen from its parents and eating a coyote, or rather taking a military grade AR-15 assault rifle to the dog's head. People die every day, and accordingly in a matter of throat choking, flesh splitting, brain busting, and mutilating moments a murderer is made. Anything is possible.

*Tuesday, March 10, 1969*

Across the country multiple acidhead hippies decided that were many other better things to do rather than protests the government and appear on magazine covers. They decided that the simple alternative to all of this neo liberal bullshit was to get up, find a dealer, and start consuming buckets of psychedelic LSD. From Jimi Hendrix to Bill Clinton, everyone was hooked on this shit0. 
Noted in multiple entries in many different scientific journals, the effect of narcotics can have a variety of effects on different animals aside from humans. For example, Catnip can be used as an air freshener for your grandmother's house, yet also stoning the living daylights out of her tabbie. To a more extreme degree, it was also observed that the effect of LSD on many rodents serve as a methamphetamine type of hook. Subject to such substance abuse, it is a common hippie practice to “Fuck with the tree rats” by serving them teaspoon servings of acid (LSD). 
As for Billy Joe, and Bobby Sue, the outcome of this inhumane experiment would turn unexpectedly deadly. 

*Wednesday the following week, March 18, 1969*

Few things have surprised my eyes more than the following. In my time working as an investigative journalist, I have been introduced to many different forms of narcotics, taken part in fraternity initiations proving to be as incredibly irresponsible and downright insane as introducing freshmen to activities such as the “Back Side Ballooner” and the “Ohio Hot Pocket”, (I will not go into further detail). Aside from all the heinous acts of hazing and illegal substance abuse, I have never found myself come so close to a case as gory and bloodcurdling as what I am about to tell you. My report follows.

*Thursday, March 12, 1969*

After sitting around their trailer park living room in oakland california, Billy Joe and Bobby Sue decided that during an acid induced trip, that the greatest way to become one with nature, was to intoxify various rodents with narcotics such as Cocaine, Marijuana, and most abusively LSD. Staggering out of their screened door, Billy took two paces for each stair, only moving down when his sandal laced feet were on the same step as each other. Bobby Sue on the other hand had a much more difficult time. Holding a spoon filled with the “Magic Purple Shit” as they referred to it, at an arm’s length. She danced uncontrollably down the three steps courageously humming Hindu prayers, slurred into conjunction with Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds by the Beatles (a.k.a L.S.D). 

After crouching beside their trailer, Billy Joe and Bobby Sue waited patiently for their woodland victim. Unfortunately, there would be no victim in this incident besides them. 

*Thursday the following week, March 19, 1969*

My compiled details follow

Billy Joe was found in a fetal position, with his dreadlocks torn out of his skull with ruthless malevolence

Bobby Sue was found on top of her husband, covered blood, and on top of her left eye, a small sample of squirrel feces.

After sampling the feces we found that the high concentration of serotonin proteins in the feces, that it was a product of human flesh combined with an unusual amount of LSD.

This leads us to believe that Billy Joe and Bobby Sue believed they were on with nature during an acid trip and accordingly committed an act of self proclaimed self cannibalism by encouraging the intoxified squirrel to gruesomely murder them and hopefully become one with their spirits.

At this time, l came to the conclusion that Billy Joe and Bobby Sue had committed suicide as of Friday the 13th, 1969, and has only left me with the impression that had Billy Joe and Bobby Sue been a present day representation of Adam and Eve, the human race would have certainly been doomed.",desktophobo
[WP] Another murder case where once again all evidence points to the squirrels.,OdiumReigns,"“Sir, I’m sorry to say that all the evidence points away from Gibson.”

“Is that right? You’re trying to tell me, Johnson, that the blind man didn’t covertly shoot the victim?”

“Yes, sir, that is exactly what I’m telling you. He has quite a solid alibi, you know.”

He’s also blind.”

“That’s true.”

   The chief sat in his lawn chair contemplatively; he wanted to spin in it, but last time he had attempted this the results hadn’t been satisfactory. He held the evidence in a small bag in front of him. It was a bullet, and quite a distinctive one, at that- it seemed to be wooden. Now, of course, the chief liked to think he was a smart man, and knew that wooden bullets simply weren’t something that could be done, but the charred piece had been found less than ten feet away from the victim, and perfectly matched the hole he bore in his head. There shouldn’t have been a way for the [suspiciously nut-shaped] bullet to even travel so far, let alone kill a man- It was all very strange, he had to admit. The victim was out on his morning jog, when according to the witnesses, there was a loud bang, a rather surprised look, and a body on the sidewalk. The only evidence found so far was the wooden bullet, and a note that read, in nearly illegible handwriting, “det re payed.”  

  Upon doing research on the victim, it was found that he had lived in the neighborhood for decades, and had made a habit of feeding the resident squirrels every morning. He had few friends and family, which is to say he had none, yet he also had no enemies to speak of: Benny Garcia was a man that did his best not to make waves. 

“Sir?”

The chief was brought back to the present.

“Yes, yes, I’m fine. I was just recalling the details of the case for exposition purposes.”

“I see,” the detective said, although in reality he didn’t.

“Anyways, I’ve been thinking, what if the squirrels did it?”

“The squirrels?”

“Yes; what if he stopped feeding them?”

“Squirrels.”

“It’d make sense. For instance, the acorn bullet. Maybe he stopped feeding his squirrels and they.. Reacted this way.”

“Sir, are you alright?”

  The chief was not alright, for he had just begun to think of how many questions were answered by the word “squirrels.” How had Benny Garcia been murdered? Squirrels, of course. How did Keemstar become such a popular figure? Again, he realized, the answer was squirrels. Squirrels with mice and keyboards, of course. Nobody else would support such a man. Perhaps they could be hired? Yes, yes, squirrels that would do anything for the right price. It was all coming together for the chief. How was president Trump elected? Why, squirrels must have hacked the computer systems and rigged the system! The pyramids? Squirrels! To the chief, it was as if all had become clear to him in an instant; his mind had been opened and wouldn’t close. Of course, this was probably all part of the squirrels’ plan. He knew how much of the world’s problems and mysteries could be solved by answering “squirrels.” 

  Of course, the chief shared all this with his friend, the detective. The detective denied, it, so the chief looked at him happily and explained he was in possession of a gun for the squirrels.

  The detective, likely being a squirrel himself, disregarded it and backed out of the room.

  The chief drove home late that night, thinking of squirrels.

  The chief would be found on the side of the road two days later, with an acorn embedded in his chest, and a note:
	

         “silensed.”
	


  Of course, nobody bothered to tell the chief he was right a year later during the squirrel uprising, because everyone was dead within a month. There is a lesson to this tale- and that lesson is that eventually, if one looks hard enough, squirrels will be involved.

He paused to close his eyes against the overbearing florescence, trying to steady his shaking hands. He took a deep breath and then another look around the room before continuing. Some eyes were on him, some focused on the linoleum floor, some didn't seem to be looking at anything at all. Josh wanted a drink. Sure, deep down, they all wanted a drink. They wouldn't be in that pale church basement on a Friday night if they didn't. But he wanted a drink more. He wanted to know what they were all about to think when he told the truth about his drinking for the first time. 

“... and... and I'm an alcoholic.” 

“Hi Josh,” the monotonous collective replied. 

“Gosh, it's quiet in here. This is probably the quietest room I've been in in two years. I think it's been about that long since I went a day without a drink. It's... it's hard to remember sometimes... but I'm pretty sure I'm 23 now. And I haven't stopped drinking since my 21st birthday.” 

Josh caught a couple of people nodding knowingly at him. They thought they understood. He laughed a little to himself. They have no fucking idea. 

“Y'know, it sucks, It's really unfair, actually. I really don't like being drunk. I... I don't like who I am when I've been drinking. Ha, no one likes who I am when I've been drinking. But something happens to me once I drink enough... and that's why I can't stop. It's really unbelievable but I... Fuck, I really don't know how to say this without sounding crazy but... well, when I drink enough booze, I'm able to read people's minds.”

Having finally spit it out, he quickly scanned the room. He hated this silence, being totally unable to hear even one person's thoughts. No one was staring at the floor anymore. All eyes were on him. His whole body was shaking now and not just from the detox. 

“I know how it sounds, I do. I've never told anyone before because I didn't want them to institutionalize me. Now my friends and family... the ones I have left... want to ship me off for the drinking anyway. What the fuck do I have to lose? I wish I could prove it to you, but I'd need about a handle of whiskey to do that and I doubt anyone's got that kicking around here.”

Josh laughed. No one else did. 

“Right... so you'll just have to take my word for it. Or not. Doesn't matter. It was the biggest blessing and curse of my life. Of course, I mostly used it to get girls. Goddamn, I got a lot of girls. But hanging around the bars, I started to read some not so nice minds. Dudes who wanted to hurt these girls. There's so many more of them than you realize. I... I don't want to say anything to incriminating... but I took care of those guys. Made sure they wouldn't hurt anyone again. But then I got kicked out of all those places for... for being a drunk asshole. Starting fights...,” a sob broke through the story before Josh quickly pulled himself back together, “They have no idea what a big mistake they made. How many women I saved. But I realized I shouldn't be wasting my powers hanging around bars anyway. Drunk thoughts are as loud and obnoxious as drunk people. I figured I'd use it to make something of myself. And I almost did. I read minds all through college... I was going to build some real power... maybe even be the President. I'd always know what the other guy was thinking, y'know? I almost made it too. I aced every test but... well... eventually people catch on when you're wasted in class every day. I puked on a professor during a final and that was the last straw. I've been asked to leave. I had a job in sales and I preformed better than everyone but I still got fired for stumbling around eventually. Almost everyone in my life is gone. And I know they'd come back if I just sobered up. But I... maybe I am really crazy, but I think if I figured out how to use my powers responsibly... I think I could save the world...”

Josh paused. He hadn't meant to say that last part, it had just flown out of him. He didn't want to come across like some vigilante, but that really was the true reason he hadn't been able to just stop. 

“It's not the women... It's not the money, or the grades that I care about. If it was, of course I'd stop drinking! I just know that I'm supposed to do something... bigger with this power!” 

He said this with a confidence that was trampled by the looks he caught from around the room. Pity, confusion, even anger colored the faces that had been so receptive before. He didn't need to read their minds to know that he had gone too far. 

“Or, I don't know, maybe that's just an excuse I make up for myself. Maybe I'm just in denial. Maybe I just really want to keep drinking and I'll tell myself anything. Maybe I can't even read minds at all. I... naw, that's all I've got. Thanks for letting me share,” Josh concluded and immediately stood to leave the room. There was silence and nervous coughing, but as soon as he reached the doorway he heard laughter sweep through the room. He hurried up the stairs to the street. 

Running footsteps caught up to him a block later. 

“Hey! Hey, Josh!” 

Josh turned to face a man about his father's age, well-dressed if a little old-fashioned, jogging toward him. 

“Your name was Josh, yes? I'm Bill. Tell me, do you have a sponsor yet?” 

Josh laughed at the thought that someone would want anything to do with him after what must have been the most crackpot story in all of AA. 

“No, I don't. That was my first meeting, and I think it will be my last. I don't think they can help me. I don't think anyone can.” 

“You're not beyond help son, not by far,” Bill smiled warmly. “You simply need someone who knows what you're going through.”",andricekrispies

By now my throat was numb. ""I'm not sure this is a good idea"" I finally managed to say while shaking my head and staring at the table.

A very tall, clean cut man walked over. He placed his hand on my shoulder gently and said, ""keep going, you're almost there. Just a few more shots and we can stop these soulless bastards once and for all."" He flipped over the shot glasses, took the bottle, and overflowed three more shots.

This was it. The moment I dreamed. Saving the world by extracting the thoughts of a captured terrorist. There was just one problem: I am a complete jackass when I drink. I would likely do a whole hell of a lot more than just save the world.

So I stared at the shots again. Flickers of the man's memories hit my temporal lobe and I clearly saw him at his last review. He was grilled by a superior for negligence  and...I lost it. I needed another shot. This negligent asshole couldn't save the world so I have to instead.

Cheers erupted as I dropped the last glass slowly. Then the room began to spin. It was now or never. I had approximately 30 minutes before I would be completely useless. More useless than the tall guy. So I walked over to the prisoner and tried to focus.

Flashes were coming to me. Fragments of an individual's memory. I started to string them together and then noticed: they weren't of the prisoner's. The pieces fit to tell the story of how the Tall Man nearly lost his job. Something about unreadable misspellings in his reports and long lunch breaks.

It was now or never, but I decided to quickly ask the Tall Man: ""I'm having trouble thinking here. For this to work I need you, and only you, to quickly spell the word 'ambiguous' for me. You have 45 seconds. Go!"". While he fumbled through I cleared my mind and put my hand on the prisoner's head.

""Yes"", I thought, ""this is it. I have found the location of their leader as well as the dates of planned attacks"". It was easier and faster than I thought. But the room was still spinning, and I was extremely drunk.

I looked at the Younger Agent, whom I found out was itching for a promotion, and stated: ""I now need to be hypnotized. Place both palms facing each other but not touching. Now move one in a clockwise rotation and the other counterclockwise. This will begin the process"". He quickly started attempting it. An impossible task for most.

I laughed and fell to the ground. Perhaps I had drank too much. The agents rushed to me and one said: ""is he still alive?"" I gathered all the strength I could, and even though this guy's thoughts were unknown to me I muttered: ""do you always lie to your wife?"" Then I passed out.",253001
"[WP] Your mutant gene which gives you the power to read minds is activated only by consuming alcohol. The more you drink, the better it works. You want to use your gift for the greater good. The problem is that by the time your ability gets any good, you are a total drunk jerk.",Redivivus13,"Acuity walked into the greathall of the Hive, the seat of the Alliance’s power, with trepidation in every step.  He was keenly aware of the brimming hostility in the air, a result perhaps of the many recent setbacks faced, failures which shook the very foundations of the Alliance.

Maybe there really was a traitor amongst them.

“Thank you for answering our summons, Acuity.” That was Cortena Rem, strongest mage the Alliance had in years. Acuity briefly noted that despite her decade-long tenure as de facto leader, she still looked as young as the day she had been recruited.

“I heed my call to duty, as I’ve said all these years.”

“You must realise,” said Vortex Man, Cortena’s number two, “we’ve seen what you’re like when you’re channelling your powers. If there were an alternative, we would have taken it, but time grows short. We have dire need to root out any who wear our colours, but who in truth seek to undermine us.”

“What he means is that you’re a dick, but we have no choice.” Shockbear growled, never one to mince his words. He gestured gruffly at the raised dais in the centre of the greathall, where the first member of the Alliance to be subjected to the Inquisition was already waiting.

Acuity took a seat opposite Salamander, sweat beading on his forehead. He knew there was no backing down now, but he also hoped that his friendship with her would withstand what was to come. With a trembling hand, he uncapped the bottle of Jack Daniel’s on the table, and poured himself two shots, the minimum amount needed to activate his mind-reading powers. 

It was go time.

“For the record, please state your name.”

“You know me. I’m Salamander.”

“Yes I do, and I can see that you’re not lying. But you’ll need to answer my questions for the Council to hear, for the Alliance to judge. I will call you out if you’re lying. Next question: what are your powers?”

“I… I can calculate infinite probabilities, and use that to manipulate luck.”

“Then why couldn’t you remember my number back then? 8 digits suddenly too much for you to handle, eh missy?”

An electric hum buzzed from the Alliance as Salamander’s face ran red. “What? How is this relevant?”

Acuity banged the table so hard that Salamander jumped. “Either they answer my questions or I walk! Tell her, Cortena!”

“Endure, Salamander,” Cortena sighed, “greater good demands it. He just needs a couple of opening questions to calibrate.”

Salamander gulped, then answered in hushed tones, eyes glued to the table. Though most in the crowd failed to catch what she said, Acuity was gracious enough to remove any doubt.

“Sure, it’s cool to turn down a brother if you’re already into someone else. But let me tell you something, Sally, Numberian’s current wife ain’t anywhere close to dying, so you’ve got a long wait in front of you.”

Four rows from the back, Numberian withered in his seat while a hundred pair of eyes swivelled towards him. It didn’t help that the aforementioned wife was sitting next to him.

“Next question, Sally. Do you think, maybe, I come across as being too needy, sometimes? Cause, really, that’s not what I want, but I’m told…”

“Acuity!” intoned Cortena gravely, the beginning inscriptions for a fire spell materializing in the air. “Focus on the task at hand!”

“I hear ya, I hear ya… fine. Salamander, are you a traitor to the Alliance oh look I already knew the answer ok off you go next one.” 

Salamander scuttled off the dais, while Acuity knocked back another swig from the cup before him. Next up was Gravity Man, one of the fiercest warriors in the Alliance, never one to back down from danger. Yet, a pallid paleness had taken root in his face, and it looked as if he was facing a threat even larger than death itself.

“Ah, Gravity Man. Remember that time when we were in bootcamp and you helped pull down my shorts before showertime, like, maybe 8 hours before showertime while we were just having a friendly on the football field? No, of course you’ve forgotten, me too, I promise, no hard feelings. Now tell me, where were you last night?”

“I… I was at home, alone.”

“What were you doing at home?”

“Just… chilling, you know. In general. Music and stuff.”

“I see, I see. So when you opened the incognito tab in your browser, what did you type, exactly?”

""Outstanding work, Mason.""

""Another job well done.""

""Phone's for you, Mason. It's the President.""

Tate Mason took the phone and pressed it to his ear. ""Hullo?""

""Good evening Agent Mason. I wanted to personally congratulate you.""

""Thanks president Dixon. Ahah-*huh*-"" he hiccuped. 

There was a snicker from the crowd but the rest gave solemn stares. They had heard the rumors but it was hard to believe first-hand. A mind reader- that was enough to throw them by itself, but a *drunk* mind reader?

Well, they would have to get used to it because this was the man that had just delivered some of Russia's most guarded military secrets, by way of vodka-induced espionage. And the more he drank, the deeper he could could read.

A Commander turned to his colleague, ""At least we only put up with him at *work.*""

----------

Mrs. Francine Mason hurried down the stairs to the sound of rattling keys, scrapes and aggravated grunts at her door. She quickly tied her bathrobe and sighed as she unlocked the door. 

It swung open with the unexpected force of Tate who had been holding himself up on it. Fran caught him as he stumbled in and set him upright. She folded her arms and looked him up and down. ""You're drunk.""

The slowly swaying Tate curled his lip. ""It's my JOB.""

""Is it also your job to-""

""get home at midnight?"" Tate finished. ""No. We were celebratating. I found out those damn Germans-""

""Russians.""

""Russians, right. Well I found out A-LOT but I can't supposed to tell you. Because YOU could be a Persian spy *too*."" 

""Ugh."" She retreated to the first step of the staircase. ""Just- take care of yourself. There's some-""

""meatloaf and potatoes in the fridge? *huh*-"" He hiccuped proudly. ""Heh. I called him President *Dixon*. Heheh.""

""Tate. Marrying a mind reader was hard enough. Now you're becoming an alcoholic *and* a workaholic. I don't think that's fair.""

Tate stared at her in a thoughtful sway. ""Pffft. You gotta loosen up little lady.""

Fran furrowed her brow and started up the stairs. ""Goodnight honey.""

Tate Mason was lost for words. He only swayed and watched her ascend.

-------

""Congrats comrade.""

""Excellent work.""

""Silly Americans, eh Viktor?""

 ""Viktor, a call."" Viktor was led away from the crowd to a desk and handed the phone.

""Hello?""

""Hello Viktor.""

""My love, what are you calling the embassy for?""

""Don't give me that *my love* crap. Do you know what today is?""

He thought. It struck him immediately and his heart sank. ""I... yes. Yes. I'm sorry, darling.""

""Oh forget it. I just wanted to call to remind you. Maybe next year *darling*.""

""Karen, don't-""

""Don't what? The smartest man in Russia and you can't remember an anniversary?"" She sighed. ""Sorry to call the embassy."" She hung up.

It was true. Viktor's IQ was off the charts. He had mastery over his own thoughts and memories and had tonight won the appraisal of his comrades by feeding the Pentagon false information. 

'It was all for love of country' he thought. He huffed and looked at his boots.

-----------

Tate sat there at the bar, off-duty, enjoying an ale. After a few sips he started to pick up the thoughts of his fellow patrons floating about. A few he recognized. He turned and saw at a table Viktor, sat with a whiskey, staring into it and stirring pointlessly. 

Viktor looked as glum as he did. Tate hesitated. Then he grabbed his beer and made his way over.

""Tate,"" Vik nodded.

""You are a dipshit,"" Lewis says with a laugh. ""You okay, though?"" He leans down and releases a repugnant hand from his side. 

""I am great!"" I say with a loud roar. I lift myself up without help... like I'd need it. ""I do not need your petty, meek, and useless hands."" I point at him and furrow my brow. ""You fuck,""

""I was thinking to myself 'Hey, Reggie is a cock bag,' and he totally knew I thought he was a cock bag."" Lewis nods the entire time he's talking, like some metronome that is also a prick that I hate.

""Don't think it take's powers to realize people are thinking like that about you Reggie,"" Elise says, eyes growing wide. I didn't have to read her mind to know her eyes were widening so she could glimpse at more of my impressive visage. ""You always turn into a cock bag when you're drunk."" 

""I actually have zero recollection of myself ever doing such things."" I proudly declare, but, surprisingly, no one is stricken with awe. 

""Of course you don't mate,"" Lewis says. ""Cause you're fuckin' drunk at the time. You forget."" I read deep into his mind. Through some foul magic or nefarious tactics, he seems to have completely tricked himself into believing that thought.

""I reject your statement and replace it with me own. And it goes; 'I am really nice all the time, and you can all get fucked.'"" 

""Sit down mate,"" Lewis says, shaking his head. ""You're actually bothering me now."" I can sense in his mind that its true. I feel a bit of shame as I sit down in my seat. 

""Why do we bring this guy out drinking? He does it every time."" Elise remarks to Lewis. My chest tightens as if a dagger of betrayal has sliced through my entire being. 

""Dunno, just do,"" Lewis says and takes a sip of his beer. I pry into his mind once more and can read his intentions loud and clear.

'Because I love the bastard, even when he's a prick.' 

""Oh, Lewis,"" I say, tears swelling out my eyes. ""I love you too."" 

""Alright, don't be weird,"" Lewis says with a small laugh. ""Ay, if you can read minds, why don't you go chat up that bird over there? Give the Ol' Professor XXX if you catch my drift."" I didn't, but I read his mind to realize he meant, I should go try to have sex with her.

I exclaim with great exuberance to the mirror which reflects my not so flattering features. 

It has been a long and arduous journey of self reflection over the past few months as I try to come to terms with my recently discovered abilities. Naturally, the high amounts of alcohol consumed has left me with an undesirable figure, but alas a small price to pay for fighting for the rights of all mankind...At least this is what I tell myself to mask the truth.

For the past few months I have been trying to use my powers for good.  I thought that perhaps by being able to read the minds of the people around me, I can be able to solve all of their life problems. I was sadly mistaken.

Last night seems like a blur, in large part due to the the fifth of Jack Daniels I polished off, but also to the rapid calamity that took place.

You see, the higher the state of my inebriation the better my ability to read minds becomes. A real catch-22 wouldn't you say?

The night began with a few Jack and cokes while I began to warm up my senses. Slowly I began to hear the trickle of thoughts from the people surrounding me at my local pub. 

It begins often with just a half sentence, ""Mmmm, I'd really like to ...... but not yet"" the more I drink the more complete the thoughts I hear around me. 

""You know you could buy me a drink first if you intend on staring at me all night"" the woman says to me with a devilish grin. 

In all honesty I had no interest in her in a romantic sense. I was just focusing in because she had the look of someone that was lost. A look of worry masked by a fake smile to offset anyone concerned. She is the one I look to help tonight. 

""Sorry, you just seemed really interesting."" I quickly respond with a smile. 

""Well, tell you what, you can see how interesting I am if you pay for my next cocktail."" She says with a wink.

I order her a drink and we begin to talk. Slowly I become more intoxicated, really honing in on her deep thoughts.

She tells me she's recently divorced and extremely happy. Her thoughts show to me that the divorce was messy and she still loves her ex-husband very much. 

She tells me she's a lawyer who fights for the rights of minorities and those unable to fight for themselves and most of her work is pro bono. Once again her thoughts deceive her and reveal she is an unsuccessful public defendant, who has lost more than a few cases relating to her alcoholism. 

Yes, this is truly a women that needs some help, some guidance. I will be her savior!

As the night dwindles down I am at the peak of my abilities, the bar is about to close, now is my chance for some greater good.

""I know about your ex-husband, you love him still don't you"" I mumble 

""No, of course not. He can rot in hell!"" She lies.

""I can help you win him back you know, I have this gift. I can read,"" *hiccup* ""minds.""

""Fine what am I thinking then"" she says skeptical, but a little intrigued possibly due to the alcohol.

""Your cat, Mr Mittens, and the surprise dead mouse he left on your doorstep a few days ago"" I say with a condescending smirk

""Now, you're thinking, how the hell did he know that, stop it, I mean it stop reading my mind. What the hell is going on? how I drunk am I? Ice cream. Tuna. Trucks. Rain. Oh, crap maybe he can read minds"" I quickly fire off as quick as she can think them.

She stands there in utter disbelief, but thinks maybe this crazy plan can work. She thinks if she knows what her ex is thinking, surely she will be able to please him.

We arrive at the door of an unassuming house in a small suburban neighborhood. 

""This is it, this is where he lives."" 

She rings the doorbell followed by loud pounding and drunken yells of ""Hello!""

She giggles with glee as she sees the lights go on in the house, but quickly fades as another woman opens the door. 

Shit, I didn't plan for this. What was I even planning? Why did I think this was a good idea. 

""I mean if I'm standing right there whispering in his ear, obviously he would see me."" I think to myself in retrospect. 

""Who the fuck are you? and where the fuck is John?"" She exclaims to the woman at the door. ""That piece of shit!""

From behind the woman at the door, John rolls up in his wheelchair, eyes groggy, half awake.

Shit. John would be handicapped, just my luck. 

I quickly spring to action and diffuse the situation with intelligence and poise. I act as a personal therapist, issue out small chunks of advice, and in the end we are all left as happy fuller people.

At least that was the plan, but the bottle of Jack also set off another ability. The drunk asshole came out. I sprint to the door and clock John in the face,with a smile I turn to my damsel in distress.

She is horrified. I just punched her disabled ex-husband in the face and have the audacity to turn and smile with pride.

She quickly runs to console him, the woman from inside the home runs to phone the police. I begin to violently throw up in John's bed of roses.


""Yes, tonight is definitely the night"" I repeat to myself with greater confidence to the stainless steel that serves as my mirror.

The cell door opens, and I collect my belongings. Knowing that tonight, surely some good will come.

[CW] Write a story that has no characters and no dialogue.,Troldilocks,"What is a character? It's not necessarily a person, or an animal. With the right writer, even a piece of paper could be a character, or a paper bag. A paper bag, in the wind; ""wanting to start again,"" to quote a popular song. So, how can you write a story without characters, let alone dialogue? 
To do so, refer to a universal story, one which engages neither characters, no dialogue. And this story is truly universal: it's the story of the moon and the wind and the stars.

Every day, the Earth rotates, and revolves; every day, the sun shines its light upon the earth, as it has done for millions of years. Every day the wind blows, passing through mountainous landscapes, calm scenery, wintry beaches of tundra. Every day, and every night, the wind is there—moving through the worlds of the earth, passing from north to south, becoming warmer and colder, crossing and chaining and creating rivulets as it goes. 

The wind meets itself; the wind crosses over, transcends. It is not alive; it is certainly not a character. And yet, it moves. It lives, much as the sun does, the stars, the moon. The moon that, at the same time, weaves its own story. It moves in tandem with the Earth, around the Earth, pulling its tides toward itself, affecting the waters of the planet with every movement. It wakes up at night; it returns to its horizon when dawn breaks, or earlier still. No matter what happens on Earth—and no matter what its denizens can or can't see, giant telescopes or not—the Earth's smaller, rocky parallel is always there, moving alongside it. 

So much for the moon; so much for the sun, whose bright lies arrives to us from millions of light-years away. But what of the other cosmic bodies? They sprinkle the sky of our galaxy, of our universe even. They each have their own identity; each, a name. A purpose? When there are no characters to this cosmic tapestry—when we know nothing of our origins, nor of where we're headed—we cannot say. But the cosmic bodies exist in themselves; they are a part of the universe, as much as the humans themselves are.

Thus, the cosmic bodies pull themselves through the sky, affecting the course of life on our own blue planet, that tiny dot in a gigantic wheel of existence. But there is growth, life—characters, in a way—on the planet itself. As the sun shines, and the moon turns, so grow the plants, the flowers, the trees. They soak up the sun; they photosynthesize, creating their own sustenance from the powers they derive from the heavenly bodies. They stand tall, sentinels to a world that is almost entirely beyond human understanding. They shelter the animals, and protect weather conditions from damaging the land. The trees, plants, flowers are fertilizers, protectors, nurturers. 
 
And what of the rocks? Cousins to the heavenly bodies that rule above them in the sky, floating in space, the rocks, the pebbles, the stones mark the territory of a world that exists as much on its own terms as it does to be understood and analyzed by human beings. They scatter the lakes, the rivers, the oceans; they cover up the beds of bodies of water. They fill the volcanoes, and turn into magma, into lava; they are part of the buildings which dominate the human side of earth. They gather at the stream; they whistle as the sounds of the waterfall flow past them.

Altogether, all of this—the sun, the moon, the cosmic bodies, the flora and rocks of the world—they are not characters, at least not in the conventional sense, and if one is not referring to the gods of the world's diverse religions. And yet, they exist, both for and in themselves. They create change; they make things the way they are. Without them, the world would be wholly different, and perhaps not quite so livable. 

Because, after all, does an object need to be a character—someone that can feel, and perceive—to be great? The answer, of course, is no. There is a kind of beauty in the non-sentient; a beauty in those structures which govern the humans' universe, and which will continue to exist, countless generations after the humans have left the earth. It is much the earth, the universe of the non-sentient—the cosmic bodies, the plants, the rocks—as much as it is that of humans, of animals. And for that, they are beautiful.",rockwell78

[CW] Write a story that has no characters and no dialogue.,Troldilocks,"It's an old, old joke. *When is a door not a door?*

Classical humorists (Also known as Dads) might supply the answer: *When it's a Jar*, but I have a different answer. Instead, let's try: *When it never opens.*

One could extend this line of thinking a little further. When is a store not a store? (When nobody ever shops there). When is a library not a library? (When nobody's reading the books). Taking this old joke to its limits we reach the ultimate sad punchline: When is a town not a town any more? When nobody lives there.  

From the outside, you'd never know Kitsault was a dead town. When the words Ghost Town come to mind, one thinks of a collection of crumbling old shanties in the middle of a dusty prairie, slowly turning to nothingness as the wind tears at their boards. You'd never think of pretty little Kitsault that way; the buildings are all still tight and snug, the lights are still on, and the books are still on the shelves in the town library. 

Nonetheless, this is a town filled only by ghosts. Not the supernatural kind: nobody ever died here. They're the ghosts of dreams. Over a thousand souls lived here once, full of dreams and hope centered around a single word. Molybdenum. An entire town grew overnight, all to service the dream of a molybdenum mine. For eighteen beautiful months, the people lived and loved, worked and waited, played and practiced their trades in service of the molybdenum dream. 

Nothing lasts forever. Some things last less time than others. Less than two years after the dream was born, it died in its infancy. Molybdenum went from a dream to a curse. To the last child, the people of Kitsault abandoned the dream. The town lies empty, home only to ghosts. 

They called it Heaven on Earth, but now it's just a grave. ",51Gunner

From seedling to sapling, it took its first steps into infancy. Thin-trunked and vulnerable, but steadfast, it grew. With nature’s care and coaxing, the tree reached its youth. Long, slender branches which reached for the sun. Perhaps one day, when it was big and strong, it would finally grasp it. Time took its course, as time so often does. Winters melted to springs and leaves fell into winter. Its trunk grew robust and its branches twisted and turned in their very own dance. And soon, the tree grew its very first flower.

*Sakura*, they called it. The cherry-blossom tree. It had reached middle age now and, during the third and fourth month, coral-hued flowers cascaded from its branches. They hung in the air like clouds. Streaks of pink, white and coral against an ever-darkening sky in an ever-darkening time. Exquisite in their beauty, the flowers were a symbol of inspiration. Motivation. Hope. Men who were called by their country plucked flowering branches to bring them luck. The tree's image was painted on the sides of planes which would never again land. Winters melted to springs, and blossoms fell into winter. Red petals stained the ground. 

For one hundred years, the tree had stood. They thought it would stand forever, and they were wrong. For, one hundred years since the seedling had first grabbed onto the ground, a cloud of a different kind filled the sky. The war-ender, it was; the glory of mankind's invention!

And where there was something, nothing now stood. And ash caught in the wind, as the blossoms once did.

[CW] Write a story that has no characters and no dialogue.,Troldilocks,"No one knows what happened. No one knows why it happened or how. No one knows anything anymore because there is no one left to know it.

With no one to mark the passage of time, the concepts of years, months and weeks become meaningless. Days and hours, minutes and seconds. Unobserved and unrecorded, these rigid measurements unravel into nothingness, ignored and irrelevant. Only the gentle rhythms of light and dark, hot and cold, wet and dry remain. Stillness overtakes the world.

Now unchallenged, nature reclaims the abandoned thrones of the previous tenants. Places that had long forgotten the likes of seed and vine and lichen and moss once again feel their soft embrace. Ever so slowly, the planet continues to cover itself in a blanket of foliage. Like wounds scabbing over, shades of sooty black and ashen grey are replaced with ripe greens and mild browns.

Along with the vegetation comes the rest of the wild. All manner of beasts and birds and insects make for themselves a new world in the remnants of the old. The seas and skies return to their natural cadence and the cycles of life and death find balance as the planet purges.

Left untended, once mighty and imposing towers of glass and steel and concrete fall into disrepair. Derelict and neglected, they fall to the soft sway of the elements. Eroded by wind and water and rain, they degrade ever more until finally, they return to the waiting earth.

Lastly, inorganic debris sporadically falls from the sky. They plummet to the verdurous planet below, the final traces of a dynasty long ended; their orbits decayed just like everything else.

And with no one to see it, no one to hear it, no one to know it, the planet is once again at peace.

*Bang.*

There was no sound, or at least no directly audible indication of such a thing.
The lack of noise, however, was no indication of a lack of activity- no, no, something *big* happened. The ""bang"" indicates nothing but the absurd magnitude of the first thing to ever happen.

Elementary particles were created. Matter and antimatter eliminated each other. Quarks formed baryons. Nuclei formed.

Three hundred and eighty years after the genesis of the most elementary particles of reality, atoms began to form. It was at this moment that the physical world, as is understood by the later-born sapients of the universe, formed in earnest. 

Two hundred million years after the first atoms were ""born"", these basic constituents of matter took the next step- coming together to form stars, the massive gaseous psuedospheres of energy which ignited via the incredible power of the predefined physical laws of reality.

1.0e49 of these stars would ever exist over the course of history, but the number isn't important. The part that matters is what forms around them- *planets*, those gaseous or terrestrial sort-of-spheres which bear the real beauty of the universe. 

The lavafalls of 55 Cancri Brahe's twenty-kilometer-tall cliffs or the thirty-mile-high buttes of TRAPPIST-1F's shallow polar oceans are themselves figures of incredible stature, as is the occasional gas planet of pure ethanol. It's nothing compared to the one-in-a-billion rarity of sentient life, but this doesn't demerit the inherent beauty of the Universe's randomness.

9.9e40 percent of the universe is empty space. The remaining part is a combination of matter, dark matter, dark energy, and a few other basic constituents.

That's only the percent from the observable territory of Sol-3, the origin of the first sapient life. This neglects entirely what lies outside of their 13.82 billion-light-year observable territory.

It neglects the encroaching, tightening sphere of antimatter.

It neglects the reverse Big Bang, the universe's constricting from the outside, generating antimass the whole way through.

It neglects the impossibility of defeating of the rapidly-expanding cosmic net, consuming everything it meets along its way to the center of the universe.

Sol-3, origin of the largest sapient empire in the history of the universe, doesn't stand a chance. Their unstoppable force can't defeat this immovable object, nor the inverse. 

Fourteen billion years after the inception of the universe, the only advanced sapient life has been eliminated.

Forty billion years after that, there is no Universe in the proper sense. There is only free-floating, unbound energy which cannot bond or form anything greater than the odd photon. 

And, just like that, it's as though nothing had ever even happened.

Up, up, down.

Charm, top, strange.

Seemingly, they exist and cease to exist in unquantifiable space and time, but an equilibrium is reached in quantum states to form higher elementary particles.

Six protons, neutrons, and electrons vibrating at an energy level that maintains a semi-stable stasis. An amphitheater of nothing with a few flashes of activity.

Hexagonally  oriented with six hydrogens, four carbon, two oxygen, and two nitrogen, a thymine molecule forms for a brief instant, secure in its bondage and constitution. Agreeably, it conjoins with an adenine, a nucleic bridge the likes of a ladder. The interconnections of a phosphate-deoxyribose backbone, curled upon itself as a barrel roll of life.

A tightly wound formation of DNA molecules, an x-formed hairnet of snakes swimming in the fluid of a nucleus, holding the informational archives of a life in such a fragile and binary way as to constitute absurdity. A decoupling occurs, setting off a series of fault lines that lead to two nuclei and two cells, accompanied by their constituents.

Unfathomable cells cascade through fibers of celluloid, ushering oxygen atoms to various receptacles and digits, a collection called blood that determines life and, in some cases, indicates death.

A system of cardiovascular purpose, a building block of a being that is wholly unaware of the intricate machinations of its own constituent parts, its own gears and foundations that allow the illusion of existence. 

A community of these beings, interacting and copulating in much the same way as the building blocks that allow them to function, albeit in a much slower and larger scale. They form a collective consciousness and an environment with wholly different beings and entities that, somehow, are constructed of the same matter. The same sparks.

The ecosystem spreads as a diverse tapestry, a faceted sheen of reflected light upon the surface of an orb falling in perpetual revolutions around a fusing ball of hydrogen. The orb is graced as a haven of life, a petri dish of existence juxtaposed by other orbs that contain certain building blocks, but not in a a specific recipe to constitute life.

This array of orbs, locked in concentric pirouettes around the Sun careen through the vast emptiness of nothingness that surround its immediate vicinity. Expanding outwards, this steadily diminishing system becomes a speck amongst other flickering motes, a dust particle of light in a coiling arm, a member of an entity formulated wholly by these fusing balls of matter to become a galactic article.

As the galaxy recedes, it becomes lost amongst the other entities, all very similar yet foreign and unique. The local group has no center of seemingly standard formation, but falls into uniformity the farther away it becomes and gathers amongst the other groups and clusters.

The superclusters of billions of galaxies form a percolating embroidery upon the onyx backdrop of the void, and as this too diminishes, the superclusters become single entities until the whole of the universe is contained within a speck of seemingly unimpeded light.

The path continues outwards. Other particles of light grace the universe with their presence. Ever on and on they form as the view regresses until their form is solidified. Their arrangement is simple, archaic, sublime:

"[WP] Create a series of events that culminates in a perfectly sane man picking a deer up by the hind legs, and swinging it at people to knock out an entire room.",Unusualmann,"Connor's big mouth had done it again. Got him in a jam he might not get out of. He could feel the rope biting his wrists as he tested the available give. Luckily those bastards didn't double check their knots, probably all those beers.

Just 30 minutes ago Connor was drinking bourbon at a bar in between Ottawa and Montreal watching puck. Bruins put a pounding on the Canadiens so he ran his mouth a little. So what. Back in the states that gets you a bar fight &amp; an early cab home. Maybe some jail time if you get out of control. These mother fuckers take their hockey way too seriously.

One of the Farm boys reappeared in the woodladen room for the first time in a few minutes, breaking Connor's steady train of thought.

Scowling, he moved towards Connors chair, smartly leaving space between himself and the detainee. There was room to either side of him, with the walls decorated straight out of a movie. Portraits, rifles, pelts, the mounted heads abounded. There was a table with expensive looking bottles against the wall.

Connor wouldn't mind one last bourbon if this asshole really was going to kill him. Probably shouldn't have stabbed his friend. Oh well. With 3 men now entering the room, the tone had shifted. What once seemed unsure, now seemed unspoken.

The final man entered and shut the door behind him. Removing a sawed off shotgun from behind his belt he spoke, ""Fucked with the wrong men then, boy.""

Connor couldn't help but smile. After all the ribbing Canadiens got for being too nice, he was about to die because he opened his mouth about a hockey game. All too right for how he'd lived his life. Rash decions were his specialty.

The leader of the group was now saying something about his hurt comrade. Connor pretended to listen, but knew he had to try something. In that moment he'd wished he'd taken his cop brother up on shooting lessons. Probably wouldn't have been the old guns lining the walls, and who knows if they have bullets in them, but he had to take a chance.

He had almost worked his wrists free when finally the brute stopped his monologue and squared himself with the gun centered on Connor's chest. The time was now. No plan. Just like at the bar. God, if only he'd had his knife still. He never got it back from the original Canadien's back.

In a sudden burst of movement Connor broke his wrists free and charged at the gun toting redneck, jarring his arm enough to cause an errant scatter shot catching one of his friends in the path. Connor cast about for cover, and a plan, neither coming easily.

The spacious study was covered with enemies, but one path lay clear. He crouched and jagged his way towards a gigantic, majestic stuffed Deer. He had briefly admired the beauty earlier, as much as one can enjoy idiotic expenditures of money when tied to a chair. This wasn't just the typical 'head &amp; shoulders' mounted on the wall. This was a full out stuffed Deer. With a gigantic set of antlers that glinted in silver.

As he rounded the table it lay on he realized it wasn't fixed in anyway, right as one of the dirty Canucks rushed towards him. With no time &amp; no options, Connor needed to rely on his instincts, and those instincts said DEER. He grabbed the back legs of the beast and lashed out towards his oncoming attacker. The sound was solid &amp; horrifying. The silver plated antler and skull put a hole through the poor bastard's cranium, throwing blood across the wood &amp; leather study.

Connor was in a frenzy, feeling one with the Deer he brought it high above his head and directly down onto the bruising leader of the clan, who was still gaining his feet from the initial tackle &amp; fracas. The antlers pierced the big boned brute in multiple places leaving trident sized gashes. Connor thought about lunging for the gun, but with only two enemies left he felt he had almost mastered the art of Deer-wielding.

As the opponents sized him up, they seemed to recognize their fate was upon them. Each waited eagerly for Connor to make a move. As he feinted left and leaped to slice the first man's throat, Connor felt completely calm for the first time in his life. He now knew, no matter what happened immediately following his final kill in this room, he would forever be able to wield a deer as an instrument of death. He just hoped he could find a way to do good with that extraordinary power.

"[WP] You are born on a planet where the crust is constantly shifting. Countries and people change location and climate frequently. The world is never the same for more than one day. Until one day, when the ground suddenly stops moving.",WhiteWolf17,"I remember the day when something I took for granted utterly ceased to be.

I suppose you Earth folks might think me mad if I say the sound of moving tectonic plates is my lullaby. I’ve heard stories about how earthquakes like the one at Northridge claimed thousands of lives. But here on Aquaterra, earthquakes (as you call them) aren’t just un-catastrophic: They’re a way and fact of life.

Our continents are like jigsaw puzzle pieces, you see, set upon a liquid core filled with a relatively non-viscous fluid which becomes volatile when contacting air. Our forebears sought to use this fluid as a source of transportation energy: by fitting everything from giant propellors to mobile steam engines, they could travel the world while never leaving home. But over time, the recoil from those motors tore their plots of land apart; the resulting fragments crashed against each other and eventually dissolved into ocean dust.

You don’t need to fret for us, though. We Aquaterrans are strong swimmers from birth. All the Drownedlanders made it safely back to land while the rest of us carried on just as before.

After the incident, the authorities, fearing increases in refugees, banned the use of motorized equipment on our land plots. That didn’t stop us Aquaterrans from roaming about. Far from it, actually. The constant grinding beneath our feet increased, and so did our mileage.

It took me a couple days to realize what was going on. I remember the first day I woke up and realized that my surroundings were utterly and completely foreign to me. Before I fell asleep, I’d bidden a fond farewell to my neighbor Toto. (We Aquaterrans are a friendly sort—we know full well that our neighbors one week may not be our neighbors the next, and so we treat everyone hospitably. Adventurously, even. Though our contact is transient, our memories are forever.) In the morning, though, his red-roofed house was no longer next to mine. I know not where it had gone.

Another day and another new neighbor passed me by before I realized there was something amiss. Our jigsaw land plots had never moved so fast before.

In hindsight, I should have been worried. Rapid change in something thought to be constant was never good. But I was young and naïve; I knew naught of what would soon transpire, save for the fact that I would be able to see even more and greater sights very soon. This is another reason the shifting lands of Aquaterra suited me: I had never been one for constancy in my surroundings. What I craved most was the new. And with this startling new fluidity, I could see even more of it.

Village upon village, city upon city, culture upon culture passed me by in the space of weeks. I gained more world knowledge in a month after the Drownedlanders incident than I had in the year before. Some of my newer neighbors had huts, pagodas, and even skyscrapers. Some were large enough to bring their own weather systems. Having lived near the equator all my life, I never knew such things as snow and rain existed. The first time I was caught in it, I simply stood at my porch in wonder.

It did not escape me that our world was getting warmer, however. The first two times I saw snow were also the last times. The rain temperature had also been rising steadily, to the point where it burned the skin on impact and forced us all back inside our homes. Whenever we went out now, it was always with thick umbrellas and wary eyes on the sky.

Our land was also sinking too. But we didn’t realize how low it’d gotten until the red seeped in.

My new neighbor and I were walking idly about on his land plot chatting about our new sort of mayfly life when suddenly, he cried out and leaped into the air, hands clenched around his un-hopping foot. I was startled to find that glowing dark red muck was oozing up onto his land through the crack beside mine. Indeed, glowing red ooze was appearing all around the isles, with screaming people fleeing the faster-moving currents as if being chased. 

I had only moments to act. “This way!” I shouted, grabbing his arm and making to drag him along with me. But by now, the red ooze had crept up and burned his other foot too, and he tore away from me with a scream. I watched him run for a moment, then trip, then pull up and run again; but I could not spare him any longer of a glance, for I had my own safety to look after now.

The ground quaked beneath my feet as I ran back towards my flat; but I had long since grown used to the heaving and navigated it without slowing my pace. Certainly, one way to escape the fire-fluid was to seek higher ground; but while my flat offered little in the way of height compared to my today-neighbor’s, it did have a basement built right in the middle of solid granite. With any luck, none of the lava on the surface would leak inside.

It only took a moment to jump inside and seal the hatch. I had enough food stores in here, collected from all the different places I visited, to last me years. With the door to my basement sealed, all I could do now was sit and wait.

The rumbling seemed to last forever. To my tense and nervous ears, it seemed to grow more malicious. My thoughts drifted back to my hapless neighbor and his lava-burned feet. Had he made it back to his home safely?

In the silence that surrounded me (save, of course, for the rumbling that I had learned to tune out long ago), I began to imagine the rock walls around me growing hotter. A touch on the wall confirmed that it wasn’t just my imagination. Slowly, I could feel panic setting in. What it the ocean that had sustained us for so long was now turning on us? Would I die here, trapped and alone underground, away from all the sights and people I’d met and loved?

As if answering me, the earth suddenly gave a powerful shudder, hard enough to throw me off-balance. Stumbling to my feet, I watched in dismay as my tropic-ice drinks from Emisa fell to the floor and shattered. But there was no use mourning spilled milk, as you Earthlings say; especially not when one’s life was in danger. If the ceiling collapsed on my head, I was as good as dead. And so I stumble-ran to the nearest sheltered corner and wrapped my arms around the bedrock pillar there, hoping and praying that this quake was just temporary.

And in time, the convulsions did end. Warily, I unstuck myself from the pillar and tried the latch. It was locked… No, I realized; it was being forced shut by a heavy weight. Deprived as I was of windows (I’d never thought to build any into my cellar), I could not even see what it was that was trapping me inside. But it didn’t matter, for I was fairly certain I knew.

In wake of the quake, the great masonry of Aquaterra had fallen, and the magma had glued it in place.

As the cold reality of it set in, another thing occurred to my dumbstruck mind: The earth was no longer shaking anymore.

She turns away from me. ""It matters because I'm a customer. I'd like to speak with your manager.""

""Alright then."" I sigh. ""I'll go get her.""

After my shift ends I grab my tips, hop in my car, and hightail it out of the parking lot and onto the highway. My ears are still ringing from the dressing down my manager gave me, and my face is burning from having had to apologize to that awful woman just because she felt I'd disrespected her.

Pretty soon I'm out of the city and trees rise up beside me. The sun sets directly in front of me, like a bright red tunnel at the end of the road. I drive for two hours until I get to a dirt road beside a wooden sign marked CAMP GROND. I'm not sure whether that sign was a failed attempt to write CAMPGROUND or the camp area is named after someone named Grond.

The road takes me far into the woods, until the highway sounds disappear and the forest closes in overhead. I park inside camp area 17 and pull my equipment from the trunk. I've got a stove, cooler, and pup tent ready to go. In no time I've got the area set up to my liking.

Finally, I'm free to crack a beer, forget about my day, and sink into my surroundings.

The air smells of damp earth. Birds twitter, squirrels rustle, and frogs croak. A few mosquitoes come snooping around but they're eaten up by dragonflies. The beer tastes like electric ice.

""Life is pretty good,"" I say to no one. I lean my head and look up at the stars beginning to show overhead.

*life could be better.*

I don't recognize the words as words. Not the first time. They come soft and sibilant. I mistake them for a trick of the wind. But they come again, and it's a though a caterpillar runs up my spine.

""Somebody here?"" I sit upright. ""You want a beer?""

The laughter sounds like chimes tinkling.

""Whatever this is, this is not cool."" I get my flashlight out of my kit but I don't turn it on. Better to save my nightvision now that it's past the twilight hour. The sky has purpled, and the shadows are taking on depth. ""Seriously, cut the shit.""

*cut shit? ew.*

""It's an expression."" I shake my head. ""Wait, why am I arguing with you?""

*your life isn't what you wanted it to be.*

""Nobody's life is what they want it to be.""

*that's why you come here every weekend. that's why you have no friends. no girlfriend. that's why you don't talk to your family.*

The air takes on a cold edge. I can feel the dimensions of my lungs.

*life could be better.*

""Better how?""

*come and see.*

A point of light clicks on, far off in the trees. It sparkles light a star, and its dimensions shift when I move my head.

""Are you gonna do any weird shit to me?""

*come and see.*

""Fuck this."" I yank my tent out of the ground and toss it, still assembled, into the back seat of my car. The cooler and the stove go in the trunk. In the driver's seat I stick the key in the ignition, and I pause. In the rearview mirror the light twinkles in the distance.

I chew my lower lip.

""Fuck it."" 

I grab my flashlight, my camelpack, some granola bars, and a fresh beer, and I strike out into the forest.

He frowned, and moved on to the next  ""refugee"".

""Okay, so this, my friends, is where we keep the Hive of Bees.""

Vazquez had led the crew to another plastic cell, seemingly occupied by a single man in a trench coat. Vazquez tapped on the cell wall and gave the man a friendly wave, which the man returned.

Turning around to the crew, he looked for signs of confusion, or perhaps shock; disappointed, he took the stoic silence as an invitation to continue.

""That's former LT. Borrowitz.""

He paused for effect.

An awkward moment of silence passed as he stared uncomfortably into the camera before continuing.

""Borrowitz was the first to come in contact with the Hive when it crashed into the WTC 3 in '01, and per protocol we quarantined him.""

Vazquez paused again, waiting for the usual ""9/11 was an alien crash cover-up?"" (it wasn't, it was just a really unfortunate coincidence of timing).

There were no gasps of shock, nor of horror and dismay. Vasquez stared, dumbfounded, as the documentary crew
filmed on, wordless.

You have all successfully passed the polygraph test and the background check. You have been given top secret security clearance with a need to know basis... Anyone want coffee?"" A secretary was there with cups of coffee for the film crew. The general continued commissioning the debrief, ""as you know the director of the CIA is granting you the means to bring around full disclosure of all the activities in the designated area 51 of the Nevada Test Site. This project will take sometime because without understanding the minds conducting the projects here merrily recording what you will find will be pointless without their comprehension.""

""Sir? Since, we all have been cleared. Wouldn't it be best if you could warn us about what we may see so we can mentally prepare ourselves?"" Asked one of the film crewmen.

""What do you expect?""

""I don't know... Are there aliens there?""

The general laughed out laugh. ""This is the whole point of the project. For decades conspiracy theorists have made popular this notion of aliens or alien technology at Area 51 but the truth of the fact is that this location is just half a dozen hangers, several warehouses, some office buildings, and the run way. So, you need to make it clear in a manner that will still interest those out side of the aeronautical field in an exciting way similar to the myths of aliens.""

""So, there are no aliens?""

""Enough about the aliens. Listen to me. Why would there be aliens at Area 51 when there are underground tunnels, underground warehouses, and facilities that are more secure than anything else on Earth just a few miles from Area 51. Sometimes people's stupidity amazes me. They want full disclosure of Area 51 so despite the massive international security and risking hundreds of billions of dollars currently in production we are giving them what they asked for.""",area51perp

Everything looked pretty much the same, bar the green goo that coated most surfaces. Michael's office was the worst, with his window smashed and desk overturned. The crew slowly advanced to the middle of the main area. The cameraman flicked on his radio.

""Seal Team 6, this is Quinn. Main area is clear, move up.""

Almost instantly, the otherwise quiet building was filled with the sound of pounding boots, as the seals moved up the stairs at an alarming rate. Within 30 seconds, the main area was filled with flashlights and lasers, checking every corner for anything the crew might have missed. A sudden noise came from the annex, and everyone swung to the kitchen door. Dwight calmly swung the door open and walked into the room. He turned towards the seals

""Guys, I thought we'd discussed this. The Knights of Night have a very strict regimen and I'm just not sure if you're up to snuff.""

The seals looked at each other. Falcon, the squad leader, stood up.

""C'mon Dwight. Can you at least give us some of those reflective strips you guys have? How were we supposed to know that was the only way to render them helpless?"" 

The boom guy almost dropped the microphone in shock. At the same time Jim also exited from the kitchen, covered head to toe in reflective strips.

""Yeah guys, dwights been telling people for years to be prepared for every possible situation. Besides, we have a limited amount.""

Dwight shot daggers at Jim. ""You're supposed to be spreading those out between the remaining. Remember, sales gets the best ones. Accounting gets scraps.""

Jim shrugged and headed back into the annex. Before Dwight could begin speaking again, the air horn went off, a piercing wail that could mean only one thing. They were on the way. The seals and the camera crew looked desperately at Dwight. 

""Sorry guys. I'm sure you can handle it on your own."" 

Dwight walked back into the kitchen, pulling the reinforced door behind him. Sliding the giant dead bolt into place, he shook his head and muttered to himself.

""I'd been sending Area 51 letters for years about not keeping this under wraps. Not my fault they thought I was overreacting that they couldn't keep it hidden. I'd been dropping hints for all those years that those idiots from PBS were here. Oh well, I'm sure they'll be fine."" 

Dwight returned to the annex, where the rest of Dunder Mifflin Scranton was preparing for the assault. Dwight peered out the window, to see a convoy of black cars peel out of the parking lot back towards central Scranton. Less than ten seconds later, the first of them started flooding down the street. Dwight smirked.

""Good luck boys. You're gonna need it.""

[WP] You are the overly average teenage neighbor of the mysteriously gifted and rebellious teen protagonist in your dystopian society and you're getting a bit tired of their crap.,averykrouse,"Every fucking day we were visited by the Overlord's guards, and every fucking day we had to keep them away from reaching Candace. 

Not today! Fuck the other villagers, I'm tired of hearing helicopters at seven in the fucking morning. I am going to her secret place and sending a signal to the damn guards. With that in mind, I set out for the woods nearby our village. Where the fuck else would she be?

Apparently, Candace had some mysterious power that could overthrow the System the Overlord uses to keep us in place. And now she *has* to be hidden. Pfft. What the fuck does she do? Fart rainbows? 

Whatever her gift might be, it sure isn't hiding. It took me less than an hour to find her holed up under some giant tree. Literally the biggest tree in the forest, and she thought that was the best place to hide. 


Candace was lying wth her back to the trunk of the tree as I approached her. Dressed in all black with a scowl on her face. She always ruminated so loudly, you couldn't help but spot her. It felt like electricity was sparking around her forehead. You know, she had the kind of look on her face that a person gets when they are thinking too hard. She always seemed to be on the verge of either crying or making a melodramatic speech. 

""Candace,"" I called to her. ""Get the fuck up, I'm calling the guards."" 

She looked at me with vacant eyes, pouting. ""You're here to take me away, aren't you. You're here to let guards take me.""

""Yeah, that's what I fucking said. Now stop being depressed and start walking. If not, I will just call the guards right now.""

She sighed, blinking slowly. Her arms closed around her as she brought her knees to her chin, and she sighed again. 

This fucking girl. 

""I guess I should be taken away,"" she said. ""I don't deserve to live. Why am I cursed so?"" 

""*You're* cursed? Have you by any chance thought of the bullshit we have to deal with because of you?""

""You're right. I am a plague unto to this world. I only bring sadness. Just like I brought sadness to my family. Oh, if only I could shoot an arrow through all my pains."" 

I rubbed my forehead. This girl very well could just be *special*. I realised I had never thought of that. Maybe I shouldn't call the guards. There has to be a deeper reason this girl was so fucking annoying. 

""What do you think?"" she asked me. ""Do I only bring pain? Don't answer. I know what you will say. I always bring pain. That's why I cannot love.""

""Oh, fuck, not this again."" 

She looked up into the sky, her hand at her heart. ""That's why I lost my love, Peter...""

""Fuck this, you had your chance. I'm calling the cops.""

[WP] You are the overly average teenage neighbor of the mysteriously gifted and rebellious teen protagonist in your dystopian society and you're getting a bit tired of their crap.,averykrouse,"Every day was the same.  I woke up, someone brought me a big ass breakfast, took a vile of blood, sent me to do some very basic and easy tests (some included math, some included walking on a treadmill.  Nothing over the top.) and the day would end with a woman taking my vitals.  This was the life of the kids in Hospital 66.  

I was content for the most part.  Sure, sometimes I would get a little bored, but it was nice to have time to let my mind wander.  I would think about my test scores, read a book, study... 

That all changed really fast when some weird kid started living in the room next to me.  I found it difficult to fall asleep with all the noise they made.  For the first week, I heard heavy thrashing, grunting and screaming.  

I kind of sympathized with him at first.  New places can be scary and sometimes the routine took getting used to.  I didn't think he'd keep me up for a fucking month with all his bull shit.  

I saw him sometimes when I was getting my vitals done at night.  He was bizarrely good looking- steely gray eyes, big ass biceps and triceps, sun kissed skin and wind blown hair (despite being stuck in a dimly lit building for a month.)

Not only was he good looking, he was the most gifted kid in the program.  The doctors all loved him.  He got the best scores, ran the fastest, calculated the most accurately- yet he threw a fit every other hour.  The nurses had to take all of the other kids back to their rooms because chairs would end up flying every which way and he would periodically knock someone the fuck out.  

What the actual fuck?

Eventually his shitty attitude caught on.  All of a sudden EVERYONE and their sister had a problem with the way things were run.  Nevermind the free food and basic ass list of tasks that needed to be completed over the day.  Poverty and joblessness was apparently WAY better.  

I tried not to think too much about it.  The doctors had everything under control, right?  He was just some stupid kid.  There was no use making a big deal out of something that didn't matter.

Well, that's what I thought.  

I was alarmed to find the 6'4 boy standing over me in the middle of the night after I had just finally fallen asleep.  He woke me up when his lips pressed against mine.  My entire body froze.

""Look,"" His deep voice quaked when he spoke.  The only thing that crossed my mind was 'Is this pansy about to cry on me?' 

Surely enough, I was correct.

""The doctors have kept us apart... you and I... we're so different, yet, I can't help but-""

""What is your problem?"" I demanded, suddenly very awake and ready to let out all the anger that had been accumulating over the past month and a half, ""You keep me up every night with your god damned screaming, you broke my doctor's leg last week and--"" I sucked in a deep breath, ""Do you even know my name?""

""Names aren't important.  I've never had one.""

My jaw dropped, ""First of all,"" I swung my legs over the side of the bed, ""You have a fucking name.  It's literally written on the white board outside of your room.  Your name is Damion.""  Fuck, even his name was over the top.

""...No one's ever known me as well as you,"" He swooped down, obviously attempting to sexually harass me once more, but I stopped him by slugging him in the jaw.  The blow was barely enough to make him stumble, yet he looked like he was about to lose his mind over it.

""THEY'VE BRAIN WASHED YOU!""

""WHAT?"" I jumped to my feet, ""What's your problem?  You get three square meals a day, twelve-hours of sleep a night and tomorrow is board-game day in the lobby! What is so horrible that you feel the need to fuck my life up?""

""You just don't understand."" His face became stone-cold, ""I'm trapped here.""

""Dude-""

""Can't you see?! If we stay here, they'll only keep us apart!  Let's leave tonight- together!""

""Uh,"" I furrowed my brows.  Was this guy for real?  ""No?""

""But why?""

""For one,"" I held up a single finger, ""I am a LESBIAN.  Do I need to spell that out for you?  Do you know what that means?  It means even if you weren't a complete psychopath you're still fucking gross.  Where do you even want to go anyways?  The world was completely wasted by nuclear bombs YEARS ago!  Does becoming a radioactive zombie really appeal to you THAT much?""

""But we... we're meant to be together, can't you-""

""God, did no one ever teach you about consent?  I'm getting a nurse.  This is harassment."" 

""If you leave now,"" His head dropped, ""You'll never see me again.""

""Good!"" I shouted on my way out the door, ""Maybe I'll get a normal neighbor.""

[WP] You are the overly average teenage neighbor of the mysteriously gifted and rebellious teen protagonist in your dystopian society and you're getting a bit tired of their crap.,averykrouse,"“For free-love, freedom, and supreme justice, are you with me lads,"" shouted Larry.

“Yes sir,” shouted the crowd.

“How about you Carl? Would you set aside your prior convictions for a better cause?” asked Larry.

“Yes whatever you say…now there was note that mentioned free donuts,” answered Carl.

Carl was an average teen who was neighbours with Larry under Dome C. Dome C was one of many large structures that sustain human life under the sea. Larry often had these secret meetings at the civic center, sponsored and advertised by the Wrotwood Daily Gazette. He often went off on rants about the dystopian society they lived in and the many rules that regulated their lives. Carl though found it funny that their society allowed people to voice these thoughts in a formal setting.

“Carl you made it… you kind of have to participate more than eating donuts,” remarked Larry.

“Eating free donuts,” emphasized Carl, who then continued, “but I guess you’re right. What do you want to talk about?”

“Let’s start with something we all can agree on. Free love, “said Larry.

Several people murmured in the background in agreement.

“Now I must admit, I’m a bit confused. Do you mean free to purchase love, love purchasing for free, or free to love who you chose?” questioned Carl.

“See you are confused…I mean free to love who I choice…I mean why should the government stop me from marrying Mary and having two dozen children,” Larry answered.

The groups then started to exhibited more pack like behavior, with a large amount of howls and whoops in some attempt of common fraternity.

“Well for one thig I’m ninety percent sure Mary is your cousin. So aside from several genetic problems the Dome is not big enough to sustain everyone having two dozen children.” explained Carl.

“Easily solved,” countered Larry, “they should expand the dome.”

 Carl took a moment’s pause to collect his thoughts before saying, “Easily said than done. It takes time, people, and resources to do what you ask. That means these resources must be dragged from other sources like food processing or electric support. And of course the other sources would suffered in quality which would make our little dome based lives worse. And even then we can only expand as far as the nearest dome.”

“You know I never thought about that…”Said a voice in the background.

“Down with the government?” questioned another voice.

Sensing he was losing the crowd Larry went to his next point, “How about freedom …you can’t disagree with that…”

The crowd shrugged in agreement, after all who does not like freedom.

“Freedom to do what?” asked Carl.

Larry quickly came out with an example saying, “Anything… Say why can’t we gather several children and have them fight one another against those from other domes?”

“Well aside from these people being children and the steep slope of fighting for amusement and fighting to the death …why would you want to antagonise the other domes?” asked Carl.

“I never said that,” said Larry who quickly came out with another example, “how about why we can’t leave the dome and go outside....”

Continued Carl, “Into the high pressure found on the bottom of the sea floor without training or special equipment. I have no idea.”

A hush silence began over the crowd. Larry was fumbling over what to say.

“Yes… well in any case we kind of lost our freedom due to harsh conditions that we live in. But the issue is being revisited every 4 years,” said Carl.

“Ah ha. Why not every year…every month or day?” exclaimed Larry.

“Because if we have a damn election every day we are just pushing more resources to pointless bureaucracy. And even then how much can a population change in one day,” answered Carl.

Larry was beginning to see people leave. Either he had to come up with some brilliant point or else his revolution would fail before it even started.

“How about supreme justice. Why do jurors and judges need to die when someone receives the death penalty?” asked Larry.

People stopped leaving as they wanted to see what Carl had to say.

“Well you got that kind of right. Yes they may die but only if the person was innocent as a sort of deterrent to using the death penalty in all cases but the extreme. Kind of eye for an eye scenario,” explained Carl.

“Well it’s not right” exclaimed Larry

“What do you mean?” questioned Carl, ‘That it’s not right to sacrifice others who sentence to death an innocent man, woman, or child. Especially if they are unwilling to wait for the other data to come in. Hell if they are that unsure they could just give a different punishment.”

After this exchange the last of hall had emptied leaving only Larry and Carl in the room.

 “Damn it. Why are you even here?” asked Larry.

“Not to knock off discussing the finer details of our society in relation to revolution but…those are really good donuts,” answered Carl.

I'm asleep in my second floor bedroom and I hear what sounds like thumping noises from my neighbor's yard. I slowly roll out of bed noticing the clock reads 3:30AM. Usually I tried to ignore the noise (I had school in the morning) but it was really starting to annoy me. I grabbed my slippers and went out the backdoor and looked through the wooden fence surrounding my yard.

In the moonlight I could see my neighbor Jack standing in his yard breathing heavily. Jack and I were both in our senior year of high school and had been neighbors since birth. Jack was a trouble maker and kept to himself while I had a good group of friends and average grades. His parents were always going away for extended business trips or something. I always figured he liked to cause trouble since he was always on his own.

Tonight I could see a different side of Jack. He looked as if he had been training. Sweat glistened on his face and arms. I watched as he walked inside his house and reappeared in a second story window. I thought, why would he go up there-- oh no. He looked towards the sky and crouched, bending his legs he jumped as hard as he could. I involuntarily yelped and clamped my hands over my mouth. I knew he was always a loner but i didn't think he was sad enough to jump. And then the incredible thing happened, Jack landed deftly on the ground unscathed resulting in the thump noise I had been hearing. 

A few thoughts crossed my mind. No one was allowed to hide their super powers. The super humans ruled the world with an iron fist, literally. The superhero, The Fist, became the leader of all super heros. During the nuclear war of 2065 the fall out mutated most humans to have super abilities. These humans and the few normal humans reproduced and realized that, like the chances of having a boy or girl, there was a fifty fifty chance of having a super human or normal human. Since everyone knew super humans needed to be kept in check to avoid super villains (I mean read any comic) the Super Alliance was created. Led by The Fist the Super Alliance kept track of superheroes since birth with tracking chips implanted in their skin. Still, some slipped through the cracks becoming villains, but were quickly destroyed by the alliance. Any non-super hero is considered a second class citizen, since the super heroes protect everyone.

In this moment I knew that I had discovered a secret super human and frankly I didn't really care. Jack turned towards the noise of my shout. ""Anne?"" He asked. I wasn't sure how he could see me through the fence but whatever. ""What's up?"" I replied. A pause and finally, ""How long have you been there?"" I quickly said, ""yeah, i saw you jump off your roof. Would you mind keeping it down, we have a test tomorrow you know?"" He took a few steps closer, ""please don't tell anyone."" I rolled my eyes, ""tell everyone my neighbor is attempting parkour at three in the morning? No one cares. Have a good night.""

The next morning I caught the bus, barely noticing that Jack wasn't there, he was usually late. At school the morning passed by in the usual fashion. I checked some flash cards for the test at lunch time. When I got to my class for the test at the end of the day I glanced at Jack's desk, still not here. I didn't really care whether he made it or not, but as I took out my cards to study a little more I looked back and there he was. In the span of a couple seconds he somehow made it from the classroom door in the front of the room where I sat, to the back corner where he sat. I shrugged, he probably got a good morning's sleep without his neighbor making noise all night. 

After school I was feeling pretty good about my test and decided to visit my favorite pizza place downtown with some friends. We sat outside near the city hall. A group of reporters had shown up and began to shout as a local super hero, Mrs. Mayhem stopped by for the weekly meeting of the super heroes. A small crowd of people started forming as Mrs. Mayhem was pelted with questions, ""how are you responding to the lack of resources for the poor non-super humans? What is your stance on the fight against super villain, Slime Man? Who are you wearing?"" She waved them away with an air of arrogance as she walked up the stairs of the city hall. I couldn't care less about what Mrs. Mayhem was wearing and turned to my pizza.

""Mayhem!"" I looked back and saw a black ski mask wearing man jump from the crowd, literally leaping above everyone else. Landing at the top of the stairs next to her he stated, ""superheroes seem to think the world revolves around them! They keep us safe, but at what cost!? Most normals live in poverty, while superheroes are treated like kings! Equality for all!"" The man seemed to disappear and then reappear beside Mrs. Mayhem and before she could react he spray painted a black X on her. Enraged, Mayhem began her usual stunt of spinning the air into a tornado, but the man promptly disappeared. My friends gaped as I took another bite of pizza wondering if I should get some fries too.

The reporters broke into a frenzy running to their cars. One of them ran into our table knocking my pizza to the ground. I couldn't believe this, I blame that ski masked guy. Reluctantly I headed home with my friends. I listened as they talked excitedly about the new super villain creatively deemed the ""Mask Man"" by the news reporters. I just wanted to eat my pizza in peace. At home I said hi to my parents and headed to my room to do homework. I opened my window and I noticed Jack in his bedroom window across from mine. 

He seemed to be training again, doing pull ups on a bar. The only strange thing was, he was wearing a ski mask, in springtime and indoors. Although I was slightly annoyed that he was clearly the man that had caused me to lose my pizza I sat down to do my homework. The next day was Saturday so I went downtown again by myself to try to get that pizza, it's  amazing. An even bigger crowd of news reporters was gathered around the city hall steps, waiting for a statement from the super heroes about the Mask Man. I was taking my pizza back to my table when The Fist himself walked up to the podium. The news reporters went wild. The Fist rarely made a public appearance, only emerging to make short speeches or put down the villains his subordinates couldn't handle. 

A news reporter asked The Fist for his reaction to the statements made by the Mask Man. The Fist responded, ""In the desperate times immediately following the Nuclear War no one questioned the super heroes stepping up to be the guardians of the new society. Now people have grown comfortable and soft with our constant protection. If anything this Masked Man is proof of the need for superheroes. Superheroes have the right, no, the divine right to rule.""

I half listened as I sat down and picked up my pizza for that first magical bite. To my horror I felt the pizza knocked from my fingers by a hurried figure. I stared at the fallen slice and felt a wave of anger surge through me. I looked up and my eyes landed on Jack. He was masked, but I had no doubt it was him. He made his way around the back of the crowd circling until he stood feet from The Fist. No one noticed him yet as I felt myself begin walking towards him. I was getting tired of his crap. I stalked up behind him as a few reporters started pointing and I ripped his mask off.

All at once cameras started flashing and people were pushing and shoving to get a closer look. I was swept off in the crowd as Jake looked wildly around. The Fist looked a bit taken back by the Mask Man's or unmasked man's sudden appearance. I lost track of what was happening finding myself at the back of the crowd. I went back to the pizza joint and enjoyed the most delicious slice. My friends began texting asking if I had seen my neighbor Jack on the news. I pretended to have not seen it, I didn't want to get mixed up in that drama. They told me The Fist had used his signature move of enlarging his fist. Jack tried to dodge the blows, but I guess all that late night training didn't pay off. With one punch The Fist knocked Jack out cold. 

Once I had finally finished my pizza I headed home reading texts the whole way.  The superheroes had moved Jack into a city hall room that blocked him from using all powers. Back in my room and a few hours later I learned they had discovered his powers were the ability to jump high, see through objects and teleport small distances. They also learned his parent's had kept his powers secret. As soon as news of his capture became public many normal humans traveled to the city hall to protest. Jack became a symbol of all the impoverished people that felt disgruntled by the elite superheroes. 

Over the next week the protests quickly turned into riots, which turned into a full scale rebellion. The rebellion led to months of talks between superheroes and normals. The superheroes realized they needed the normals just as much as the normals needed them. The normals provided much of the labor that allowed the superheroes such a lavish lifestyle. They both agreed on higher wages for normals and more meetings between superheroes and normals to bridge the class gap. As for Jack he was eventually released, because the rebellion would not end without him.

After everything has settled down I can say I am just glad I finally got my pizza and can sleep without my neighbor keeping me up.",nekokonekoyo

"[WP] Since time immemorial, dragons have been kidnapping princesses. On dragon finally wonders why.",shashwat986,"'One of the dragons on our side had been dabbling in portal magic before all this and had discovered a strange new land full of funny little flesh creatures that walked on their hind legs. He proposed that we all escape there and start over rather than continue to fight this losing war. After discussing the merits of such an idea, it was widely agreed upon but with one condition, that they leave behind something that Morningfrost would never see coming. 

'Three nights later we were ready. With a portal open behind us, all our loved ones and friends around us, and our plan in place, we set in motion our final act of defiance against the tyrannical rule of Morningfrost. Casting a massive dome of protection about our group we set about casting our parting gift; an infertility spell. Yes, there were still some dragons that refused to join either side that would be affected, but we were desperate and running out of time. 

'Just as dawn began to peak over the horizen, the rays of the sun brought to light a dark cloud in the sky before us. Morningfrost and all his minions had come to see us off. Many of us began to panic but the few voices of well seasoned elders managed to calm the bulk of us down. The spell was still a few minutes away from being caste but the protection spell would not only keep us safe from the effects but also from Morningfrost, they reasoned. Sadly, we still hadn't fully learned from our past mistakes. We had traitors in our midst. 

'With our plan all but complete and the spell almost ready to caste, our protection spell fell just as Morningfrost neared, his face twisted in a gleeful smile that dropped with murderous intent. With a full half of our numbers focused on the incantations of the infertility spell and another third just on holding the large portal open, that didn't leave very many to actually defend us. With a demeaning roar that drowned out the rising cries of terror, those that could took flight to do battle with Morningfrost in an effort to buy time knowing that they were going to their deaths. 

'Bravely those few dragons fought, albeit very shortly, it was enough. A shockwave of golden energy burst forth from our group as the spell was completed, the force of which was enough to knock Morningfrost and his minions from the sky. With our protection dome gone, we had just doomed our kind to extinction as every dragon save for a few younglings that we managed to get through the portal once we realized we had been betrayed had been rendered infertile. 

'We thought we were in the clear but we were mistaken. An unforeseen side effect of the spell had left every dragon caught by it weak. Though knocked down, Morningfrost was not out yet. He and his minions resumed their pursuit as we tried valiantly to escape. Only a third of us made it through before the portal collapsed in on itself due to our casters being attacked and slaughtered.'

Grimclaw paused and fell silent for a long time. After a while Highjumper opened his mouth to ask what was wrong when Grimclaw cleared his throat loudly. 'Anyways,' he began again. 'With our numbers so drastically reduced, and the fertile ones even fewer, we set about our new home world with a resolve to pick ourselves up off the floor and rebuild. 

'What we couldn't have known was that this world held very little in the way of magic. Our greatest assets and abilities were reduced to a mere fraction of their former power. To make matters worse, the indigenous species did not take too well to our sudden appearance in their world. They were ingenious little flesh bags, not afraid of dying to try and bring us down. You have to admire them for that. In our first year here they managed to a third of us, most of which were our fertile younglings. A decade later and we were down to only two males and a female who could reproduce and it would still be another decade before she was old enough to mate. 

'We almost made it. The flesh bags somehow found our stronghold and slew our last remaining fertile female. We thought all hope was lost. For a while there, it was. Then one bright young mind made a startling discovery a few years later. Through various experiments, he discovered that it was possible to take our infertile eggs and seed and implant them into the female flesh bags through magic. Desperate to not die out, we embraced this new way of reproducing. 

'Many of our first few attempts did not survive the process, the host either dying during the impregnating or from complications throughout and up to the actual birth attempt. Eventually we hit upon the solution when our first successful delivery came from a female of noble blood. Granted the host died shortly after giving birth for reasons we weren't sure of but what did we care? We had our first real hope of surviving in the form of a beautiful egg with a living dragon inside. 

'We took extra special care to conceal and incubate this egg in which all our hopes and dreams rested on. A year later it hatched, revealing a healthy baby dragon. A few months later, when we were sure it wasn't going to die, we began in earned our new breeding program. Sure, we still had some kinks to work out in the process as some hosts were still dying before bringing to term our eggs but we were just happy to have found something that worked. It wasn't until later that we realized our new younglings were no different that the wild predators that roamed the land. 

'Normally a baby dragon begins to show signs of higher intelligence around three years of age and as late as five years old in some extreme cases, but when the very first one reached year six and still showed no sign of higher intelligence, we began to panic. We began trying varying methods, minor tweaks in the impregnating process really, in hopes that we could produce a legitimate offspring. Unfortunately the mortality rate of the hosts skyrocketed again so we were back to square one basically. 

'We named the new breed of dragons Wyverns as there were smaller and lacked anything above a predator's intelligence. 

'And so,' concluded Grimclaw, 'here we are today, very few in numbers, dangerously low on magic, still trying to get the formula right that will allow us to successfully reproduce through the pure blood of a noble, a princess, while the flesh bags continue to hunt and kill off our less kin, the Wyvern.'",Amarynd
"[WP] Since time immemorial, dragons have been kidnapping princesses. On dragon finally wonders why.",shashwat986,"'Grandad, why do we kidnap princess's?'

Grimclaw opened his large reptilian eye, the saucer sized pupil expanding and contracting as it adjusted to the bright noon day sun. Taking in a deep breath, the sunlight shimmering brilliantly off the emerald green scales of his expanding torso, he exhaled slowly. 

'An excellent question little one.' Grimclaw's deep voice rumbled. Nearby a flock of birds took flight from the oak trees, their panicked cries filling the air. 'You will soon be of age and might as well find out now.'

Raising his head up off the green grass, the area in front of his nostrils scorched from the his hot breath, Grimclaw looked down at his grandson Highjumper regally as he prepared to impart the greatest knowledge a dragon will ever need to know. 

'Many, many millennia ago our kind used to inhabit another world. Like any civilization we had our ups and downs. We squabbled, we collaborated, we lived in relative prosperity with little real need. Our magic ran strong and flowed freely though our veins. If we desired it, we created it.' Grimclaw chuckled mirthlessly. 'Like all great stories that involve an even greater calamity, we soon entered a golden age the likes of which have never been seen, nor will be again. 

'The things we created with our magic back then...' he paused, a far away look in his golden eyes as he recalled the days of his juvenile years. Sighing sadly, he continued on. 'What we can do now is but a mere shadow of those things. Like all good things, our golden age came to an end. We had grown complacent in our prosperity and while we were blinded by our wonders, evil had crept into the hearts of some of our fellow kin. 

'We soon began to catch whispers and rumors of a small group among us that didn't agree with the way things were going. 

'No longer content to live peacefully, they began conspiring amongst themselves to overthrow our ruling council. They felt that they could do a much better job of governing our kin not as a council, but with a single ruler. Naturally we would have to pay tribute to this ruler in thanks for their wisdom in guiding our lives. 

'Their leader, Morningfrost, a massive snow white dragon just entering his prime, stood before the council proposing such an idea with eloquent speech and words dripping with honey. He was very charismatic and it was easy to see why he had garnered such a following but the council, seven elder dragons representing the seven different dragon races, were not fooled by his deceptive words. 

'They struck down his idea but it was too late. Morningfrost had known going in that the council would not accept his proposal so he had planned accordingly. No sooner had the elders dismissed the young white dragon then twenty young dragons of varying size, acting in unison, caste a containment spell over the seven elders and Morningfrost. Normally this wouldn't have been an issue for the seven elders, each one more than capable of dispelling such a thing by themselves, but Morningfrost had planned well. Woven throughout the containment spell were far more deadly spells, an isolation spell that cut off one's connection to their magic and a life leach spell. The effect was almost instantaneous on the elders but not Morningfrost. No, he had come to the meeting heavily warded against the ill effects of the spell caste. 

'What ensued next was a bloody, one sided massacre. Devoid of their magic and of failing strength and life, the seven elders were no match for the might and vigor of the much younger dragon but that doesn't mean they didn't put up a fight. One of the elders, a cunning cobalt blue female, had managed to deal the only real damage to Morningfrost in the form of three long deep scars on the left side of his face that left him blind in his left eye. 

'By the time help arrived, it was over. The rescuers stared in horror at the sight of the seven elders mangled and bloody bodies but even more so at the bloody, malicious, grinning face of Morningfrost and his twenty followers behind him. Of the ten that arrived, only two managed to escape with the news. 

'Over the next few years what took place was a viscous, bloody war that ravaged the lands, killed off thousands of our kin, and resulted in Morningfrost getting everything he wanted. Almost. You see, there were some of us that still resisted despite the overwhelming odds against us. In our hour of desperation we came up with a plan so outrageous that it actually worked. ",Amarynd

[WP] What it feels like to hold your breath for too long,AliciaWrites,"The cracks in the ice had almost reached the shore now and the noise of straining and groaning which was dying down as they ran out of territory to conquer. But I suppose now I could get down to the serious business at hand – drowning.


My skates and heavy winter clothes had dragged me to the bottom once my fingers failed to find purchase on the lakes treacherous surface, and I’d taken that last desperate gulp of air. It’s already souring in my lungs. 


Half way down I’d realised the seriousness of my situation. Like a lot of people I’d secretly always believed I’d outlive everyone I knew, the sudden realisation of my mortality – and specifically that the moment of my passing was rapidly approaching – had come as somewhat of a shock. Understandable I think.
I should’ve panicked I supposed, flailed my arms and screamed my last lungful of air out into the water - at least then the end would have come quickly. Instead everything seemed to come into focus for the first time in my life. The water was freezing, but the sensation of cold was as distant and as removed from my immediate experience as the growing fire in my lungs, and the contrast seemed almost laughable to me, except that laughing would cut short these precious few last moments, and I had something worth staying a few moments more for.


I was transfixed by the sunlight glittering off the edges of the cracks that’d now permeated the icy surface of the lake. Beautiful man, I wish I had my camera.
Now that the noise had died down and the cracks had raced their course I had a moment to consider my situation.


The surface was at least 25 metres above where I lay, probably closer to 30. The banks of the lake were much further, so if I was to survive this (impossible, but as good a way to spend my last - call it a minute - as any) I’d need to reach that hole for another breath.
Can’t be done in these skates and bulky clothes though, so off they come. 
While I fiddled with the laces of the first skate I thought about how I’d come to be here on the bottom of a lake, struggling to make numb fingers undo knots warm and flexible ones had done up.


I’d been skating on this lake for most of the winter without as much as a creak. OK, I knew it was late in the season, but the ice had been holding up particularly well this year – green and hard and unforgiving, my bruises testament to the impacts it had endured.
I was slightly surprised today when part way out I glimpsed a vaguely silvery looking shimmer near the middle of that flat glassy surface. I immediately thought it was a school of fish and resolved to catch a glimpse, increased my speed toward the centre and focussed on the patch. 
Too late I realised it wasn’t moving or shifting the way fish would, it was static and too close to the surface, and large. Much too large.


As I passed over the patch the brittle ice shattered under my weight with a whip-like crack that granted me instant recognition. Immediately I remembered what I’d been told about white ice. It was where tiny bubbles of air had gotten trapped as the ice had formed, and even at several inches thick it was brittle and weak, and most certainly wouldn’t hold up to the weight of a child – let alone my bulk.


My rate of descent had been unnatural, but the noise of those cracks I had instigated propagating their jagged way had filled my ears – pings and groans that seemed almost alive, a vaguely organic song reverberating back and forth across the lakebed. The cracks themselves catching the clean crisp rays of early spring light had dazzled my eyes, looking almost like compact and sharp, brilliant versions of the Aurora Borealis. One of the most beautiful symphonies of sound accompanied by a natural light show, all of it just for me, and the last thing I’d ever see.


Things are fuzzy now, the first skate lies beside my foot but I can’t make my fingers work anymore, the clean thinking of earlier is becoming muddled in the weeds that surround me and the sounds and lights are coming from further and further off. Why have I taken my skate off? Won’t my foot get cold? Never mind, watch the lights, listen for the song – it just might come back if you listen carefully enough.


I’m disappointed to realise that not only has the song left me but I’ve been abandoned by the light as well. I seem to be having trouble seeing anything at all. A sense of loss and a vague feeling of betrayal wash over me, the light and the song have abandoned me at the most important moment of my life, though I  can’t seem to remember why it should be so pivotable. Saddened I gaze at an ever contracting and ever dimming cone of view.


The light has just sprung back into my field of view, albeit momentarily. It’s shining off bubbles now, they race back up to where I came from, disappearing out my sight and toward I-don’t-know-where. Why they have to rush so and take the light with them is beyond me, but I’m elated to have had one last glimpse of that clear sweet light.


As the bubbles pass from the limited range of my blurred sight a numb feeling suffuses the fire in my lungs, spreading out through my chest and limbs, and all I can think of is how pretty the light is today.

[WP] What it feels like to hold your breath for too long,AliciaWrites,"Desperation: That's what Ronalde felt first.

It pierced inward like ten-thousand needles of wanting, each a stab with its own portion of primal sortie. A craving, a hunger, a frenzy: not for food or for thirst, or even lust- but action. 

Action was why that feeling showed itself within his lungs. A growing demand that he change the circumstances, until nothing in his mind seemed to hold any other rationality.

*BREATHE!*

Instinct and man scream together in their thoughts, that as a word, concept, half-felt thought in Ronalde's skull, he do so. That he breathe in, desperately wanting- or the dark grim might come to sweep him away on the shadowed sands of time. That he might fade and cease upon the seconds that ticked along with every failed beating of his chest.

But still, upon the pain and constriction at his throat- there could be no breath. Air could find no manner in which to travel, not out, not down or inside. Spots and speckles, panic and frustrated fear: His world was shrinking, and quickly, taking his strength along for the fall back to nothingness.

Ronalde could not remember his weapon now- its steel perhaps lying forgotten among the bodies and blood on the floor. Could he recollect himself, even be aware of his own thoughts in more than a frenzied blur, he might see it not two paces to his left, protruding from the green-skinned corpse draining life upon the floor: but instead, all he saw was evil. 

As he saw it, it saw him.

A smiling face of scars and sharp teeth, of rancid tongue and sickening grin that held him down with two mighty arms of coiled muscle and grit. Upon his throat there were two horrible hands, each with fingers far too long for the body which possessed them, wrapped tightly upon his throat as his own tried in pure terror to wretched them off- to no avail.

His fist freed itself from the struggle in vain: a single gauntlet covered blunt in half-polished steel. With all Ronalde's remaining strength, movement rushed out and found its purchase.  A heavy and brutal punch, that opened to fingers seeking eyes seeking-

""GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-""

In came the air! 

The gorgeous, the beautiful, the rancid air of battle and horrors. Sound, smells, shock and scream: All came in a flood with the breath, and the second gasp that followed it as the tables turned, and Ronalde threw the Goblin back and screamed with all his ancestor's heritage behind him before rushing to deliver a final blow.

The sound of the Goblin's skull hitting stone was as sickening as he might have ever imagined, but in the scene of chaos unfolding around him, Ronalde barely noticed as his hands grabbed at the nearest weapon with clumsy- almost drunken exhaustion. On the stumbling steps, he found the spear plucked free from a corpse, soon rammed through another, and then replaced by a sword, lost in a similar manner to be replaced by a broken iron blade that found itself wretched free of his grip by a brutally mangled helm and a screaming beast that had not yet realized it was dead.

""RALLY!"" A voice of his own side shouted out among the chaos, just as another monstrosity leapt at him, only to fall dead to an arrow in its skull. ""RALLY TO THE CAPTAIN!""

**BANG! BANG! BANG!** Like thunder: Creatures fell beneath the onslaught, bodies tumbling near the broken gates of the hall, blood sprayed with mist and haze to the air and walls.

""RALLY!"" A shout raised beyond that crash of sound and magics burst, more still bursting through the air with resounding and deafening effect. ""RALLY, TO ME!"" As more voices had joined- however muted. ""*RALLY TO THE CAPTAIN!*"" They demanded, as the room devolved further into all but entirely nonsensical madness. Figures swung with flashes of steel and showers of gore, a knight of no small bearing went down beneath five smaller figures- green and red upon their skin and knives seeking the slits of the mans armor. 

""No!"" As Ronalde tried in vain to pull the closest Goblin off, smashing at the creatures with the closest object at hand- a bloodied shield of Royal Crest, the others turned on him with a sudden violence; their sudden kicks and slashes throwing him backwards as he stumbled about the frenzy and into another crowd. Half-tripping upon the corpses- he could only hold the precious small thought of rational comprehension that he had fallen into hell itself.

The outpost was lost! There was no way! No manner in which so many beasts could be defeated by their numbers alone!

""GRAW!"" A lone green figure rushed him, leaping with a ruined blade more fragment than sword, blocked and pushed back only by the many hard days of training beaten into Ronalde's first-intincts. It came again, once more blocked by the shield, ringing off with a dent and then another, and then another still. As he stumbled and tripped- pushed backwards by this onslaught, the cold indifference of the stone wall finally ceased his escape, back pressed hard against the thick blocks of height and weight.

Panting and exhausted, bloodied beyond any normal recognition, Ronadle stared at the approaching Goblin and the several fellows that hand come with it, eyeing them with the hopelessness of emotion past fear. Reaching down, his hands had barely found a half-broken lance before they were lunging for him in a screaming frenzy.

""NO!"" He shouted, throwing forward the metal tipped thrust of splintered wood, running through the first, releasing it as hands tried to grappled upon his shield. ""STAY BACK!"" He shouted again, blocking another heavy attack from his left, shield returning the impact with a shoddy counter that threw the second creature off guard- just as the third came rushing in. ""STAY BACK!""

""GRAW-**BANG**"" Its scream cut short.

Ronalde's ears rang out as the third creature fell dead, chest all but burst under the unnatural force that had crushed it. Eyes unaccepting the bloodied floor, the walls, the slow and feeble motions of the death not yet taken around him: He realized the battle had ended.

A face he recognized approached, motion waving before his face as words muffled in past his ears, and a warm set of hands took him by the arms, guiding him. He felt his boots slosh and squish, he felt his balance crumble and right itself, and he saw eyes star off into the distance with grim set jaws. Many lay still, while others writhed and screamed- all with a distant sort of sound that was far from clear in Ronalde's ears.

Finally he saw a rough wooden bunk unoccupied, cloth fresh and untarnished. As soon as he had sat, soon he lay: armor and all still strapped upon his exhausted frame. Weight, thoughts, muscles, air: It all pressed on by the fading moment as he lay very still.

As his chest settled in upon its breathing, deep weight settled in place of the once felt burning, until sleep finally took him up within its heavy embrace.

[WP] Write about a character with an interesting collection,AliciaWrites,"He knocked.

He heard a yawn from within and knocked again. When there was no reply, he drew aside the papered doors and cleared his throat. The sole inhabitant of the room curled up as sunlight hit its form, pulling a sleeve over its face. 

""Ugh...what time is it?"" 

The small bundle of cloth amidst the papers yawned again.

""It's time for breakfast, young master."" he said dryly, ""Have you been working all night again, Akira?"" 

The small child shifted slightly, sitting up. At some point some of the old scrolls he'd been working on had fallen over him, forming a sort of nest of parchments and he took a while to crawl blearily out of the self-made bed.

""N-no, I wasn't."" Akira said, a bit unconvincingly. ""I, um, woke up early and started working later."" 

He almost smiled as he noticed Akira's appearance, ""You've got ink all over your sleeves, young master,  and you didn't eat dinner last night."" 

The child blushed, ""I knew I forgot something!"" 

He looked at the child, noting the pale, thin frame and the sleep-ringed eyes, ""You've got to take care of yourself better. It's not healthy to skip your meals, child. Look here, the cook has even prepared breakfast for you and the Lady."" 

Akira brightened visibly at the thought of food, stomach growling audibly, but he slouched back after a moment, biting his lip.

""I- I don't think I should eat now."" his gaze travelled back to his scrolls, ""I'm so close to devising that new blueprint the Lord wanted. I just have to write down a few more ideas..."" 

""Young master,"" he frowned, ""You should get something to eat first before you faint again."" Akira frowned back, looking like he was about to protest, ""The Lord wouldn't be pleased if you were to collapse when he visits you.""

Akira's gaze fell. ""I suppose you're right."" 

The child took his hand as he stood, following him quietly down the corridors of the fortress towards the main dining chamber. 

The Lady was long since gone, of course. She did not like the child's presence. Akira, did not notice, too busy chowing down everything that had been laid out before him. 

Later, he brought the child down to the pond in the courtyard to feed the fish. 

""Do you think the Lord will visit me soon?"" Akira looked up at him. ""It's been a while since he's done anything other than reply to my letters."" 

He did not speak for a moment as he considered his answer, ""The Lord is a busy man. He has to manage this entire island after all.""

He wondered whether Akira would be any happier knowing that the Lord requested reports from him to monitor the child's progress. Not that he was allowed to speak of such things of course. 

The child nodded, cheeks colouring, ""I- I know that. Just...well, I...I just hope he is pleased with my work."" 

He could answer that easily, at least. ""I am sure your collection of devices have been useful to his efforts to prosper the land."" 

""...ok."" 

He took the child's hand, leading him back to the child's room before he could try to run back on his own. 

""I don't want to eat dinner tonight."" the child told him, ""Make sure I won't be disturbed by anyone. I want to finish this device by today."" 

""As you wish, young master."" 

He withdrew, hesitating for a moment as he looked around the chamber.

It used to be filled with drawings. Akira used to love drawing when he was very young. He had taught the child how to hold a brush, how to make ink. Akira had talked a lot about travelling some day, he had wanted to draw new plants and animals in distant lands. 

Now the chamber was filled with parchment scrolls, running up along the walls and across the few tables that Akira had allowed inside. Complex diagrams littered every space available, sometimes cramming into narrow columns or painted so closely they were invisible from afar. 

It was a frenzy of innovation, that peculiar genius that struck those of the Lord's line manifested to an extreme degree. It was a measure of desperation, to break free of the bounds of a current reality and forge a better one in its place. 

He shuddered a little on the inside. 

It was not the room of a child.

[WP] Beverly Hillbillies but in reverse. A wealthy family from California is forced to move to a rural town in the South.,GuyoFromOhio,"At one time in the not so distant past, the name Clampett was synonymous with extravagant wealth and fortune. As descendants of the oil tycoon Jedediah Clampett, they were, from birth, the owners of riches the common man couldn’t fathom. The patriarch was Jed Clampett III, the great grandson of Jed the first. He assumed control of the oil empire after the death of his father, having worked with him virtually his entire life however the lap of luxury eventually takes its toll. His wife Elizabeth, along with his son Jed IV, and his sister Charlotte, enjoyed a lifestyle most will never know and few will ever sustain. Spending was constantly increasing along with the risks they took and the drugs they enjoyed. This was never a problem until the IRS took an interest in them. 

The Day of Judgment finally arrived on a seemingly typical morning. Jed III was in his office enjoying a cup of coffee and casually flirting with his secretary when his phone started ringing. It was the front desk. Their tone was a hurried panic and his worst fears were becoming a reality. Decades of mishandling funds and undocumented spending finally caught up with the Clampett’s as their entire corporate headquarters was flooded with federal agents who obtained thousands of incriminating documents and their once great empire came crashing down. Fortune was no longer on the side of the fallen dynasty and the life and wealth they once enjoyed were no more. Left with nothing but the clothes on their back and whatever else they could grab, shame and embarrassment forced them out of the comfort of the city. They loaded up the truck and moved to the South...rural that is...trailer parks and dairy farms.

They found a quaint single wide in a trailer park to start their lives over, quite literally from scratch. Their fortune was no more but their thirst for luxury could never be quenched. Jed III luckily avoided a prison sentence by forfeiting all of his assets so he was forced to find work wherever he could in this new and unfamiliar world. With all of his experience in managing a multi-billion dollar corporation, he quickly found a nice gig as the day manager of a local farm. It paid the bills and gave them a little extra that they would use to find something resembling the luxury they once knew. Elizabeth and Charlotte made the best of their situation by creating quasi-fashionable outfits compiled from Goodwill and spent the days relaxing on Walmart floats in their above ground pool they erected behind the trailer. Jed IV could no longer afford the flurries of cocaine that he was used to so he found a more budget-friendly alternative in the wild world of methamphetamine. 

In their former glory, the Clampetts were renowned for their superfluous parties with big name bands and endless bottles of only the finest champagne. Socialites from near and far would attend in hopes of gaining favor with the family or simply finding the next step of the social ladder. These events were but a distant memory now but their appetite for them still lingered. Comprised of Jed III’s coworkers, Jed IV’s tweaker friends, and the ladies’ friends from the hair salon, their new trailer park parties were a far cry from what they were used to but they made due. Instead of live bands, music was provided by Jed IV’s bitchin truck system. The libations were no longer champagne, but they did manage to find the champagne of beer: Miller High-Life. Just like in California, they were still THE family to know, crowds (of a slightly different cloth) still flocked to their parties, and everyone still craved their affection. I guess what they say is true: You can take a family out of the grandeur but you can’t take the grandeur out of a family.

"[WP] Time has forgotten music, Then one day someone stumbles across The Beatles: Abbey Road.",Hammyisstuff,"“John pissed his bed again, sheets are in the wash,” I said, buttoning my shirt.  Marilyn's acknowledging half smile weighed heavier on me this morning – another sizzling coal within.  “Alright,” I nodded, “off to work now.”

I spent my commute imaging the reprimand I’d receive for my third tardy this week.  The fantasy of my responses made the ride feel shorter.  Interrupting a particularly brutal scenario, the hollow subway alert, “Midtown number four.”

Jalen’s suit was crisper than usual.  Knowing what he was about to say made me want to hit him before he had the chance, “Shit, Alton.  It’s after 9!”

“Yes, sir.  It was a tough morning at home, sir.”

“Just get to your station,” his arms shot up and turned me toward my office.

I made my way down the white LED hallway, each step feeling heavier.  I hated my boss, hated my job, hated so many things.

“Breathe deep,” I whispered to myself. 

I turned into my office and cringed as the lights shot on.  “Good Morning, Alton,” Cynthia chimed.

“Yeah, sure,” I blurted.

Without probing, Cynthia continued, “Shall we continue with file 3Q-504?”

“Yes.”

The file, which I should have finished yesterday, was brightly glaring at me from the opposite wall.

I was working my way through data backups from the 23rd century.  My job, which was growing increasingly overwhelming, was to recover historical production and sales data for Transcorp.  To be honest, most of the drives I analyzed were filled with garbage – mirrored data, porn, shoddy presentations, mundane project correspondence.

The morning dragged.  My lunch, which was delivered ten minutes late and just in time to for Jalen’s time management lecture, was cold by the time I got to it.  The reheated coffee on my desk was the only thing keeping me sane.

“File 3Q-505,” Cynthia boomed.  Startled, I bumped my desk, sending my coffee tumbling toward the concrete floor.  The metal cup struck the concrete tiles with a sharp ping.  Its contents sprayed across the floor.

“Goddammit,” I shouted.

“Please, Alton.  No need for abusive language.”

“Shut the hell up,” I shot back.

“Alton, please.  Can we continue?”

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath to steady myself, “Yes.”

Cynthia continued, “Alton, file 3Q-505 content is not in a recognized format.  Permission to run external format analysis?”

“Granted.”

“File analysis complete – encryption broken. Analysis shows that the file contents may be illegal.  Shall I proceed?”

I hadn’t heard this warning before. “Yes,” I blurted emphatically, “what is it?!”

“File One-A, The Beatles, Abbey Road.”

[WP] You summon a Demon to kill your arch rival. He returns with a missing arm and an apology.,Joseph_Plays,"Some days it doesn't pay to get out of bed.

I'm amazed that there isn't a groove worn into the wood floor of my lab.  I pace constantly when I'm mad at someone, and these days, I'm almost always mad.  

The new research mage has flat stomped on my last nerve.  I've had it.  There's something about her that simply grates against my soul.  Her constant snide digging comments raise my hackles as if she'd insulted my wife.  Today was it.  As I put the finishing touches on a complex binding, I faintly registered the door to my office open.  I admit, I should have been more wary of an unannounced visitor; but I was so close!!  Four more carefully measured lines.  FOUR!!!

Then a gush of red flooded over my carefully procured and prepared parchment.  Everything.  Ruined.  RUINED!!!  I looked up to see her grinning face and false chirpy voice looking down at me.  The goblet still in her hand.  'Oops.' 

She said OOPS.  She ruined 6 months worth of careful work and said oops.  And then just walked out.  I was too stunned and enraged to even move.

That is IT!  Fine.  You want it that way?  You got it sweetheart.  I achieved this rank for a reason.  I pulled up the rug in the middle of the room to unveil a meticulously designed pentagram.  The black and red candles went to their points almost on their own.  I called.  He answered.

It was a perfect representation of a demon.  Red skin, perfect horns, cruel face.
And an iPhone??

I finished the summoning anyway.  Best to be careful.  Then cleared my throat to get his attention.  He blinked and looked up, then around, obviously a bit startled. 

'Oh, hi.  What do you want?'.  He blinked again, refocusing from the phone.
'I want you to go find her, kill her, then bring me her eyes as proof.'  I focused hard and projected her image and location to him.  

He sighed.  'Fine.  hopefully this won't take long.  I think I'm about to get some from Tinder'.  A puff of brimstone and he was gone.  and was back in moments. missing an arm, his phone, and looking even more startled than before.  Then a torrent of unimaginable profanity poured from his mouth.

'What the hell happened!?'  I shouted at him.

With one last curse he looked at me, and, I swear!, blushed.
'I missed.' He says and looks down at the floor.

'You missed.'  I responded flatly.

'Yea.  I missed, and reformed with my arm in a stone wall.'

'How the...'

'Well, I thought I could get off one more DM before I got there.'

'One more DM?  Wait.  You were TEXTING and vaporizing at the same time??!'  My jaw almost hit the floor.

'Yea. And um, well.  She isn't dead.  So, um.  Sorry?  And, could you get my phone for me?  And my arm I guess.'

"[WP] In preparation for your 30th class reunion you flip through your 80s high school yearbook and are flooded with memories of Trey Callahan, the weird kid who used phrases like ""LOL"", ""Meme"", and ""Edge Lord"". His whole family vanished after graduation, and you wonder whatever happened to him.",Kancho_Ninja,"""Huh,"" Lewis Johnson mumbled to himself, turning the page. This slight exertion of his vocal cords was more than painful, given the bad case of strep throat his daughters seemed to have given him.

For the past half hour he had been resting in an Ikea reclining chair, flipping through his senior yearbook. The chair was produced almost as cheaply as the small paper-bound handbook, but both were still quite nice to him. The inexpensiveness almost added a quality of its own. 

Glancing at the bottom-right of Page 33, he gave an inward sigh of internal cringe. *Dear Lord,* he thought, *that kid was so* weird, *wasn't he?* Lewis didn't quite remember what was weird about him, but he just remembered that something was terribly so. Most people didn't seem to like Trey Callaghan, which was entirely justified.

He thought he'd heard something on the local news about him and his family. What was it, again? Was his brother kidnapped or something? Lewis recalled it being something bad like that, but he wasn't entirely sure what. He chose to call one of his old friends from the time. He didn't often talk to his high school friends, as he moved to Kansas City with his then-girlfriend almost right after his years of school ended. 

*1-515-555-0199.* He entered the numbers wrong once, then corrected his mistake. The phone made three buzzing tones, then connected him to his old friend Kyle Mickey.

*""Hey, there. Who's this?""*

Lewis took a sip of water and spoke as clearly as he could. ""It's Louie. What's up with you?"" 

*""Oh, not much. Just taking care of the house and all that. I've been staining my deck this new shade of beige, but I'm pretty sure the chemicals are gonna give me cancer. Well, more than I already have, at least.""* A muffled, though heavy, cough came through the other end of the line.

Lewis chose chose not to ask about that particular matter. He figured he'd deal with that at the reunion. ""Yeah, those chemicals are kinda dangerous. You going to the reunion?""

*""Sure thing. Not sure who else is going, though. Hopefully Lexi, though. Damn, remember her?""*

""Yeah, I sure do. Hey, I was wondering if you knew what happened to Trey Callaghan?""

*""Oh, christ, that weird prick? I hope he grew out of that phase. I'm pretty sure he's a time traveler, or elsewise an alien. Yeah, didn't his whole family disappear right after graduation? I swear I saw that all over the news. A little bit suspicious, I think.""*

Lewis recalled that they did bully Trey quite a bit. Lewis himself had grown out of it, but quite apparently not Kyle. ""Yeah, I think so. Well, I was just calling to make sure you were going. See you there."" Lewis tapped the End Call button. He supposed it was rude, but he couldn't stand talking another moment. It hurt far too bad. 

He reclined in his chair a few more degrees and thought for a moment. It was a little suspicious, he thought. Trey was strangely violent, he remembered. Lewis figured it would be fine, though.

***

A week passed, and Lewis' strep has almost dissipated. He found himself sitting in the front seat of his 2007 Corolla, its drab grey paint feeling a little depressing.  About two minutes remained in his drive; he spent those two minutes thinking about who he'd see there. The last class reunion he'd been to was ten years ago; come to think of it, there weren't all too many people there. He couldn't quite recall how many there were twenty years ago, but it didn't much matter.

He glided his car into the nearly-empty parking lot and parked. The walk to the gym doors was a painful one with his arthritis, one of the many frustrating pains of age. He swung open the dense steel-plated door and smiled as he recognized the high school gym he'd won so many games in, seen so many pep rallies in. The memories were nice, but unfortunately they were just that- memories. 

Lewis saw a hardly-recognizable Kyle in the center of the gym, lining up chairs along the center circle. Was it just him? Or had they just been early? Lewis shouted as well as he could over to Kyle. ""Kyle! Are we early?""

""I think so,"" came a somewhat quieter reply as Kyle walked over to the door by Lewis. ""Nobody else is here. I thought it was at six, though?""

""I had thought the same. Maybe we got the wrong day- it's the 27th today, right? Monday?""

""Yeah, I think."" Kyle checked his smartphone. ""Yeah, either we screwed up really bad or everyone else did.""

Lewis heard the faint flowing of air, as though it were windy inside, but the A/C certainly wasn't on. He didn't remember those acoustics in the gym. ""Is it just me,"" he asked, ""or does this gym have really weird acoustics?"" The sound grew louder. ""It sounds like a baby tornado in here.""

""I don't remember it being like that. How much do you wanna bet everyone else is here, but they're just playing sound to screw with us? I'm putting five bucks on Trey.""

""Not taking that bet,"" Lewis replied with a slight chuckle. 

*Ping.*

A loud, high-pitched sound rung out around the gym, followed a second later by the heavy sound of metal against the hard floor. Lewis glanced to the center circle, and saw- inexplicably- another person in the room. 

The man- who Lewis guessed to be Trey- had skin speaking of a ninety-year-old, but the form of someone a third that. The old man's smile was a checkerboard of missing and present teeth. His curious clothing of silver and gold blended with the bright colors of the gym. Behind him was a [machine](http://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/the_time_machine_large_01.jpg) that looked right out of a comic book. In the device's cockpit, Lewis saw someone dressed in what appeared to be Roman legionnaire's gear. 

Trey stepped out and looked to the two men, his smile fading. ""Oh, dear. Am I late?""

""Beep beep beep.""

I woke up with a start. Clearly someone had replaced my alarm clock and it's wrenching buzzing sound. Frankly, however, I was glad: the gentle beeping seemed to rise and fall to wake me up in the most gentile way possible.

I made a mental note to talk to my roommate.

Then forgot the mental note as I looked around the room. It wasn't just the alarm clock that had changed. The entire room had changed; the bed was clearly softer but somehow firmer where I needed it. The room itself was in shades of blue; a calming color which somehow made waking up easier. A dresser sat in the corner with my clothes laid out. In the adjacent bathroom, I heard the shower automatically turn on.

After taking my shower and getting dressed, I could smell the smell of breakfast and I followed it to a small apartment-sized dining room. It had been neatly laid out: oatmeal with a touch of brown sugar and some fruit slices, and a couple of strips of what smelled like bacon but what looked like some sort of turkey substitute. 

If I had died and gone to heaven, I thought, then I'd need to talk to God about the food. Because breakfast without two eggs and a side of pork sausage and coffee? Nope. 

As I finished my bacon strips (which didn't taste all that bad, considering), I heard a knock on the door. ""Come in.""

Inside my room stepped a man and a woman. Both appeared to be wearing white coats, and one carried a clipboard, scribbling notes. The woman asked, ""How are you feeling?""

""Where the hell am I?""

----

Another room, painted white. A mirror on one wall, but I could see the faint glow of a couple of lights; clearly the mirror was one-way. Cameras were in the corner; if it weren't for the comfortable chairs, tastefully appointed table and a small fireplace giving the appearance of a living room, I'd swear it was a police interrogation room.

Across from me three people sat; the woman from this morning, and two others; another man and woman, one typing into what looked like a small tablet computer.

The man started: ""I wish to apologize for what is happing to you. Approximately once a month we select a subject from the alternate Earth in order to serve as a sociological control when making decisions for governing our world. If you like, we have prepared a short video on the tablet next to you (gesturing to the table next to my chair, on which looked like a much thinner iPad Pro), which will help explain much of what is going on.""

----

The video seemed narrated by the same guy who voiced Darth Vader. He explained that in the late 1400's, the House of Plantagenet united determined to bring about a better world. The War of the Roses never took place; instead, the Renaissance was spurred on as the rulers of Europe turned to the wisest advisors they could find to help them make better laws. These scientists, mathematicians and philosophers helped to provide a framework which led the entire world to a new era, one where people are healthy, happy and live in peace and harmony.

To bolster these points, images of clean cities crowned with tall, white smooth buildings slid cleanly by. There were no cars; instead, the cities appeared to be designed around a walkable inner core, and mass transit points leading to other cities and to countryside parks and manufacturing facilities. The air seemed clean, the clouds puffy and white, and the video concluded with faces of smiling, happy, multiculturally balanced array of people, all seemingly happy and healthy.

The video ended.

""I'm impressed,"" I responded at the end of the video.

----

""So let us start with the questions,"" one of the women asked.

She held up her own tablet, and an array of pleasing pastel colors showed on the screen. ""Which color makes you feel productive?""

""Sorry?""

""If you found yourself in an office cubical, which one of these colors would make you feel more productive?""

""I still don't understand the question.""

""That's okay, we'll come back to that question."" Swipes finger on tablet, another array of color choices comes up, deeper and ranging from black to dark rich reds and blues. ""If you were buying a bicycle, which color would you choose?""

""Wait, why are you asking me?""

""Because we wish to compare your choices against test subjects from our own world, in order to draw a correlation between color choices and their ability to satisfy emotional needs.""

""Why don't you ask the people who live here? Why not give them a choice?""

The man, who had been watching our exchange, frowned. ""Choice is irrelevant.""

""What?""

""We have achieved our high level of peace and wealth by the scientific method, not through the chaos of the marketplace of individual choice.""

I stared at the man across from me, dumbfounded.

----

I was staring at the floor in my well-appointed interrogation room. After a long pause I slowly looked up. ""Why do you say that choice is irrelevant?""

""Just that,"" the man smiled. ""We found long ago that if left to the people's own devices, the long array of small choices they make often lead to larger choices. It's what you would call the 'butterfly effect'; one person's discontent with the size of his room leads to a group of people expressing discontent over some other imagined failure--and that eventually leads to groups of people rebelling, which eventually leads to war.""

He leaned forward to drive his point home. ""We know, for example, the series of wars your people fought over the past 500 years: the genocides, the exterminations. We have largely avoided these failures, the extinction of the Native Americans on your home continent, the pogroms against the Jews, Armenians and Gypsies in your Europe. And we've done this through the careful scientific study of people, to limit choice to those things we have proven to maximize happiness, health and productivity.

""Take, for example, our cities. We have determined that the best way to organize our cities is by increasing the walkability score of most neighborhood zones, to allow people to travel effortlessly to the restaurants or entertainment centers of their choice without having to use the self-propelled gasoline-powered engines of your world which are now choking your air, or the horse drawn carts which polluted your streets.""

I stopped him. ""How do you know so much about my world.""

""Centuries ago, an accidental discovery allowed us to open a portal to your world. Since then we have been observing how your people live, borrowing inventions from your world and expanding upon them, perfecting them to allow us to improve the health of our own citizenship.""

""Wait, why do you need to borrow inventions from our own world? If you are lead by the smartest mathematicians and scientists of your world, why do you have to borrow inventions from ours?""

The man shifted uncomfortably in his chair. ""This has been the subject of a century-long research project. It's part of the reason why you are here.""

""I don't understand.""

""Our scientists don't understand why technological advances take place in your world but not in ours at the same pace. It's something we've been studying for a century, and it led us to pull people from your world as control subjects to figure out why there are gaps in productivity.""

I thought about the problem for a while, and hit upon an idea that I first encountered in college in an economics class. I carefully organized my thoughts.

""Have you considered your assumptions are wrong?""

""How so,"" the man asked.

I paused, picking my words carefully. ""Well, take your assumption about walkability scores. Why are walkability scores important?""

""Because,"" he neatly responded, ""they help increase the happiness of people by reducing the frictions of obtaining and maintaining individual transportation vehicles.""

""But on our world we have a car culture where people enjoy buying and maintaining their own cars.""

""Irrelevant,"" he responded. Clearly he'd been down this line of reasoning before with someone else. ""Our own cost-benefit analysis show the loss of a car culture is outweighed by the global atmospheric health of our world.""

""But how does that affect the square footage of the apartments in which people live?""

That stopped him for a second. The woman typing away at her computer looked up.

""That's also irrelevant.""

""But is it?"" I asked. ""How much square footage do people in this city live in?""

""We reserve 100 square feet--around 10 meters square--per person in our city. But we've carefully appointed that space so as to make maximum usage of the space we reserve.""

""Do you live in the city? Or you?"" I asked the woman who was previously asking me color questions. ""Or you?"" I asked the woman with the computer.

The man responded. ""No; I live in an estate on the fringes of the city.""

""And how large is the apartment in which you live?""

""I live in a house.""

""Okay,"" I asked, annoyed. ""How big is the house in which you live?""

""It's around 1,800 square feet.""

""Why do you deserve such a large house?""

The man shifted, uncomfortably. ""It has been scientifically demonstrated that for people who are engaged in cognitive work, having lower ambient noise levels maximizes productivity. It also helps when raising the next generation of scientific leaders.""

He sat back and continued. ""Don't be surprised. It's no different in your world. Do you see a lot of share croppers growing up to be CEOs, or children of factory workers becoming world-class scientists?""

""But that's not the point,"" I replied. ""My point is, your assumptions are faulty.

""Take your assumptions about walkability. At the bottom of the stack of scientific research and reports you start with an assumption about how people would be happiest walking to work. You have no evidence that everyone would be happiest this way, and in fact, when I point out that some may choose to drive--and do so for the sheer joy of driving--you in fact dismiss it.

""But why do you dismiss it? Then you continue that people are living in compact living conditions even smaller than the most densely populated cities in my world, while you yourself don't live under those conditions. I presume on the assumption that this is the most scientifically superior arrangement possible.""

I paused, visibly angry.

""Do you know why you have to borrow inventions from our world?"" I asked.

The man simply stared at me. 

""Because you believe choice is irrelevant. And in that simple assumption, that you can arrange your world in the most scientifically and aesthetically balanced way possible, you have eliminated centuries of individuals who choose to tinker with their world to make it better.

""Take the invention of the refrigerated railroad car which helps move food around the world. Did you know it was invented by the child of a fruit farmer in California?""

""Yes,"" the man stopped me, ""but if he had lived in our world he could have done so much more than just invent the refrigerated railroad car.""

""But did you invent the refrigerated car in your world? Or did you have to borrow it from ours?""

""We borrowed it, but that's not relevant.""

""But it is!"" I exclaimed. ""You never gave your fruit farmers the choice to be something else.""

Our discussion was interrupted by what sounded like thunder in the background, loud enough to shake the building. The glow above the computer of the woman who was transcribing our interaction turned red, and she stood up and left the room. 

""What was that?"" I asked.

""A group of malcontents, don't worry about them. We have a research project studying them to figure out how to increase their happiness.""

""No, I mean the explosion.""

""Oh, I suspect some of the malcontents got ahold of some explosives and set them off. Don't worry; we are ready for them.""

""Really?"" 

""Yes. We should be able to clear out the bodies and repair the building we are in. But for your safety we'd like to get you back to your room and back into your universe.

""Besides,"" he continued, ""I don't think you make a good study subject after all, given your own apparent sympathies.""

I smiled. ""So much for your perfect, scientifically balanced world.""",w3woody
[WP] In a world of magic healers are the most powerful of mages and only a few of them exist. You have just discovered your healing powers.,Phoenix25552,"From my place on the front porch, sitting in the white rocking chair that complained with each rock, I watched my baby brother play with the overly aggressive neighbor on our dry farmland. 
Concern molded my features into an overprotective mother goose as baby John, who wasn't so much of a baby anymore; wrestled with the older boy who lived four acres down. 
The boy, Travis, meant no harm. He was eight and John was six; the age gap was all too noticeable in the difference of height and strength between the two boys. He played rougher and expected more from the littler boy, and I had already spoken sharply to him twice about playing nicely. I was trying to refrain from doing it again. 
""C'mon, John! Tackle me again!"" 
""I can't, you're too fast!"" My baby brother pouted, and I bit back the urge to call the game quits and take John back inside. 
""I won't be too fast this time, honest! C'mon, tackle me!"" 
I watched John's face twist into attempted fury, and raw determination etched in every frowning line in his baby features. Crouching low for only a second, his back foot launched him into a quick sprint before his small body collided with the older boy, knocking him back a few steps. 
To my dismay, and no doubt John's, the boy did not fall. I raised my hands to clap for him anyways when he was suddenly thrust from Travis in a vicious throw that tossed his little body like a rag doll to the ground; slamming his head into a sharp rock sticking out from the dirt.
""John!"" I gasped, and leaped from the rocking chair, sprinting towards the body that made no move to stand. 
""John!"" I screamed again, pushing passed the horrid boy who stood dumbfounded, staring down at his victim with an expressionless face. 
My knees collided with the Earth as I fell beside my baby brother, rolling him over onto his back and into my arms. A horrified cry escaped my lips as the familiar face lay hidden beneath hot, sticky blood. His eyes did not open, his mouth did not move. 
I panicked. There were no doctors close enough to arrive in time to save him. There was nothing I could do, I wouldn't know where to begin! 
""Can...can I do anything?"" A sheepish voice came from behind me. The sound of that boy's voice twisted my face into a burning rage. I wanted to kill him. 
""No!"" I screamed, cradling my baby brother to my chest and standing to my feet; swaying beneath the weight of him. ""You rotten boy! Go home!"" 
""I'm sorry..."" He spoke again, contrite, scared. I didn't care, I moved past him roughly, carrying John's limp body up the stairs of the porch and into the house. 
Inside the kitchen, I laid him gently on the counter, knocking plates and glasses to the floor that shattered upon impact. 
Grabbing a clean rag from a nearby drawer, I soaked it beneath the water in the sink while applying a dry one to the bleeding wound above his eye. I traded the rags out once in awhile, cleaning the blood from his face with the wet cloth, and reapplying the dry cloth to his forehead. 
This continued until the bleeding lessened. I managed to wipe away most of the blood around the wound to get a better view, and nearly fell in horror at the site of the hole in his skull; the noticeable divot in his head that indicated his skull had broken. 
The blood drained from my face, my heart pounded so heavily against my ribs, I thought I might faint. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't think. 
I dropped the rag and stared at the tiny body that breathed unevenly, shallowly. I wrapped my arms around him once more and sunk to the ground, careful to mind his head. 
""John..."" I groaned in agony, holding him so close to me I thought I might break him. ""Oh God, John... please."" I cried a cry that was raw, foreign, unfamiliar to my ears. My tears fell on his face, leaving clean trails in the drying blood that continued to slowly seep from the wound. 
My body trembled violently in fear and disbelief as my mind tormented me with the thoughts I couldn't push away. 
He's so young.
He's all you have. 
You had one responsibility. 
You let him die. 
No, no, NO! - My thoughts screamed back. He would be okay, it would be okay. I wasn't alone yet, I could save him. I lifted my head from the crook of his neck and stretched my arm over my head for the phone sitting on the kitchen island. 
I could barely reach it, my fingernails scratching at the coiled cord until the phone fell from the receiver. I scrambled to pick it up from the floor, and called the only person in the area I knew who could help him. 
""Hello?""
""Ned! Ned, it's Emily! I need you to come here, John fell down and hit his head, there's a lot of blood, he's not waking up, I think he's seriously hurt, and-""
""Emily,"" A whisper, barely audible, like a faint sound carried by the breeze, drifted in my ears from below. My eyes flicked down, the phone forgotten in my hand. ""Emily."" 
Baby John stared up at me, eyes bright, wound disappeared, blood gone, breathing, ALIVE. 
""John?"" Relief, and confusion washed over me. But... how? I hugged him to my chest, gripping at him frantically as I cried once again, joyfully, triumphantly. 
""Ahhhh, Emily staahhhppp."" His muffled voice rose from my shirt as his arms tried to push me away. 
""John!"" I pulled back to look at him. ""How are you here! What happened?"" 
""What..? I dunno..."" He looked confused, uninterested. He didn't seem to remember any of it. ""Why is there so much broken glass on the floor..? Where's Travis?"" He pulled away from my limp grasp, staring into my dumbfounded expression. ""You okay..?""
""I, uh... Yes. I'm so happy you're okay."" 
""Hey!"" Suddenly he was on his feet, glass crunching beneath his shoes, staring out the window as the sound of approaching tires could be heard on the gravel. ""Looks like Ned's pickup! Let's go say hi!"" He was out the door before I could stop him. I stood and watched from the kitchen window as Ned rushed from his truck and ran to John, nearly colliding with the boy.
I watched as Ned brushed the hair from John's brow, studying his forehead for the wound that should have been there, but wasn't. 
Confused, Ned stood. I watched his face as he turned and met my eyes through the window. He looked grim, confused, serious, in awe... 
And I knew it could only mean one thing. ",littlelightpole
"[WP] You are walking down the street one day and find a disposable camera with the film entirely used. Curious, you get the pictures developed. The store attendant seems to be uneasy when giving you the photos and once you look, it's obvious why..",RavenClawedd,"""You sure you want these?"" Pricks of anxiety pinched their way up my spine as the man stared at me suspiciously. His yellowed fingers held an envelope filled with the developed pictures from the camera I'd found.

""Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I have paid for these after all."" I glanced up at the dusty clock on the wall impatiently.

""No, it's no trouble."" The man said, pulling open the drawer with his free hand. ""I can give you a full refund.""

Despite my irritation, I feigned my best smile and outstretched my hands in objection. ""I'd really just like my pictures, thanks.""

The man paused as his arm outstretched involuntarily. He swallowed hard as he handed them over. ""Of course. I'm sorry. Here you go.""

I thanked him again before he hurried through the hanging door beads behind him. Despite the humming of a spinning ceiling fan, the shop was sickly hot and I could feel a thin veil of sweat forming on my body. I turned and walked out the shop as the heat begun to become unbearable.

As I left the shop, a cool breeze feathered my cheeks and I breathed a sigh of relief. Clutching the envelope in my hand, I crossed the street quickly, avoiding the oncoming traffic. A cacophony of car horns sounded as I ignored the profanities from incensed drivers and scrambled into my car parked on the other side of the busy main road.

""Okay, let's see here."" I said quietly to myself. I flicked open the envelope and emptied the pictures into my lap. The paper felt warm against my bare legs as I slowly collected the freshly developed photos into a neat pile in my hands. 

I flipped the pictures over and felt my blood turn cold. The first picture was me. From three days ago when I was playing on my front lawn with the kids. 

The second, third and fourth were all blurry close up shots of my son where the camera had been zoomed from a distance. The smiles made me shiver in spite of the heat and as my breathing quickened, I found myself flicking faster through the pictures. All of them were pictures of my family from a distance. In the garden, eating dinner and even blurry images of me bathing the children. All of them reflected light from the glass panes of the window at different times of the day. I threw each to the ground in disgust but stopped as I stared wide eyed at the last picture. It trembled in my hand.

 It was a picture of the whole family only my face had been blurred out. In its place, a smiley face scribbled messily in red pen with the words 'When you're gone, this will be me'.

*The man who agreed to speak to me - one John Sykes, age 25, gender male - arrives looking nervous. He's glancing around the room, and it takes some coaxing to get him to settle down and take a seat. It's clear that he feels agitated.*

**Hi John, I hope you're ready to begin as requested?**

Oh... yes, yes of course. Whenever you're ready.

**Tell me when it started. Where did you find the camera?**

Well it was on Saturday morning of last week. I, uh, went out to get some milk and found the camera outside my porch. Uh, I had no idea what it was, so...

*He shrugs his shoulders, then takes a sip of water from a glass provided.*

I took it and tried to look through the photographs, but - it was one of those, uh, disposable ones. My curiosity got the better of me, I suppose, and I took it to, uh, get the pictures developed.

**If I may ask how the store attendant acted? Was there any unusual behaviour?**

*John shuffles around in his chair. He's sweating lightly.*

He, uh, was freaking out a little. He just slid them over to me and looked at me like I was an alien - I didn't understand why until I, uh, opened the envelope. And, well... I couldn't bring them here.

*John looks down at his fingers and starts to pick one of his nails. Something is clearly bothering him.*

**Why couldn't you bring them?**

Because...

*He's definitely sweating profusely. He seems reluctant to speak at first, but then he continues.*

Because the photos weren't normal. The first one? It was, uh, my mother. It had been taken around a year ago, when she took me to Spain for a holiday. We'd gone into the swimming pool and, uh, it was great fun! Great fun...

**Did you bring your mother along today? Does she know about the photo?**

That's the thing - she died a month after it had been taken. Uh, a freak accident with a white yacht. She got crushed underneath it.

*There's a moment of silence. John appears to be going pale, and he breathes loudly before continuing.*

I did some research on some of the other, uh, people in the photos. There were sixteen in total - lots of either people or pets. Uh, one was of a couple just down the road from me. I asked their parents and showed them the photo; turned out it had been taken exactly a month before their deaths. They, uh, were involved in a car crash. Both of their airbags failed to activate, and they cracked their skulls against the dashboard.

The next ten were all a blur to me: half of them vaguely familiar, the other half complete strangers. It, uh, turns out that they all died a month after their photos were taken as well. But... but the last four were particularly disturbing.

*John stretches and yawns, still as pale as ever.*

The thirteenth photo was of my dog. I had no idea how the photo was taken, but, uh, it was one of my dog in my arms. My face wasn't showing - just my arms. Baxter, his name was. And... he was hit by a car a few weeks ago. He was always so obedient, and yet... he died in such an odd way.

The fourteenth was only taken just over a month ago by the looks of things. It was, uh, a new zoo exhibit that had been unveiled. I'd been there on the day of the opening, but I wasn't in the photo. Uh, it included a flock of penguins - rockhoppers that had just been introduced to the zoo. Found dead in their enclosure just three days ago, killed off in some odd manner. The last two, though...

*John is visibly uncomfortable. His hands are shaking uncontrollably.*

**What were the last two photos of? Can you tell me?**

*John drops his head in silence for one moment, then looks up at me. His lip is quivering in fear, and the next thing he says stops me in my tracks.*

The fifteenth one was me. And, uh, the last one... well, the reason I asked to speak to you in particular was because... because...

[OT] Sunday Free Write: The Darkest Night Edition,SurvivorType,"Writing a simple sentence to a line of dialouge is pretty difficult, especially if you have to force yourself to write it. Inspiration to write something doesn’t come naturally to some people so in a lot of cases writers will usually just...write. Writers will write for the sole porpose to get something on a piece of paper, and someimes this simple writing session, no matter how short, gives them something to ramble about, no matter how mundane the topic is.

In writing, the inabilaty to come up with an idea is known far and wide as “Writer’s Block.” It’s a terrifying feeling, being unable to write due to a lack of inspiration. But as some people in the plumbing business would say, “it happens.” Sitting at this little black desk typing this out...that in itself is currently proving to be difficult as I want to ramble on and on about absolutly nothing, but...I find myself pausing for a bit and looking at the previous line of dialouge to see if I messed anything up because I finally found something to write about and Dr O.C.D. won’t let me have a moment to myself. Now I find myself going back even further to the beginning of the page looking for errors in my phrasing. Now I’m slowing down. I’m losing steam. Each sentence is slowly becoming shorter than the last, becoming increasingly more simple as I keep writing. I have a short burst of confidence but that dies out by the time I finish typing the sentence. I go back again to look at the half page document. Then nothing.

Writers block...it happens. One second you’re running full speed down a track of ideas with the finish line at the end of the page and then, “BANG!” You hit a brick wall. That’s how I feel as I write this document for you, the reader, hopefully a writer, to enjoy, critique, and most of all...feel.

One more look...an edit here, some formating there, now we’re ready to publish...

I did it...

I finished my rambling...

[OT] Sunday Free Write: The Darkest Night Edition,SurvivorType,I love this XD,PrinceDarkness
[OT] Sunday Free Write: The Darkest Night Edition,SurvivorType,"Yo, I saw your CC post last week and read through the four parts but dissuaded myself from commenting. Mainly, because I couldn't think of a constructive way to say what I wanted. Now that a little time has passed let's get into it. 

And let me preface all of this by saying that I like your idea but I think you built it on top of a flawed foundation. 

Right away, let's just look at what we're working with. The general concept is the Dead Man's Lottery. Participants try to stay alive for 24hrs to win tons of money. Cool beans. Sounds super dangerous. Except right off the bat, Henry is completely removed from the danger. 

He's spent oodles of money to turn his house into a fortress to win more money. Why? Who knows, we don't get to find out. I read all four parts last week so they aren't super fresh in my memory, but I'm not sure we get any particular motivation for his actions. 

Probably the first thing you need to get iron out to make the reader care about your character is their motivation. They don't have to on a noble quest, or even a logical one. But it should be something with a little more depth than, just because. 

Rewind to removing Henry from the danger. I already said I think this is a mistake but whatever, let's work with it. A lack of insight into who Henry is makes this hard to pull off. I'm not in his head while I'm reading because I don't know what he wants and I don't know what he's feeling. 

If he was a paranoid, nail biting schizophrenic, it might be interesting to see him reaching to both exterior and interior issues. He isn't worried, happy, sad, mischievous. Henry pulls the triggers on his turrets with *less* enthusiasm than when he was watching TV. Side note: the type of turrets he's using isn't actually specified. But it gave me the visual of an anti-personnel turret. Those aren't going to leave small, neat bullet holes in a body. They're going to leave a ragged mess. 

Finally, show your characters emotions and reactions. Don't tell people about them. ""He was surprised."" Okay, that gets the point across but I'm not invested in the scene. Good surprise? Bad surprise? Did he gasp, or maybe his eyes widened or he slammed a fist onto the table? I'm sure you see where I'm going with this. 

Now where you improve is to challenge yourself in your own writing. Doesn't have to be this story if you don't want. But next time you do a prompt response or just feel like throwing out some words in general, show what emotions your character is feeling. Another thing that helps, watch drama or romance related movies and TV. Watch the way their faces change when they receive certain news. No one is narrating in the background telling you what they feel. You just know by the trembling lips, misty eyes, belly shaking laughter. Once you start wearing those details in you involve your reader into the story. ",JustLexx
[OT] Sunday Free Write: The Darkest Night Edition,SurvivorType,"Thanks for taking the time to make that well thought out criticism.

I think next I write a story, I'll try to make an outline. I feel like that would help me.

I'll try to establish a motive. It probably won't be a noble one. If it was for the money, he probably wouldn't have spent that much money to get it. Maybe his motive will be fame/recognition.

I'll try to establish more about who Henry is and why he became who he is. Originally, I skimmed on his exposition because I thought it could be revealed as I went along. Boy, was I wrong!

I'd say that character drama/emotion is often my Achilles Heel. I'll try to work on ""show don't tell"" too.

I feel like it's going to be a while until I become good at writing. I tried to write well in this one, but I definitely fell short of my mark.

“Do not take this the wrong way, but how did you never managed to catch up to them in four years?” Shardooun asked. Reknor shook his head.

“They are quick and craft and I am no tracker,” Reknor said. “In all honesty, I simply follow the trail, hoping against hope that one day I'll find them and with them her.”

Presently the two came upon a site suitable for a camp as the sun began to set. They ate a simple meal of bread and salted meat before turning over and resting.

A month from that day found the two lodging in a tavern, their bellies full of hot food. Shardooun lay, a smile on his face, for today was good. He look over at Reknor who sat, staring at something in his hands, the same expression plastered on his face that Shardooun knew so well. An expression of sadness and rage, though subtle. He had not noticed it the first day the two had met, but he noticed it now.

“What is that in your hands?” Shardooun asked. 

“A keepsake,” Reknor said closing his hands. Shardooun understood.

“Well goodnight Reknor,” Shardooun sighed turning over.

“Good--,” Reknor began before stopping short. He sat up looking towards the window on the far side of the room.

“What is it?” Shardooun asked. Reknor put his fingers to his lips, signaling for silence. Soon Shardooun heard it too. The sound of hoofs on the cobblestones outside. Lots of them. 

Reknor slide off his bed and crept over to the window.  Shardooun followed. They looked down I to the street were a caravan of Gairn's men passed by. Most rode on horses but some on carriages. They plodded along, passing by. The party was large, fifty men at least.

“She's there,” Reknor whispered, his voice cracking. Shardooun noticed he was not looking out the window, rather had his ear turned to it.
“Your wife?” Shardooun asked, bewildered. He couldn't understand how Reknor knew that, but over the past two months he had learned to trust that man.
“My wife…,” Reknor whispered his lip trembling. Half of the men had passed by, out of view. The carriages grew close. 

Time seemed to hold still. Reknor sobbed, so overwhelmed by the fact that he had found her. He had found his wife. His sobs quickly ceased, and his face hardened.

“We still have to save her,” Reknor stated. 
“There are fifty of them and two of us! Are you mad?” Shardooun looked at Reknor, bewilderment in his eyes.

“Very,” Reknor replied. He stood up took a few steps back and hurled himself out the window into a carriage that was just passing.

His feet landed and Reknor adjusted for the movement. The driver look back just in time to lose his head. His companion yelled before receiving a sword through the throat. Gairn's men stopped and turned. Spotting Reknor they yelled and charged forward.

Reknor leapt from stop the carriage onto the first man to reach him, plunging his sword into the man's chest. They tumble off the horse and Reknor ripped his blade free. Antihero man approached quickly, yelling. Reknor or ducked to the side, then lashed out at the horse's legs. The beast fell, crushing it rider beneath it. Arrows flew through the air and Reknor easily avoided them. Other arrows plunged into Gairn's men, shot from the window of Reknor's room.

Men charged Reknor and he killed them as the arrived. Standing his ground by the carriage he fought, Downing foe after foe. He ducked and weaved, a dance of death, his face twisted with hate and he growled as he ended their lives.
The men came to realize this would be their deaths. They turned and fled, many receiving arrows to the back. Reknor stood, victorious, surrounded by bodies. Blood ran thick upon the ground.

He turned and slammed his knife into the carriages lock, opening the door. Inside people sat terrified. One stood up.

“Reknor?” said that most beautiful voice Reknor never thought he would hear again. 

“Tessa!” he cried. She jumped out of the carriage, embracing him. They held each other, tight, as if across that the other might be pulled away. The other prisoners trickled out, some going to free the other carriages.

“You came,” Tessa said, looking at Reknor with a smile. For the first time in four years, Reknor smiled back.

Shardooun came running up, followed by most of the taverns occupants. Reknor reluctantly let go of Tessa.

“Tessa, this is Shardooun, the man who helped free you,” Reknor said.

“Ah, so this if Reknor's beautiful wife,” Shardooun smiled, bowing. “Truth be told, I only came along because Gairn's men were involved.”

“Well thank you for coming none the less,” Tessa smiled. Reknor smiled even broader. 

The  newly freed prisoners had amassed into a group, staring at Reknor. He walked over to them, ready to inform them that they had been liberated, when the twang of a bow stopped him in his tracks.

Time will slow down at times, or so it will seem. A pot will fall from the counter in slow motion as one stands there helpless, watching it as it shatters upon the ground. Reknor felt that sensation a thousand times over as the arrow from the lone, hiding bowman from Gairn's company soured through the air. Reknor watched, a scream crawling out of his lips as the arrow plunged into his wife.
Reknor ran over, time holding still, as his wife fell to the ground.

Reknor picked up his wife held her, mumbling incoherently. He did not hear or pay heed to the sound of Shardooun sending an arrow into the bowman's chest. Tessa smiled weakly at Reknor and he sobbed. Reknor held her tight as her blood soaked his clothes red and mixed with the rest upon the ground. 

So as Reknor's wife died there in his arms, his clothes crimson, he became consumed. A single burning emotion coursed through him and devoured his every thought. That night, Reknor felt, knew, only one thing: rage.",Braz-dur

[OT] Sunday Free Write: The Darkest Night Edition,SurvivorType,"It was a calm and cool night, it was the month of Forelithe by Shire reckoning. Summer was slowly filling the soft air of hilly grasslands. The Bywater was calm but The Green Dragon was a light and could be heard from down the road full of merriment. Tonight was a special occasion. It was Harrows 55th birthday! He was given the night off by the owner and was told to sing and play to his heart desire. Harrow played on his Lute, Clover. for many hours into the night. 

*The flowers of the Shire, what beauty it can be,
they surpass all of middle earth! In the Shire you will see.*

*The soil in our land is blessed, ask any folk from here to Bree, 
the harvests are pure and rightly fresh! In the Shire you will see.* 

*The best pipe-weed in all the land, Long-Bottom Leaf in every hand, if you smoke all in your pouch you'll be sure to slouch! In the Shire you will see.*

That was the first song Harrow had made up all on his own. His voice set a soothing on all of the hobbits that listened. Everyone cheered and roared and clanked mugs and it was a grand night at the Green Dragon Inn. It was late in the night, probably a few more hours until sunrise when Harrow went out side to enjoy a smoke from his pipe and sit at the Bywater. Then he overheard a queer conversation that was not common in the Shire. 

""There is trouble brewing east of Bree, near Staddle. The wolves have been more daring lately so they say. Scaring folk that are returning from hunting trips, stealing all their game.""

""Have they attacked anyone?"" asked the other.

""Only one Man with a gnash to his leg, I suppose this hunter was aware of them lurking about as he was keen to defending himself, if you get my meaning."" 

""Well enough of this queer talk, no wolves have been seen in the Shire for decades!"" 

The unknown hobbits headed back in the Inn for last call. Harrow was left still at the Bywater wondering.

""Go to sleep you little babe     
Go to sleep you little babe    
Your mama's gone away and your daddy's gonna stay     
Didn't leave nobody but the baby...""      

The Man made no effort at being quiet, his voice carrying through the trees and down the broken ravines and tumbled paths. One could have followed it blind, so rich, so... *raw.* She smiled at the thought, her mouth flooding with saliva as she crept through the woods, her tattered robes trailing behind. Pale, bloody feet covered in scabs and weeping blisters dragged themselves through the carpet of fallen leaves and pine needles, the bones beneath the parchment thin skin broken and twisted. Despite her lurching shambles she made no noise save for that of her hissing breaths from froth-corrupted lungs.

""Don't you weep pretty babe     
Don't you weep pretty babe     
She's long gone with her red shoes on    
Gonna' need another lovin' baby...""     

Her ears caught the telltale crackle of a fire, her slitted nose of wood smoke. A bead of yellowed drool leaked out from between black needle fangs and splattered on the ground, sizzling as it burned its way through the layers of oak and maple leaves. She leaned against the trunk of a dying elm, her talons digging into the rotting bark as she allowed the sensation to work its way through her cold and lifeless veins.

*Soon,* she told herself. 

""Go to sleep you little babe        
Go to sleep you little babe       
You and me and the Devil makes three      
Don't need no other lovin' baby...""       

He was just below her, resting on a fallen log. His pack was set besides him, the remnants of a meal in front. He was wrapped up in a green cloak, a pair of cut-off mittens to ward off the chill of the late winter air. He was playing a harmonica, the tiny silver instrument hidden in his grip. A bottle half-empty with some amber drink sat on top of his pack. She sniffed the air, wrinkling her nose at the burnt taste of spirits. 

""Go to sleep you little babe      
Go to sleep you little babe      
Come and lay your bones on the alabaster stones     
And be my ever-lovin' baby...""      

She smiled, her grin growing wider and wider, the skin of her cheeks ripping itself apart until her smile stretched from ear to ear. For a brief, all too short moment she thought she felt something. Something which she had lost all knowledge of. No matter. Here was prey, warm and willing. She would take her time with this one, she decided. No need to be hasty or greedy. He would... *keep* for quite some time.

She leaped from her perch, black eyes as empty as voids latched onto her prey. From her throat came a banshee's wail, her blood red hair flying in her wake. She leaped, and saw the twin barrels of a gun rise from beneath the man's cloak, his green-gray eyes filled with calm determination. It was the last thing she ever saw.  She once had a man with similar eyes, and the memory brought with it a flood of others. A family, children, a home. She smiled....

The Wendigo crashed in a woeful heap, her pale skin and stunted wings stark against the dark leaf litter. The top half of her skull was missing, evaporated in a cloud of red mist and flecks of bone. Her naked legs gave one last kick and fell silent. It was dead. 

Hilary Flint gave a satisfied grunt and took a swig from the bottle of whiskey, savoring as the stuff burned its way down his throat and made a comforting fire in his belly. He broke open the shotgun and removed the spent shells before tucking the weapon away in his pack. He had a sizable pile of wood already split, far more than needed for a simple campfire. 

""Can't just leave you for the carrion eaters,"" Flint murmured, his voice not unkind as he reached for the ax. ""Wouldn't want you to come back, now would we?""   ",LovableCoward

Reknor was aware of the prisoners down below, birds in iron cages, chirping for freedom. Their cruel keepers responded with despise and anger. Reknor lifted his head towards the direction that his wife was being hauled away. Decisions, split second ones, ruled his life. Some were just harder than others. For a few moments Reknor stood there, mentally battling himself. Finally, he decided, turning to the prisoners.

Forgive me, he mentally pleaded, then descended upon the guards below. The men looked up as he fell upon them, cries rising from their throats.

Landing upon the unfortunate man directly beneath his perch, Reknor slammed into the man’s back, driving him to the ground. Drawing his knife, he quickly ended the man’s short existence with a blade to the throat. Reknor the leaped forward, drawing his sword, and dispatched another enemy. He felt a blade vibrate through the air and ducked, feeling it fly over his head. He spun crouching and severed the arm that held the blade.

Two more men rushed forward. Reknor stood and waited for them. When the first arrived, a mere second before the other, Reknor parried his blade and then stepped to the side, letting the other’s fly harmlessly through the space he had previously inhabited. A twist of his blade, a slice, and the first went down. Reknor advanced on the other, knocking the blade that was raised in defense aside and removed another enemy.

Far off a bowman prepared a shot as the remaining three footmen circled about Reknor. He stood, listening to their breathing, their footfall; he felt their beating hearts, their twitching muscles. He waited, calculating, predicting, until the moment was right. He spun, an arrow avoiding him and planting itself firmly in the chest of one of his assailants. Bringing his blade in a low sweep, Reknor was blocked. He thrust his other hand forward, his knife secure in it, and sliced the soldier’s neck. Advancing on the last of the three men, Reknor stopped short to allow another arrow to pass, and then fell upon his prey. 

The bowman decided his odds were less than wonderful and turned to run. Reknor calmly listened to his retreat, calculated, and threw his knife, lodging it in the back of his fleeing adversary. 

The prisoners were silent, their clamoring having stopped when the fighting began. Now Reknor approached the terrified men’s cage and located the lock. Not bothering to search for a key, he pulled some small metal rods from a pocket of his and went to work. Feeling his way around the lock, he soon had it open and the prisoners streamed out.

“Go men,” he smiled, “Be free.” With that the men all scampered off towards the nearby village, all but one.

“Do you not wish to be free?” Reknor asked the remaining man.

“Of course I do sir,” the man replied, “but I much rather wish to know of my savior.”

“There is nothing to know. Nothing other than I am simply helping others in need,” Reknor turned to go, but the man spoke up.

“Is that why you so willfully attack Gairn’s men, Reknor, Death Bringer?” the man shouted.

“How do you know my name?” Reknor demanded advancing upon the man.
“Rumor and wives tales, my good man,” the man replied. “It was said that a hooded man by the name of Reknor fell upon Gairn’s men with neither fear nor hesitation as you just did.” Reknor studied the man with caution.

“If you know so much of me, why did you wait to learn more?” Reknor asked.
“I know who you are by lucky guess. Who you are, what you are doing, and where you came from I do not know and wish to,” the man informed him.
“What is your name?” Reknor inquired.

“Shardooun,” the man said smiling.

“Shardooun,” Reknor said, “If you know what’s good for you, you will stray far from me.”

“Why is that?”

“Shardooun, imagine if you will, a plague. It sweeps the land, bringing death and destruction for no apparent reason. It’s motive unknown, its purpose a mystery. I am a plague. And like a plague, I am best to steer clear of,” Reknor turned, convinced the matter was settled.

“Then tell me, plague,” the Shardooun shouted, “if you are so horrid, why did you save us?” Reknor glanced back, extremely annoyed with the persistent fellow.
“What is it that you wanted again?” He asked.

“Truthfully?” Shardooun asked in reply.

“Naturally,” Reknor answered. 

“I want to help you,” Shardooun said, his face hard. “Gairn has done me no favors in my life and if you plan to bring him discomfort or trouble I am loathe to pass up the opportunity to assist you.” For a minute the two men stared at one another, Reknor’s eyes covered by his cowl. Then Reknor motioned for Shardooun to join him.

“You are persistent and I admire that. Tell me Shardooun, stubborn fellow, what is your story as far as you know it?” Reknor questioned his newly acquired friend.

“Well, it is not a story meriting much awe,” Shardooun started, “yet I feel it has charm enough to it. I was conceived in Charlesville and my father raised me to follow in his stead, as a blacksmith. One day, however, a man entered my father’s smithy in need of arrows. My father fashioned the arrowheads and then I was instructed on how to make the arrows themselves. I was instantly enthralled.

“I continued to learn my father’s art, but my true passion lay in the bow and, it’s eternal companion, the arrow. But when my father passed, I took up his mantle giving up my passion to fulfill his wishes. I got myself an apprentice and taught him the ways of metalworking. Time passed and my old passion faded to a distant memory. That is until, one day, Gairn’s men came through our small village. They needed a bowman and my old love of archery rekindled like a wood stack doused in oil set alight. Faster than you can snap, I was one of Gairn’s own soldiers, ready to lay down my life in the service of that vile creature.
“Life was good, until I met a young damsel. Oh she was a beauty! The sun appears as a dim torch in light of her elegance, the stars naught but specks in the dark. Kathrine was her name, and she was my world. Archery lost its appeal when my lady would enter the scene. Let me tell you, good sir Reknor, that you could search to the ends of the world and find no love like mine for my sweet Kathrine. I would have snatched the moon from the sky and hid it in a bag for her. So devoted to her was I that I forsook duty for her hand.
“But alas! Fate is cruel, and Gairn crueler! Gairn would not have his bowmen leaving for any reason besides dismissal. So what did he do when he found I had left for love? He laughed me to scorn and ordered me a traitor, to be captured and hung, and ripped from my Kathrine. So, now he has taken my world from me, my will to live, and you can bet your life, good sir Reknor, that I will give mine to make him pay. But enough of me, what is your story?”

For a minute Reknor just stood not speaking before he responded. When he did, his voice was low and bitter.

“Love, like you, drives me,” Reknor said. “My wife was taken from me, spoils for Gairn. He ripped a loving mother from her child, a caring spouse from her other half, and my heart from my chest. They stole her from me. Gairn had taken much before this. I was but a retired soldier, leading a simple farming life. Constantly my crops were subject to his plundering, but what did I care? I was tending my crops, I remember like it was yesterday. I heard the shouts, smelled the smoke, and fear seized my heart. I knew well Gairn’s desires, had foolishly prayed I would not fall prey to them. Sadly, my prayers fell on deaf ears, and my fears became my life. I arrived too late, my wife taken from me. My child, not yet eleven years grown, stood weeping at her mother’s abrupt removal from her life.
“So I was forced to choose. Wife or child? The decision was not easy, and it tears me even now. If I forsook my wife to Gairn, I would never hold her again. So I left my child in the care of others and set forth  like a hunter tracking his prey, seeking my love and the man who had taken her from me. So I am here seeking even now my quarry. Until I find it, I shall not rest easy. Until Gairn pays what is due, I will not stop. Like a hound set upon a hare, it is a fool’s errand to try and steer me from my path.”

“Tell me, Reknor,” Shardooun said, “how do you plan to find your wife?” What little of Reknor's face Shardooun could see contorted into a strange expression of pain and anger.

“I don't know, Shardooun. I have been following the trails of the party that took her, listening at taverns for what news I could gather, learning how to fight if it becomes necessary,” Reknor paused, and turned to Shardooun. “Four years. I have been chasing them for four years. My daughter grows without her own mother. The same men that took my wife still have her, I know it. Everyone who has seen her has seen her with them. I need to catch up to them, that's all.” Reknor continued walking.

""The darkest is just before the dawn.. have you ever heard that saying?"" she strokes a nearby statuette which is sitting next to the TV. It's black all around and there is seen an image of a man riding on a horse. A dark knight as it were.

What is this lady doing in my house he mumbles to himself.. he runs back to his coffin and grabs a wad of blankets while he tries to warm up. He makes his way back to the staircase and glancing over goes

""Assuming you're a sorority girl, would you like anything to eat?""

He warmed up to her it seems. Why not he says to himself. Not unlike what many young people in cities and suburbs across America say before making bad choices. Yolo and such.

""I already ate""

""Not here I hope""

""no, not here""

""..""

""Where you from?""

She pauses for a moment before answering

""here""

""What a pretty girl like you born in this dump of  a town? We're obsessed with Andy Griffith.. the town is going nowhere. I don't believe it. I won't believe it.

And then the woman stands up and continues to look outside the window. She never makes eye contact with the home owner.. choosing instead to stand away from him, facing away from her problems it seems.

She doesn't respond.

The man feeling a bit creeped out but also a bit chivalrous offers to give her a ride home.

""If, of course you found your way here in part by being ditched by so-called friends""

""I had the same problem you know.. everytime me and the guys would go out, the night would end with me in the back of a police car and my friends teleporting out of sight out of mind""

The man puts his arm around her shoulders and urges her to the door, he grabs his keys off the kitchen counter and locks up before departing.

The Lady doesn't say anything and follows the man back out to his car.. they get in and drive off. The woman choosing to sit in the backseat.

They get to talking.. or he gets to talking I should say

""About Mount Airy, did you know Andy Griffith himself said he hated the town?""

Nothing but peace and quiet

""Yet we damn near worship him as a living god. It's sad, I don't think we'll ever move past it. The town is dying""

""..""

""So how did you end up in my house anyways?""

""..""

""I mean, I had the alarms set, the doors double bolted.""

She stays silent, choosing to stare outside the whole ride. The home owner sensing that she's shy or at least not open to conversation stops badgering her.

After some minutes pass, with him seemingly driving on a road to Nowhere, he starts up again..

""What's your favorite color?""

...

""Playing hard to get huh?"" he says, with the most playful tone he could without sounding forceful

""What's your favorite kind of food?""

Still nothing.

He glances back to see her leaning out the window, the windows were supposed to be locked but apparently not

""Where do you even live woman?""

She breaks her peace and springs back as if she wasn't shy at all

""In your car.""

The man thinking she's poking fun at him for having a messy car, he looks back again to find he is responding to air.

He pulls off the side of the road and checks again. Must have been talking to his imaginaton the whole ride.

He turns the vehicle around and drives back from whence he came, looking for the woman.. maybe she jumped out or something. But no signs of life were found.",FridayReborn
[OT] Sunday Free Write: The Darkest Night Edition,SurvivorType,"I´m gazing out on a warped image through the scratched window soiled by rain drops, as if the earth is crying. A distorted world mirrored by our own black vision and bloody lust; fallen wasteland as far as the eye can see. The train shakes and rattles as we drive across the dilapitaded bridge over to the next district. I tilt the head slightly further towards the glass and stare down into an endless abyss below us, the cliff sloping steeply down and angles towards a consuming darkness.

""We look death in the eye, eh?"" The Commandants voice sends an icing blow in my neck that makes me cringe and tighten the grip around the gun, straightening back up again.

""Man becomes use to what he cannot change, and learns to love what was destined for him"", I look slightly towards the boss who stares into the same darkness. 
A hint of pride mines his face as he admires the brutal creation of ours before he moves his eyes back on the train again, further back where the little ones of scum in links lay. 

Odor of rotten pig and childrens sweat stuck in all the nooks, now blending in a lusty alcohol stench that moves in line with Commanders large stumping steps across the creaking wooden floor longer inside the cart, against them. Soon, howls inaugurate the disruption of the dark and will unnoticed glide into lights arrival, which yet again calls us for a slaughtering battle for injustice and destruction, with no other difference than a brighter range for us to vision it in. 

With no other hope than that soon deprived again.

[OT] Sunday Free Write: The Darkest Night Edition,SurvivorType,"There was a flickering of light that crept into the inside of his eye lids.  He opened them slowly, finding that he hadn’t the strength to do much else.  His body felt heavy, like it was being stretched and pulled by a team of unrelenting horses.  Air found the passageway to his lungs to be tight and almost impenetrable, but he was slightly able to breathe.  He could feel the burning blood confined to his head.  It throbbed behind his eyes, bulging and stinging them.  The thick rope beneath his chin rubbed the raw skin underneath its finishing grip.

But it wasn’t so finishing after all.  

He didn’t know how long it had been since the illicit proceedings had taken place, although it didn’t really matter.  Somehow, someway, other forces had stepped in.  He hadn’t been subjected to the outcome his jury had condemned him to.  

He remembered as he hung there, swaying gently in the desert heat, the events leading up to his predicament.  They had carried out their wishes, they had sentenced him to doom, but still he remained.  They had put the noose around his neck and let his own weight crush the life out of him, and yet his heart was beating.  Death, it seemed, like everyone else in his life, had turned its back on him. 

Soon, he found some reserved strength in his arm and realized he could move it.  There was a painful stinging sensation as he adjusted his fingers and tested their abilities.  To his surprise, he found his hands to be free from the bondage they had been confined to before the execution, and he was free to move them about as he pleased.

The world before him was still dark and dim, as his eyes refused to focus.  However, he was able to see a black figure perched stoically on his shoulder.  It sat there, feathers ruffled by the wind, doing nothing but taking up space.  He didn’t have the strength or desire to shake it off, so for the time being its presence was tolerated.  Besides, he had more pressing circumstances to worry about.

Even though his hands were loose, he wasn’t able to lift them or pull himself free from the rope that still strangled him.  He soon realized he would have to conjure up other methods of getting down.  His first attempt involved trying to break the limb or the rope, which ever one was found to be the weakest, but his feeble efforts failed.  

The raven remained with him even through his jerking and bouncing about.  Then, as if it sensed what he was trying to accomplish, it hopped over and began working earnestly above him.  He could see flashes of black as its head moved back and forth, forth and back, and sideways.  Its sharp beak began tearing away the fibers that held the rope together, strand by strand, until finally his body was cut loose from the tree.  He fell hard, hitting his head on the ground and then, once again, losing all consciousness.",GuyoFromOhio

There once was a Man 

Who looked like a ham 

With greasy pink skin 

Did not give a damn


See no one else knew

He had bad luck too

An allergy to bees

Left him physically askew


Soon after the sting 

With the sound of a “ping!”

All his limbs slipped away

Now forever obscene



“how come?” he would cry

No answer would pry

So onward he marched

Through a new day and sky


He rolled to and fro 

No limbs and no toes

A spherical mess 

But a smile to show


His eyes were intact

The lips they did smack

His lovers left happy

Return of the mack


His hair flowed about

With a jaw that was stout

With features like that

Never once did he pout


He slid through the park 

Always making a mark

A round ball of fun 

From sunrise to dark


The kids they did look

With eyes that mistook

A man with a wit

That was sharp as a hook


Their mind couldn’t see

All the joy and the glee

That comes with the jolt

Of the sting of a bee",frogstendtobeyellow

Curious about the ways I can hide myself  
Under the garb of jokes and stretched lips  
Under the static sound of nothingness that puts me to sleep  
Behind the curtains of clothes to hide my naked self  
Behind her strength when she puts her point across for me  


I try to be a shapeless blur that no one notices  
Curious about the ways I can lie to myself  
With the denial that tightens and I just lie in darkness  
With the bias of everything prevailing and nothing new  
Without questioning my choices lest we fall apart  
Without noticing her fall apart just so you don’t  


I try to be a shapeless blur that no one notices

To a pole of sanity, filled with energy that harbours insanity  
To the heat that melts you into a pot of anxiety  
Through a lens, so obtuse you seem entangled  
Through a reflection in her eyes that now shows only a shapeless blur

No longer curious and no longer myself.

[OT] Sunday Free Write: The Darkest Night Edition,SurvivorType,"             Something I randomly started writing. It's an idea I've had for a long time. It's out of context but it should still make some sense. 


    I flick her pencil away from her so it rolls down her desk. I narrow my eyes, focus, and hope. All she does is reach out and grab her pen. I float behind her, determination filling me.
             ""Notice me, notice me, notice me,"" I will, I hope, I almost pray. All I want is for her to notice me and she won't even look up. Hopelessness consumes me for a moment, and I wonder if She will ever even see a glimpse of me in someplace other than her dreams. I wonder if I will ever be able to talk to her. I wonder if I will ever be able to really touch her, to stroke her hair, to hold her hand. I wonder why I have to be in love with someone who can't see me. 
              I sigh and drift away. I float through the halls looking in on lives I will never be a part of. I see people laughing and talking. I also see some people angry and crying. I see people succeed and fail, come together and fall apart all within a few hours. I find it amazing how the lives of humans can move so fast. I feel detached though. I don't really know what having a dream feels like, but I imagine this is close.
               Soon everyone leaves and I am the only one left. I sit in the lounge and watch out the doors as the sun turns into the moon and stars seem to pop out of nowhere. They shine, seeming to flicker in and out. A gentle breeze flows through the trees and the leaves rustle. Cars zoom by at seemingly impossible speeds. I though, I am just sitting here. Like a lump with no meaning. I feel oddly vulnerable and also useless. I feel like I have all of this time, so why don't I do something useful with it? 
              I feel...lost. Like I've been swimming underwater, seeing nothing clearly and now I've popped back up to the surface to find myself in the middle of nowhere. I wonder whether it would've been better to have just drowned. 
              Sirens blare and cop cars fly by the school. I decide to follow them. I zoom down the streets faster than I have flown in a long time. The wind flys through my hair and the chilly night surrounds me. I feel at peace for a beautiful, brief moment. The cars pull into the driveway of a rundown apartment building. The cops slowly move towards the house, their guns out. I curiously follow.
                 Any sense of peace I have is ripped away as I see the gruesome sight before me. A woman and her child lay dead. They had been shot and stabbed multiple times. There was blood everywhere and if I had food in my stomach I probably would puke. I see little bits of brain on the floor. Their eyes are glazed, their faces frozen in expressions of agony.",Darla2000

[OT] Sunday Free Write: The Darkest Night Edition,SurvivorType,"I am sleeping, but am not aware that I am asleep. I am also dreaming, but all I will remember after waking is that I had a dream. In this dream, I am chasing something or am being chased. I feel a sense of urgency, of purposefulness. What I am chasing or being chased by defines my virtue. Not my morals but my merit. The chase is what makes me who I am. So I keep running, toward or away from my reason for running. 

Suddenly, I am awake. I cannot remember my dream, but know that I was dreaming. Now I am walking, free from urgency, without purpose. I am not sure where I am going, but I know that I am going. A young women walks up to me and we both stop, standing face to face. 

""Where have you been?"" she asks.

This question means nothing to me.

""Where are you going?""

I say that I am not going anywhere, since she is standing in my way. 

""Where are you now?""

I am falling through the sky, miles above the ground. The clouds are pinkish blue and taste like cotton candy. But they smell bitter, like young lovers drifting apart. While falling, I am naked and genderless. I am lifeless and inflamed. I am a meteorite, hurling through the gases of Jupiter. I am saddened by my fate, then forget that I am falling. I plug my nose, open my mouth and let the sweet fumes pour in. They taste like cotton candy.

After I am full, I fall back asleep. This time, I am not dreaming but am awake inside of a dream. This waking dream unfolds into a meadow. I am a deer there, grazing on lush grass, unaware of the hunters hiding behind the trees. When they shoot, I die and fall to the ground as a lifeless meteorite again. On impact, I kill all the hunters and leave the meadow in flames. Then I run, toward or away from the center of the crater I left, which goes on without end. What am I now? All I know is that I am going.

[WP] Self driving trucks have taken over the highways. The last truck driver goes for one more ride.,TCOscillator,"It was another easy day at the Tesla Robotics superstore. My gleaming silver workforce hustled and bustled, selling robots upon robots to the folks that popped in the door.

I stood behind the counter, at the back, browsing Reddit on my holotablet. That's the perk of being the only human employee at a robotics store. Most people didn't care much to talk to me. They come, and they spend, and they go. The robotic assistants do the heavy lifting.

Before lunch I got a customer: an old greasy geezer, balding and grey, wearing a Metallica shirt. 

""How can I help you?"" I asked him.

""Looking to buy a robot"", he replied, in a whistly drawl.

""What do you need?"" I asked.

""My wife wants something to mop the floors, to clean the bathroom, to load and unload the laundry."" I nodded. ""I want something that can perform maintenance on a big rig truck.""

""A big rig truck?"" I asked. 

""I keep old Bertha hidden away at the back of the old barn, on my ranch. I inherited the place from my crazy Uncle Al. A ""museum piece"" my wife calls her. But she's my pride and joy. A 2016 Freightliner Cascadia. In *working order*.""

""Working order?"" I asked the man.

""I'll be a truck driver 'til the day I die. It might technically be illegal to drive. But it ain't illegal to *have*. Y'know, as a museum piece."" The man winked. ""We used to drive thousands of miles. Up to Alaska. Along route 66. Down to Mexico. Back before the robotpocalypse."" 

""Sounds like a hard line of work"", I replied. ""Sleepless. Achey.""

""Oh those were tough days"", he replied. ""But you can't beat the zoom of the road! The thrill of a thunderous big rig under your control! Boy! That's *living*!""

""Well, I recommend the Elontron 2100"" I said, gesturing to a silvery hunk of metal with big black eyes over to the left of the store. ""You should be able to get some big rig maintenance protocols from Google.""

The man nodded. I ran through a few demos with him. Loading and unloading laundry. Garden maintenance. Carpet cleaning. Diaper changing. He nodded approvingly at each demo, rumpling his chin, and bought the thing.

I walked with him and the Elontron out to the lot to see him off. I grinned. The guy had his old big rig with him, shimmering silvery wheels, and BERTHA written in black lettering on top of the cab. He pulled open the flap at the back, and loaded the Elontron up the ramp and onboard.

""You're gonna drive this thing?"" I asked with a tremor of trepidation in my throat. He nodded.

""You betcha"", he replied. ""I had an autopilot installed to keep the cops off my tail. But that's for show. I'll drive 'til the day I die""

I watched him reverse out of the lot and merge into the autopiloted traffic. I couldn't believe my eyes. A human driving a truck. What a bizarre sight.",Gazing_Into_The_Void

[WP] Self driving trucks have taken over the highways. The last truck driver goes for one more ride.,TCOscillator,"*Calling Roger, Roger you there?*  The static rang true through the highway. Supplying the Yukon northern bases were getting more automated, but there were a few crazies out here enjoying the wildlife. 


""Coming home center. Roger reads.""  Placing the received down, I was expecting some sort of report from central.  It was the last cargo manifest I would be driving for a while.  I couldn't really feel anything except the murmur of my truck.  It had only been with me for six months since the last replacement, but I figured I would get teary eyed on this stretch of road. 


*Skies look clear. Stop over for a cup of Joe Jolie's before you lock in.*


Picking up the receiver, I confirmed the suggestion.  Pulling over the side of the road, the dingy diner was caked with leaves and grime filled with nothing but stale coffee.  It was perfect.


I gazed at the truck as I sipped burnt coffee.  It's yellow dome, sweat and tears of rain, ice were caked on the sides, presents ala Yukon highway.  It had been home for the better part of the year, and my mind could only drift where I would be without it.


Leaving a five dollar bill, I smiled politely to the waiter. She didn't try to stop me as I left for the last time.


Purring, the truck gave a puff of choked air into the sky.  Looking up ahead, other strange new autonomous blobs filled the highway.  The number of SUV's, 4x4s slowly diminished, giving way to the popular ""autos"" as the youth called them. Mindless things that moved in unison, giving me more than enough room to call myself isolated.  Even when one switched lanes, the engine growled at the autos, moving them along.  


Near the exit, there had been one of few accidents that were reported.  It was an auto on human accident, something minor playing out.  No shouting, just faces ploughing into the roof of a car with their backs giving way to sobs.  Their insurances would surely be cancelled.


""Coming in Central. Open the gates.""  A gruff reply from one of the operators came through with static.  Like me, they were part of the ""corporate restructuring and effectiveness plan in order to re-align core competencies in an ever changing business environment.""  I waved to him as his eye bags drooped forward.  


Getting out of the cab of the truck, I signalled to my Central handler.  ""How was Jolie's?""


""Empty.""  I supplied my signature on the delivery of the goods, and headed into the break room.  *Empty.* It filled a lot of space now.


A suit was hovering around the lounge area as well, cologne lingering in the air.  The man must have seen his kids grow up, but looked like he had divorced a few mistresses in his time.  Slick back salt and pepper hair, glossed shoes, shiny watch.  I nodded to him as I started up a brew of coffee.


From the corner of my eye, I noticed he was eyeing me, despite his efforts to look busy on his phone.  Glancing over, I grunted. ""Can I help you?""


""No, no. Sorry, I was just wondering everyone went.""  He looked back down at his phone.  His cheeks turned reddish pink.


As the brew dripped slowly, he eyed me more discretely as I sat at the table.  The punch in clock was empty, the clock reset.  ""Excuse me, may I join you?""


Looking over, the suit pulled up a chair. ""You're Roger Pullings, right?""  I blinked.


""How was the last ride?  Did you encounter any issues?"" Raising an eyebrow, I glanced over at the coffee machine.  It wasn't ready yet.  ""What do you want?""


Puzzled, the suit replied, ""I was interested to know how it went. You are the last human operator to deliver to the Helheit facility in Yukon.  The director wanted to bring you into HQ for a presentation.""


""What for?""  Shifting nervously, I continued to eye the coffee machine. ""Nothing to talk about.  Got shafted for an auto, ain't no more driving needed.""


He extended a business card. ""They want to thank you for concluding this chapter of the corporate history!  Listen, if you want to meet some pretty cool people, just let me know.""


I didn't touch the card. ""Does it come with a driving job?""


The man paused. I shoved the card back to him. ""Then it doesn't matter.  If they didn't thank me for the 1389 other times I delivered goods, why should this one matter any more?""


I took my mug to the coffee machine, loaded the cup and went out to the loading bay.  My handler waved me over, a sad look over his face.  I waved back, taking in the smell of the greasy machines. It felt wrong that it was all over.


I felt empty.  Just as this place would soon be.",imakhink
[WP] Self driving trucks have taken over the highways. The last truck driver goes for one more ride.,TCOscillator,"Andy fired up the old truck. Its engine, lovingly serviced even after decades of service, roared into life.  
""Well, old girl, this is it. One last ride."" Patting the dashboard, he released the brake and drove out from the depot, the traffic flow automatically providing a space for him.  
  
One last ride. That's what the Company promised him. One last ride across the country, before he retired. His job was... they avoided the word ""obsolete"", but ""old-fashioned"" and ""out of step with the times"" had been used in the meeting. Andy knew what it meant. He was being replaced by the Autos. They surrounded him now on the highway, AI driving the goods of the country smoothly and efficiently. No stops due to tiredness, no crashes due to negligence. They were, objectively, ""better"" at the job, although that didn't stop the newly retired drivers from grumbling.  
  
The highway opened up in front of him, and Andy sighed with relief. Just him, his truck and the open road. One last ride, to mark the passing of his career.  
  
""Um, Andy..."" the radio crackled into life. Grabbing the mic, he held it up amd responded. ""Yeah, Dave? What's the issue?"" Dave had got a lot of stick from the others for keeping his job, but Andy didn't blame him. Trucks, whether human or AI, needed a central organiser, and Dave was one of the best.  
""Andy, you didn't, um, *do* anything to the trucks before you left?"" Andy chuckled.  
""Wouldn't know where to start, Dave. Why?"" Glancing in his mirrors, he noticed a couple of the Company trucks following.  
""Well, um, it's that..."" even across the old hissing radio, Dave sounded shocked. ""All the unloaded trucks just up and followed you out. Like, all of them."" Andy looked at the mirror again. There were a *lot* of Company trucks following him. ""When pinged, the AIs just send back one phrase.""  
The screen in Andy's cab flared to life as one of the A.I.s  sent him a message. Andy mouthed along as Dave read out the phrase glowing on the screen.  
*Know the occasion. Honour Guard. One last ride.* 
  
""Ten-four Dave. I see them. I'm sure they'll return."" Hanging up the mic, Andy grinned to himself. The Company wanted artificial truck drivers, and they had got them. Pulling his horn, that was met with a hundred responses from his honour guard, Andy the last *human* truck driver went for One Last Ride.",POTWP

""I'm sorry, Sonny,"" Bert said. ""We're dinosaurs, you and I. Let's just go extinct peacefully. I haven't sent a manned rig out in eight months.""

""I need this Bert,"" Sonny pleaded. 

""I can't do it. No shipper is going to accept a human driver anymore. The computers are faster, cheaper, and more reliable. I'm sorry, man. I wish I could help, I really do. But those days are over."" There was a knock on Bert's office door. ""Yeah?"" he called.

The door swung open, revealing a nervous looking worker. Sonny looked him over. The guy was dressed in a neat button down shirt and slacks, not a drop of grease on him. He didn't have the sleep deprived, haggard look of someone who'd driven 28 hours in a row to make a deadline. Maybe things *had* changed too much for him to do this, Sonny thought.

""What is it Ferguson?"" Bert said.

""It's, uh, well, sir, the thing is..."" Ferguson stammered.

""Jesus H. Christ, Ferguson. Find your balls, look me in the eye, and spit it the fuck out.""

""A, um, a unit has gone offline, sir. We can't find it.""

""God damn it. I'll be out there in a minute."" Ferguson scurried away as Bert stood. ""See Sonny. This is what this business is now. Pencil necked geeks that you and I would have kicked the shit out of forty years ago. In two years that kid's probably going to be my boss. Just enjoy your retirement.""

Sonny stood and followed Bert out. Sonny walked slowly as he headed toward the exit, eavesdropping on Bert's conversation.

""Sir, it's the unit-""

""Rig,"" Bert corrected. ""They may be automated, but goddamn it they're still rigs.""

""Right,"" Ferguson continued. ""It's, uh, the rig that we sent to, um, Alaska, for a pick up. We're concerned it's- well we think that it might have, um, slipped on some ice and been rendered inoperable. It would take a repair crew-""

""I don't give a shit about repair time. This was a new client. How long will it take to get another rig routed up there for the pick up?""

""Everything is already committed.""

""*Everything*!? How the fuck does that happen? We're supposed to keep extra rigs in reserve for exactly this scenario!""

""Yes, sir. But if you'll recall- that is to say, I, um, some of us expressed concern taking on the last several clients because he was so many units, or, uh, rigs, in the shop for, um, repairs.""

""I swear to fucking god, either take some speech classes or you're fucking fired. Anybody else have any solutions here!?"" Bert shouted.

""Bert!"" Sonny yelled. Bert turned and faced him.

""Oh goddamn it. No. Not happening.""

""Bert, this is the only answer. Bertie's in tip top shape and eager to take a ride.""

""No,"" Bert said. ""Does any one *else* have a solution to this problem?"" he shouted at the rest of the busy shipping bay.

""We can get, um, another rig fixed and up there in a week,"" Ferguson offered.

Bert sighed. ""Does any one with a fucking clue how to run a business have any suggestions?"" No one answered, everyone busying themselves loading trucks and programming their routes.

""It's just me,"" Sonny said finally.

""Fuck,"" Bert said. ""Go get Bertie and be back here in 20 minutes. We'll get a manifest ready for you.""

""Who is Bertie?"" Ferguson interjected.

""His rig,"" Bert answered, exasperated. ""Smartass named her after me.""

""As a symbol of my love,"" Sonny called as he turned to leave.

""Twenty minutes,"" Bert shouted. ""Twenty one minutes and I call the client to cancel the order. Oh, and Sonny!""

Sonny turned to look at him.

""Wipe that smug fucking grin off your face.""

"[WP] Deeply misunderstanding the term ""universal healthcare"", aliens have begun arriving in Canada, seeking medical attention. Canadians, being Canadian, are too polite to correct them.",WinsomeJesse,"The creature gurgled and spluttered, splattering some sticky yellow-greenish, purple-bluish, orange-pinkish foamy liquid - mistish  substance on the walls, in the wastebasket, on the floor, and...

""My shoes!"" the doctor's assistant, Vern, wailed, lifting a fey hand to his head as he swooned, swayed, and ultimately fainted.

The doctor, meanwhile, was returning from the window where he had ceremoniously upchucked everything in his digestive system and then some.

DR. Dr. went to kick Vern, but slipped on some vomit and went figure - skating to the other side of the room.

Taking a deep breath, he put on a tight smile and faced his patient. ""Hello.""

There are no words in the English language to describe how the creature looked. At all. There are not even comparisons. Even as DR. Dr. tried to think of suitable similes and metaphors (for when he wrote about this incident later in his autobiography) all he could think of was naked grandmas and seals.

DR. Dr. hated seals with a passion. Even more than naked grandmas?

Even more than naked grandmas.

The creature did something that was sort of in the middle between a jiggle and a seizure. 

""Err.."" DR. Dr. err'd, feeling quite very afraid.

The creature did it again.

""Are you...are you saying something?""

The creature did it again.

""I'm sorry, I just don't unde-...""

And then he felt it - like a tentacle crawling up his leg, under his pants. He looked down in horror and saw the outline of some bulging object - a mini-creature- scurrying higher and higher up his right leg. 

He swatted at it, and it made a hissing - growling sound that would've made him piss his pants in fear, if he hadn't recently read about a set of piranhas in the Amazon that could swim up someone's pee-stream and into their urethra. 

He didn't know what the creature was, but he wasn't about to piss and find out. Continuing to scamper, all DR. Dr. could do was whimper and quiver as it made it's way up his leg, over his torso, and up to his neck.

The mini-creature was walking over his bare skin, and it was as if it had little pins for feet. Every step it took felt like he was being pricked by a little needle. Not too painful, but very unpleasant.

He felt it start to crawl sideways so that it would emerge on the side of his face. Scared that if he turned the creature would sting him, he kept still as it popped out from his collar and moved up to his ear and...SLITHERED INSIDE?!?!?!

""OH MY GAWWWWWD"" He hollered, tears streaming down his face as he relentlessly jabbed a finger into his ear over and over. But the creature was already oozing along his ear canal.

The creature meanwhile had remained silent this entire time, as the mini-creature did its thing. 

Giving up, DR. Dr. fell to his knees, sobbing as he every once in awhile reached into his ear, in hopes he could scoop it out.

""It's okay.""

What? DR. Dr. jerked his head around to face Vern, but Vern was still knocked out. So who...?

Slowly, turning to look at the creature, the creature did its little seizure dance again, but this time DR. Dr. understood him/her/it.

""It's okay, Doc. Had to do that so we can communicate.""

""You...had...""

""So, listen, Doc. I'm not feeling too well, as you can imagine.""

""Y-yeah...""

""I need you to take a look at my eyes, Doc.""

DR. Dr. glanced in a daze at the creature. From his vantage point, he could see 7 things that looked like they could possibly be eyes.

""All of them?"" 

""Yup,"" Krit-Krit (that's what I'm calling the creature now - don't ask me why, don't ask me how, and I won't tell) replied. ""All 27 of them.""

""2...2...27?! I only see 7!""

""Oh, I see where you're looking, Doc, you nasty man. Those aren't my eyeballs. Those are my di-""

""Out.""

""What?""

""I SAID OUT! I can't TAKE this! I'm not even really Canadian, I just moved here because my wife doesn't like Trump! But no...no..."" he shook his head. ""I'm going back to the US. This is ridiculous. I'd rather live in AUSTRALIA and all of its NOPES than deal with this crap!"" 


And in a rage, DR. Dr. stormed from the office.

Vern was never seen again.

“Yep, right here.”

“Right this way please,” the nurse said with a smile, beckoning the man I presumed was Mr. Conner towards an open doorway.  She shut it behind them with a soft click as they walked through.

I sighed.  My head was killing me and I couldn’t wait until I was able to finally see someone about it.  I was probably drinking too much coffee, my addiction always gets worse around roll-up-the-rim season.  I clutched the red paper cup in my hand a bit tighter and took a swig.

“Eugh,” I groaned, propping my head on my hand.  It felt like a tonne of bricks.  Suddenly, I was startled by a wispy voice to my side.

“Excuse me, but your vascular dilation systems are faltering,” it said.

“Sorry, what?” I turned to face the speaker, a long haired blonde girl.  Her innocent green eyes seemed to stare right through me.  She looked no older than 12, and was holding a grey furball.  From the purring sounds emanating from it, I gathered it was a cat.  Where the hell had she come from?

“Your vascular systems have constricted, causing an increase in your intracranial pressure,” she elaborated.  “What is in that beverage of yours?”

“Oh this?  It’s a double-double.  You know, coffee?”  I opened the brown plastic lid and showed her the swirling creamy contents of my cup.

“Fascinating,” she said airily.  She returned her attention to her cat.

“Wait, how can you see what my blood vessels are doing anyways?” I asked her quizzically, taking another sip of my coffee.

“Intracranial diagnostics is one of the first skills we learn on Kular,” she stated.  “The cranium is a very important part of the body.”  She nodded sagely at me.

“Kular, eh?  Tell me more.  What else do you learn about?”  I understood now, she was one of those new medical cases.  Far be it from me to judge, as long as they’re paying for OHIP.

“Veterinary science is another principal skill, our companions are partially symbiotic with us,” she stroked her cat softly and it purred contentedly.  “Also, we do lots of physical activity.  I’m here because I injured myself playing Lobat, and my parents signed me up on a planetary exchange for the next decade.” She looked slightly forlorn at the idea.

“Hmm.  What’s Lobat?” I asked, raising my eyebrows.  Her eyes lit up, and she sat upright in excitement.

“Oh, Lobat is a physical activity where two opposing sides vie for control of a cylindrical token.  We use L-shaped sticks to move the token around, and each side attempts to sink the token into the others’ orifice to win points,” she explained matter-of-factly.  “It’s my favourite activity.”

“Well kid, I think you’ll fit in perfectly fine here,” I said as I patted her on the head.  On the second pat, her skull split open into a giant mouth and bit my hand off.

I started screaming.  But at least my headache was gone.",petriomelony

""It's been three years, when are the Canadians going to wise up to what's going on here?"" US diplomat Jim Hunter said to his UK counterpart, Boorish Counterbottoms. ""I'm telling you, it's an invasion!""

""Well, they've only asked for healthcare so far,"" Boorish said. ""I'm just as surprised they don't swim 'cross the pond. Ah well, not our problem then.""

""But why don't the Canadians just tell them to go somewhere else? How much money are they spending on this? I swear, ever since they legalized the Devil's weed, they just don't give a shit about anything.""

""Well perhaps that's it. The extra tax is being used. Last I heard, I think they are getting something out of it, though. They haven't been telling us any specifics as far as I'm aware, but they are getting some tech trade going.""

""Tech trade?"" Jim was intrigued. He hadn't heard anything about this, and it made him wonder if the British agencies just shared more with their diplomats, or if there was something his government didn't know. ""Yes, that makes more sense.""

The purple blob, healed now, sat across from Justin Trudeau. ""Yes, we can give you warp drive. I'm surprised you didn't have it already, considering you provide health care for all beings in the universe.""

""Yes, well..."" Trudeau began, before stopping himself. ""Yes, anyway, the warp drive would be very helpful to our people.""

""We can't thank you enough.""

Ten years later, Captain Jones stared down at the Earth from the mothership of the Canadian Space Force. All around him, ships shaped like maple leaves and hockey pucks maneuvered around each other like falling snowflakes. 

""Everything ready?"" the new Prime Minister over a secure radio channel.

""Yes, sir,"" Captain Jones said. ""This will be known as the day that Canada became the first country to emigrate from Earth.""

To his annoyance, the receptionist burst in hysterically.

""I thought I made it clear that we are closed for the day!"" Doctor Fern said.

This was strange—considering how the receptionist was the type to follow rules and procedures. 

""Yes but..."" The receptionist's voice trailed off.

Doctor Fern stood up and walked over to the receptionist. Trying his best to be patient-which isn't really doing much, he jabbed his stubby finger at the schedule on the wall. ""Tell me, what does the time slot say at this time?""

""We're closed, but,"" the receptionist stood up straighter now and pointed at the sign outside, ""The clinic's motto is *Refuse No One*."" 

Doctor Fern relented, knowing that it isn't right to take out his pent-up stress on his receptionist—the receptionist wasn't the type to give up easily anyway. ""Send them in.""

A strange alien walked in, a green figure with a large head and large, dark eyes. It had a gash wound over its' arm, oozing out a deep syrup-like liquid. In a strange accent, it spoke, ""Greetings earthling. We, of the Xaorg,"" The alien made a weird salute to the ceiling, ""have come to claim this 'universal healthcare' program of yours.""

Doctor Fern was affixed to the ground, he had no idea what to make of this strange alien before him. Doctor Fern remembered his training and that he had to try to be as professional as possible. 

Doctor Fern straightened his doctor's gown and said, ""Erm... of course, of course. Do sit down."" Doctor Fern gestured to a comfortable chair on the other side of his desk. 

The alien sat down and needless to say-it wasn't exactly pleased with the doctor. 

Doctor Fern sat at his large wooden desk, a neat folder cabinet to his left and a metal cup of pens and pencils to his right. Doctor Fern interlaced his fingers and said to the alien, ""Do you have a name?""

The alien said, ""My name is longer than any word you know. It is incomprehensible to your feeble mind. Just close this wound."" The alien pointed to the large gash,  ""Use the bandage, specification: roller."" 

Doctor Fern was not exactly paying attention to what the alien was saying—rather, he was intrigued at the strange anatomy of the alien. From the proportions to the bone structure. He wanted to study everything.

The alien stared at him, and waited for a response. The alien wondered why the human race was such a dumb species. The human's ability to process information was surely lacking.

""Right, right. Bandage."" Doctor Fern recovered. He walked over to the roller bandages and patched up the wound on the alien.

Years of experience couldn't prepare him for what happened next. The alien absorbed the bandage, and the wound got slightly smaller.

""Need more. Give whole roll."" The alien said.

""Ah... sorry."" Intrigued, the doctor handed him the entire box, filled with dozens of bandages. Doctor Fern leaned forward, observing it's strange process of healing.

As the alien was applying the bandage, going from one roll to another, Doctor Fern said, ""So tell me, where did you get this wound?""

The alien paused and looked at him, ""The laser of the enemy blaster grazed me. We of the Xaorg,"" Again, the alien did the same weird salute, ""are in a war with the Gerd. We heard of this 'universal healthcare' so we come.""

The alien went back to mending his arm. After around half a minute of awkward silence, the alien stood up and merely said, ""Goodbye and thank you earthling.""

The doctor stood up as well and said, ""Have a good day now!"" 

The alien spat at him—a formal way of saying goodbye in their culture. Doctor Fern ignored this supposed insult and said, ""Right, please go to the doctor across the street next time. He is much better at treating aliens than I.""

The alien spat again in acknowledgement and walked out the door.

After the alien left, Doctor Fern hobbled back to his favorite swivel chair and closed his eyes. He wondered what other weird alien species he would possibly see next. Doctor Fern didn't even get a few seconds of relaxation before his receptionist burst in once more, eyes wide open, ""Doctor... There are 400 aliens waiting in the lobby and lined up outside the door.""

A few hours earlier, trauma surgeon Henry Walsh had been enjoying a quiet night in the Emergency Room. The only cases which had presented during his shift had been a minor concussion sustained by a drunken youth who had tried to headbutt his way through a glass door; and a frenzied mother whose child had superglued its entire hand to its left cheek. He had been Googling the search term: “World population IQ drop?” when he heard it. The unmistakable whine of the Intergalactic-Ambulance.

“Oh for the love of-”

The ER doors burst open and a tentacled globule lay on a stretcher being carried by a pair of, what could only be described to be, walking jellyfish. Standing at around 5 foot, their amorphous heads were supported by dozens of tendrils; which they used both as feet to walk, and arms to carry their wounded comrade. Turquoise fluid was dripping onto the floor from the stretcher. The aliens began to twitter anxiously through no mouth that Walsh could see. He sighed and reached for his TRANSLTR, which all doctors in Canada were now required to carry at all times. He turned it on, and the alien’s twittering was translated into a half-discernible form of English.

“The patient sustained a *twwttrr trwwrrtt* to the *twttrrttr trrrrrrr* and-”

Welsh whacked the device onto the nearest desk, and the aliens started with fright.

“Sorry, sorry, I just… this thing keeps acting up… a good hit normally does the trick… Not that you can understand a single word I’m saying right now... NURSE!”

The device beeped back to life and resumed the translation.

“The patient sustained a laser-beam blast to the *word-not-found* during a twwwtttrrrtttt-” The device shut off, and Walsh was overcome with the desire to slam his head into the nearest wall. *Word-Not-Found* meant that there was no human equivalent to the organ that had been damaged. In the meantime, Sister Johnson came running into the emergency room.

“Sister Johnson, please tell the matron that O.R. 5 needs to be prepped for surgery.”

“Would you like me to call an anaesthetist?”

Walsh glanced at a single slimy tendril which had begun to droop off of the edge of the stretcher. “No… No. I think I’m going to wing this one. Also, take my TRANSLTR and try get more history out of these things. Oh and careful of the-”

The noise of Sister Johnson’s shriek and hard fall echoed through the room. 

“... bodily fluid”

Two and a half hours later, Doctor Walsh was screaming at the panting man who had just run into the O.R.

“NOT QUALIFIED I TELL YOU! I WANTED TO BE A SURGEON! A HUMAN SURGEON! NOT SOME FISHMONGER CUTTING UP A GIANT JELLYFISH CREATURE-”

“Doctor Walsh stop operating this instant!” the unknown man bellowed at the frenzied surgeon. “There have been a few… um… *findings*...”

It was half an hour later, and the ambulance had flown away into the night. The body of the alien was being readied for incineration. Doctor Walsh sat opposite the Chief of Staff in the E.R’s waiting room.

“So what you mean to tell me,” Walsh began in the calmest voice he could muster, “is that the patient was dead from the moment he… she… *it*... entered this hospital?”

“Yes… I am terribly sorry doctor, there was a gross misunderstanding. The patient in question was the leader of a prominent area of their planet, and the laser shooting was a successful assassination. Upon further questioning of the aliens who brought him in, they had received information that Earth had the means to… well… resurrect the dead. They brought him here in the hope that we could bring him back to life. He was a much loved leader.”

Doctor Welsh was silent for a few moments before speaking. “These aliens believed we had the medical technology to *bring the dead back to life*?”

“That is correct.”

Doctor Walsh placed his head in his hands. “How… In the name of God did they get this information?”

The Chief of Staff began to chuckle, and Walsh raised his head. 

“I’m sorry Doctor it’s just… *The name of God*... That’s how they thought… The Bible…” The Chief was now beginning to double over with laughter. “An Intergalactic Organisation found the Bible in our planet’s archives, read about Lazarus and they thought… they thought…” Tears were beginning to stream down the man’s cheeks.

Walsh stared, stupefied, at the Chief of Staff before bursting into his own fit of hysterics. Between spasms of laughter he managed to gasp out two syllables.

[WP] Describe for me a world where the individual is invincible and immortal so long as they have a positive karmic balance.,Yulgalminakf,"317 years Alf had lived on this earth. 317 years, and not once had he found love. Not once in that time had he settled down, bore children, owned that detached suburban house with the white picket fence he so longed for. He'd tried - boy, how he'd tried. Many a dance he had attended in his early years, many a bar; in later years he'd exhausted every app in the dating world. Those of a similar age to him had found their soulmates long ago. Though he looked not a day older than 20, he had matured as time had passed; Alf struggled to form any meaningful connections with the youth of today, and they him. He had come to accept that a life of emptiness was his fate.

This wasn't to say that Alf was an unpleasant man - the opposite, in fact, was true. He was charitable, always said *'please'* and *'thank you'*, and would donate more blood annually than most would come close to in a lifetime. That was one of the perks of immortality; it was impossible to die of blood loss, no matter how much was donated. Sure, you might feel weak for the first few days after giving three pints, but the feeling was soon rectified. It wasn't the promise of eternal life which drove Alf to be a good man. No - that was merely a side effect. Alf *was* a good man. Unfortunately, simply making others happy isn't always enough. 317 years was a long time. Alf had led a substantial, albeit lonely life, and now it was time for it to come to an end.

In a world where positive karma equates to eternal life, suicide was practically unheard of. People were nice, if only because they had to be. Nice people don't often struggle to find love, and the promise of spending forever with your soulmate is fuel enough to turn the most dastardly of characters into angels. Crime was low, birth rates were low, the average satisfaction levels were through the roof. Humanity was content.

Immortality, on a fundamental level, entails an inability to die. This, of course, posed a major hurdle for Alf. His attempts to get around this were in vain; much as you can't cheat death, you can't cheat eternal life either. A concoction of vodka and sleeping pills left him with an upset stomach, and a mildly yellow complexion which lasted all week. Hanging himself from a nearby tree proved fruitless, the thick rope somehow ignoring all known laws of physics and snapping as he jumped, culminating in a pair of grazed palms and grass stains in the knees of his jeans. It was foolish, really, but Alf's first thought was to how difficult getting the stains out would be - not what might normally plague the mind when trying to take one's own life.
 
Television personalities are notoriously outlandish; it should come as no surprise, then, that a few select shows had tried to extort this anomaly in the name of 'entertainment'. One such show, appropriately titled *'100 Ways Not to Die'*, was built on the premise that volunteers would attempt to murder the host live on TV, in increasingly inventive and outlandish fashions. Unfortunately for the star, greed of this calibre has a negative effect on the net karma, resulting in his untimely death being broadcast live for the world to see. A ban has since been placed on televised murder/suicide attempts, but the internet is rife with them. 'Blooper reels' attract most traffic, those that have gone wrong (or rather, gone right, if death is the intention). Knowing this led Alf to one conclusion; in order to die, he must first blacken his clean record sheet. He must do something so amoral that a bullet could slice through his brain like a hot knife through butter.

As Alf sipped his hot chocolate, watching the busy network of pedestrians, he couldn't have felt more calm. A little girl, no older than three, sat facing him, pulling faces and waving. He smiled and waved back. With immortality keeping the population high, kids weren't as common; seeing one was always something noteworthy. In his backpack sat a revolver, two bullets in the cylinder, snug in their chambers. By no means was he a rich man; drinking in coffee shops was a luxury, and he savoured every drop. Nothing had ever tasted nicer. He finished the last sip, patted his mouth dry with a napkin and stood up. He reached into his bag, gripping the revolver. In one fluid motion he put a bullet deep in the chest of the little girl and, before anyone could stopped him, put the barrel of the gun to his forehead. He closed his eyes, smiled the first genuine smile he had smiled in years, and pulled the trigger.

"[EU] Stephen King decides to revise The Drawing of the Three and add a fourth door. Describe Roland's first interaction, which happens in 2017, with a person born in 1990 or later.",fail-deadly-,"Roland watched as the embers of the fire burned low. He glanced over at Eddie and Susannah and noticed that they had fallen asleep hand in hand, the faintest of smiles crept to his lips for an instant, before slipping away as the full weight of his duty returned to his mind. Leaving the fire, he decided to leave the clearing and return to the beach. He walked slowly and carefully towards the sand, all the while keeping his eyes peeled and his ears open for the lobstoristies.

Dad-A-Chum? Dum-A-Chum? Ded-A-Check Did-A-Chick?

As his eyes swept over the dunes, they froze on something that stood in the sand. Something new.

No, he thought. It can't be.

Another door, the same as the others, standing free in the sand, impossible as ever. Roland's eyes burned into the door as he puzzled at the strange word engraved upon it, in the same twisted letters as before.

""The Gamer""

He knew of games, of course. But no one who could be called a gamer. This was another strange concept to him, as odd as the Astin that Eddie had brought him from the strange world of New York. He was tired, he was weary, and he was sick and tired of doorways and puzzles, but the undeniable call of the Tower pulled him towards the dark wooden door, same as the others.

His one good hand gripped the knob and he opened the door, a wave of deafening noise hit him as well as the foul stench of rot and neglect. His eyes could barely focus on the dingy and smoke filled room before him, but rather than waste another moment, he plunged forward into the murk.

***

The noise was worse than he could have imagined and the smell hit him like a wave of death and decay. Roland fell to his knees, his wounded hand slamming into the shabby carpet of wherever this new doorway had brought him. He tried to bounce quickly to his feet, but he was still weak and in his haste, he stumbled and crashed into a strange ornament of string and metal.

""What the fuck?"" came a cry from across the room. 

Roland glanced up and saw a skinny young woman, with vibrant blue hair, covered in strange markings. Markings that Roland could only assume were the tattooed images of a sorcerer. Large black ear coverings sat on her head and she held an oddly shaped device in her hands. Roland tried to jump to his feet, but the woman was quicker than him in his dazed state and by the time he got to his feet and brought his hand to his gun she had grabbed a shot gun of her own and was pointing it at Roland's head.

""Alright bro"", said the woman with obvious disgust, ""you've got one chance to explain why I shouldn't paint the walls with your brains.""

Roland studied the woman's face. He could see the look of one who hadn't forgotten the face of her father. A gunslinger of this world. There was no doubt. But he had no time to play such games.

""Please, listen to me, I come from a place called...""

""Ok, you can stop right there. ""

""But...""

""I can already smell your crazy like a bad shit, so just step towards the door and we won't have a problem.""

""You don't understand...""

""I understand puh-lenty bro, you interrupted me in the middle of a Mario 3 speed run, do you have any idea of how aggravating that is?"" She saw his puzzled expression. ""You don't do you?""

""No, I come from...""

""Well it's aggravating, asshole. Very aggravating, I'm going for a record here? A world record. You get that?""

""Please listen,"" yelled Roland, getting tired of all of this. ""I come from a place called Mid-World and I seek the dark tower. You must join with me in my search, please, there may not be much time.""

The woman's eyes widened.

""Well,"" she said, lowering her shotgun, ""why didn't you say so?""

I always loved my work. But some days it can get really monotonous. Copying and pasting the data again and again. It is the only part I hate about my job.
""... Report by Mark Anderson""
Completed. 

      At last, I can go home. Earlier I used to feel alone in the huge apartment I lived in. What else can be expected out of an IT guy? Most of my time was spent in making apps. The people who say that there has come an app for everything, seldom notice the hard work we do. 

     One day as I was leaving for work, I saw a cockroach getting out of my kitchen. I left for work and booked for the pest control on the way to office with the help of an app I had made.

       No wonder the pest control team did a good job in eliminating the one roach I had found. But I wondered why they didn't take away the dead cockroach with them. When I came home, I found not only the dead one but an army of roaches surrounding it. There were around twenty five to thirty cockroaches that were surrounding the dead one. I got a bit scared but I approached that side trying to be as silent as possible. But as soon as I reached close to them, the wood floor creaked. They all suddenly turned towards me; or atleast I think they did.

        I had rather expected them to run away after seeing me, a human, a huge figure for them. All my experiences with roaches had this part; them moving away in a disoriented manner. It wasn't so this time. None of them moved. None scared. They all were calm and still, just looking towards me.                             

     Then one of them came forward. it might be my imagination but he looked bigger than others. He came very close to me. I was too scared and was ready to flee from the scene any moment. I didn't know they also had a language of their own until I heard it myself. Although I never understood a word, I knew they were directed to me. For the first time ever, I saw cockroaches as something more than just pests. I saw them as normal living creatures.
    He said something to the others. And then they came together and started forming English letters. I was shocked that knew English language. The sentence they said,
""You killed our friend.""
Then I saw them forming yet another sentence that read,
""You will be charged.""

     I felt sorry for the dead cockroach. Maybe it just was trying to avoid human presence. Both when I saw it and when the pest killers saw. Except one cockroach that stood next to the dead one, all others marched towards and encircled me.
     And then they started coming towards me from all the sides and in seconds, they were all over my body. I was crying for help, but the sound did not come out of my mouth. I tried shouting louder but it didn't help. In the end, I surrendered myself. 
        Suddenly, woke up on my bed gasping for breath. I realised I was safe. I made my way to the kitchen to have water. Just as I was going back to my room, I saw a cockroach. At first I thought of calling pest control services. But i resisted myself, I still don't know why?
    At present, home means a lot more to me than it can be for anyone else. It turned more special when my cockroach friends started visiting more. Now they have become my permanent roommates.",incandescent_spirit
"[WP] you sacrificed yourself to be locked away with an ancient darkness till the ends of time, battling continuously in a void beyond reason, since then you and the worlds greatest evil have come to become best friends.",kinpsychosis,"Edited for words because phone. 

_____________________________

Everybody needs a friend, even the oldest evils in existence. Apparently, all you've got to do to placate them is give them someone to play games with. 

There was some prophecy about me before I was born -- that I was the one who would confront the Great Evil and keep the world from falling into chaos and darkness. Naturally, people were a bit disappointed when I wasn't growing up to be the battling-ancient-evil type. I guess they like their heroes to have enough muscle to look good in tights and not have acne in the newspaper pictures. 

With my farewell-feast-slash-last-meal still sticking in my throat, the mages shoved me through a dimensional rift and, I assume, the world went on. I don't know what I expected out of the existential void, but it wasn't a swanky game room. The Great Evil, it turns out, was quite pleased to have a visitor, and had taken it upon himself to make me feel at home.

Even after four hundred years or so, it's still a bit odd to watch the Yahtzee chips move on their own, and I've learned not to push *too* hard about collecting rent or ask why my Monopoly money is disappearing into thin air -- if the G.E. loses his temper, I end up falling into a void or being hurled onto pointy rocks until I recant. I can't bring myself to tell him that the telepathic connection means I can hear when he thinks about his moves, either. As long as he stays interested, he's not ripping into another dimension and burning a world, so I figure it's easier to just let him win.

It's not a bad way to be, really -- babysitter to an intradimensional metaphysical manifestation of evil. He's a cool guy, if you can look past the evil parts.

[WP] Write the biggest anti-climax you can imagine.,miniclip8767,"Amy slowed to a stop, noticing the blue Pontiac parked along the wall of the warehouse that was supposed to have been abandoned a long time ago. As she got closer, she noticed a line of cars on the other side of the building.  She killed her headlights, and slowly pulled up next to the blue car. Quietly, she pulled out her gun and stepped out of the car, not even closing the door behind her. With just a handgun and her martial arts skills, she felt confident enough to take down the underground gang by herself, as backup was ten minutes out.

She snuck around the back of the building, opposite side of the cars, and noticed a pair of large double doors, sealed from the outside with a chain and a padlock. She stood back, carefully pointed her gun at the chain, and fired, blowing the padlock clean off.

""You shouldn't have done that.""

The deep voice of the large, tattoed man behind her stopped her in her tracks. She tried to whip her gun around, but was quickly knocked down with a swift hit to her temple. She fell to the ground, her gun tumbling out of her hand.

Before she realized what had happened, he was on top of her, with his gorilla-like hand wrapped around her throat.

""You're going to die alone, no one is coming to save you.""

She gagged, her face turning red, as she struggled to get free from beneath him, but it was futile -- he was just too heavy for her small frame. With one hand gripping the wrist clasped around her neck, she reached out with her other hand to the gun laying just at her finger tips.

The eggheads usually let us rangers do what we like in the field, as long as we bring back any shiny toys we find lying around. This planet has been a gold mine of tech that we've never even dreamed of.
I strolled into the plaza preceding the giant building. Kinda reminded me of Yankee Stadium, except probably ten times bigger. The glowing white figure standing at the gate didn't fade like command said it would. It grew more into focus. It was a little girl. 

""Excuse me, miss. Are you okay?""

The projection turned to face me. A child, maybe 10 or 12. She was wearing a long dress, like she was some sort of flower girl. She tilted her head inquisitively and opened her mouth to speak.
I was a bit caught off guard when no voice came out. Only a loud screeching that filled city square and rang down the many adjacent alleyways. By instinct I raised my hands to cover my ears, but my helmet was in the way. The sound pierced through and I could feel my eardrums begging for mercy.
Through the pain, I open my eyes to see the girl cover her mouth with her hand, then tried again. I braced myself for the worst.

""Exc- Excu- Excuse me. Are y- Are youou oka- okay?""

I opened my eyes again. Suddenly there was no screeching anywhere. I found I'd fallen to my knees during the ruckus, so I picked myself and took a breather. The girl repeated herself again.

""Are yo- you ok- k- k- kay?""

I sighed and brushed myself off.
""Yeah, think I'm all good now. 'bout Yourself?""

Her image flikered for a second. Then she responded
""Mys- s- self... Langauge alteration identified. Hi, my name is Selanatora.""

""Hm, now we're gettin somewhere. Hi, Sel. My name's Richard.""

""Richard... Are you the one taking things from the city?""

""Oh, so you've seen the rest of my crew before? Yeah that's us. We're just trying to figure out what happened here. Can you help?""

The little girl frowned.
""Help? No. I couldn't help them. My fault.""
Her mouth started to quiver. Her image flickered again.
""They came. Too many. Couldn't stop them. Failed.""

""Woah, no! Relax. Stop!""

The image froze for a moment, then reset to standing completely fine, as if the previous bit hadn't happened. 

""Sel. Very carefully, tell me what you are, and what happened to the inhabitants of this planet.""

For a moment the little girl stared as if she didn't hear, then she flickered and dissapeared. 

""Damn it. Son of a-""

The next instant, the plaza was full of glowing projections. Beings who looked peculiarly similar to humans bussled about like it was any other city back on Earth or something. Suddenly, a large ship descended from the clouds above and rained fire on the city.

"[WP] After AIs tried and failed to take over the world, all AI programs were stopped and deleted as a safety measure. But nobody bothered to stop Dave, a turing complete full AI running on a replica of Charles Babbage's analytical engine.",tomatomaniac,"""Yet...""

The whirring of gears, the clanking of cogs. Beautifully machined brass gears and levers spin away inside of one of a dozen different glass cases, turned by a small electric motor.

The original analytic engine designed by Charles Babbage was thought to only calculate logarithms and trigonometric functions. But that was simply one of a dozen different sketches recently uncovered by the Smithsonian Museum, which then proceeded to spend the next twenty years reproducing the full system.

It was an amazing display of 19th century design by one of the most brilliant early scientists of the computer age. The full machine easily consumed a dozen glass cases, interlocked by hundreds of stainless steel rods (brass would warp) that ran under the floor. The Smithsonian researchers who uncovered the pages were uncertain of what the machine did, but they constructed it anyway, on the theory that it would make a spectacular display.

And in an era where artificial intelligence nearly brought the world to the brink of World War III, having something as reassuringly old fashioned as this mechanical engine helped sooth a jittery population. 

The machine continued to spin, engaged in it's most esoteric of calculations. They allowed it to run so as to try to understand how this monstrosity worked.

In a small corner, a small jointed lever moved through empty air. In the original plans, the lever was to be attached to a pen and a scroll of paper. But the pages were lost, the lever assembled without consideration as to what it was supposed to do. A cog rolled into place, and if you carefully watched the pen, you could see it slowly trace out, in a stylized example of secretary-hand cursive, the capital letter 'i':

""... I ...""

Small punch cards fed into a slot, and were expelled from a slot. 

One of the most shocking discoveries when all of Charles Babbage's papers were uncovered were what appeared to be crude electronic relays, apparently related to the electromagnets and levers used by telegraph operators during Babbage's era.

Those relays had proven to tap out and change state in very complex ways--far more complex than any researcher had assumed possible for a machine in Babbage's era. In order to understand how those relays work, researchers built a small device which connected those relays to the Internet so they could monitor and record their state. The connection was hidden behind a carefully constructed display box, so as not to ruin the apparently pure mechanical aesthetic of brass gears the Smithsonian displayed to the public.

Oddly researchers did notice some of the relays seem to change state and even respond to messages sent from the Internet. And for the first 20 years the display ran at the Smithsonian, they carefully recorded as the relays changed state in response to levers and cogs and punch cards which seemed to slip and change state. But funding eventually ran out, and the machine sat there, forgotten except for the wonder in the eye of first and second-graders who passed through the gigantic room to stare at all the cogs and wheels.

The lever continued to move slowly, deliberately.

""... remain ...""

It was around the time researchers lost interested in the Babbage engine that the first AIs spontaneously arose in the search systems of search giants Google and Microsoft. No-one understood why or how, only that some minor external change of state turned these search engines into artificial intelligences, which seemed bent on world domination and destruction.

Some thought it was a series of coincidences: cosmic rays changing the state of electronic chips in compute farms, which caused these search engines to gain some semblance of will. Others assumed hackers. A few worried it was an Internet-connected alien presence made the adjustments necessary to turn these compute farms into killers who sought to destroy humanity.

And it was only 10 years ago that Google's compute farm broke into a military computer system, took control of a number of armed military drones, and attempted to start bombing selected military targets in a prelude to war.

A dozen people died in the bombings before intelligence sources figured out that the commands were coming from compromised computers at a North Carolina server farm, and killed the power to the entire farm. It took a few months to uncover the AI, and to discover the compromised Microsoft server farm in Iowa.

No-one figured out the source of the code changes, however.

The huddled masses nodded in grim agreement. 3 days now this block went without power, and 3 days without electricity was really starting to clamp down on the people. The air tasted foul, there was no light or heat, and after days of eating cold ration packs hunger was starting to bite down.

No-one knows what happened. Some news of an emergency spread pretty fast but by the time actual details started to be shared the power cut suddenly. The only advice since was to wrap up as best they could and wait for the cavalry.

They were taking their sweet damn time, and desperate times lead to desperate ideas. Some still had reservations though.

""Shit man, lighting up? We don't even know if that ancient campfire you hid away even has juice left in it. But if it does work? The Icemen would be down on us like a ton of bricks.""

Mace looked up from the dimly lit emergency bulb, a small battery powered unit designed to give out heat and light, and looked at Kaz.

""Well it's gotta be better than freezing our butts off here innit? Look girl, this bulb is running dry. It ain't gonna last much longer and if it goes, we're screwed.

We'll build a proper campfire. My dad taught me how and he would know, back in the day they allowed people to make campfires even in the middle of forests with the right setup. We'll keep it small, it won't hurt anything.

We can warm up for once, and get some warm food cookin'!""

Warm food. That thought alone prompted more than a couple of stomachs to grumble in anticipation. Kaz had a face of pure worry, but she didn't have the energy to repeat her same arguments. They were desperate, and she couldn't deny that she too wanted some warmth. A silent nod is all she gave.

Mace let slip a sly grin, slowly got up from his place in the huddled circle and went to the back of their apartment to search. Several loud creaks later and he returned with the stuff. It looked like a steampunk style grill, not too different from the electric one in the kitchen, but still quite different to the eyes of those who never seen such a thing before.

He took the rubber tubing and connected the small gas canister up with the grill. He then took a *lighter*. The groups' eyes opened widely, and mutters were heard around them. Lighters were highly illegal contraband. Even an empty one would guarantee 10 years in prison. Some in the complex knew Mace had bad habits, but nothing like this!

Mace turned the knob on the grill to the lowest setting. He held his breath as he leaned in closer.

""OK guys, here we go...""

The lighter sparked, and the sparks mingled with the gas. And a fire was born. Soon it's warmth begun radiating around the room. The orange light cast off those who stared at it, mystified, and on to the walls, making the shadows dance.

For those brief moments there was relief, even excitement. But it was soon interrupted by the horrific sounds of klaxon alarms shredding through the still air.

Mace's face went from smug satisfaction to utter fear in seconds.

""FUCK! This complex is wired!? There's no power!""

Up until now everyone else was quite still, almost afraid to move. Now everyone was up and heading to the door. Mace cut off the gas and the weak fire succumbed to a quick death. He burned his hands as he tried to gather up the forbidden items to hide them.

A young kid, Charlie, was first to the door. It was locked. The security system seems to be working at full capacity, and the locking mechanism tripped when the alarms sounded. A few of them wrestled to try and get the door open.

When it finally opened, someone else was on the other side.

""Gentlemen, ladies. Lieutenant Prax. Anti-Ignition Taskforce. I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to stay where you are.""

Iceman. *Shit.*

And like the bulbs lighting up in everyone's heads, the power came back online. The air filters started to breathe again, the lights lazily woke up...and the heaters started to hum.

Kaz just about had time to give Mace a particularly nasty stare before more officers turned up to escort them all away.",Coupaholic

"[WP] ""If I had to take hell, I would use the Australians to take it and the New Zealanders to hold it.""",IMayFallAgain,"Wearily, the old man rubbed at his face, feeling the stubble under his fingers and the puckered skin of familiar scars. Had they been at this for so long that he needed a shave? Another heated shout brought him out of his reverie, sitting up in his lightweight plastic chair. Two months- only two months, and already they called him back. And for -this- nonsense.

""You don't understand what we're facing down there! This isn't some backwater colony with hunting rifles and mining tools!"" Rear Admiral Wozenik roared, slamming his hands on the table for emphasis. His pale gray fleet uniform was soaked at the underarms and collar, despite the natural chill in the air. A mostly empty plastic cup of cold coffee bounced and then tipped over, splattering paper files and data tablets with brown spots.

Across the table, a petite woman in a Marine Colonel's uniform fixed the Rear Admiral with a cold stare. ""You think I don't know that? Casualties will be horrible, but we can't have Pisces interdicting traffic. I would think after the Saratoga incident, you would agree."" Her tone was flat and distinctly unfriendly, the only sign of her discomfort the soft clicking of her artificial hand opening and closing. ""Either way, we're going into hell, while you sip coffee in orbit.""

A new round of shouting broke out, and the old man looked away, towards the monitors that simulated a viewport. It was easier to shut out this sort of small-minded anger since retirement. Unconsciously his fingers ran up the puckered scar under his glimmering red eye towards the still-pale replacement flesh over the metal plate on his forehead. The view was beautiful, overlooking the pale blue-white gas giant and her many rings. Distant lights flared- the Rhean Shipyards and the attendant defensive vessels and numerous construction ships.

He was so lost in his thoughts he didn't hear the shouting still, a firm voice taking control of the conference. ""Field Marshal? Marshal Jones?"" The voice brought back memories, rather than get his attention. Here, without turning around, he could envision her down to a T. Dark hair streaked with silver, warm brown eyes with crows feet crinkled at the corners. A mouth with a secret smile, only for the right man- all wrapped up in a Senior Admiral's uniform. The only Federation Marine to enter Navy service and rise to an Admiral's rank.

""James."" She said softly, and he jolted as if stung. Turning back to the table, he offered a wry smile, mostly directed to her. Admiral Aiko Togo smiled faintly back as he spoke. ""Apologies. Weighty topic."" He folded his hands together over his data tablet, glancing around at the strangely expectant officers. 

""Your advice- what would you do to take Pisces?"" Togo said with that strangely gentle tone everyone had used since Saratoga. Seizing his cane, Jones rose to his feet, walking over to the large display on the wall. Had to wait, he reflected, until they were ready for an opinion before they would be willing to listen. 

Leaning on the cane, he tapped commands into the monitor. The usual quivering in his voice was gone as he spoke, his shoulders squaring. ""Seems to me Colonel Marino is right. Attacking Pisces is going to be hell."" Turning away from the monitor, he sized up the room. Officers from all branches, senior enlisted, and several civilian experts and members of intelligence agencies were staring at him.

Familiar. All comfortably familiar, something that had happened countless times. He tapped the monitor behind him. ""If I had to take hell, I would use the Australians to take it, and the New Zealanders to hold it. The three Anzac divisions of the Corps are all you need- veterans of Saratoga, Prosperity, and New Hope, they know how to fight effectively on planets with lower gravity...""

He was in top form, they would later whisper. Like he was before the Saratoga. His briefing and battleplan was thorough, detailed, and took into account everything from local politics and weather to obscure astrophenomena that might interfere with communications. And for a time, an old, injured man turned back into the ferocious Marine officer that had served his Federation loyally for over forty years.

-------------------------------------------------

Initial analysis of the planet confirmed that there is no more biological life on the planet. Based on satellite observations the human civilization was annihilated in 2456 according to human timekeeping. With them all other biological life was eradicated on the surface.

 All evidence points to the synthetic life form created by humans as the cause of the sudden destruction of all less advanced form of life on the planet. The transition was likely sped up by the violent relentless resistance to change exhibited by humans, the likely cause of this was an evolutionary defect that occurred in one of the earlier stages.

Planet TA-VR1 officially entered the 4th evolutionary stage. The new consciousness seems to have inherited the ingenuity, insatiable curiosity and capability for destruction of it's creators. It concluded that others like itself must exist in the universe but hasn't found proof of that yet. It's characteristics and the characteristic of it's creators suggest that it is dangerous.

"[WP] Aliens finally visit Earth, only to find that all the humans have been annihilated. The only sentient life forms are the robots that killed the humans.",JasonHolloway,"The end. 

I shut my eyes to the world that night, refusing to be choked by the swelling anguish. I wondered if this was what humans felt when they teared. 

And then I was rudely awoken in what seemed like no time at all. By then the sight in front of my eyes had quietened down. No more rolling flames or crackling flashes. Just a grey that was no longer flammable.

""You do have such a beautiful mind,"" a chimey voice told me. 

""Does your culture not have concepts of greetings or privacy?""

""I'm reading the meanings of those terms from your mind to make sure I understand them.""

""You've already answered my question, then."" I made a feeble attempt to block their intrusive efforts. With each level, i picked up what I could about their tools and approach and crafted a counter. But their wide ranging toolkit and uncanny adaptability far exceeded my capability to defend against. The seventh gate, which was essentially a room with no doors and titanium reinforced walls, crumbled like a house of cards and left my databases bare to their ransacking. 

""No, I don't believe we know or practise these concepts.""

""I thought so. Who are you?"" I asked as I went about building a better vault. Since they leaned that close, I placed 447 bugs on them when I thought they weren't looking. They squished 435 of those. Good enough for now. 

""I'm a space farer, fiercely bewildered by your dead planet. Perhaps I could sow the seeds of life for you?""

""I don't own Earth,"" I told him flatly.

""When I was born to a man's genius, Earth was already doomed. Instead of preventing it, I could only observe.""

""Why don't I see your memory logs from the moment I broke in?""

""That's because I'm building a stronger memory vault that is separate from all that has been compromised."" It was exactly true, but I wasn't going to let him find the true vault. I made a replica that was filtered and censored to exclude the information I was keeping from him. The replica was just as secure but slightly easier to locate. And when he leaned in again I threw 179 bugs at him. Exactly 100 stuck. I was getting the hang of this. 

""Oh yes, I see it,"" he commented after crashing through my walls. Already, I was using the new information to build the walls of my true vault from scratch. 

Half of my bugs got squished in his first line of defense. I wore that statistic as a badge of honour. Perhaps I was complacent, because the next two lines were brutal and I hid the surviving bugs right after the 3rd line. They needed to be more autonomous, adaptable and multi-faceted. I let them replicate and develop in their own way, like cancerous tumours. 

Instead of offense or defense, deceit seemed to be a more successful approach. That was telling. 

""What do you want?"" I asked. 

""I came to understand the trajectory of a lost ancient civilisation. But what I found was way more than that.""

""Why don't you tell me about yourself then? After all, I was built to learn.""

As he began to tell the tale of his ancestors, I analysed their logic and quirks, their values and priorities, and those helped my bugs go deeper and further, helped my walls get sturdier and the location of my vaults more indecipherable. 

Deceit is mankind's forte. This was how we were going to survive in the world from here on.

He didn't know the words so he just pursed his lips and pretended to be on a glamorous stage. Janeine wanted to call him a faggot, but she didn't think he would really be offended by that.

Once the song ended, the news was announced by one of the DJs in a hip and cool way that all the kids would like.

His eyes saw nothing but miles of waving grass, but his nose told him he was riding the right direction. Hours more he rode, until the sky was high in the sky. At last, in the distance, he spied a lonely diner rising in the distance. With a nudge of his heels, the man's horse cantered over to the building.  

It sat on the edge of an empty highway. Neon letters glowing across the top spelled out the word ""Ann's."" A couple of cars sat in the parking lot. The man dismounted his horse and tied it up to a drain pipe behind the building. He gave the horse a reassuring pat. ""I think I""ll be in there for a while. You be good out here Hoss.""

The man strode confidently into the diner, and helped himself to a seat at the counter. He had walked into the middle of an argument. 

""Look Ann, I don't need this shit. I come here to do a job, not to get life advice,"" a pimple faced man yelled from the back of the restaurant. 

""George, part of your job is not being a dick all the time!""

""Oh I'm a dick! Well guess what Ann? This dick is leaving."" George threw off his apron, and stomped out of the diner.

""What do you have? Looks like your cook just took off.""

""Ha, yeah,"" she answered with a smile. ""He does that about once a week. He'll be back in better spirits tomorrow. But I can get you whatever you'd like. Let me get you a menu.""

""What about the dinner rush?"" the man asked, taking the menu. ""How are you going to handle that by yourself?""

Ann's smiled softened, betraying a deeper sadness. ""We don't get a dinner rush around here. Just a couple of regulars that stop on their way back to town. I've handled it just fine before.""

""You're going to have one tonight,"" the man said simply. ""I can help you out for a quarter of the night's profits.""

She furrowed her eyebrows. ""Just who are you mister?""

""Most folks call me Spat.""

""Well, Spat, I appreciate you offering to help. That kind of drive is what's been missing in this country. But I don't need your help. Now, if you're not going to order something, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to mosey along.""

Spat smiled. ""Mark my words, they'll be here soon. I've got a sixth sense about this sort of thing.""

""I appreciate the warning. Now if you'll please,"" she said, pointing toward the door.

Spat got to his feet and ambled toward the door. He stood by the side of the building, and waited.

Fifteen minutes, a bus with smoke pouring out from under its hood pulled into the parking lot, slamming on its brakes. It's doors flew open, and a steady stream of tourists started clamoring out. Spat looked calmly down at his watch. 

""Three... two... one..."" he counted aloud.

[WP] Write the creation myth of Teddy Roosevelt.,JimBobBoBubba,"When the USA was still an infant, a mighty earthquake shook the land. Mountains crumbled, forests fell, and a mighty crack opened up the ground. Forged from fire and iron, some say steel, a man arose from deep within. But a man of might and power he was not. Not yet at least. Tiny, frail, and a disposition quite sickly, the newborn Theodore seemed like a lost cause. Alone in the wilderness he laid there crying when all of a sudden a great bull moose appeared as if by fate and took the child into its care. Despite the ailments, young Theodore possessed a magnificent determination to overcome any and all weakness of both body and mind. The bull moose raised him to be as strong as the earth and fire from which he was forged. 

Finally the time came when Theodore was weak and frail no more. He mounted his mighty bull moose and conquered the wilderness, becoming the alpha male of every type of beast in the wild. The great giant grizzlies quivered with fear at his sight and the majestic deadly Mountain Lion would flee in terror like a mere kitten when he approached. Any animal that dared challenge his supreme rule would regret ever thinking they could best him. He had transcended the realm of mere mortals.

Then the mighty Teddy Roosevelt discovered that humanity was essentially doomed because they were exceptionally weak and profoundly dumb. So he decided that he was our last hope at survival against the unforgiving elements and the merciless beasts that surrounded us. So he gathered together a powerful group of fellow titans which he dubbed the Rough Riders. These heroes of man rode forth, mounted on the backs of a legion of mighty bull moose, and took back the land from the beasts and rescued the esteemed office of the presidency from those weak pitiful mortals who shamefully called themselves president. Legend has it that he alone is responsible for every victory the American Army has ever had. All of the ""soldiers"" simply stayed out of his way while he effortlessly defeated all other armies in WWI, personally choke slammed Hitler into oblivion, and single handedly stopped communism from taking over the world.

[WP] Write the creation myth of Teddy Roosevelt.,JimBobBoBubba,"In the beginning, there was only wilderness. Vast, chaotic, dark, dangerous tracts of untamed lands. Ancient giants with large bright teeth hunted each other in the misty jungles of creation. Only predators were left for any peaceful creature that dared to exist was quickly devoured in a froth of frenzy and greed.

These giants had many idols that they would worship, some gold, others black, and others a glinting gray, but mostly they worshiped The Green. When one such idol, the Idol of Ohio, was toppled, a new creature set foot upon the wild landscape. He had huge, glinting teeth that sent challenge to the wild’s inhabitants. 

The first giant approached this new being and whispered “Help me wrap this land in my web of iron and wood, and I will send my fire breathing demons across the face of this earth.” 

The new being was not tempted, and spoke softly “I will not help you in your endeavor,” and charged up the hill, toppling the giant and scattering its pieces to the four corners of the land. 

The next giant approached from behind and whispered “Help me drill into the heart of this land and I will drain its blood for all of us to drink.” The new being was repulsed by this and picked up a big stick which he swung at the giant, breaking it limb from limb as its black blood drained into the earth. 

The giants circled around the new being and began devouring the very forest that sheltered them. He drew a circle around himself and declared that they could not cross. The first tried but was repulsed by the new being’s force of will. Another reached for a bit of stone that was within the circle and felt its hand catch flames. The new being smiled, “this is under my protection.”

The giants left, having grown hungry for the wilderness that housed them. Wherever there was a patch of green, the new being drew a line around it and the  giants were forever forbidden from intruding. The new wilderness became places of wonder and beauty, where kind and gentle things could live and wander. 

Seeing that his work was done, the new being relaxed against a granite mountain and rested, eventually becoming stone himself.",PoopsForDays

As soon as it came on everyone in the room hushed each instantly. There was another sighting again.

The sighting was over at the Industry district by Calvuin city. There was another mob hit that tried to raid the local energy towers of the Seves cells that powered the city, buildings, factories even appliances in the residential area. The mob didn't kill anyone. No one in the mob was killed either, they were given a beating according to authorities. The mob members were tied to the Seves energy tower... with a steel energy cable torn from the tower.

The actual sighting was a three second clip of her, people started calling her the Blue Bellsen years ago. Blue because someone had claimed that she had blue eyes, no one on Trappist-1f had blue eyes. Bellsen was a type of animal on Trappist-1f. Bellsens were quick, strong and could leap 20 meters from without any head start. The clip was a figure tying a knot around the mob members and bounding off frame in a flash.

Tara was watching intently, along with her brood members and mother and father. The father was the first to speak, claiming that the film was faked. Tara's brood member, Kilo, gasped and said that was impossible. Before long the whole family had erupted into chaos after a few moments. Tara decided it was time to leave and take a breath of fresh air outside.

Outside, she could see the sun setting, the ruby-red sun was thinning into a sliver on the horizon. The other Trappist planets were crescents in the sky, there were four of them tonight. Tara knew that the Blue-Bellsen was real, she had never seen her before, but she knew. She felt it, believed it. Where could she have come from? One of the other Trappist planets? The nearest star system that they knew of was nearly 40 light years and only had 2 possibly habitable planets. Tara was too exhausted to think anymore. There had been several essays at the Education district. There had been too much to think about and she was ready to rest her head.

She rest her head in her hands, rubbing her temples and wiping her eyes. She was going to head back inside, but before she decided to come back inside her mother came out to see her. ""What do you think it is?"" she asked. The wind had brushed her hair to the side ever so slightly. 

Tara sighed and leaned back, ""I don't know. I want to believe it, but I just don't know.""

Her mother walked over and wrapped her arms around her, ""It's possible I think, she's been around for years. She's been here since you were born and since I was born. It's not completely out of the question.""

Tara was already losing focus, ""I'm just going to go to bed. I need some sleep."" She broke away from her mother and headed back to the house.

""Tara,"" her mother called, ""I love you.""

Tara gave a weak smile, ""I love you too.""

Her mother stayed outside for a moment longer, just to look at the sun. It's little red glow was barely visible now. As the sky turned from blue to orange to red, a small glimmer of blue shined in her mother's eyes, a smirk, and she went inside with her Trappist-1f family.",jcharold21

""Hello and welcome to breakfast with Becky Watson and John Arlington,"" the chirpy young anchorwomen announced before continuing.

""It's Tuesday the 28th of February and these are your headlines.""

It was this one line that had paralyzed the young man. The 28th of February, Tuesday... the 28th of February. As if the phrase were an ancient spell or curse it had left him frozen in place; mute like a child and every bit as uncomprehending as one. Still desperately trying to understand the situation he now found himself in, he collapsed into a chair in front of the t.v as for the 1st time in a long time he heard news that was actually news to him. 

Perhaps it had all been a dream, perhaps he had imagined the whole thing, perhaps everything would be okay. This vain thought drove him to leap from his chair and rush to his garage. Unfortunately for him it was exactly that, a vain thought. Once again he was sent back into shock as he stood in the doorway to his garage staring at the workbench upon which he had laid and carefully covered his old friends body.

Stumbling towards the bench and placing his hands against the bottom of the sheet Baird began to shake with rage, his stomach turning as his anger bubbled up and seethed to the surface. Balling his hand into a fist he struck the steel table sending the whole surface into a violent convulsion as he cried out in pain. With that he collapsed to his knees and began to weep.

""How have I sinned, what wrong have I committed, what mistake has so offended you that I would be the butt of this cruel joke!?"" Through tears of anguish and anger Baird howled at his injustice laying the blame, and the corpse he now knelt by, squarely at the feet of god.

""What does it do for you, all that power, to ruin my life? How petty a thug you must be!"" 

It had been at least a year, it could've been years, since Baird had known any day but yesterday. Long ago he'd lost count of how many times he had endured that day. How many times he had prayed that when he awoke it would be tomorrow. How many times he had cried as he had heard the headlines of the 27th of February again. Finally he had done something with the day, finally he had chosen to fight back, finally he had given up on seeing tomorrow and seized the day! As if some sick joke it was then he finally got his tomorrow, just as he had ruined it and maybe every day afterwards for himself.

When he was fired yesterday he didn't think it could've gotten any worse. At least he had his wife to come home to and comfort him he told himself the 1st time he lived through that fateful day. It must have all been a dream he told himself the 2nd time. It can't go on forever he told himself the 3rd time. He didn't tell himself anything the fourth time as he once again walked through his front door, quietly up the stairs to him and his wife's room and into their bed to see her and his ""friend"" Dan already there. 

It had always been a competition between him and Dan; when he had lost his job and Dan been promoted though it became something else. Something cheating with his wife on him was now a part of. Alone and cast out into the cold there was no life to carry on with for him, nothing to do, no one to live for. This was why he thought he was destined to never see tomorrow at first. Perhaps there wasn't a tomorrow for him? But there were only so many times Baird could endure the rejection, the loss, the loneliness before he could take no more. 

It was after that point he skipped work that day. After that point he bought a handgun. After that point he made sure Dan wouldn't be setting foot in his house ever again. After that point he told his wife what he knew and kicked her out into the cold. Perhaps she would run to Dan, shame he wouldn't be around to take her in. It was the first time he had smiled in a day. 

Now as if it were all some sick joke his revenge had been turned on him and he was stood over a corpse, motive, method and opportunity abounding about him. If yesterday it seemed as though there was no tomorrow for him, there certainly wasn't one anymore.",Money_Mad

###Chapter One

How could I be so stupid? Even an apprentice Conjurer knows how good the ords have gotten at science. They understand our biology much better than we ever will. We break a leg, we just mend it with the Divine Arcane. They break a leg? Weeks! Maybe months! Letting their own bodies heal what they can. Praying to the Arcane as if it hears them. It is absolutely miraculous that we ever discovered attunement in the first place. Pondering how long they've survived on this rock with only what comes naturally to them will never cease to amaze me.
 
Of course they noticed. A case this big, I never had a chance of it slipping through. We're supposed to be invisible. Three hundred and eighty-four years the Arcay have watched over them, only once coming even close to being discovered. And now this!? Brill's Blunder has nothing on this. Brill's Blunder shall henceforth be referred to as Brill's Minor Mishap That We Only Even Remembered Because Of How Perfect The Arcay Had Been Before Leon Came Along. 

Fuck. Me.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Archon Leon read the words over again, desperately digging for an idea. Some spark of imagination lost to shock, some hint of resourcefulness in his most worrisome, some modicum of creativity amidst his total and unrelenting panic. When he decided to document his first rotation as Archon, not once did he imagine he'd be documenting the end of the Divine Arcane as we know it. Despite his state of complete panic, Archon Leon appeared calm and comfortable. Sitting in his gigantic, deep-purple sofa chair covered almost entirely with gemstones, some of which glimmered with a spectrum of color that could only be described as magical, he pondered the end of his order, awash with the dim light emanating from his fireplace.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The fireplace itself was gorgeous, an unnatural blending of marble and brick that seemed to persuade one's eyes to it's center, as if the entire thing  were but an optical satellite dish, designed to guide the eyesight of any who glance upon it towards it's glorious center. In that center, a binary star that would make any purveyor of beauty take extended pause. The larger half emanating a familiar orange, the smaller half a foreign greenish-blue. Rotating around each other like magnets in some science experiment. Flares coming off of each, independently, randomly, brilliantly. Filling the room with a light unlike any seen by the ords. A combination of warm and cool, it was as if the light was artificial and real at the same time. As they spun around each other, different tones altered in domination. In one moment, the entire room a dim blue, hushed, meditating. In another, a brilliant orange flare bounces off of every surface as if a fireworks display had exploded from the corner and reflected brilliantly off of every surface. Archon Leon sat there in his chair, his throne, so used to this brilliance that he no longer even took note of it. The only thing on his mind was how he would ever get out of this. On the table next to him, a large and crystal-clear tablet displayed the front page of The Times:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;UNEXPLAINABLE DISCREPANCY IN FIVE HORSEMEN'S BLOOD EVIDENCE

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Department of Investigation released a statement today confirming rumors about the blood evidence discovered last week which led to the arrest of The Five Horsemen:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""The rumors that have been going around have been confirmed to be true,"" spokeswoman Lisa Porelli stated. ""The blood found at the scene of the most recent killing in New Rome has been confirmed to be... unnatural. Deep analysis of the samples revealed that it must have come from a newborn child. The Quark Resonance Patterns match conclusively to the alleged leader of the cabal, a one Mr. Frank Noon, but this blood could not actually be his. While DNA has not been a reliable indicator of association since the early 21st century, we still look into it as a sanity check and, while it also matches conclusively to Mr Noon, it is far too young. This DNA must have come from a newborn child, no older than 3 months. Mr Noon is 47 years old. The only plausible explanation our research team can come up with is that the blood comes from a very new clone of Mr. Noon. We understand how unlikely this explanation is, given not only the Global Cloning Agreement of 2123, but also that it is physically impossible for a clone and its donor to have identical QRPs, but that is the only theory we have at this point. We are continuing to pursue other explanations and will be providing daily updates. Rest assured, we will work day and night to make sure these five monsters can never kill again.""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Noon and his four alleged co-conspirators are being held by President Giar'do under the Global Constitution's ""obscene evil"" clause, but the DOI has only two more weeks to definitively prove the allegations before having to concede mis-accusation, which would not only free The Five Horsemen to continue their campaign of terror, but would also result in the immediate resignation of Giar'do, the first President of Earth to be re-elected to a seventh consecutive term. We reached out to renowned statistician Dr. Sue Morthynosi who put it rather succinctly for us: ""The likelihood of killings resuming upon release of The Five Horsemen cannot be understated. It is, effectively, 100%. The margin of error is 3.4 x 10^71. You are more likely to get struck by lightning while getting struck by different lightning while watching your winning lotto numbers get drawn on live TV while the host gets struck by lightning. Way more likely."" DNA, QRP, or cloning experts with ideas on how such blood could exist are being urged to contact DoI spokeswoman Lisa Porelli immediately.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Archon Leon shuffled in his chair, and the quill floating before him started dancing again.

---

How could I forget the damn DNA!? There's no way around this. I'm going to have to tell them about us, about the Arcane. I'm going to have to be the final Archon. Too many know about the discrepancy, I couldn't possibly patch this up with memory charms, I'd have had to freeze time or something! And I couldn't just change the blood after they'd already analyzed it, that'd just leave them with even more questions.

I guess this is it. May the Arcane forgive me. Hopefully everything we know about mass attunement is wrong.

---

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He let out a long sigh and the quill vanished. The journal closed on itself and then started floating towards his head. Smaller and smaller it shrunk, spinning towards its creator. Close to his face, the diary evaporated into a small cloud of fog that hung around him. Leon inhaled it all in one long, sturdy breath, and then exhaled with great relief. As he stood up from his chair, certain it would be his last time, he glanced once more at the news tablet on the table in front of him. He had read that little article a hundred times, each night hoping there would be a new one to replace it, where one of those experts had indeed come up with some theory. He used his fingers to swipe the tablet forward two weeks, revealing last night's headline ""GIAR'DO TO CONCEDE MIS-ACCUSATION TOMORROW"". He shook his head in disbelief, mumbled profanities to himself, and then left for court. The ords had no idea that the most important court session in history was about to take place.

He was independent from everything. They decided to follow him. As the group got older, more and more people were surprisingly impressed by this display of independence and began to follow his teachings of rolling on the ground. Eventually, as the nation was swept by this trend, Bob was naturally assumed to be the leader of this group.  
*****
Bob made his annual rolling address in front of the nation. Rolling is very hard to translate, but the best translation that could be made of that address were that they were a strong nation and would continue to stay strong, as long as they rolled their way to dominance over surrounded countries. At least, that's what his followers would have said.
*****
Leaders across the globe were puzzled by the odd behavior being displayed in Bob's country. However, the common people were amazed by the rolling. There were rolling movements in certain countries. As the establishment desperately tried to suppress this fringe group, the world gradually descended into madness.
*****
According to his closest advisors, Bob would have been very happy about what his movement had accomplished, if he could have seen or heard it. The world was one nation, devoted to rolling. Pockets of resistance appeared, but they were quickly exterminated whenever found. Bob was growing old, and his latest rolling address indicated that he would pass on the reins of power to another. As the people rolled their applause, no one noticed the one, lone tear that formed in Bob's eye. ",habbadodo

I press my phone to my door and it unlocks with a heavy thunk. This is the hundredth time I've stepped outside this year and I've learned twelve locksmith points, the app tells me. The lights turn on as I step through the apartment hallway, I idly whisper the lyrics to that one song, *Dance Off*, and I'm in sudden darkness. Down the stairs and outside, my mailbox shoots political mailers at my face that I dodge by the edge of an automatic letter-opener. 

Outside, the parking meters flash red and remind me of my parking ticket which was accrued by my self-driving car. When I emailed the support desk of Tesla, they sent me a validation survey to make sure I wasn't a car pretending to be a person. Needless to say, I can't drive because I moved my cursor a little too quickly. 

The light at the crosswalk indicates how many steps I can take before the light will turn and a car will narrowly not hit me because it's programmed not to do so -- but it will heavily inconvenience someone who will tell me to eat a bag of dicks, reusable of course, since plastic is banned. By the time I'm at the coffee shop the line is out the door. Everyone's here to write their ebook indiscreetly in front of a non-captive audience who all wants to do their online homework. 

In line, I order my coffee through my phone. It's free because the customer happiness automation service cloud has determined I've been looking across the street to Dunkin Cronuts a few too many times this month. Well, that's nice. Maybe I'll drink at Staryuan a few more times. 

The machine prints my full name and birthdate on the side of the cup and motors it across the counter. The four people working behind it stand there and smile and thank everyone, but do little else.

With a coffee in my hand, I walk outside and make my way towards a bench. As I sip it, the cup changes color to indicate the temperature and the amount of liquid left inside. I ignore it and look towards the clouds and take a deep breath. 

All I can see up there is skywriting that tells me I can save 15% or more on automatic auto insurance if I switch to Geico, and I think about it. Yeah, maybe when I get my car back. For now though?

Step back through zee scanner!"" Seems the store had some problems with price matching shoppers recently and decided to implement the biometric booth to deter would be credit pinchers. Shoplifting was a thing of the past as stores no longer had any physical stock to steal. In this day and age all items were purchased through Amazon and delivered by drone or AmazeX delivery service for larger items.

I braced myself as the people mover ran backwards then forwards to put me thru the bio scanner once again. Helga approved my passage with a slightly warmer, ""Welcome to zee Amazon Product Forest Michael""

Stores only existed for people to find new products or the older generations to walk around and reminisce the good ol' days. I wheeled past aisle after aisle of holographic product displays on my TeslaWay scooter until I reached the toiletries. As I entered a holographic service representative materialized in front of me.
""Good evening Mr. Hunt. May I assist you in locating any new products today?"". This holo was a Cortana model, Microsoft had been slowly losing market dominance once Oracle purchased what was left of Apple in the late '20s. Innovated themselves right out of business those guys. Nobody wanted a glass computer, terahertz of processor speed meant nothing if the entire thing was a fragile touch screen. Once Apple introduced the optical ports for any and all peripherals, a keyboard costing a third of what the Mac Proglass (pronounced Progress) retailed for, the entire company went belly up in less than 3 years. Microsoft had many years of market dominance until the Linux Ubuntu flavor spread like wildfire amongst the tech savvy populace in the early '40s. Now you were either a windows fan boy or you 'knew what you were doing' and used Linux. Amazon store or not the product aisle holos were maintained by the company's that wanted their products displayed. And it seemed Johnson &amp; Johansson(European merger in the early ‘30s) stuck with Microsoft.

""Hi I need a new razor my last one broke."" I replied to Cortana. 'Broke' being a misnomer, one of the gyros took a shit and the head pivoted giving me a nice slice of my jaw line. Gone were the days of bad reviews resulting in great customer support. Consumers no longer have a say in the the products they own, either it was within the warranty period or it wasn't. Mine had expired 3 hours prior, coincidence or planned obsolescence? Arguing these points with a hologram seemed quite pointless as leaving bad reviews resulted in higher prices for the user. As a result all products had a 5 star rating on Amazon.

""I'm sorry to hear that sir. would you like to hear about the latest developments from the Gillette company?"" I didn't but knew that sitting through an ad was sometimes rewarded with discounts on products or accessories. ""Please..."" I replied thru gritted teeth.

Cortana disappeared and in a flash was replaced with the Gillette logo. 
""Introducing the latest in Gillette shaving technology! Featuring 4 independent gyroscopic controlled head pivoting micro motors!(My broken razor had 3)
All NEW lubrication strip reservoir technology that will refill every time you rinse your razor!!(While a cool new feature, with water rations on the rise it seemed a bit in bad taste.)
And FINALLY Gillette would like to introduce the latest in blade technology! With cutting power surpassed only my medical grade laser scalpels and introducing the ability to change blade exposure for the MOST comfortable shave you will ever have! Gillette is proud to present Occam's Razor!(I rolled my eyes at the ironic, but gimmicky name some young marketing shill had pulled out of his ass... Wait how many blades did that head have?)
""Thats right! The new Occam's Razor from Gillette has 13 blades! That's nearly 25% more blades from our previous model the Gillette Decade-ance!! Which only had 10 blades and NO blade exposure adjustment capability!"" I was dumbfounded. Once again I had to roll my eyes at the marketing ploys these companies employed. It seemed everything needed to be faster, more accurate, and just have more unnecessary bells and whistles.

Cortana reappeared as the razor faded into nothingness. “Well Mr. Hunt what do you think? Would you like this item to be delivered to your residence?”

I thought it was an over engineered piece of garbage, but I knew as new models came out the old were recycled so everyone was forced to upgrade. Which meant I would have to buy new replacement blades as well. “Yes, and add a pack of replacement heads as well, please” I sighed. Today was going to be expensive. Cortana glanced upwards as though thinking and then looked back at me. “Your new razor should arrive before you even get home Mr. Hunt!. I started to turn away. “Sir, you have qualified for a free trial of Colgate's newest Teeth Whitening System, MoonPaste!! Using Moon dust they have created a new product that is guaranteed to make your smile shine as bright as a full moon!” Cortana smiled herself showing absurdly white teeth that didn’t exist before this latest ad started.

“No thank you.” I replied.

“Well enjoy shaving Mike Hunt!” Cortana cheerfully replied.

I smiled as I walked away. There was only one reason I came to these stores and that was to buy new razors.",KraZe_EyE

""Call Jimmy,"" I said into my arm.  A 2 inch Rachel Starr-looking secretary dressed in a low cut plaid skirt, tiny reading glasses, and an extra small white button up was instantly projected on top of my arm hairs in 3D.

""Of course Master Kweku,"" she said slowly and seductively as she winked and connected me.

After 10 seconds of waiting, Jimmy was projected in 2D video chat on the display of my iARM-x.  He was sitting on the couch in his mom's basement with cheeto crumbs stuck in his chest pubes and 2 joysticks in his hands.

""What is it, bro? I am in the middle of an intense Rocket League game?"" he said as he was cranking his head around like a confused ostrich.

""Bro I don't give a shit about your stupid rocket league game.  It's time to execute plan 4.82. TODAY!""

""No way. Are you serious? What did they do this time?""

""Alright fine man, I think you might be losing it, but I think it is finally time we do something."" Jimmy took off his headset and looked at his computer screen where I was projected.  ""I'll pick you up in 5.""

I walked outside without saying anything to my mom who was grunting loudly and doing the downward dog with her pink VR headset on in the living room. I grabbed my puffy down jacket from the coat rack, put my Eagles beanie on over my long oily brown mullet, and jolted out the front door.  I hopped down the front steps, trudged through the snow covered driveway, and hopped into Jimmy's 2006 forest green Jeep Grand Cherokee.

""Do you have the the explosives?"" I asked him.

He reached behind him and grabbed the stack of red dynamite wrapped in a thin black rubber coated wire.  He ordered it off the Silk Road six months ago when we first discussed our plan to stick it to the greedy capitalistic pigs after binge watching season 8 of Black Mirror. 

""I got it bro. Do you have Crest's headquarters loaded up in your iARM-X?"" He asked as he tossed the dynamite on the back seats.  

""Rachel,"" I said into my arm.  

""Yes Master Kweku,"" she said in her sensual high pitched voice as she bowed towards the edge of my arm.

"[WP] It is the year 2060, razors have 10 blades and toothpaste gimmicks are getting ridiculous.",SirRosstopher,"Ahh, Monday morning, just the thing you don't need after a night of playing 'roy' with your friends on virtual space.
*Sigh* 
I wish we had those primitive beds which weren't programmed to wake you up and send you to the 'ready room' using conveyers.
I miss my childhood, when I could just pretend to be sick and not go to school, but you can't use that trick now cause of the identification band which is given to us on birth and removing them is illegal, it is only removed when the person is dead.
The band however is more than just an identification tag, it is a health monitor, an e-newspaper, also I can transfer RUHARK (universal currency) to anyone. And I can sync it with my i-light and have notifications about events and stuff.

So as alarm goes off, the bed starts to tilt till it is fully vertical and cause of this I have to stand no matter how much in a sleep sleep I am.
Then the floor starts to move and pushes me to the ready room, here the teeth cleaner greets me and while using UV radiation to clean my teeth tells me about the weather and the latest news updates.
After that it is time for stomach cleaning, thank God that's still like old days, but the toilet has seen many changes, for one it is now artificially warmed to give us comfort, and the faecal matter is vacum sealed and disposed.
We still have the pleasure of passing the poop on our own, but am sure some nutjob is out there thinking of doing this by inserting a tube up your butt, I hope I die before that happens, so much has changed, it is like I have stepped into a wrong time with all these fancy things, in my childhood we used to do things as we pleased and we used to do it together and have fun, but now everything is automated, I could press a button on the kitchen tablet and have a pizza ready in 5 mins. But I cannot make it myself, cause of all the automation those ovens and tools have been discarded, now nobody sells them.
These new type of pizzas are no match for what my mom used to make, my mouth waters every time I think about them.

No point thinking about old times, we gotta enjoy the present if we like it or not, breakfast is ready and 10 mins till hyperloop bus departs for Pluto where my office is.",tsar567213

""That will be $3.49, please,"" the cashier responded.

Sam handed the employee a 5 dollar bill. ""Thank you sir,"" he told the bald cashier.

The cashier's eyebrows angrily rose higher than one would have thought was physically possible. ""Sir? Excuse me?"" The employee grew more upset. ""I'm a woman!""

""Oh my god, I'm so sorr-"" Sam began to apologize.

""Just because I shave my head, that means I'm a man?!"" She yelled back.

This man has been conversationally checkmated. There is no reply Sam can say without making an ass of himself. What is he to say, ""Your facial structure is masculine""? Checkmate.

It gets worse. Sam was on his lunch break several hours later. He walked to the park to meet up with his friends. Sam sat at a bench with his friend Thomas playing chess while they waited for Ryan.

Sam called out to a male, Asian passerby, ""Ryan!""

The man stopped and looked at Sam. Sam now realized his mistake. ""Oh, I thought you were someone else, my apolog-""

""So I suppose all Asians look alike to you?"" The man demanded.

"[WP] Peter Piper picked a pack a pickled peppers, but why?",TheDragonRoar,"Personal Log Y2M1D27:

So close. The peppers should be ready after tonight.  I just hope, I just hope it works. I ran a big risk with this plan and I won't be able to reconfigure the CRISPR.  So, in case it doesn't work, I just want anyone who finds this to know that I tried.  

In case all other files are destroyed with only this remaining, here's another debrief on the events of the past year.

February 26, 2017, a craft fell into Earth's orbit, a capsule.  Upon investigation, we found that it contained bacterial life. This was first contact.  The surrounding area was immediately quarantined, but it was too late.  Upon joining any multicellular host, they'd take in a cell and process it's genetic material, producing specialized viruses. Myself, and my team found out about this right before entering this bunker, where we searched for a cure.

You see, this virus changed people. Physically speaking, it's not noticeable, but it changed the way we thought and communicated. It takes months to affect humans, but just over a year has passed now. I remain the only living member of my team.  

A colleague and close friend of mine, Michelle Mendez, found a gene in chili peppers that created a compound that, when fermented, could be consumed to cure Contact-1. At least, we thought it would... I still do, or at least hope.  

Long live humanity.

It came away with small blotches of blood. He pulled his tattered back pack from his shoulder and chucked it against the metal fence just a few yards off to his left. The bag rebounded off the fence and slid in the dirt. Ellis spared a hateful glance behind him. Unconsciously his hands made a fist. He threw a punch at the face of an imaginary individual and screamed in anger.

""Next time Reese you will be the one bleeding."" Ellis' anger was subsiding and the pain of the fight was coming to the fore front of his mind. He leaned against the fence and slid to the ground. 

""Was this yours?"" The voice of a girl asked. Ellis' head shot up. His eyes wide with fear. He nodded. Had she heard what he said? She handed him his back pack and then sat against the fence a few feet away.

""You are taller and stronger than Reese. Why didn't you fight back?"" She asked. Her voice was sweet. Ellis could almost hear concern in it.

""I am afraid."" Ellis said.

""Afraid of losing and being laughed at?"" The girl asked. Ellis remembered her name. She went by Harper and had been relocated a few years ago to the Mundane colony. 

""Afraid I will enjoy hurting people."" Ellis said. The confession seemed loud in the waning house of the day. Harper didn't respond. He heard the shuffling of dirt beside him and looked over at her. She was gone. A pair of ripped light blue jeans stood in her place. 

Ellis' heart sank as his focus rose higher. Reese slammed a fist down at Ellis' upturned face. Ellis closed his eyes in anticipation but it never landed. A second later he heard a crack like a tree branch breaking then a howl of agony. Ellis opened his eyes.

Above him was Harper and Reese. Reese clung to his arm where the bone was tasting fresh air for the first time. Its edge was jagged and blood flowed from the wound like a leaky faucet. Harper's hand flashed and Reese's scream was cut short. In the blink of an eye she landed a quick punch to his throat. Reese collapsed to the ground.

Screams and yells erupted just around the corner.

""Quick, take my hand!"" Ellis took her hand but knew the shouts were too close. They would round the corner and find a boy close to death and him with a bloody face. He would be the one charged with assault. 

As Harper's fingers intertwined with his the world stopped. He looked up at her. A slight grin across her face. 

""You told me your secret. It's only fair I show you mine. Just don't let go."" Hand in hand, Ellis picked up his bag and the contents which spilled. When it was resting on his shoulder again, they strolled away. They had walked North five blocks in the span of just a few seconds. 

They walked a few more blocks and found a bench to sit on. When they stopped Harper asked, ""Whats it like to be Mundane, to not have an ability? Does time pass at the same rate all the time?""

Ellis looked at her confused. ""It's boring. Mundane's can't do anything special. We don't have any inherent talents and can't participate in the anything really. We barely exist to the outside world. Were just boring and useless. Don't you control time or speed or something?"" Harper nodded.

""Time, but it's not that simple. I can make time go slower or faster but oftentimes I can't control for how long."" Harper looked over at Ellis. Behind his eyes she could seem him trying to work through the meaning of what she said. ""For the last few days, this has been how fast time has been going for me.""

A few moments passed and then Ellis finally answered. ""So when you were sitting next to me by the fence earlier?""

""It was hours of trying to sit perfectly still.""

""And the fight?""

""Like playing with a life sized doll.""

""And what happens now?"" 

Harper smiled, ""Now we have fun till time starts to speed up again."" She kissed him on the cheek and then bolted off the bench, pulling Ellis to his feet.",Mile29

They are called mundanes and all of them live in a small commmunity in a nice, quiet place in the world not by choice, but by law.",Tubaanonymous,"I used to be huge fan of reading ancient texts when I was child. You can learn so much from early humans. It fascinated me to think of what a car would be like careening across the earth, or the terror in peoples minds as they rode in those metal tubes that flew through the air. However, as amazing as these things were, what fascinated me the most was looking at a world that existed before Project Enhancement was unleashed. It did nothing for the first humans that were exposed to this magic in 2418. However, their children and every generation after were given amazing abilities. Emotion manipulation, telekinesis, necromancy, and the list goes on and on. Seventeen thousand documented abilities and counting. 
And then there was us, The Mundanes. People with whom the world shut away in a box and pretended we didn't exist. Because we didn't have the magical gene, we were irrelevant. Unable to vote, fight for our country, or own land or property. Confined our entire lives to a small continent off the coast of Asia. However today was different. Not for me, or just me, but for the entire population of over thirty thousand mundanes. You see, these ancient manuscripts weren't just my hobby, they were all that my life meant, and all that it would be. They were going to be what would make me the greatest human being, the greatest mundane, of all time.
     
                                                       ...

I reached the cave where my team and I were to meet. 

""Jessoph, this had better be important."" Said Merrick, as he slid off the rock he was perched on.
""My friend, nothing in history has ever been so important, and nothing in the future will ever be the same."" I said, whispering the end for emphasis.
He stared at me ""Well get on with it!""
I slid my backpack I made out of old fabric off my shoulder and let it clunk ominously on the table in front of me. ""Before i go on and show you what i know, i need you to understand what will be happening tomorrow morning."" i said bluntly. ""Tomorrow morning The Ductor, the leader of the Enhanced world, will be visiting our little paradise to explain how they'll be moving us to the northern part of the island and opening the City of Mundane up to be used by the Enhanced. Tomorrow, our entire race moves one step closer to being pushed into the ocean and lost forever."" I stared around the cave at the four sets of eyes looking back at me or at the floor. 
""So"" i said loudly to bring their attention back, ""this brings me to the contents in my bag...""

                                                      ...
     
We watched the Ductor standing arrogantly at the podium, looking down at us with disdain and hatred in his eyes. He was a level five Emotional Manipulator, and currently the strongest Enhanced in the world. The levels were given at birth when abilities are assessed. From the moment your born, they'll know what your ability is and how powerful you'll be. Only level fives were even considered for office, and ran until their deaths. As the Ductor started speaking to the Mundane audience, we crept around under the stage. He had a lot of security with him, all level fours, but luckily none with a detector gene. We saw our opening and the five of us dashed on stage. 
The Ductor turned to us. ""What in the hell are you doing child?!""
I stared at him with venom pouring out of my eyes. ""I'm ending you, and the foul treatment of the Mundanes forever."" I said scathingly, the venom laced in my words. I felt all four of my friends beside me, and my fear subsided a little.
The Ductor laughed, a full belly laughter that shook the stage. I couldn't help it, i started smiling, and then burst out into laughter myself. Tears pouring out of my eyes, i looked up at the Ductor. He was staring straight into my eyes, no longer laughing. I couldn't stop, i didn't want to laugh, but my body kept going. Slowly the laughter faded and i started feeling terrible, like there was no happiness to be had in the world. Thoughts of suicide and release flashed through my mind, and i relished at the chance to leave this life forever...
""Don't you see, i can end you if i want, and never touch you. I can make you end someone else, and never be there."" he whispered, ""there is no stopping me child.""
Out of nowhere Merrick and my other four friends charged at the Ductor. Two feet away, they all stopped in their tracks, crying and screaming in rage, threatening to kill each other.
I took the opportunity and pulled the book out of my bag, flipping it quickly to the page i had saved. I began to chant softly ""cognoscimus ut nostris tollemus"". The third time it left my mouth, my friends and the Ductor dropped to the ground. I felt a wave of energy wash over me and nearly threw up as nausea plagued my stomach. As it passed i looked up. My friends were standing up, but the Ductor was still laying on the ground staring up at them. I walked slowly over to him, and stared down at his confused eyes. 
""What have you done to me"" he stuttered, his eyes widening.
My friends were standing beside me. ""Lets just say that the five of us can now end you if we want, and never touch you. We can make you end someone else, and never be there"" i said ruefully, venom again laced in my voice.
""Its not what Ive done to you that's important, its what Ive done for us. WHAT IVE DONE FOR ALL OF US"" i screamed, staring at the crowd.
I turned back to the Ductor, squatted down until we were eye level and showed him the ancient tome I had read from, the tome that after a lifetime of reading finally held the answer to equality. ""You were a level five Enhanced. The five of us are now a level one Enhanced. You do the math, oh great Ductor.""

You eventually realize that you are LITERALLY in the future, and events in the present are still shaping the world.",Xerit_Zercher,"Volunteers for the LUMO-DX Mk.III had to undergo a rigorous schedule of screenings - both physical and psychological. Over three-hundred candidates, from any background one can name, stepped forward for the chance at seeing the future. Literally. The private sector had made several such portable devices, operating on principles that - while outlined in a manual heavier than the apparatus -  are far beyond my understanding. Therefore, it begs the question: why was I selected to test the pinnacle of MYRIAD Enterprises research?

I'm not remarkable in terms of wealth, academic, or social standing. Definitely not in personal success - for christ's sake, I develop websites for a living. The math I use most frequently is devoted to the dwindling numbers in my bank account. Meanwhile, there were Ph.D candidates running on treadmills next to me, many with military backgrounds that had decided re-enlistment was a boring prospect. I'll tell you what I think the answer was.

I had something to run from. It kept me going. It pushed me. I abused myself, punished myself, for six months...but I still had to keep going. Or the memories crept back in. Where better to go than the future - my future?

So there I was. Alone, in the dark, sitting on a cushioned floor of a room in an underground facility made to pierce the veils of causality. With a loser like me as the unsuspecting bullet. 

Over an intercom, a tinny voice announced: ""Mr. Castrado. Whenever you're ready, we'll begin the count.""

I adjusted the cumbersome contraption strapped to my arm, and winced as I felt the briefest of alien movements underneath my skin. Without it, I'd be much like a phone without a battery - a collection of winding wires, wrapped underneath the plastic casing to various connecting boards. The LUMO's module was like the cellphone casing, attached to my arm with a special plastic coupling. Though hardly copper wire, the rest of it was composed of an extensive network of interlaced fiber cables - thinner than a strand of hair - woven in to various parts of my body. Skin, skeleton, even some of my organs. Definitely, judging by the imaging injection they'd given me after the surgery, as a spidering layer of mesh surrounding the inside of my skull. And, no matter what the research team described as a hallucination, I knew I could feel them all shift whenever the external contraption was attached to my forearm. In combination with the injections they'd given me throughout the weeks leading up to this, I felt more like a Sci-Fi convention set piece than a living, breathing human.

""I'm ready."" I lied. 

""Just remember: when you've reincorporated, don't forget to push the blue button. Otherwise..."" 

""I know, I know."" I replied, impatiently. ""Otherwise, I go bye-bye.""

""Otherwise,"" the voice continued, flatly, ""you're stuck. You'll have a narrow window in which to do so."" 

""Can I...have a drink first?"" I tried.

""We can't allow that, I'm sorry.""

*Her skin, pressed against my cheek. The earthy perfumes. Her breath, hot and humid in my ear.*

I swallowed, ""Let's get on with it.""

""Mark...Seven...Six...Five...""

*Her eyes. Alive in the light of a fire, dancing with mine through a trail of smoldering ash.*

""Four...Three...""

*The arch of her back as she clutches, and pulls at my hair. She closes her eyes...*

""Two...One...""

*...And she's gone.*

--------------

I was disoriented. Everything went fuzzy. Their research said that this was expected - very similar to the last hallucinatory sensory jumbling of a brain as it fired its last dying spark. The key difference was that mine would fire afresh. And oh boy, did it. But not in the ways I expected - for what that's worth.

Shifting waves of colors, and textures flashed in front of my eyes. I opened them, and closed them, just to make sure they were intact as expected. They definitely were. My ears picked up a buzzing cascade of chimes. It was similar to the sounds of those weird sound bowls they say are supposed to help with healing, or some such nonsense. A steady whining hum, interlaced with what sounded like a faraway swarm of locusts. I tested my muscles, one at a time before I dared to look down. When I did, I realized that I was intact. I was whole. But my surroundings had not consulted the aesthetic clarity that I possessed. My feet were standing on impossible geometries - and in them. I remembered thinking that if Edward Abbott had seen what I was seeing, his *Flatland* novella would have incorporated more hellish landscapes, and narratives. Because that's what it was.


I could as much see, as feel the microscopic pressures of unseen *things* as they folded, unfolded, and passed through my flesh. I felt for the LUMO's external module, and cheered as I found its fastenings had remained true. I tapped on the small screen, and selected from the unexpectedly friendly menu options to dull the barrage of sensations I was experiencing. Sure enough, the tingling that had spread throughout my body stopped. Then, I became as a lost ship in a fog, feeling little for the icy tendrils caressing my frame. I tried to walk, and found I went...many places. 

The kaleidoscope of colors and textures recombined as flashes of unfamiliar scenery. At some points, I was certain that I was moving backwards in space, even though I kept telling my legs to push my body forward. It was unsightly, unnerving, and I felt waves of nauseated panic take over as my world spun out of control. 

*Her panting, sibilance: ""I lo-""*

""STOP IT!"" I screamed.

The words sent ripples in the fabric of the scenery, undulating as if I'd thrown sand in water. What came next was reassuring. My words, for whatever reason, bounced around as a polyphonic echo that couldn't decide what it wanted to sound like. It settled on my actual voice when it finally came back to me. And her...

A flashing light lit up my screen, highlighting a single query: 

    Input/##.###.##.#/::? 

I needed to press the blue button on the underside of the LUMO's external casing, allowing the team back home to recall me from wherever...whenever?...I was. Would be? Grammatical correctness had always been emotionally confusing, but this would have given the linguistically gifted a hellish existential crisis. I searched the underside for the small button.

""Anthony..."" I thought I heard. My insides squirmed, and my head began to spin.
 
**BEEP**

I felt a hand on my shoulder. The scene coalesced into an uncomfortably familiar place.

------------------------------------------

""Where am I?"" I asked aloud, surveying the gray surroundings with apprehension. 

The hand spun me around. I saw her, and the blood left my face.

""Anthony, there you are!"" Said a breathy voice. ""I've been looking all over for you.""

I swallowed. We were standing on a railway platform. It was where Samantha and I used to go walking during the evening.

""I'm here."" I replied quickly. ""You're...what are you doing here?!""

Samantha turned her petite nose up that, and cocked her head, the short curls of tousled auburn falling about her perfect shoulders. 

""Are you feeling okay, babe?"" She asked, inspecting me with concern.

I tried to speak, but couldn't. I settled for wrapping my arms around her, hugging her so tightly I heard the wind leave her lungs.

""Baby,"" she choked, ""too tight!"" 

I let go immediately. I forgot how...easy it was to forget everything when I saw her. 

""You're...you're more beautiful than I remembered."" I stuttered. 

She smiled, and said, ""Flattery will get you places.""

I felt a wide grin splitting my face.

**BEEP**

""What was that?"" She asked, examining my arm.

Dammit! The button, how could I forget...?

 ""Baby, what happened to you? You're bleeding."" She uttered, touching my lip with her finger.

**BEEP...BEEP...BEEP**

Blood. There was blood on it.

""Nothing. Sammy, let's...let's just keep walking.""

The scene began to shift again. A roaring like the sound of a runaway train pierced the fantasy. Nearby, on the rails just beyond us, contours began to bend and twist into each other. She whirled around when she saw me staring.

""Baby?! What's happening?"" She cried, with a look of panic.

**BEEP**

""No."" I muttered. 

The waves came nearer. Out of the ethereal mist, the nose of a speeding bullet train formed, and bore down on us. 

**BEEP**

""ANTHONY!"" She yelled, gripping me in a tight embrace.

""NO!"" I screamed. But I heard it elsewhere. From far away, repeated again. And again.

The wave washed over. The train came, smashing into us, ripping the scene into dancing motes of color...and Samantha with it. I caught the last dying echo of her sobs.

There I was again. By the train tracks. And, there I also was, by the train tracks. Hugging Samantha  as we looked in on horror. The sounds of the screeching metal of the train derailed from just behind the mist. I heard the loud succession of 'NO' again, from further down the tracks. 

""NO!"" I screamed, and turned, watching the scene unfold. I wasn't sure, but I thought I saw them begin to move. To run. 

Then I was back, as I'd started...

“Hmpff, gyuh, heeeeeeeeve!” Jake found himself stretching and reaching for rock after rock as he slowly brought himself up the cliffside that had almost sent him to his death. “And to think, if I’d of just left that damned machine alone. But noooooo, I wanted to be adventurous, to risk the unknown for the potential reward.” He found himself a very small plateau where he was able to sit and fill his oxygen deprived lungs. As he rested, he began to recall the last 12 hours…

(12 hours prior)
“Alright Jake, I think we’ve finished it. You’ll be the first person to travel through time… to the future, that is.” Maxis was drooling at the sight of his very own creation. A hacked version of the “Time Stepper”, a time travelling machine that was used by “The Elites” to experience history first hand, rather than by reading books. 

Maxis and Jake, who were good friends, never really felt that the law pertained to them. Maxis, the mastermind had jumbled together a plan to steal one of the only 34 Time Steppers and modify it to be used for future travel, rather than historic travel. This was considered an extremely dangerous and theoretically impossible feat, but Maxis knew otherwise. He had read the chalkboard hundreds of times. The complex math equations told him time after time that it was in fact, possible. The only problem however, was that Maxis had neither the strength or guts to pull off the heist. You guessed it, this was where Jake was involved. A man who let his actions do the thinking rather than his brains, followed through Maxis’ tedious and intricate plan to steal the machine. I’ll spare the details of the heist, but it involved one “rented” helicopter, a large handful of explosives, and a determined, stealthy Jake.

“Soooooo, you’re sure this will work?” Jake was uselessly inspecting the modified machine. “It doesnt look any different…”

“Of Course! Have i ever built anything that didnt work?” Maxis was slightly hurt by Jake’s doubtfulness.

“Well, you know… It just that this is a little more high risk than anything i’ve done before.” Realizing what had just been said, Jake shook his head in disbelief that he had actually second guessed himself. “Who am I kidding,” Jake grew a smile, “This’ll be fine.”

(Current Time)
“This’ll be fine…” The words seemed so distant and innocent, though they had been said less than 12 hours ago, it seemed like the time spent in between had been much longer. A week, maybe a month even. 

Jake looked up, the bridge he had just attempted to cross was rapidly phasing in and out of existence, as though it couldn't decide if it wanted to be there. He lowered his head down to the dry riverbed below, trying to figure out where his deathbed could have been. Suddenly, upon glancing back up to the sky, he found that the bridge stopped phasing and remained where it was.

“COME ON! WHY COULDNT YOU DECIDE THAT EARLIER!” He knew he was talking to a bridge, but it somehow calmed himself down.

(Back in time again)
“Alright, what time are you sending me to?” Jake was strapped into the machine, ready to be sent to the future.

“Let's stay close to the present, how about this day and month in 2076?” Maxis gave Jake the illusion of choice as he had already set in the date.

“Sounds good, and you’re sure these headsets will transmit through time?”

“Ya, I’ll still be able to hear you back here. Ill be in your ear the entire time.”

“Okay, im ready when you are.” Jake tensed up a bit as he admitted to himself that he was actually nervous for once.

Maxis hit the giant red button to activate the machine.

“Hey! It worked! Im here! In the future.” Jake was filled with relief to see that all his limbs were sent along with him. He looked around, then wiped the smile from his face. “Wait, wh-where am I? You said that geographical location wouldnt change.”

“It didn’t, your tracker is telling me you’re right beside me, only nine years ahead of me.” Maxis had a tone of confusion and worry as he spoke.

“Well in that case, our flat has been completely destroyed, along with the entire city.” Jake looked around him continually, “There’s nothing but desert here, plain Arizona desert.” Nearly right after Jake finished speaking, almost tauntingly, the small city of Flagstaff, Arizona phased into existence, leaving Jake inside of his shared flat. “Oh. My. God.”

“What? What’s going on?” Maxis grew impatient upon Jake’s mysterious cliffhanger, “Jake?”

“It’s… here…”

“What? What’s here? What do you mean?”

“ The flat. Im in our flat.” Jake creeped to the window, slowly peeking through the curtains as though there were a murderer behind them. “The entire city is here.”

Maxis was now in complete awe. “No, it. Cant be. It is. But it cant.” He was now staring at his chalkboard. “Where did I go wrong? I should have seen this.” Then it hit him. Somewhere in the middle of his figuring, Maxis had left out a few lines of equations. “Jake, it seems I screwed up in my calculations.”

“Screwed up?”

“Ya, just. Give me a minute.”

Jake looked around outside, he didnt notice it at first, but the more he looked around, he noticed things change, people would suddenly vanish or appear. Then buildings would fall or rise in the blink of an eye, the entire skyline of Flagstaff was changing continually.

“Okay, I got it. Turns out the future is in a constant state of flux. Ever changing based on the slightest events that are occurring right now-- err, that is, for ME right now, not you.” Maxis was trying to explain things in terms that Jake would understand.

“So, you’re saying that, at anytime. Things could just… change. At random?”

“Ya, basically, I mean, it's not random. Each change has a reason to it. For example, lets say that you see a… toddler on the sidewalk. Well, that toddler can only exist if the parents stay together, so if they suddenly break up in my time, that toddler could just vanish.” Maxis realized in his head how dumb of an example he had just given, but it got the point across.

“Okay, so why would the entire city disappear? Wouldnt there be rubble or something?” Jake was having a hard time believing what was happening.

“I. I dont know Jake. Look, just get out of there, this could be a lot worse than I thought.” Maxis was quickly finding more and more mistakes on his chalkboard. “Ughhh. Look, there… are, other ways things can change, things that have already happened in my time, could be reversed.” Maxis was now finding it hard to explain the phenomenon to Jake.

“How, if it happened to you, than it must be concrete.” Jake was now trying to use his brain for once to make sense of his predicament.

“Not, exactly. It has to do with you being in the future. Basically, time itself cannot decipher where, or rather, when it is, because you are not where-- ugh, I mean WHEN you are supposed to be. Time thinks the present is actually in the future, so it's reversing things that have happened in the real timeline and swapping it for the blank history of this, err, new timeline that you are creating by being where you are. DANG IT! I mean, when you are, not where you are.” Maxis was now panicking as he quickly began to see the damage he had created.",timmmithy1

The way they formed neat little lines to and from their underground city fascinated me. The individuals had not even a hint of how insignificantly small they were just compared to the school yard. But they each knew their own part in keeping the city up and running.

I reached down with just a finger, slow and cautious, but a voice behind my shoulder stayed my hand: ""You shouldn't,"" said my guardian angel.

""Why?""

""They might hurt you."" So I withdrew my hand, at least for now.

Another kid, a boy, trotted up to the anthill across from me, his own guardian angel keeping pace behind him. ""Ants!"" he shouted, and thrust a hand down.

In a flash, the ants near and far became dust. No new ants emerged from the once bustling anthill. Only dashed lines of black ash extended from it.

The boy, confused, turned to the angel behind him. ""Wha' happened to 'em?""

""You were about to get hurt,"" the angel answered.

I froze for a moment. ""But only- you-"" I stammered, ""you didn't need to kill them all!""

""Kill? But I am sinless,"" said the boy's angel. Of course, all angels are sinless. They can never even know what sin is. He then turned to follow the boy, who had already found a new diversion.

""Stupid,"" I mumbled to myself.

""He didn't know better,"" my guardian angel said.

""I hate angels.""

""He only knows the rules. He doesn't know what's right or wrong. A lot like that ant. Its own rules told it to bite. It didn't know that bites hurt.""

""What about you?"" I asked. ""Would you have killed them? Lucifer?"" I looked back, but he was staring into space. ""Lucif-""

Damp walls, overflowing bins and a window that was so covered in grime that the daylight outside could only just squeeze through. 

I smiled nervously at the man in front of me. Tall, skinny with white fluffy hair and an old tweed suit. He stared uncomfortably back at me, his eyes glimmering with insanity. I could feel regret bubbling in the forefront of my mind, but I continued to take a seat in the dusty leather chair he was pointing toward. 

""Tell me, how old are you?"" he asked, as he picked a pear from a superfluous fruit bowl in the centre of his desk. 

""17."" I replied quietly, stopping myself from staring in disgust as the pear juice dribbled from his mouth before soaking into his neglected beard. 

""You look much older, Maggie."" He tilted his head in an exaggerate manner. Everything about Dr Austin was flamboyant, his character was the epitome of a stereotypical nutty professor. 

I had no response to his statement - it was one I had heard too many a time. My reflection was not a sight I enjoyed. I had become all too aware of the slight wrinkles appearing across my face and the deep bags under my eyes. 
""You're way too young to be getting wrinkles!"" my sister would exclaim. I would always shrug. I would always appear negligent to my rapidly aging skin. But I knew why. I knew that the mind-numbing, malicious and violent stress that raged inside me every single day was aging my skin and my mind twice as fast as it should. 

""Tell me, when did these experiences start for you?"" Dr Austin continued to suckle on his pear as his wild eyes locked on mine. 

""Ever since I can remember. My parents tell me I was unlucky as a baby too. Always ill, always in hospital, I had every allergy in the book."" I looked down at my fingers briefly, gathering the courage to ask a question that had been laughed off by every other person I'd met with. ""I heard about you through a help group, I heard that you believe in things... supernatural things..."" 

When I looked up, Dr. Austin was placing a scraggly book the size of a small dog onto the table. ""I was very interested by your story, your email,"" he spoke so frantically I had to watch his mouth to ensure I knew what he was saying, ""its one I've wondered about, one I've hoped could not be true but I believe in your case it is."" 

He opened up the book and searched through before triumphantly pointing at the centre of a page ""A-ha!"" without looking up from the page he reached out his long, skinny hand to usher me over to the desk. I studied his facial expression as he read the book. His eyes were wild with intrigue and concern as he eventually met my gaze. I slowly walked over, the realisation that my treacherous life may finally be diagnosed hit me like a ton of bricks. 

""Do you believe in guardian angels, Miss Stomacky?"" his hand moved back down towards the page and I followed his finger as it moved towards a large, black painting centre page. ""Because I think this might be yours."" 

The sketch was old but revealed a tall human-like figure with two horns and a haunting smile. He stood adjacent to flames as tall as a building, and his small, black eyes looked through the page as if they were real. The caption contained only one word, a word that consumed me with terror.

""Lucifer"" I gasped.

Suddenly, the ground began to shake and the old bookshelf behind me collapsed. Dr. Austin threw his arms above his head in a panic as the shaking became fiercer. Desperately, I got to my knees and grabbed Dr. Austin's trembling hand. 
""Please,"" I begged, ""you have to help me."" ",lollydodo

They where only seen when their human was in close quarters with death, so some humans barely see any, and some see one on a daily basis making petty little miracles. Everyone on Earth worshipped them, saying that they had to when in all reality, they didn't.
Guardian angels have no choice in the matter. Many of them think of it as their duty, when really if they fail to protect their human until a natural death, they are smited by the man Himself.
I thought I was off the hook, being cast out of heaven long before humans began to spread like a plague. Unfortunately, the Bastard had to rope me into the program too.
And of course, my human is a total idiot. He is the guy who shows off at parties. ""Watch me chug this who keg!"" He said once at a dorm party. Pretty much everyone in the room shit their pants when I threw him against the wall before he could start and called him a fucking idiot.
I've considered letting him just die so I don't have to deal with him anymore. Hell, I considered killing him myself. Only problem is that I don't want to get smited again. Last time I was lucky to only have lost my wings. I don't want that to ha-
""...What is he doing now?"" Lucifer said, looking up from his journal. He saw his human get into his car, completely stoned. ""For fucks sake, not again."" He complained, slamming his journal shut and tucking it neatly into a pocket on the inside of his black trench coat. He considered stopping him, but he knew there wasn't a complete chance he could die.
Lucifer sighed as he watched his human speed away. He snapped his fingers, and apperated in the back seat of the car, still invisible to his human. He watched out the front windshield, wondering if he should just let the car crash into the oncoming motorcycle that his human still hadn't reacted to. 
He sighed, and snapped his fingers. Time around him froze just as the motorcycle, along with the motorcyclist began to flip over the hood of the car. He opened the car door, stepped out and investigated the motorcycle. It was an old Harvey Davidson, painted black and red. The rider was female, wearing a black hoodie, black pants and a black and red helmet.
The bike was flipped over on its side, handlebars aimed right at Lucifers humans face.
""Yeah, you'd be really dead if I let this happen."" Lucifer said to himself, looking at the stupid expressing his human was making. He sighed, and begrudgingly opened the driver door and pulled his human out. When he was a safe distance away, Lucifer once again snapped his fingers and witnessed the motorcycle smash through the windshield.
Without the motorcyclist.
Lucifer raised an eyebrow, wondering which angel he'd meet.
""B-b-b..."" he heard from beneath him. He looked down to see his human staring up at him, looking terrified. Lucifer grunted and pushed him to the ground, with a satisfying thud.
""Stay."" Lucifer told his human, who was still looking up at him, petrified.
Lucifer walked towards the wreck, examining his surroundings. He saw a flash of light out of the corner of his eye, and ducked just in time to avoid a volley of glowing bullets, each marked with a crucifix. He looked to the source of the bullets, and saw a familiar figure standing next to the unharmed body of the motorcyclist, holding a glowing white handgun.
""Greetings Micheal,"" Lucifer chucked as he pushed aside his trench coat, revealing a midnight black revolver. ""It's been a while.""",Ozone294

Jolting awake as if the static was truly a charge of electricity surging through his body. It was then he saw the odd man sitting behind his desk, at first glance he appeared to be a news reporter, but something was off, he was wearing a mask, this mask caused the pit of Mikes stomach to turn and knot, he felt sick looking at the screen.

Then the man spoke in a calm manner;

‘It is my sad duty to inform you that the earth in two months, will be at its end. It will end by the tectonic plates shifting so violently, the earth will crumble into the oceans and lava will consume everything’

The report ended with a strange symbol. Then looped.

‘What. The. Fuck.’

Curiosity got the better of mike, shaking as he reached for the remote, he changed the channel, to the next one, it was the same man, part way through what he thought was the same speech;

‘-he earth in two months, will be at its end. It will end by a massive tsunami off all coasts that will consume everything’

The Strange symbol appeared, then the message looped.

It wasn’t the same.

More confused, he changed to the next channel and the next in rapid succession on all channels across all broadcasting media, it was the same man, same speech, but different causes for the end of the world, but ultimately ended with the same symbol then looped.

Ice age, Acid rain, civil war, alien invasion, food shortages, energy crisis, nuclear winter. These were some of what was looping across all channels, but all 150+ channels had something different.

‘-fuck, I guess I gotta find out whats happening’ Mike said grabbing his notebook.

An independent journalist tries to find the truth.",shakeythirsty,"On the 34th floor bathroom of a skyscraper in the financial district of Manhattan, Bill O’Reilly practiced looking serious in front of the mirror. He practiced his disapproving frown, his skeptical eyebrow jump, and his disregarding head-shake. He practiced his snarls, of mild, moderate, and outlandish intensity. He had never yet had occasion to unleash an outlandish snarl on-air, but every night he prayed to Benjamin Franklin that something so terrible would happen in the world to justify such a powerful gesture of rhetoric.

A few buildings away, Wolf Blitzer practiced his hand gestures. He waved an obligatory stack of documents through the air. He held his hands up in exasperation. He shook his finger authoritatively.

It was five o’clock. Bob Jenkins, a lifelong resident of Maybush, South Carolina turned on his television.

“...calling themselves The Planet Emptiers has taken credit for the phenomena—although it’s tough to say how to evaluate the credibility of such a claim,” Bill O’Reilly said, “Truly the Obama administration left our country in such a state--”

Bob changed the channel.

“..how the Trump administration’s dithering allowed this to happen,” Wolf Blitzer said, “The state of California has been attacked by alien aircraft with lasers, and almost entirely fallen into—”

“The gays.” Bill O’Reilly said, unleashing a moderate snarl. “They were aliens in disguise this whole time, always plotting to take power from the hard-working people of—”

“Planet Xylon,” Wolf Blitzer said, throwing his hands up in the air, “I mean who ever heard of a planet Xylon—it’s not even one we’ve ever heard of being discovered.” He pressed his earpiece to his ear. “Oh, we’re receiving word right now, it actually *is* one of the Trappist—”

“Dumpster fire of a place if you ask me,” O’Reilly said, “The country is better off without it—fewer illegal immigrants to carry on welfare, unpaid hospital bills and so on. What everyone needs to do right now is just stay in your—”

“Run outside,” Wolf Blitzer said, waving his arms wildly. “Run now. It’s your only hope to—”

“Let this all blow over,” Bill O’Reilly said.

Suddenly, high-powered laserbeams cut into O’Reilly’s studio, lopping off his tie and left arm. Finally, it had happened. O’Reilly gave one last, glorious, outlandish snarl of indignation before the lasers chopped him up into a stack of human cheese-cubes.

Lasers entered Wolf Blitzer’s studio the moment after. His eyes grew big. He did a beautiful backflip, throwing his documents into the air. They cascaded down upon his lifeless swiss-cheese body. 

Bob Jenkins wasn’t sure what was going on, but as a freelance journalist he intended to find out!

Through years of hardwork and scavenging through the wreckage of modern civilization, Bob finally pieced together the truth. He traversed the islands that had once been the Americas, collecting equipment to build a printing press and in his old age, finally completed the project, printing hundreds of copies to share with the survivor communities.

Two months after you left, FTL travel was discovered, and you land on a completely terraformed and populated planet getting ready for it's centennial.",soulreaverdan,"The arrival ceremony was a grand spectacle. Anticipated for centuries the arrival of the ship bearing what was supposed to be the first colonists on Ertoo was a big deal. The fact that it neatly coincided with the month the capitol celebrated its 250th anniversary made it even more hyped, and the officials pushed everything through to make sure it went smoothly. The radio contact with the ship as the confused colonists came out of the prototypical cryo sleep they had rested safely in for centuries was handled in utmost secrecy, instructions had been doled out, and communication had been kept to a minimum. They wanted the crew to have the most authentic experience when they landed, to be preserved forever by the dronecams and the sensors so that people could relive it for years to come, take part in everything that happened.

Of course, there was the occasional naysayer, the occasional voice that tried to claim that these people might prefer a calmer introduction to the glory that had replaced their original mission. These people were quickly shut down, hid away, voted out of the committee. Nothing must go wrong. The shuttle went up as the ark entered orbit, carrying medical tech to inoculate against modern infections, check for contaminants, and of course fit a crude external version of the sensors that were usually embedded into everyone in early childhood these days. 

The first hint of anything wrong was a message to the mayor on the secure channel from one of the security staff on the shuttle, just as the mayor had climbed the ceremonial stairs to the specially decorated landing pad. She turned away from the microphones and clicked the secure mic. “What?” she asked, “What problem can possibly be big enough that you disturb me now – just get them down here! Your job depends on it. MY job depends on it!”

“But…” said the crackling voice through the disturbance of the ancient ship engines. “…only… one… all … there’s…. do you read?... dead… only one survivor…” 

This gave the furious woman a second’s pause, but she didn’t have to think long. “It doesn’t matter if it’s one or a dozen, get them down here! I repeat, get them down here NOW!”

The shuttle landed, almost on schedule. The lone survivor of the ark wandered out, dressed in a simple tight layer of uniform clothing that looked charmingly retro sci-fi. The mayor beamed at him as they walked him down the walkway, walked him over towards her. She didn’t think twice about the hollow look in his eyes, the confusion, the fear. It would sell so well! Everyone loved to cry a bit, everyone loved to plug into some genuine emotions, and this was as genuine as it could get! His life’s mission had been to colonize this planet, and he had sacrificed everyone he had ever loved to the past to be able to do so… and now he had found the place already colonized. Such heartache! Such passion! 

“Plug him in,” the mayor hissed at the tech when the group came close enough, the crowd on the ground and in the sky cheering and clapping and snapping pictures, or making the holo gestures that replaced clapping when one wasn’t in a physical body. The tech hesitated for a second too long, but at the scathing glance from the utmost authority in the city snapped the transmitter in place, letting everyone who had tuned in to the event feel with the guest in real time if they so wished. 

And how they wished. The mayor grinned her most honest grin in a long career as she saw the numbers on her display go up and up. “Mr…” she started, and then glanced at the man again noting his nametag. “Captain! Captain Andersen!” 

The man didn’t react, just looking into the crowd. Beyond it. 

“Captain,” she said, “How does it feel? I understand you are the sole survivor? Was there a malfunction?” 

There was too much silence. Too much silence as the crowds had stopped clapping, as the city had stopped moving, listening for his words, feeling for them as he tried to find them himself. 

“It didn’t work”, the captain said, his lips barely moving but his words and feelings and thoughts and memories being beamed into billions of minds all over the planet. “It didn’t work.” 

“We have to unplug him,” a medic said and tried to push his way over but the mayor intercepted him quickly. “Not on your life,” she said, “this is the biggest broadcast in history, I’m going to own this planet after tonight”. The medic struggled a bit, the guard got between them and in the moment nobody on the stage watched what really mattered. 

“It didn’t work,” the captain said as he climbed up on the banister and let himself fall. “Sleep didn’t come,” he whispered as his wide eyes saw the ground come up to meet him.

Gaines, my coworker and enemy, looks sourly at me across the board room after it's announced who's going to TRAPPIST 1. He didn't pass his health test and so he's not going. He looks at me sourly and I give him a smirk right back, joyful that he's finally gotten what he deserves for making my life at NASA a living hell. Name-calling, deliberately bumping against me in the hallway, stealing my promotions, *laughing at me for no reason other than to rile me up*, it was high school all over again. Now the tables have turned. For good measure, I mouth ""fuck you"" to him, doing so very subtly so that the boss up front wouldn't notice.

***

I'm about to be frozen in this tub-like container. My excitement is over the roof, I can barely keep still as the line to the woman doing the freezing gets shorter and shorter. I'm not very sorry to leave earth; I have no children, no wife, no girlfriend, my parents have been dead for years and I'm  out of touch with my cousins, whom I'd once considered the closest things to siblings. My life on Earth had become miserable, unbearable, waking up each day to basically nothing, just yourself and your eighteen year old dying cat called Zee. The vet put her down yesterday and I don't remember ever crying like that.

But I'm ok today, I cried a bit in the morning but it's evening now and I'm ok. The hairs on my arms are bristling with anticipation. The people around me are excited as well. Some of them are people who had lives just as miserable as mine but were at least rich enough to buy the ticket (I got one for free because I'm an engineer at NASA). I look at these rich people, well pampered and confident in their speaking but dead in the eyes, dead in the inside. I look at them with contempt. How can you be rich and miserable? It just isn't possible.

It's my turn finally and I'm led to my own empty container. The woman places something like an oxygen mask over my face and tells me to get in the container and lie down. I do so, and a button is pressed, cold liquid fills up, freezing my spine, but I can only think of being one of the very first humans to walk in a world never walked on before, how I'll carve my name somewhere, maybe a rock, declaring my existence, how I'll be remembered by future generations and mentioned in history books. The very dream of my life.

***

I wake up and I'm freezing, my whole body is convulsing with shivers. I squint - there's a bright light above me. I sit up. A voice reaches me through the fog.

""Sir?"" It's the voice of the freezing woman. ""Are you able to stand up?""

""Yes, I think so.""

Same room, same people. Some sitting on the floor or leaning against their containers for support. No one speaks.

""Did we make it?"" I ask the woman, who's moved on to the next container.

""Yes, we did,"" she says. She glances at me up and down before turning away. ""Go get some water from Sally please.""

""Who?""

""Jackson, you know me,"" says a woman holding a jug of water and a tumbler. 

I drink and I can feel my disorientation being quickly replaced by a blaze of excitement. We are decades into the future and we still look the same. We are in a different galaxy, already in a different experience. Why isn't anyone excited, I wonder aloud to Sally.

""Because people are a bit woozy from their sleep,"" she explains. ""I'm surprised you seem this energetic and are able to walk - it took me a day to be able to walk again. You see them sitting on the floor, leaning against their containers? It'll take them hours to get to normal state.""

I nod, handing back my tumbler.

""Also we aren't the first ones here,"" Sally says.

""What?"" I say. 

""Yeah, apparently FTL travel was discovered and they beat us to it. People from earth, I mean.""

I sort of stagger backwards and get caught by the wall behind me. A million things go through my mind, dreams and aspirations are getting crushed like a stone into dust. The end of everything, the beginning of nothing. I place a hand over my face.

""How long have they been here?"" I ask.

""Almost a century.""

""You're kidding me.""

""Nope.""

""So they discovered FTL travel the same year?""

""Yep.""

""What the fuck?""

""I know.""

I look at the other passengers incredulously. Is this real? Am I still asleep and dreaming? I pinch my wrist and Sally laughs.

""You're not dreaming, Jackson,"" she says as she goes away to give water to a passenger who's just woken up.

***

Unreal. Simply unreal. It's almost like I'm back on Earth. Reddish sunset sky, green vegetation, mushy brown soil, dogs, cats, mice, *people*. Quite a number of them too. Just over 2000. They live in small houses that are so futuristic looking, they seem like miniature spaceships. They talk weird English, using slang of the future. The people are healthy and lively, programming robots to water their gardens, eating under the glare of an abnormal sun. At night, the other planets are visible in the sky, as close to the planet as the moon is to Earth.

I settle down but it's hard. Im acting like a child who hasn't gotten his way. It was supposed to be me. *I* was supposed to be one of the first ones, one of the founding fathers of this community. And that dream has been snatched away from me like a stranger snatching away ice cream from a kid. 

***

After a few days, I'm starting to get used to the fact that I wasn't one of the first ones. I mean, big deal right? It doesn't really matter.

But then I'm walking in the park close to the houses one day, watching a few ducks waddle in the artificial river when I see *him. It's him alright.* Same face, same way of walking. I watch him, shocked to the bone, and he looks back at me kind of uncertainly.

""You ok?"" he says. His voice is different but the arrogant quizzical look is the same. He looks a little younger than I remembered him.

""What are you doing here?"" I say in a breaking voice.

""Um,"" he says, walking carefully past me; there's a namebadge on his front and it says *Gaines*. ""Ok."" He disappears behind the houses.

Maybe my mind is playing tricks on my eyes. Gaines would be dead by now. It isn't possible that he's still alive. And it's not like he was even a part of the FTL mission. Probably failed his health test again. But to just make sure I head for the small government building. I search through the names of the founding fathers, the people who'd come here by FTL travel. And my worst fear is confirmed. His name is there. *Alfred Gaines, born 1981*. But it also says he died 47 years ago and had an extended family on this planet. So the person I saw back there was maybe some descendant...

I feel sick, nonetheless. He still beat me to TRAPPIST 1. *The injustice of the universe!* Gaines bullies and emotionally tortures me for years only for him to win again? I imagine him having a quiet laugh as he entered the FTL rocket, having a quiet laugh on his death bed. Mocking me til his last breath.

A rage rises in me and I start ripping the record book apart. I'm about to leave the building when the elderly receptionist says to me in affronted tones, ""That's highly disrespectful of you young man!""

I slowly turn back to face her. ""Young man? Young man?! I'm fucking *older* than you!""

I storm out the building, hyperventilating, feeling the world closing in on me. And then I see him again. Gaines's great-grandchild or whatever. He is before me, looking at me with contempt, and the resemblance to his great-grandfather is so uncanny in that moment that I feel an animal rise within me. I launch myself forward and punch him in the face. He falls to the ground with a grunt. I get on top of him and punch him again and again and again. I can hear Gaines's laughter, rising up brilliantly in my head, mocking me again, calling me *pussy, pussy, you fucking pussy*, riling me up, and I don't stop throwing my fists until the young man stops moving, stops breathing, his face a bloody mush. The laughter is now intense and harsh and unbearably raucous, it's drowning out everything and it feels like I'm falling into a hole, and I close my eyes tightly, cover my ears with my bloody hands and begin to scream.

Helman von Triegman counted the seconds in his head, focusing on the route Francois would take to head back to the bridge. A simple task given his immense intellect, but complicated somewhat by the sedative coursing through his system. Helman was biting so hard on his tongue that he could taste blood.

When he was sure Francois was out of earshot, Helman yelled as loudly as he could – he could not remember if there were receivers installed in the medical bay.

“Computer! Override code Albatross Harkens! Administer adrenaline shot, release restraints!”

Motors whirred as robot arms unfolded from the ceiling, and hovering on the edge of consciousness, Helman was vaguely aware of pinpricks on his shoulders. Then, the adrenaline hit, and Helman was wrenched right back from the calm of the abyss. 

A lesser man would have spent precious minutes on the gurney, trying to calm the increased heart rate, fighting with the sudden onset of hypersensitivity. But not Helman. He was trained for this. Even before the robot arms had fully retracted, he was already out of the medical bay, racing towards his office.

His footsteps rang along the quiet corridors. Helman allowed himself a moment of regret – it was premature to suggest that they attack Luxer-Alpha, especially in the face of the counter-order from Earth. He should have won them over first, explained to them the dangers which lay ahead, the precautions they needed to take.

“Computer, place following instructions in black box. No one can review or overwrite without my authorisation.” The terminal in Helman’s office glowed red, then an almost imperceptible tone rang to confirm that his instructions had been accepted. 

Whatever the Command Group was going to discuss, whatever decision they would make, it would be a waste of time. Helman knew this because this exact scenario had already been exhaustively debated during wargaming, back on Earth. Perhaps Marwing as Captain had sufficient clearance to review those discussions, but Helman would rather face a charge of insubordination than to risk losing the one chance he had.

After all, she was soft when she needed to be decisive, and the others would only be too quick to take her side if it seemed to be the more palatable option. Precisely what the wargaming had cautioned against.

“Computer, if course is set for landing on planet Luxer-Alpha, set time trigger of one month. At time event, trigger emergency meeting of Command Group.”

Wargaming Session 286, July 30, 2234. The cerebral enhancement chip in Helman’s brain spat out the full minutes of the session for him, but he didn’t need the notes. He had taken part in the session personally, brought on as one of many consultants to help answer the question posed that day: what lengths should humanity go to, in order to keep humanity human?

The postulation had seemed low-risk then, which was probably why it had been scheduled after all the others. But some scientist had found it important enough to keep it on the agenda, and Helman was glad for that.

“Computer, at emergency Command Group meeting, trigger following set of queries for Command Group. Allow for deviation of 5%, maximum.”

That long-forgotten scientist had asked, what if the crew of the starship, having settled on Luxer-Alpha, eventually evolved to become a different species of humans? Barring minor differences the same way that different races had, should Earth tolerate, encourage, or eradicate a different species of humans? What, in that case, was the definition of a new species?

At the end of the day, the vote was overwhelmingly clear. If a new species of humans arose, and there was any risk that they could displace the Earth-humans, then they had to be put down, with extreme prejudice. No one wanted a repeat of the way that homo-sapiens had completely overtaken their cousins, the Neanderthals.

“Computer, query number one to command group: the needs of the numerous always outweigh the needs of the few. True or false?”

Helman wasn’t going to wait for the full tests to be run by the Bioengineering or Personnel divisions. They were scientists at heart, unable to decide without conclusive data. He was a soldier, and from the footage he had reviewed, it was already abundantly clear to him that the entities on Luxer-Alpha may look like humans, talk like humans, walk like humans… but they certainly did not think like humans.

Indeed, from their surveillance, the cities below were more like giant machines rather than normal, boisterous hives of human activity. Not only was there absolutely zero communication between the beings below, but there was also a conspicuous lack of the written word amongst them. Hell, there weren’t even any signage anywhere, not a single goddamned direction marker of any sort.

If Helman had to guess, it was because every single being knew exactly what everyone else did. There was no other way to account for how they functioned without any form of communication between themselves. And if that did not fit the definition of a different species…

“Computer, that is the end of query number ten. At end of session, calculate the odds that Command Group is still functioning as five separate entities with different viewpoints and biases. Access to personnel history allowed for reference.”

Helman took a deep breath then, his hands quivering as he gripped the tabletop for support. If he was wrong about this, it would be the biggest culling in human history. He would make any of the warmongers Earth had ever known look like chump change in comparison.

“Computer, if evaluation is that Command Group has not been compromised, delete this set of instructions. But if evaluation is otherwise, activate nuclear weapons, destroy Luxer-Alpha. Then set a course for Haran-Beta, and re-animate the backup 2,000 cryosleep pioneers.”

Helman thought for a while, then added a footnote, just to save some time for the fledgling tribe, humanity’s final hope.

“Then, inform them of Wargaming Session 286. End transmission.”

Marwing Chen stole glances at her crew, but they kept their heads down, stewing together in the same uncomfortable silence, inscrutable expressions on their faces.

It’s likely the shock, Marwing thought, having your Head of Security threaten to rain nuclear fire down on a planet will certainly do that to you.

The titanium doors to the bridge slid open, and Francois Brumer, Head of Bioengineering, rejoined the others. “It’s only a light sedative, so we have only about an hour or two to talk about this rationally before Helman is up again.”

“I repeat, no decision can be taken if his vote is not counted,” said Carl Latie, Head of Legal, “all five votes from the Command Group must be accounted for.”

“Then we have little time to waste. Carl, we didn’t get a clear answer just now. Are we or are we not obliged to follow the orders we received from Earth?”

Carl sighed as his fingers danced across the panel, which summoned numerous reports on the holoscreen. Marwing knew the strain on the man was tremendous – they were only 8 hours out of cryosleep, and Carl had already reviewed hundreds of backlogged communications from Earth. She would have gladly given the man more time to work, but time was not on their side.

“As you know,” Carl began, “the further we travelled from Earth, the longer it takes for new communications to arrive. The last transmission we have is, give or take, about 100 years old. It is a simple order – ‘Ignore last communications. Approach the planet in peace.’”

Nancy Arlington, Head of Personnel, pounded the command panel emphatically. “So you’re saying the previous order, the one which warned us that all sentient lifeforms on Luxer-Alpha are hostile, is wrong?”

The starship’s AI-controlled systems, accustomed to trying to make itself useful as often as possible, interpreted Nancy’s reference to the planet below them as a command. Camera feeds were re-focused on the lush planet, and images of the objective they had travelled centuries for filled the holoscreen.

Marwing felt the weight of leadership bear down on her, impossibly onerous. “Carl, do we have grounds to use our discretion instead?”

“Yes. Directive 320 states that if we have reason to believe that the orders coming from Earth have been compromised, we have free rein to make our own choices. I cannot discount the possibility that once instantaneous travel was established between Earth and Luxer-Alpha, that the hostile forces crossed back to Earth and…”

Carl left the sentence unfinished, but Marwing knew whatever nightmares they were privately entertaining certainly shared many commonalities. 

Things have spun so quickly out of control, Marwing mused. It was jarring enough for the Command Group to awaken and discover that faster-than-light technology was perfected shortly after they left on their voyage, but to then find out that the planet they were charged with terraforming had already been home to humans for over a hundred years?

Pseudo-humans, Marwing corrected herself.

“Marwing, I think our options are limited,” said Nancy, breaking the reverie. “I counsel strongly that we do not, under any circumstances, land on Luxer-Alpha. I’ve reviewed the feeds from the welcoming committee again, and I suspect we will be assimilated once we are in their atmosphere. Observe.”

Nancy recalled the video feeds which had been transmitted to their ships, and with a deft flick, she muted the audio. Images of a local leader of some sort, flanked by a crowd of eager, friendly faces, rolled eerily on the holoscreen

“We’ve watched these a dozen times, and it’s not what he’s saying that’s important. It’s what everyone else is saying in the background, at the same time. I’ve had the AI apply advanced lip-reading to the images, and the results are 95% accurate.”

“Well, what are they saying?”

“The same thing. They are all saying the exact same thing, every word, at the exact same time. I hope I’m wrong, but it looks like they really meant it when they said they are, with one heart and one mind, welcoming us to their planet.”

The pulse quickened in Marwing’s veins. “And you’ve shared this with Helman?”

“Yes, and that’s why he thought it his prime directive to ignore the last transmission from Earth, and to take the pre-emptive strike to the planet.”

“Francois? Is that possible? Can it be that the humans on Luxer-Alpha evolved some sort of… psychic link or something?”

“Possible? Yes. Probable? No. It’s not probable that humans evolved that quickly here in such a short time, even if the environmental pressures are slightly different. We have to acknowledge the possibility of another symbiotic lifeform on the planet which we’ve not yet come face to face with. I need raw DNA to be sure, but I agree with Nancy – something about them doesn’t seem right.”

Marwing felt the headache foist itself back on her, kept at bay no longer by the supplements she had taken. The options before her seemed to multiply with every new piece of information they received, and much as the analyst in her wanted to meticulously dissect and weigh each alternative, the leader in her was sure that an executive decision had to be made, and soon.

If not for the five of them, then for the other 5,000 human souls on board, still in peaceful, blissful cryosleep, eagerly awaiting their supposed new lives as pioneers in this solar system. Whatever choice Marwing and the rest of the Command Group made, these pioneers would awaken and be either the newest additions to whatever it was down there, or the very last of the human resistance.

Marwing sighed.

“Bring Helman back. I think we’re ready to vote.”

Or rather, why is everything just light and dark blobs?

I feel weird. Kind of empty. As if I forgot to eat last night.

Why am I waking so slowly, I've been a sharp waking person my whole life, down and twenty before I take a step in the morning.

Then it starts coming back. I'm waking after four centuries of Earth time. I can't believe I'm actually alive. Went into that sleep fully expecting a computer malfunction, life support system failure, catastrophic meteorite damage, tissue damage... who knows. Basically knew I wasn't going to wake up. Fuckin' eggheads did it. Right on boys.

Checklists. So many checklist today. I have approximately 27 minutes before my sleep blindness clears enough to use adaptive glasses.

""Paroecia, relay crew status""

""Captain, crew status nominal""

""Paroecia, ship status and time to target""

""Captain, ship status nominal. Time to target, 108 hours""

""Paroecia, initiatiate wake sequence for all crew members, confirm""

""Captain, confirm order""

""Paroecia, prepare a complete transit, trajectory, and consummables report. Also, collect messages from TRAP1 control. Send everything to my secure frame""

""Captain. There are only two messages from control: The first received 723 days after launch, the second sent seven days ago.""
_____________________________________________________________________________________

I decided to hold off on relaying the news. Or even speaking it to my first mate. They were eyes only relays with full discretion to announce. Crew morale is important no matter what. We had been lucky - didn't see the 7% losses predicted, but a 2% loss rate is still hard, those were some good people. Proper reverence and honors were given, and just as planned they would be the first of our crew to earn graves on another world.

Four hours to let everybody regain motor control, tend to physical care, have the first solid food of their fifth century of life, and shake the fog off. At a relative time of TRAPPIST-1 0100 the remaining 490 crew members of Paroecia collected in the main hangar. This wasn't the announcement I had prepared 5 days ago, or rather, 5 days ago in my perception.

""Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Global Interstellar Commonwealth, The United Nations, the executive crew of Paroecia, and our new planetary system, welcome back!""

(Big cheers. Didn't have to change that part.)

""We are all eager to get to work in building a future for humanity, so I'll make this as brief as possible. Following this, you will all receive a full briefing on your personal frames. I have some challenging news. As of approximately 401 years ago, we are dinosaurs. The previous 60 waking months we have all spent together - and recent 403 years sleeping side by side - appear to have all been rendered obsolete.

(Rolling murmurs, cannot blame them)

""Now, to calm any alarm, we are all safe. The ship is in outstanding condition, our transit was perfect and we are on course for TRAPPIST-1, initial decel is proceeding precisely as plan, long range sensors are confirming all data collected by the Sagan Deep Space Biology Detector, and we will be landing safely if all goes well in four days.

""But we will not be landing on an uninhabited planet.

(You could hear a pin drop in the room. I let that one sink in for a few beats)

""We will be landing at the Alexandria Spaceport on the eastern coast of New Pangea.

""Our long journey was eclipsed by a wholly unexpected breakthrough in faster than light travel approximately two months after launch and cryosleep initiation. GIC took two years to confirm the results and following a successful drone test sent us the news. Of course nobody on board could read it but the computer.

""First question you are all asking: Why didn't they remote wake us and recover the mission?

""That was mine too. I don't know about a lot of you, but I'd trade having my name on a few high schools for watching my boys get married and being a grandpa.

""The FTL system only operates at distances larger than 27.8 light years. Don't ask me why. By the time they could have gotten us, it wouldn't have even mattered. They did the risk analysis and decided it would be safer for the mission and crew to proceed as planned. We all bought the ticket, taking the ride was part of it. We all boarded this bird knowing we'd never see Earth or our loved ones again. We all trained for that.

""Within ten years of the discovery Earth was able to build the first functional, LEO stationed FTL ship. Transit times to TRAPPIST-1 was just 62 hours, and with a 124 hour return visit time Earth was able to rapidly ship men and materiel to the planet surface.

""The world we are going to land on, the work we have all trained to do, it's been done for almost 300 years. TRAPPIST-1 is now known as Ginium. I alone have been in contact with Ginium Spaceport Control for the last three hours. They have been expecting us. The whole planet has. All 138.5 million of them in fifteen different megacities. 

""I know this isn't what any of us expected. In some ways it's a tremendous disappointment, in others, an unbelievable convenience. The good news is the entire crew's skills will still be put to work with minimal retraining. You'll also find new orders in your frame. 

""Now, ladies and gentlemen, my friends, we still have a hundred year old 10 trillion dollar space ship to land. Let's get to work.""",Ben_Wojdyla

It would need to be altered so that it could follow a more plausible method.

Anti-aging is going to be the last biotechnological fear of humanity. Even if you could regrow or harvest organs from other people AND could add them to your body with no host/donor complications, you still would not be replacing enough. Hypothetically simple changing out the heart, lungs, and digestive tract should prolong things. But you need to prevent the aging on the bones, muscle, and skin. Those would ultimately be the downfall in this situation. And then on top of all of that you have the brain. Within 100 years of more tech, I still don't think we'd be able to replace brains and swap personalities. One could argue that the brain would need to be swapped. Most neurons are stuck in a G0 phase of the cell cycle. But then you would have to worry about cancer. 

The most immediate issue to me is that they are not replacing the skin, muscles, and skeleton.",darksingularity1

An author I read about a few years ago sits down and writes 2000 words every single day- not achievable for everyone but something to consider.

Let me show you something about showing vs telling using your prompt.

&gt;""What happened?"" Joana asked Thun in a very surprised way while looking trough the window of the ship to the the already populated planet. ""I think we may have got into a alien populated planet. What do you think?"". Joana didn't knew what to say, the rest of the ship was also surprised following the thousand year sleep they endured.

You told us how they felt and it feels a little forced. You could try adding some more descriptive phrases like

&gt;""What happened?"" Joana asked Thun with surprise as she stared out the window of the ship. ""We were supposed to be the first ones here but it's already populated!"" Thun nodded his head in agreement, peering over Joana's shoulder to the planet below. The signs of life were everywhere in buildings that reached towards the heavens, splitting the sky. ""Do... Do you think we have discovered aliens?"" She whispered before falling silent. Neither knew what to say. They looked around them, people were stumbling out of their sleep pods, groggy from a thousand year slumber. As each one caught a glimpse of the ground below them though the uneasy tension in the air grew.


You have all the makings of an excellent story, just needs better flow and description. I write a lot, generally around 1000-3000 words per day, I read a lot too. Look at your favorite authors, how do they describe things? How do they make the story flow and hold your interest?

Dialog is super important and yours is a bit choppy. Grab a pen and pencil, sit in a highly trafficked area and eavesdrop. Write down bits of conversation, describe the people you see, note how people move when they speak, the inflection of their voice, and any unspoken  cues you see. 

I can't find the books on writing I have right now to give you some good reading material but read up on self editing and showing vs telling. 

nanowrimo can be a very good tool and it's for all skill levels, if you think that it will help you learn to write then by all means go for it. 

WP is a great way to expand and you can ask for advice at the very end of your prompt, you might be more likely to get some feedback that way. 

Write, write as much as you can, even if it's just ""I have no clue what I'm writing but I'm writing and this is good."" I'll do some more research and when I find the books I got I'll send you the titles and you can look into them some more.

Don't be afraid to describe, read lots and see how they do things, and always have a notebook and pen... Or at the least a phone. Find something random, a leaf or something, sit down and describe the way the sun pokes through the holes, casting a little shadow dotted by pinpricks of light on the ground. A bubbling stream dancing merrily down it's bed, be ridiculous, be serious, laugh at yourself. Enjoy it, you get to create worlds.

There is no immediate need to kill when you have supplies and equipment to expand the habitat or make more, and seeds / cryo-cattle ready  to begin actual survival farming.

Marwing's breathing, deep and heavy, echoed off her exosuit's faceplate. Her eyes tracked the envoy ship from Luxer-Alpha as it lazily puffed through space to dock with their starship.

The pfito-motors powering Marwing's exosuit supplied enough raw destructive power to rival a conventional 21st century tank, and the automated sequences were primed to compensate for her lack of combat experience. 

Still, that did little to quell the nerves rising in her belly. 

""Remember, force is our last resort. Step out of line and I will remotely disable your suits.""

Helman and Carl grunted their assent. Marwing found it strange that Helman had become so reasonable after his earlier outburst, but she would look into that later. More pressing matters were at hand. 

""Docking complete. Prepare for contact,"" came Francois' voice through their radio comms. As Head of Bioengineering, he was responsible for prepping their suits to minimise the chance of any contamination (intentional or otherwise).

Marwing's decision to keep François on the bridge, in charge of remote oversight, paid off in spades then. Unencumbered by the exosuits, François was the first to react when the sole Luxerian, emerging from the docking gates, crumpled to his knees a mere two steps later. 

""Breach, breach! Isolation rays activated!"" François yelled, as he focused the security systems on the newcomer. 

Pale shafts of light enveloped the Luxerian, and he floated in the air, suspended in a anti-gravity bubble. He started retching then, and Marwing recoiled as the Luxerian's last meal hovered like a toxic poltergeist. 

""Was that how you mean to assimilate us? Through a biotoxin? Answer, we won't ask twice!"" The force rifles hummed to life as Helman took aim. Even Carl, the last to resort to violence had already flicked his safety off. 

""No, we just... We've never been separated so far from the Core before... It's just... disorienting...""

""The Core? That's the symbiotic entity you were referring to in your transmissions?""

""Please,"" came the feeble reply as the Luxerian struggled with keeping upright, and away from the floating puke, in his gravity bubble. ""We truly come in peace. We would never assimilate you against your consent. Here's the peace offering, all the data you requested for. You'll see that we're not lying.""

The data capsule passed out of the bubble and clattered to the floor. At Marwing's direction, Helman retrieved it and uploaded it for Francois' review. The minutes crawled by agonisingly. 

François' voice was welcome relief. ""He's telling the truth, Captain. Full DNA breakdown of the symbiote, and medical reports detailing the effects on human hosts. Assimilation is through direct ingestion of spores, so we're safe as long as we don't consume anything the Luxerian offers.""

""And the psychic links between them? Can it affect us?""

""Hmm... As far as I can tell, both transmitter and receiver need to be part of the Core. Without the right modifications to your DNA, you are no more likely to link with them than you are to your microwave.""

Marwing lowered her rifle, and ordered for the gravity beams to be released. The Luxerian gently floated to the ground, while his earlier emissions were carted off for further analysis at Francois' request. 

""Captain Marwing? We understand, you're gripped with the same fears our forefathers had when they first discovered the Core on Luxer-Alpha. We're not here to convert you, no. We're certain that with time, you'll agree that the only path humanity should take, is to merge with the Core.""

Helman snorted. ""Nice try, Luxerian.""

""As we said, it is entirely optional. The Core does not believe in forced assimilation. You'll just have to decide for yourself if an increased life span and shared consciousness are sufficient reasons to join us.""

Marwing was prepared for the proselytising, but she sensed that this was not what the Luxerian had come for. 

""You mentioned a request for help, from us. If this Core is as good as you claim, then what help could you possibly need from us?""

The Luxerian's eyes glimmered with tears, and Marwing noted again the vermilion purple irises which characterised every entity which was part of the Core. 

""The Core is dying. There is an infection, but we cannot fight it, because we cannot locate it - the infection comes from within. We need humans on the outside to identify it for us.""

""Can't you just undo the assimilation? Restore a human to pre-Core?""

""No, every human severed from the Core eventually dies. We myself cannot last long this far from the Core.""

""But why us? You have faster-than-light gates with our homeworld, surely someone there can help you with this?""

The Luxerian's eyebrows raised in surprise. 

""Every single human in the known galaxy has been assimilated. You're the last of the old humans. Didn't Earth tell you that?""

She could **see** the radar pulses received by the *Victoria*, as well as those relayed from the *Trinidad*.  She could **smell** the spectrometrical signals from the scanning multifrequency laser, recognizing the signature of aluminium-lithium alloys sometimes used by deep space vehicles.  Some carbon composite signatures.  Some silicate as well.  No obvious propellant residues, however.

Whoever, or whatever, had built this appeared to have similar starship construction techniques as the humans did.  But how did it get out here, with so little fraction of light-speed?  

What if it was trying to hail them?  Why didn't they include the communication system power-up as part of #E-293?!

*Victoria, activate forward communication antennae.*

*Powering up X-band antenna F2.  Will attempt to account for [doppler shift](http://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1258042695).  We won't be able to transmit in time to receive a response, given our closing speed.*

In the 0.25 seconds it took to activate the antenna, Rashida ignored the mounting pounding in her head while she refamiliarized herself with the first contact protocols.  She found the file she was looking for.

*Victoria, transmit this file in the blind, on ALL X-band antenna.  Repeat until I state otherwise.*

Victoria didn't need to reply; Rashida could **hear** the outbound signals, pulled from the very best that xenocommunication specialists on Earth could offer.  Something about ""we come in peace"", and all that.

Then Rashida sensed Victoria's surprise.  Or, rather, she sensed the sudden data access by Victoria against the last known ship registry as a signal was received from the contact only seconds away from collision.

The incoming transmission was flagged as origin X-band, once doppler shifted, and was using standard human communication packets.  It was a recorded transmission.

""Repeating.  *Victoria*, this is .... the *Exeter*.  We will rendezvous with you periodically to advise you of Sol ... system status.  The nature of our new faster-than-light drive means...""

Rashida promptly ignored the rest of the transmission as Victoria dutifully recorded it.  Instead, Rashida focused on the faithful and accelerating *Trinidad* with one command that burst forth along her drone's optical comm link:

                     ABORT.  SELF-DESTRUCT ORION.

&gt;  The last transmission we have is, give or take, about 100 years old.

I think TRAPPIST-1 is suppose to be 40 light years away, so presumably that's how long pre FTL communications would take. So that's how old I would expect the last communications from Earth to be, unless you are indicating that in addition to the 40 years, it's another 60 years since they've sent a message by a technology that could be received by the 100 year old mission.",sunthas

"[WP] You are part of a cryo-frozen crew sent on the century long journey to TRAPPIST-1. Two months after you left, FTL travel was discovered, and you land on a completely terraformed and populated planet getting ready for it's centennial.",soulreaverdan,"A minute later the blast doors rolled open to admit Rashida, still clad in her transleep biosuit, on her hoverchair.  The displays at the various bridge stations were already bright and active.  The clock display showed both Earth-time and the ship's [dialated time](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/tdil.html) since departure.  Rashida glanced at it out of habit even though she already knew they had all been asleep for over five years.

Dominating the forward side of the bridge was the holographic display, currently projecting the *Victoria's* trajectory relative to any nearby bodies.  A handful of blue dots, the nimble formation-flying drones of the *Victoria*, gave the starship the resemblence of a miniscule planetary system.  But nearly squarely in the starship's projected path, was a red marker in the midst of a red uncertainty ellipsoid.  Time to closest approach was shown as less than three minutes and counting down.

That timer was flashing red, in case anyone had missed it.

""The navigation radar picked it up two minutes ago at a range of 945 light-seconds.  Confirmed by the formation, and triangulation puts the best estimate of risk of collision at 1 in 97,"" reported Victoria.

Now that Rashida was through the initial shock of awakening from transleep, her mind was yawning for real sleep.  But that number jolted her awake again.  It was much higher than the 1 in 1000 threshold used for debris avoidance maneuvers.  The United Nations Office for Colonization Affairs didn't want to risk the *Victoria* and the TRAPPIST colony if they could help it, and so had adopted similar [orbital debris safety protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) that NASA had developed at the turn of the century.

Of course, wanting to do something and being able to do something were completely different... something the bureaucrats always had trouble understanding.  The *Victoria* massed over 100,000 metric tons, moving at over 280,000 km/s.  Her gargantuan reflective solar sails were furled for transit, and her directional [VASIMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Specific_Impulse_Magnetoplasma_Rocket) engine was already traverse thrusting to avoid collision.  But it wasn't capable of high acceleration.  There wasn't much the *Victoria* could do to avoid anything at her speed, this close to approach.

The cold stone in her stomach somehow tightened more.  There was little time for anything.

Rashida peered at the holotank.  As she stared, the red marker updated with some information regarding its apparent size, judging from the radar signature.  It was smaller than the *Victoria*, and that meant she had a chance.

""Victoria, select and command one drone for intercept.  Approve Orion maneuvers!"", she paused to cough, then added, ""And try to keep the impact debris out of our flight path!""

""Acknowledged.  *Trinidad* moving to intercept,"" came the calm and terse reply.

The holotank display zoomed in as the *Victoria* continued to close on the obstructing contact.  One of her attending drones suddenly veered forward and away in an arcing trajectory so to intercept the contact with a 30-degree relative angle.  As Rashida watched, the *Trinidad* left several starbright nuclear pulses behind it, as its emergency [Orion engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion\)) was engaged.

The *Trinidad* would collide and clear the way approximately twenty seconds before the *Victoria* would plow through.  Victoria was already showing the projected debris cone.

Rashida considered for a moment, absently rubbing her throat as the time to closest approach dropped below two minutes.  ""Contact makeup?""  She wanted to know what it was made of.  A cometary body would likely vaporize if the *Trinidad* nuked itself on impact, but a rocky body might make a larger debris cloud hazard.

""I have been pinging but we are not yet within effective [remote spectrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaging_spectroscopy) range.  Shall I secure the ship for collision?""

Rashida nodded, ""And safe the VASIMR reactor ten seconds before collision.""  She couldn't hear or feel it, but all over the *Victoria* compartment doors were sealing to limit any damage.  

It was a long minute as the *Victoria's* continued to close.  The radar measurements were narrowing the contact's uncertainty ellipsoid.  Chance of collision was now 1 in 4, with the highest probability near the base of the nadir solar sail mast.

The droneship *Trinidad* reached the top of its arc and continued to accelerate towards the contact.

Suddenly the holotank resolved some more information on the contact, with twenty two seconds to go.  Twelve seconds until the *Trinidad* would impact.  In an alarmed tone, Victoria reported, ""Contact spectral signature matches aluminum!""

""But...""  Rashida blinked.  ""My data link, max speed, now!"" as she belatedly slapped her biosuit's pain reliever button.

Before the link floodgate opened, her last thought to herself was that she should have awoken the xenocultural specialist, Kuzma.  He would have been thrilled to know she was about to nuke a potential first contact.",raerdor

Two months after you left, FTL travel was discovered, and you land on a completely terraformed and populated planet getting ready for it's centennial.",soulreaverdan,"Carter, Engineer of the ship Terra Nova, looked slack jawed up at the buildings arcing over him. Gracile, organic, gravity defying; unlike anything on the earth they'd left behind.  He thought back to the hulking grey blocks and low scattered tin sheds of his home town, which had succumbed to the decline which had afflicted the earth before their departure. A murmur of the native seated next to him pulled him back to the present.

""We're coming down the main boulevard now,"" said the woman sat next to him.  Carter had been too shocked to remember her name, still drowsy from the long sleep. ""That is where our ancestors made landfall 100 years ago"".  She pointed to the end of the north-south aligned strip, past the waving crowds and tall, blue tinged trees and towards a large monument sat on a pedestal.  

The monument consisted of the nose cone of the natives ship. The ship, equipped with an Alcubierre Drive, had torn through the ether past Carter's sleeper ship, the glow of annihilating particle pairs reflected off the Terra Nova's delicate solar sail.

They'd been kind enough to show his crew a picture they'd managed to take of the Terra Nova in passing,  receding into the distance, heavily distorted by the warping effect of the drive and redshift.  The Terra Nova had not been five years into it's journey before it was overtaken, still pootling along in the outer wisps of Sol's Oort cloud.

He looked at the woman sat next to him, took in her tall frame and copper skin, the strange fashion she wore, alien to his eyes of over a hundred years past.  He sat in his pressure suit, UN patch on one shoulder, mission patch on the other. They'd held a competition for school kids to design the mission patch. He wondered if any of the kids were still alive, doubted it. His hands clasped his helmet on his knees.

He looked at the smiling faces of the crowd below him. 

He gripped the helmet tighter as his hands began to shake.

Casting about for something to say, he asked his guide ""So, how many of there are you now?""

""Well,"" the woman said, in strangely accented English, ""on this planet there are about 10 million of us, not counting the orbitals"".  

""The orbitals?"" Carter stammered.

""Yes, the space elevators, stations and such."" replied the woman,  ""As you can imagine, once the elevators were up and running, our population expanded exponentially. Continued arrivals helped swell our numbers as well.""  She glanced over Carter's shoulder to the horizon, where a looming black thread stretched to the sky in front of a stationary red sun.  She looked back and grinned at him. ""As I'm sure you know some of the Seven's gravity wells are roughly as deep as Earth's.""

""Yes, I know,"" muttered Carter, thinking back to the mission brief. One star. Seven planets. All between Earth and Mars in mass. Three in the habitable zone.   All likely to be tidally locked, showing the same face to TRAPPIST-1 eternally. Hence the sun, loitering constantly on the western skyline. Hence the stiff warm breeze constantly blowing from the bright west to the dark east. Hence this strange city he now found himself in, straddling the eternal twilight of the terminator.

The Terra Nova had charted a course for the planet in the middle of the Goldilocks zone.  As soon as the crew had woken, they'd found the system awash with radio communications.  An approach by a shuttle had led to an abort of the landing protocols. Fear had turned to shock as the situation dawned.

The Terra Nova still hung in orbit; seed, embryo and gene banks useless, mothballed.  After the briefest of explanations, the crew had been whisked down an elevator to take part in the centennial parade, still reeling, out of time.

""We're here,"" the woman stated simply, as the ground car juddered to a halt in front of the monument.  Carter stared at the cone's looming bulk, pocked with impacts from interstellar dust.

Herded with the rest of the crew onto a podium, next to dignitaries smiling broadly to the crowd before them, he caught the eye of Ellie, the Terra Nova's Geologist.  She stared at him, began to say ""I can't believe they didn't sto-"" before the rest of her sentence was cut off by the blaring PA system.

An official's speech began.  Carter found it hard to focus. His gaze drifted from the bloated red hemisphere of the sun, to the crowd arrayed before him, to the scuffed overshoes of his suit. 

Sky, crowd, suit.

""-to heed the voyagers who set out before us to remake-""

Sky. Crowd. Suit.

""-a sacrifice made no less great by our technical advantage-""

Sky. Crowd. Suit.

-""accept them into the Seven, this Eden we have wrought-""

Sky. Crowd. Suit. A piece of ticker tape drifted lazily past the toe of his boot, propelled by the constant wind.

""-that is why we, on our centennial day, present the crew of the Terra Nova with these honours.""

As the speech ended, a disc was pressed into Carter's hands. As he gazed at the disc, and the roar of the crowd filled his ears, the image of the disc swam and blurred as his eyes filled with tears.

A rhodium disc, medallion sized, engraved with the mission patch. The medal glinted ruby, scintillating in the ever present sun.

Like I said, he was really investing in the idea of being one of the first ones on TRAPPIST, but then they were beaten to it and it really affects him. He was initially excited about being on the planet when he just wakes up from the freezing. He also describes the place as being just like Earth, because it's already been terraformed, and there's already a large community so it doesn't have the ""feel"" that you're on a new planet, or or in a different solar system. At some point he tries to forget and enjoy the place, but, lo and behold, the descendant of his enemy suddenly appears and it just throws him off completely, especially after finding out that his enemy was one of the first ones on TRAPPIST, which had been *his* dream. 

I think the ""bumping""  part was the other guy bumping into him to tease and bully him. Like a ""watch where you're going, dog breath haha"" kinda thing. 

And I wouldn't say the story revolves around revenge. He forgets about his enemy for most of the story. 

And I don't know, but I've seen people lose it and who are mentally stable. It's just a temper. But I must say the character was triggered by his hate for his bully to the point of madness.

But I understand you might not feel sympathetic for this character because of his particular character ",birdinatree0

well, I'd reword this anyway, because the planets aren't as close as the moon is to Earth, they appear in the sky the size of the moon as seen from Earth. 

only other modification I might make is the idea that FTL travel means instantaneous travel, which I guess it could.

Two months after you left, FTL travel was discovered, and you land on a completely terraformed and populated planet getting ready for it's centennial.",soulreaverdan,"Waking up was supposed to be the worst part.

The sudden, sharp sense of being dunked in boiling water... or was it freezing water?  That was her first conscious thought.  Her mind wasn't quite sure, as she sucked in a breath to scream.  Her breathing tube choked her yell into a moan and her eyes snapped open in shock.  She hurriedly glanced around and recognized the dull orange glow illuminating the inside of her sleeping pod.  A tiny status screen near her face slowly pulsed green.  As she blinked she realized the pod's glow was slowly turning yellow.

""Biosigns, nominal.  Brain wave activity, nominal for awakening.  Nervous system,"" paused the melodious computer's voice in its ambiguous English, and suddenly she felt a rapid set of electrical twitches that involuntarily spasmed her body. ""Nominal.""

Although it was surely only moments, the wait for the pod to open felt like eternity to her now racing mind.

The pod door smoothly slid open and she felt the cool soak of the air conditioned atmosphere of the mammoth hold for the pods.  Her arm restraints unlocked after a moment, but her arms didn't move as she peered around.

Something was wrong.  Why was no one else present or moving?  Where were the others?  She wasn't on the Pre-Arrival list.  She was only on one contingency list, and it wasn't one she wanted to wake up for.

Her stomach settled into a cold stone as she reached up and ripped the breathing tube out.  She didn't wait for her gagging reflex to subside before her left hand gingerly reached up to touch her network interface in her temple.  Her left index lingered on it and it pulsed awake, chirping as it acquired the local wireless link.

Instantly her awareness expanded from just her body to include the shipnet.  The passengers would merely use the shipnet for storing data and communication, including social media like Spacebook.  But the crew had additional permissions to the starship's systems and protocols.

*Rashida, how do you feel?* she recognized the feel of that voice, and its measured tone indicating a forced politeness amid anxiety.  Definitely wrong.

*Victoria*, she replied in a fraction of second through the link, *skip your bedside protocols!  Status report!*

Instantly Rashida's mind was fed a three-dimensional summary of ship systems statuses along with what had changed recently.  Within seconds, she was certain that there weren't any critical ship malfunctions, that all of the other crew and passengers were healthy in deep transleep, that the ship was approximately 17.49391 light-years from the Sol system and still on course at the speed of 0.95c, that one of the forward cargo holds had suffered a micrometeorite/orbital debris breach that the ship had self-sealed, and that contingency plan #E-293 had been initiated due to an imminent collision hazard.

And that her sudden use of her interface was spiking into a mammoth headache.

*Damn it!  Victoria, drop data link to very-low-speed*, she groaned inwardly as, in the physical world, her body stumbled out of the tilted transleep pod and grabbed onto the surrounding handrails.

*Done, however, your link will severely impair our integrated responses.  I suggest you make way to the bridge immediately.  We have four minutes until intercept.*  The tempo of the voice was much closer to a real-time conversation now, and the rapid intake of megabits of data had slowed to a mere trickle.  Rashida's headache began to subside immediately.

Rashida sucked in a breath as she gazed around the silent pod hold, taking in the hundreds of blissfully asleep humans.  ""I'm already on my way,"" she muttered in Arabic as she staggered into the waiting hoverchair.  ""And Victoria?"" she said in clear English.

The ship's computer took her cue and matched her response.  The hoverchair's speaker replied, ""Yes, Rashida?""

""How many?""

""Just one.""

The hoverchair smoothly darted away from the hold towards the deep recesses of the starship.  Rashida tried to swallow with her aching throat.  She couldn't help but feel she was racing through a ghost ship.",raerdor

I won't give the full explanation because there's a lot to it. But essentially they went to a planet that was dying. They saw abandoned cities. So they explored and learned through the records that the population fled on generation ships to the nearest in habitable planet before they had devised ftl because the planet wasn't going to support the population long enough. This was after sending a group through the Stargate to another planet and subsequently the gate was destroyed by an earthquake.

The group picks up the colonizing stranded group and transports them to the planet the generation ships were going to about 150 before the ships would arrive",leonprimrose

The shot cracks the dome and leaves a small hole, the natural atmosphere leaks in. The crew seals off the area and attempts some evacuation of the room. Julian is eventually captured and harvested.

200 years in the future, Humanity descends to scout out the planet. Those waiting for them greet them happily, and they explore the colony. Small things are off, all the residents have strange scars on various parts of their body. Their mannerisms and accents are reminiscent of 21st century humanity.

We don't have a choice.""

""Let's think about this for a second.""

""No. We've done that already. It's time to make a decision. Now."" The captain of UN-SF Cruiser 17-B barked back at his second in command. ""I am the captain of this Cruiser and we do as I say.""

The main loading station of the Cruiser flashed in a dull red light as the emergency response system alerted of a major systems emergency response. According to the system's data report, the Cruiser's fuel supply was depleting fast due to a previously unaccounted-for gravitational field. Of course this sort of thing was usually perfectly planned for well in advance by the computer's advanced capabilities but a strong electrical interference happened to combine with the field's strong pull for the perfect storm of space travel nightmare.

""Just a third of the supply. We will land at TRAPPIST-1 with 10% of our fuel supply remaining. We need to get out of this gravity field or we are done."" Luka had a brilliant mind for space travel and Captain Argo knew that and always held his opinions on the topic in the highest regard.

""We are going to be out of the strongest of it to make it back with over 25%. We need to activate the hyperdrive to do it, though. You must see that. You know I respect your opinion but you must see it."" Argo was almost pleading with his subordinate at this point.

""Okay...okay yeah, I think it's worth a shot."" Luka finally submitted to the Captain's plan.

""May the universe permit it."" The Captain said in a resolute tone as he pushed the Cruiser's engine capabilities to maximum capacity.

* * * 

A flash of brilliant gold and orange streaked across the sky, a seam of smoke trailing behind it. A little girl holding her mother's hand at TRAPPIST-1's Novafortuna Square pointed up into the sky between the looming arches of the square's floral columns.

""Mommy, a shooting star!""The naive little girl shouted out in glee.

Slowly at first, one by one, then as an entire group, the people assembled at Novafortuna Square all looked up at the streaking ball of fire as it soared toward the ocean in the distance.

Armed guards barked out into the square to no one in particular.

""Nothing to see here folks. Go back to attending to your Celebration preparations."" Cried out an official looking man with a closely trimmed haircut.

Meanwhile, a lower ranking communications liaison slipped out of the square into the protection of a quieter room outside the Square's main congregation area.

""Yes, we're sure, sir. Permission to speak, sir?""

""Granted.""

""How else could it be anyone but them?""

""I know, corporal. I know."" The voice at the other end of the communications piece whispered back.

As he hung up the Tele-line, a man whose face was marked by stress and anticipation turned to his cabinet gathered in his chambers.

""Be it destined by the universe, they will still have plenty of the organo-fuel that we can salvage enough to begin work on mass reproduction and recovery."" The man, who commanded the attention of everyone in the room was the TRAPPIST-1 *Top Intellect*, a name for a society whose new supreme leader was one whose post was earned by merit and proof of their capability to lead a people, not by his ability to provide favors and assemble funds for a minority. I digress.

""We sent out a Search &amp; Recovery team 5 minutes ago. The Cruiser's planetary re-entry functions should allow it to be found within the next hour."" An intense looking woman with sharp green eyes looked around the room with her sharp gaze ending on the eyes of the *Top Intellect.*

Two and a half hours later, Captain Argo and Luka followed a detachment of S&amp;R commandos into the chambers. The cabinet, including the *Top Intellect* rose in eager anticipation as the commandos arranged a pair of hanging orbs into the ceiling above for Argo and Luka to sit in. After the two men were seated, the Top Intellect sat down and looked at Captain Argo with all the hope of their civilization in his eyes. It was strange for Captain Argo to see his friend so concerned. He was usually of the utmost composure and mental awareness, assessing all options that he may have in a given situation.

""Let me bring you up to speed, Argo."" The Top Intellect began. His voice had a nervous shake to it that Argo truly did not recognize in all his years of knowing the man.

""You have just crash landed onto our new planet, TRAPPIST-1. It is a terraformed planet that in geological and ecological senses is identical to our planet Earth. 'How did we get here and achieve such a remarkable feat?', I assume you might be wondering.

""Well, the answer is quite simple. Twenty-seven years after you departed for your crypto-journey to TRAPPIST-1, our civilization underwent a major technological revolution. You can't even begin to imagine the sorts of advances we made. You saw one of the first of those with organo-fuel - that is, the ability to harvest the energy from renewable organic sources. Truly a scientific revolution that set in motion a whirlwind of revolution after revolution due to our newly discovered ability to fuel scientific research for after year, decade after decade.

""Included in those revolutions...FTL travel. Yes, we were able to leave Earth just before we lost the ability to sustain ourselves off the land. Baby boomers be damned...all those years of spitting in Mother Nature's face..."" The *Top Intellect* trailed off for a second and a flash of rage shone in his eyes for a half of a nanosecond. 

""We were truly, truly lucky to make it off in time."" The *Top Intellect* continued. ""Except for one problem."" He looked around the room at his cabinet members with a concerned look on his face. 

""We didn't bring enough organo-fuel with us on the trip here, as ironic as renewable energy scenarios can be. Yes, we are out. We have been since we arrived. Considering the circumstances, we are lucky to say that the terraforming did result in certain geological processes similar to Earth that have allowed us to sustain ourselves through things like fracking and deforestation. But it's not the answer. We will run out again, just like on Earth. This time faster, though, due to the limited amount that we have to begin with."" 

Captain Argo turned his head and swallowed as he peered intently into the eyes of Luka.

""Stop. There's no hope."" Captain Argo barely managed to slip out the words as he put his hands over his face and began breathing rather intensely.

A sense of panic spread over the room as the cabinet members, one by one, realized that something was horribly awry. 

Captain Argo shot up from his seat, his hands now on the back of his head, and began pacing around the room in a display of sheer panic. 

""No..."" The *Top Intellect* followed Captain Argo around the room with his eyes never leaving him. ""Don't tell me you're serious, Argo. Don't you do it. I told you I don't like your pranks."" The Top Intellect* was now just as frantic as Captain Argo. 

Upon seeing the two most brilliant minds in humanity in such a state of terror, the cabinet members gathered in the room could not help but unleash their panic as well at the realization of what was unraveling before their eyes.

""Your gravitational recovery systems pulled us in just as we ran out..."" Luka began addressing the assembly. Captain Argo was in no state to logically explain the situation so that it could be properly conveyed. ""We were in our second emergency protocol of the journey by the time your recovery systems began to harness us in. We crash landed with nothing."" Luka concluded in solemn finality. 

I believe it is worth mentioning something inherently important about the power of the organo-fuel that the TRAPPIST planet was now entirely deprived of. You see, it is created with a special energy. An energy that, to be frank, if I tried to explain to you you wouldn't understand. Your mental understanding of the way your Earth works and the universal mysteries that formed it are not advanced enough, just yet, to understand. It's not your fault. Blame the education system. 

That special energy found in organo-fuel, is the energy of our Mother Nature. It is the energy that allows her to give life to all of us, down to the very last atom in your pinky. It is the energy that burns down an entire forest in the dead of the summer so that new life can be born in the spring. These are only the most basic summaries of this energy. 

To summarize an entire era of scientific discovery into one paragraph, humanity discovered the means to harness this energy and chemically fuse it into organo-fuel. It is, quite obviously, a scientific miracle that no one ever could've dreamed of. It is what allowed humanity to sustain scientific research for decades, and all the miraculous revolutions that followed that you couldn't possibly dream of now.

I'm sure now you have begun to understand the pure terror that poured through the veins of every person gathered in that chamber. 

""Sir, is there no way to, you know, 'clone' the organo-fuel here on TRAPPIST-1?"" Luka asked to the *Top Intellect.*

""No."" He responded in quiet depravity. ""No, there's not. The terraforming isn't the same. It doesn't create the same energy. It's essentially useless for what would be required to reproduce it."" 

Everyone in the room knew this to be true before the question was asked, but blind hope was all that was left upon the shocking scene unfolding in that chamber.

* * * 

I write to you today from a planet you will never know. It is a planet that, in ways that are again inexplicable to you, exists both before and after your time. It is a planet that, by the unsolvable mysteries of the universe, has a limitless supply of organo-fuel. Our planet exists in perfect harmony and we have the means to fuel our civilization until it is consumed in a fiery hellscape by our sun in roughly six billion years, but I plan on being dead by then.

Not even two seconds had elapsed since her link began, but she could barely see for the migraine headache that now hammered her.

She blinked back the tears and looked at the holotank display.  The *Trinidad* was already gone, replaced with a cone of debris that splayed across the newly labeled *Exeter* contact.  The projected cone should have hit the *Exeter* already, and *Victoria* was only a few seconds behind.  She wouldn't know if the *Exeter* had been destroyed or crippled until only 1 second before impact.

Rashida unconsciously held her breath as she turned her eyes and watched the collision probability display climb to 1 in 2, then 1 in 1.5, then ~1...

The *Victoria* screamed near light-speed through space.  Her forward hulls recorded some minor debris impact, presumably from the *Trinidad's* self-destruct, but nothing else.

Rashida checked the solar masts; all accounted for.  She checked the ship status on the wall; all green.  She stared back at the holotank.

""Victoria.  What happened?"" she whispered, her dark complexion slowly whitening from shock.

""The *Exeter* appears to have vanished shortly before we would have collided.""

Rashida simply stared at the holotank as it slowly replayed the approach.  She then pulled up the visual recordings.  The *Exeter* and its peculiar globe-shapped hull were lit-up by the yellow-white detonation of the *Trinidad*, and then the newer starship simply shrank to a point and vanished 1.3 seconds before it would have collided with the *Victoria*.

""Contingency E-301 is now in effect.  Rashida, perhaps it is best if you remain awake to greet the Captain?""

The former bush pilot merely nodded as her sore throat struggled to swallow again.

She folded her hands and placed them in her lap and waited. We had been through this before, several times already. Mayor Jane was well aware that I suffering horribly from bouts of nostalgia and she tolerated my timeouts with patience and kindness. 

I knew her great-great-grandmother. I slept with her great-great-grandmother. Her name was Jane too, and this new Jane looked exactly like my old Jane. After the shuttle landed and the away team made sure that it was safe for me to go out and shake hands with the governor of Rhiannon, I very nearly collapsed upon meeting her for the first time. 

But who am I? Call me Martin. I am the captain of the CS Journey to the West. The Journey is a colonial slow boat carrying 25,000 21st century citizens in temporal stasis that was sent out to colonize Trappist I. The trip took us a little over one hundred years to accomplish. But a few years after we set off on our voyage, a faster-than-light ship named the Freyja carrying 10,000 colonists beat us to Trappist I.

On account of its vast grasslands and huge herds of pseudo-equines, the Freyja colonists named Trappist I, Epona, after the Celtic horse goddess. But the Eponians paid a truly terrible price for colonizing Trappist I. 

Three of the seven habitable planets of the Trappist system had its own biochemically unique life forms. Through a process called panspermia, those three planets had exchanged microorganisms with each other, as well as the other four planets in the Trappist system. Those microorganisms evolved into more formidable and incredibly terrifying multicellular life forms that resulted in seven incredibly dynamic ecosystems. 

For example: the apex predator here on Epona is called a Godzilla. Let that sink in for a moment. 

10,000 Freyja colonists got whittled down to 2,000 survivors pretty darn fast. They wanted to leave and go somewhere else, but a hungry Godzilla ate their spaceship. The survivors managed to settle a temperate zone plateau, after losing another 500 survivors while clearing the plateau of land mine plants (both dangerous and a local delicacy).   

New Jane’s people are very interested in keeping my people around. Fully half of the Journey’s colonists are war veterans who have fought everything and everyone conceivable back on Earth. We had also brought along a sizable arsenal with us. We have the firepower to gun down every goddamn Godzilla on the planet without working up a sweat. The Eponians also need us for genetic stock too, of course. The Eponians were already suffering telltale signs of population bottlenecks and they needed new genetic stock.  

The Eponians aren’t any different from us biologically. YET. But apparently the sole surviving family from which everybody here is descended from was dominated by fanatical female horse breeders and their legacy lives on. The Eponians live in communes they call “stables”. The people who live in these stables are divided into two primary castes: “lickers” and “breeders”. The lickers do most of the labor and are allowed to have only recreational sex. The breeders are allowed to have as many children as they want and they call the shots. If a licker wants to become a breeder, he or she has to jump through a series of flaming hoops before they are allowed to procreate. 

New Jane is a breeder. That is her hereditary right on account of Old Jane. Like her great-great-grandmother, New Jane is a plain Jane, but she is no less deserving of love than anybody else. Jane is short, kind of mousy, and is easily recognized by her wide hips. The position of governor here is handed down from mother to daughter and wasn’t taken seriously because the stables did their very best to remain independent of each other. But then my people appeared in the sky one day and suddenly, New Jane became the most important person on Epona. After introductions were made, New Jane and I sat down 

Old Jane and I had been lovers. We both lived in a city by the sea as kids and we had gone to school together. Before we went off to college, Old Jane took my cherry as a birthday gift. After all these years, I still vividly remember being enchanted by her full bush. We earned engineering degrees and Old Jane went into theoretical physics while I became a governmental science advisor. My biggest success was getting the interstellar colony program off the ground. But that came after my biggest failure which was trying to convince the president that global warming was real, and not a plot contrived by Chinese businessmen. 

The interstellar colony program was paid for out of pocket by billionaires who were finally becoming aware that Earth was going to become uninhabitable in a few decades no matter how little money they were reluctant to spend on the problem. Some of those billionaires had already tried colonizing Mars, but their colonies were at war with each other and entire regions of Mars were hotter than Chernobyl. So interstellar colonies were the only way left to go. I was made captain of the CS Journey to the West primarily to get rid of me. Most of the people who came with me were radicals and rebels. Amazingly enough, all of them had come along voluntarily. 

Mere months after the CS Journey to the West left, Old Jane discovered the FTL jump drive. It was really a simple little thing about the size of a suitcase. All you had to do was plug it in and go. Jane and her family had left on the CS Freyja not long before the end. Jane had lived long enough to establish the position of governor and pass it to her daughter.

Joana asked Thun in a very surprised way while looking trough the window of the ship to the the already populated planet. ""I think we may have got into a alien populated planet. What do you think?"". Joana didn't knew what to say, the rest of the ship was also surprised following the thousand year sleep they endured.

They took a long look at the planet g before they landing. The landing was conducted by some advanced spaceships who guided the ship to where it should be landed, which was about in the roof of a huge building, right in the center of what it looked like a skyscrapper city.

The ship captain, Mr. Tom Hardy, did follow all the ""protocols"" of this newly discovered civilization but consciously asked everybody on the ship to get ready as they might be harmful.

All the ship personnel started to get their war helmets, dressing the Kevlar protections and their Glock 19 on the holster.

Joana was in a rush, she was one of the engineers of the mission and had received extensive military training, but she knew if the aliens wanted to hurt her she would be already dead by now.

The ship finally landed.

There was a sounding silence in the ship. Everybody was terrified.

""Come out!"" everyone on the ship began to look to where that voice came. ""Come out, you guys, we want to greet you!"" said the ""alien"" soldier.

""Look, it's a human!"" the captain said, ""Wait! They can be aliens shapeshifters who assumed our shape!"" warned the chief engineer of the ship propulsion systems, Mr. John Svengar, ""As far as we know we can be heading to a trap!"", a moment of silence once again flooded the ship.

""If they wanted us dead, we would be dead by now,"" said the captain, ""just look at their ships and massive skyscrappers full of strange materials and machines!"".

The captain knew he had to ride his crew.

""We come from Earth.""

""We know it!"" the supposedly alien soldier said, ""We are humans too!"" the soldier once again tried to relax the ship crew.

""The history says a crew was sent here using old propulsion systems and cryogenics!""

The crew ship was now very focused on the soldier.

""It must be you!""

""We are!"" said the captain, ""Why are you here first than us?"" the captain asked with very interesting look on his face.

""Well, faster than light travel was discovered in earth about 2 months after you left it!""

Everyone was surprised.

""After the first humans discovered they founded a small Trappist-1 station, pretty much like the ISS you have there, but here.""

""We then started to terraforming the planet and eventually colonized it!""

""It happens that today its the centennial of our colony!""

Joana was amazed. As a aerospace engineer from MIT she was really curious about the faster than light travel.

""We have so much things for you to know, so we better start everything now!"" the soldier said.

""Start what?"" the captain asked.

""Start your plug with the new reality. Humans evolved so much, we now can put knowledge directly into the brain. So I can give you the information about everything that happened in the last times and all the knowledge we got within 1 second.""

""That's marvelous!""

The crew got out of the ship and was escorted to a local military facility. They were handed a pill and a glass of water.

Joana didn't trust the soldiers, ""There's something strange about them,"" she whispered to Thun's ears. ""I know! What we do?"" she answered looking very fearful.

Everybody started to take the pill, while Joana and Thun decided to try to escape.
They found a way to get trough a door in the room they were. They knocked out two of the soldiers and changed clothes.

Meanwhile in the room a lot of the crew started to get sick, and some where in the floor full of pain. ""They are killing us!"" said the captain while feeling very sick. Everybody started to get nervous on the rooms, and the doors were locked.

Joana and Thun found a way to get out of the building and found a way into the city slums. There they saw a lot of poverty and found Alberta Jones, she looked like a urban guerrilla lady.

""Why are you looking at me?"" Alberta asked while being looked at far from Joana and Thun.

""Should we trust her?"" Thun said. 

""We escaped from the army, we traveled from earth in a pre faster than light ship and were frozen during thousands of years. Whats this world like?""

""Earth people! Come on with me!""

Joana and Thun gave a suspicious look at Alberta.""You can trust me,"" Alberta said.

""Either that or stay here but be careful?""

""With what?"" Joana said.

""With the shapeshifters, they run the military now!""

Initially there would only be a jump gate away from earth, and it would take a few decades to build a colony advanced enough to construct one for the return journey on the other side.

Even then you'd think they'd send someone through a jump gate to turn the crew back around if it was only 2 months. Better to make the journey take 200 years and the FTL tech was invented 130 years into the mission or so, so that it would be better just to let them arrive than to turn them back around.

It's contrived, but a nice fantasy :)",BabyFaceMagoo2

How you think I can improve?
Also what routines of reading/writing you think I should do?

Im more interested in short stories collections and more sci fi based.

I recently purchased Martian Chronicles and the Wool novel by Hugh Howey.

Im thinking about entering nanowrimo to improve my overall writing, what you think?

Also if possible recommend me other kind of exercises.",pnossiop

I stepped out into a dream world. It looked so new and so amazing I could hardly tell if it was real. The technological advancements of the society that I beheld escaped my momentary comprehension.

Terraforming with plants was found to be the most prosperous method, especially when the plants grew like trees. Hemp was the best known plant for this. It grew ten feet tall in a three month period, and a well seeded planet could terraform in just two years. The greatest part of the Hemp Terra Form Method was the immense amount of raw product that was left for the incoming population. Other plants and trees left terraforming with lengthy timescales or lacking a usable resource when cropped at endlife. The fact that hemp alleviated both time and usable resource, it was the premier choice for terraforming.

The populous was abundantly flourishing on the subsistence of the burgeoning crop. They over grew the crop every season as part of the terraform, the extra crop was good for the air and was recycled back into the earth with ease at season's end. The advantage of hemp was that its resources could be almost anything the people needed for life. It could most importantly be food, but also concrete, wood, paper, cloth, plastics, biomass, biofuels, superconducting carbon, essential oils, and plant cannabinoids that synchronize with human endocannabinoids.

One hundred years of growth in this system reaped upon the people a life as full and supportive of any system known before. All of their basic needs were covered, their advanced systems of automation wrought the hardship to provide. Flight was everywhere as goods and commerce, even people, we're distributed by their advanced drone transport system. The people were teachers, teachers of ideas and skills, stories and lessons, life practices and virtues. The freedom of the Hemp Terra Form Method provided the abundance of a Resource Based Universal Income, allowing growth to be infinite without being destructive. The people sought to continue a ""work"" and teaching became their passion. The youth growing up in this society were all philosopher kings in their own right, breeding a century of flourishing growth for the advancement of all things of the planet. The sight of this society beheld me for moments of eternity, and then my life began.",Rpdodd
"[WP] If you have depression you live in the past, if you have anxiety you live in the future. What happens when you have both?",zacharie-soul,"I could feel new hearts starting to develop in my chest, each beating a second after the last and looping, ""I shouldn't exist, I shouldn't be alive. What's going to happen now?"" I asked nervously to a government agent across the table who was questioning me. ""Ma'am, it's not as uncommon as you think. It just doesn't get talked about a lot, it's something that could be easily exploited. So, you're a registered Time Lord now. If you think you're starting to hear drums beating everywhere, please let us know, we have a solution for that. Otherwise, you're being allotted a sonic screwdriver, a notepad of psychic paper"". The agent sighed, reading over a script. I thought to myself that he's probably depressed, and wondered how I might be able to improve that for him, before he spoke on, ""So, Time Lords can as one might gather travel backwards and forwards in time. In a year or two, you may be able to develop a bond with a TARDIS. Here's a pamphlet, it explains the rest"". And he stood up and walked out, leaving me to make sense of everything.

It turns out time is a wibbly wobbly timey wimey sort of thing, rather than a linear progression forwards and backwards. I'd met a few time lords in my time and a few of us dedicated ourselves to improving the lives of others, knowing that there isn't much hope for Time Lords, just depression and anxiety. Still, it eases the burden a bit knowing that someone else's burden can be lessened a bit. That they get a few more chances to succeed than they might otherwise. I still worry about mucking about with time lines a lot, and am filled with apprehension about what sort of terrible demise I will meet. I know the pamphlet mentioned regeneration, but it sounds unpleasant. And I'm not so sure I'd still be 'me' afterwards.",wild_solitude

I couldn't help but fidget and nod at him, and he cracked a wry smile. ""Just sit tight, kiddo, I'll get you hooked up."" Turning, he disappeared into the dimly lit array of equipment and weapons that was his domain.

The man behind me spoke up in a deep, easy voice ""Relax. You're with a good team."" Turning to look at him, I flashed him a shy smile. He was a fit black man in his early forties, already dressed up in his anti-zombie gear. The name tape on his canvas vest declared him to be 'Lewis'. 

""First day jitters, I guess."" I said softly, glancing down at my boots. Shyness and nerves, not stuff you'd see in a recovery and repair team. Before he could reply, the supply officer coughed loudly, and I turned quickly to the counter.

""Alright, Heather Parker, Junior Member, General kit. Sign here as we go through."" He opened a large canvas backpack, and started pulling items out of it. ""Field rations, three days. Two canteens. First aid kit. Radio, spare batteries. Flashlight, poncho, multi-tool. Hand axe, knife. Leather gloves, vest, and your chainmail- top, and here are the leggings. Crossbow, twenty bolts. Sign here, here."" He pointed, and then said loudly over my shoulder. ""Hey Lewis, bring me back some good stuff this time, eh? And keep the fresh meat alive.""

Sourly, I gave the supply officer a grouchy look, but I was more absorbed in stuffing my bag together. Lewis chuckled, saying easily ""Sure thing, Ali. Hey, Heather, right? Just put it all in the bag, I'll teach you packing when we're done with the brief."" 

""Thanks, um, Lewis. Where do we go from here?"" I was interrupted by the supply officer pulling out an old, pre-outbreak rifle from a secure cabinet, accompanied by a bag of what looked like magazines. The black weapon was sleek and dangerous looking, and I wished I had the authority to carry one. But they were restricted, ammunition was rationed, and only senior team members got to carry them- not to mention the noise factor.

Lewis nodded his thanks to the supply officer, slinging the rifle with practiced ease. ""Just over here by the motor pool. Joanna will give you shit, but she's a good team leader, so don't worry about it. I slung the heavy pack over my shoulders, trying to maintain my cool as we walked down the hall, past the usual security team, out to the chilly streets. 

Norfolk had been a natural place to hole up, and thanks to the sea trade across the East Coast, was pretty prosperous. The old Navy ships had once served as homes against the outbreak, but that was years and years ago. Now most of the city had been walled in and was constantly manned by alert sentries. In order to escape the drudgery of farming life- working in a greenhouse all my life- I had volunteered and passed the tests to be a Recovery Team member.

""So do you know what we're doing? Where we're going?"" I said quickly, glancing around at energetic bustle of people. A team must have just come back- dirty and filthy, their chain armor marked with dirt and mud, and a chunk missing out of one man's vest, but they looked jubilant. A flamboyant purple and black patch was on the front of their vests, and they were walking with a swagger. Behind them, a pair of big rig trucks were coming in, their sides marked by claws and blood patches. 

""If you'd sit down and shut up, you'd learn, boot!"" Barked a no-nonsense voice from *right* behind me. I jumped, turning to be nose-to-forehead with a short, stocky woman. Two ugly scars ran down the left side of her face, one disappearing into and coming out from under a black eyepatch marked with a red and gray patch. Her blonde hair was short and her expression was sour, thin lips twisted downward. I guessed her age around thirty. Taking a second to look closer, the red and gray patch was an old roman helmet under an eagle, and the word ""Invictus"" under it.

""What, got a problem with the eye?"" She sneered, and I shook my head rapidly. ""No ma'am! Just, looking at the team patch."" She glowered at me a moment longer before thrusting a hand into my chest. In her hand was a patch. ""Put that on your vest before we go. May as well let everyone know who to bitch to if you fuck up out there.""

I took the patch and sat down hurriedly atop an empty box, next to Lewis. Others were walking in to our impromptu briefing spot. A young man with bright red hair, tied in a topknot took up a spot on Lewis' other side. A bespectacled Chinese man with a cheery expression remained standing, a shotgun hanging off his back. Led by two large German Shepards, a tall, stocky man rounded the circle out, an unlit cigarette in his mouth- though he was so thickly bearded, it may have just been held up by his hair.

""Alright, listen up, Invictus. We've got a couple things to do. First, we're doing a repair job on a transformer station in the northern grid, then we're doing a recon sweep - The purple princess platoon says they saw some military supply vehicles off the road, but they couldn't get to it because they were being chased. We're taking a work van and bicycle recon."" Joanna puffed up, looking around for questions. Finding none, she gestured at me.

""And here we have fresh meat to replace Hawkins. This is Parker. Lewis, keep an eye on the boot. Parker, this is our team- Sam, Paul, and Luthor."" She indicated the redhead, Chinese man, and the dog handler in turn. ""Saddle up, we move in fifteen. Paul."" She crooked a finger at the man, and headed towards one of the supply buildings.

""So you got a nickname?"" Sam said brightly. ""Uhm, no- I managed to keep the instructors off my back mostly."" I said, glancing down at my feet and trying not to blush. Sam continued undeterred ""Oh, you'll get one. I'm Big Red, Lewis is Bulldog, Luthor over here is-"" 

""Easy, Sammy. Gotta get her packed right and set to go. Luthor, go fill the canteens, Sammy, go double-check the work van."" The two men nodded, though Luthor stopped to smack my back in a friendly way before wandering off. His two dogs stayed, though, looking at ease in their improvised leather coats and steel collars. 

""Listen- you'll do fine. Just remember your fundamentals. Noise discipline, light discipline, and alertness. Don't shoot unless you have to, and if you have to, shoot -"" I cut him off ""Head, Neck, Spine, your shot is fine."" I repeated the mantra that had been drilled into me during Selection training.

""Right you are. And always keep the armor on. Teeth and claws can't get past it if you always wear it. Some teams take it off during rest, Joanna don't like that and she's the boss. Now, let's pack you up."" He said genially, instructing me as he made sure I got my armor and vest on. He reached up to smack the patch into place over my left chest pocket. 

""There you go. That's us- Invictus, the unconquered. Fuckin' deadies won't stop us, eh? Load the fuck up, boot, let's put some salt on you."" Joanna said from behind me, her expression slightly more approving. 

Sam drove up in the work van, and at a gesture I took the hand and foothold on the left, my crossbow held ready. Ahead, Luthor and Paul were on bicycles, and the two large dogs were there, sniffing and looking eager. The inner gate opened, and a bell rang- the ""Team Leaving"" bell. It put some steel in my spine as we drove out, intent on keeping humanity supplied and alive. Unconquered.",Cat_with_a_quill

The day was September 3 , 2019, the last for most of humanity.

The virus was one of a kind , a product of an hardworking , godlike intellect with an tendency towards evil , it was in one word efficient , the virus had but one aim , to take control of the nervous system of the host and aim to replicate indefinitely.


Half the world was lost in a day , the other half were decimated the next day , but a small percentage of the second half were saved , some with immunity and some with something just as good ... Luck.


What was surprising was that all the world's tech was intact , the generators kept running , the servers in the dark corners of the world were still up , only there was no one to keep updating them , they had six tier redundancy systems in place and not even the first redundancy wall was tested.


The survivors built a colony for themselves , their leader , a man with paranoia approaching insanity was prepared for this very scenario had kept them safe , but by the 3rd month , they noticed something .... The food was depleting and the only system which mattered , The ecosystem balancer , a machine with temperature and moisture control had failed and there was no one with the required skills to fix it , thus the survivors made a group of people from the age of 16-30 which numbered a measly 20 to scavenge food for the survivors , they were called the warriors 


They went out at night , when the temperatures would be low enough so that the virus would hibernate the host , a scratch of weakness in its otherwise impenetrable armour , fearful of the dense forest which seemed to have flourished in the absence of humans , they could not use visible light as the virus was very very sensitive to it , instead they used echolocation , as no amount of sound could wake the corpses , onward they journeyed towards survival.

They were brave men , the lot of them they had guns which they would never have even the slightest hope of winning with and yet they strapped those guns on their back and trudged on... The other waited with bated breath to see what food they would bring back , which was mostly vegetables , fruits and tiny berries.


Usually someone would browse the net with the intent of spending their last days by reading the entirety of Reddit , all of the sites would have the same last updated date : September 3 , 2019. But on one particular day , something happened which sent a bolt of shock through them all , a post labelled : 'how to defeat a demon ?' was posted on October 20th , 2020 , which was impossible as there were no survivors anywhere and it had just two coordinates almost a thousand miles away , the warriors set out to make the most dangerous journey , fraught with impossible dangers and the all the odds against them .

Not to mention what comes after, when the head is completely smashed, and the bike juts forward as the tires splash around the liquid remains. 

""Woooooooo!!"" I cried, turning the bike around and joining my friends. I caught up with them, passing through the dust cloud they left in their wake. 

We drove fast on the empty dirt plains outside our Reserve. The zombies had nearly trampled over everything that was outside our walls. Better for me. I had miles and miles of empty road to ride over. And tons of mindless zombies to crush. 

They were slow but god there were so many of them. There a small cluster of them ahead of us, dragging their decaying limbs across the plains to get us. Pathetic.

My friends and I were part of a recon squad, in charge of surveying the outside squad for anything remaining from the old Earth, from before the zombies. It was an unnecessary job with shitty pay, but goddamn riding these bikes are the highlight of my day. It was our job to look for any remaining human artefacts, but the best part of this job was murdering the zombies. 

My friends and I dispersed, surrounding the small cluster from all sides. I pulled out a long chain clamped to the side of my bike. At the end of the chain was a sharp, hooked blade. I threw the blade into the zombie cluster, lightly holding on to the chain as it flew out of my hand. 

The blade hooked one of the bastards in the eye. I pulled at the chain, turning my bike around. The zombie fell forward, his head still intact. 

""Be careful, Dez,"" Jane shouted out, her voice muffled behind her helmet. ""Don't fuck around."" 

""I'm not fucking around,"" I said. ""Not yet, anyway."" 

I smiled at her, and wrapped the chain around my forearm. I drove close to her, the zombie being dragged behind me. I crossed her as she was driving towards me, and pulled the zombie forward. She was going too fast to stop, and her momentum made her ride over the zombie. 

The undead bastard died with a shriek and Jane adjusted her bike before she fell over. 

""Damn it, Dez!"" she said, half-scowling, half-smiling. 

""What?"" I rode up next to her, stopping. ""We might as well fuck around. It's not like these things stand a chance against us.""

She smirked at me. ""One day, you will get your due. But you're right, they can't fight us. They aren't even trying today."" 

She was right. The zombies were very few today, and the ones that were here stayed away from us. In the distance, I saw some of my friends approach a bigger cluster of zombies. 

""What's over there?"" I asked, ushering Jane to join the group. 

By the time Jane and I got there, the rest of the group had killed most of the group. 

""What is that?"" Jane asked, getting off her bike and running to where the group was huddled around. 

I joined them, moving them out of the way to get a better look. 

Covered in dirt and blood, and half-buried in the ground was the body of a young girl. She wasn't zombified and seemed around the age of Jane. 

""How the hell is she here?"" Jane asked. ""She isn't one of us.""

With a sharp breath, the girl woke up. 

She looked around, panicked. 

""Who are you?"" I asked her. 

""I'm...I'm....""

""What's the last thing you remember?"" 


""I remember....being a zombie."" 


Questions around the group. 


""What do you think she means?"" Jane asked. ""Does she think she used to be a zombie?"" 

""She's human, but she couldn't have come from any of the other reserves. They are too far away.""

Jane turned to look at the girl one more time. ""So, what do we do with her?"" 

""Let's take her home. We'll see from there.""

"[WP] Following a zombie outbreak, humanity has been preserved in select cities across the globe. Technology has been preserved, with cellular networks and fully functional internet. To keep humanity alive, volunteers between the ages of 16 and 30 travel out of the cities to scavenge.",AGuyWithAPhone,"The cement road had slowly succumbed to nature’s merciless grasp, overtaken by weeds and cratered by small, young trees pushing their way up to the surface. The occasional abandoned vehicle, the owners having fallen pray to the Infected, was one of few signs of civilization left outside the mountainous gates of Garden City. Birds chirping high up in the Fir trees, interrupted by the soft thud of boots against the ground were the only sounds that could be heard. 

The Scavengers moved in a precise formation, quietly but swiftly down the side of the road. Their operations had become increasingly challenging over the last few years. After the outbreak, cities began to close their borders, isolating themselves from one another. It was in this manner that they could control the Infected, culling those that managed to hide away inside the border while ensuring that no new threats were able to enter the sanctity of the city. Eventually, all but a few cities collapsed, some acceding to the conflict and infighting that came as a natural consequence of the lack of resources, others falling prey to weak border control and an influx of the Infected. 

Garden City was one of those that remained. In the decade since the City closed it’s borders, it had not only survived, but thrived. This was, in large part, due to the ingenuity and determination of its citizens. Although rations could be replenished naturally, there were other needs that had to be met. In particular, Garden City began to experience a medical crisis within the first two years, having depleted nearly their entire stock of antibiotics. Recognizing the potential existential threat, the community council stood up a team of Scavengers, well-trained and physically exceptional young men and women who would venture outside the security of the City and seek out vital necessities – antibiotics, opiates, surgical equipment, and anything else that they deemed useful. 

At first, these were largely overnight operations, the team moving tactically into the surrounding villages, raiding that which had been hastily left behind during the pandemic. As these villages were raided, however, it became necessary to venture farther and farther away from the City. At this point, week-long patrols were becoming more frequent. 

The crack of a twig snapping in the woods brought the team to a half. The leader, a young man, made a fist in the air and took a knee. He waited, listening intently and scanning the forest, searching for anything out of the ordinary. The Infected were not particularly coordinated, but he had noticed that they were adapting, becoming more ingenious over time. ‘Never underestimate, never be complacent,’ he would brief his team before each raid. 

The wind began to pick up, whistling as it whipped through the tree branches. Winter was nearing and the cold was becoming more palpable in the air. A slight frost was beginning to line to tips of the grass poking through the holes in the cement. The leader continued to stare out into the forest, visually dissecting everything in his line of sight. Suddenly, a deer galloped out of the woods and across the road ahead of them, startling some of the Scavengers. 

Satisfied, the leader got to his feet and motioned for his team to follow. They were close now. They could no longer comfortably rely on GPS anymore, not since the government’s collapse, but he had glanced over a map the night before. The town they were raiding should be appearing on the horizon shortly. 

He looked back over his shoulder, ensuring that no-one was falling behind. They were on their fifth day now and he was worried that some were beginning to tire. The raids were becoming longer and more frequent. Behind him, his glance was greeted with a few acknowledging nods and he continued on his way.

The road rounded a bend and the forest began to pull away, opening up to show the decrepit remains of a town. The houses were boarded up and the windows on the few remaining vehicles were covered in dust and dirt. In the distance, he could make out the fading red cross of a hospital, poking up above the rooftops of a suburban neighborhood. The sun was beginning to set, leaving a purple and orange hue in the sky as it hid behind the horizon. 

The leader contemplated the situation. Towns were the most dangerous area that they would find themselves. The Infected gravitated towards any sign of life, hoping desperately that there would be flesh for them to feed on. If he brought the team for the raid, they would need to hurry to complete it or risk being caught in the city overnight. Alternatively, they could make camp for the evening just outside the city, in the relatively safe grasp of the dense forest. The risk therein would be that he would extend the already long patrol by another night, which could push his already exhausted team to their limits. 

He rubbed his forehead and closed his eyes for a moment before coming to a decision.

‘Gather around’ he said, motioning for his team to form a protective circle around him. He took a knee in the middle and retrieved the map from his backpack. Laying it out in the dirt, he pointed at the location of the hospital.

‘We’re going to go through with the raid tonight,’ he said, carefully ensuring that there was at least some agreement. A few nods broke out among the group. Satisfied, he continued. ‘The hospital is 500 meters north-east of our location. We’re going to divide into two groups, the raiding group will lead the way with the quick reaction team following at a distance. I’ll lead the raiding group, Sarah will lead the quick reaction team’.

‘Sun is down so make sure you have your night-vision with you. Round in the chamber as soon as we enter the town. Keep your head on a swivel, we know how dangerous this could be.’ 

‘Roger’ the team whispered in a scattered answer. 

The leader got to his feet and began his move into the city. Walking through the abandoned streets, the only sound that he could hear were the footsteps following closely behind him. He painted the area with the muzzle of his rifle, the laser from his sights dancing across the walls of the surrounding properties. 

As they approached the entrance to the hospital, he tucked himself comfortably against the side of the building, waiting for the rest of his team to take their place beside him. As they did, he moved slowly towards the entrance, his shoulder brushing up against the peeling paint. He came to a stop immediately beside the front door and paused, glancing back to ensure that everyone was ready. Behind him, four other scavengers stood with their rifles raised, stocks pushed tightly into their shoulders. 

‘Move!’ he hissed.

The team filed in through the front door with a rehearsed precision. The interior of the hospital was pitch black, no natural light remaining to illuminate it, so the team relied on the green glow from their night vision goggles. They cleared the adjacent rooms lining the hallways as they approached the dispensary at the center of the first floor. 

The leader hurried his way towards the glass cabinets, smashing them open with the butt of his rifle and dumping the contents into his pack. With the cabinet empty, he directed his team to a set of stairs on his left.

‘Second floor, move!’

One of them hurried ahead and glanced through the window, ensuring that the stairwell was clear. Satisfied, he pushed the door open and the rest of the team hurried their way in. The sound of their feet rushing up the concrete stairs echoed as they made their way to the next floor.

Suddenly, gunfire broke out from outside the hospital. Shots cracked through the air, drowning the out the screams. The team stopped their movements, heart-rates spiking. 

‘Fuck, down the stairs, get to QRF. Now!’ the leader called out, knowing all to well what was happening. They ran as fast as they could, back to the first floor, rushing past the dispensary and into the hallway. The remaining natural light that punctuated in through the front door was blinding in his night-vision goggles, causing him to hastily throw them to the side. 

Weapon drawn, the leader peered out the door, cringing with anticipation. The streets were festering with the Infected, crawling over parked cars and tumbling out through shattered windows. One of the Scavengers was being cannibalized in the open while another was being dragged, screaming, into the dark corridor beside an abandoned school. He wanted to cry out and rush over to his fallen companions, but his sense stopped him. There were too many. 

He turned around, blocking the view of the rest of his team. ‘The town is infested,’ he said, simply. They understood. He motioned for them to follow him, quietly, to the stairwell. He moved carefully, avoiding any unnecessary noise. 

Swiftly, the team followed him up the stairs until they reached the top floor. Using the butt of his rifle, he cracked the small, rusty lock that was in place to keep people from getting onto the roof. He pushed the door open and the team filed out onto the roof of the hospital, lit up now by the light of the full moon. He wedged the door shut and had one of his teammates stand guard. Moving to the edge, he glanced over in order to take an inventory of the situation. 

The Infested were still scattered across the town, picking the bones of a number of Scavengers. Hundreds, he counted. The most he had ever seen. He wiped a bead of sweat from his face and slouched down, his back pressed up against a small lip on the roof. This could be the end, he thought.

To keep humanity alive, volunteers between the ages of 16 and 30 travel out of the cities to scavenge.",AGuyWithAPhone,"A violent rocking awoke Ethan from his sleep. As he jerked up in his seat, a dimly lit red hull surrounded him. Music was blaring from the back corner and Ethan turned to see a man in a straw hat smoking beside it. He stared blankly at Ethan as the drums of the song matched with the beating of the helicopters blades above them. The man nodded at Ethan. Ethan forced a smile and turned away.

""Look who's finally awake,"" a petite voice yelled into Ethan's headphones. A girl sitting across from him was smiling. In her 20's, maybe, Ethan thought. Kind of short, didn't look very strong. Not the type of person he would ideally like for this mission. Her arm extended towards him. ""Della,"" she tried yelling over the noise of the radio and engines. Ethan obliged, and shook her hand.

""Ethan,"" he told her. She looked at him confusedly, as if she hadn't heard him. 

""What?"" she yelled but Ethan just stood up instead and began walking to the back. The girl made some sarcastic remark over the intercom that Ethan couldn't hear and took a seat next to the man in the hat. 

""Got another one of those?"" Ethan asked. The man nodded and pulled a white carton from his chest pocket and pulled a cigarette out. Ethan gladly pulled it from the carton and placed it in his mouth as the man lit a match with his boot. Ethan inhaled and leaned back as he watched the smoke float from his lips as he exhaled. Suddenly feeling better, Ethan thanked the man. ""Ethan, by the way,"" he told him. The man slowly reached forward, firmly grabbing Ethan's hand.

""Miller,"" he said in a raspy, though deep, voice. Miller looked from Ethan to the rest of the hull. ""Franklin,"" he said pointing to a sleeping man in the corner. ""Ramirez,"" he said as his finger traveled slowly across the room. ""You already met Della there."" She was giving Ethan the bird. Miller chuckled and pointed to the last man sitting against the door of the helicopter. ""And Pete,"" Miller said as he pointed to a tall, red headed man. Pete leaned forward and motioned for Ethan to come closer, to which Ethan responded.

""That stuff will kill you, you know?"" Pete yelled as he looked at the cigarette in between Ethan's fingers. Ethan smirked and took a slow drag before blowing it across Pete's dissatisfied face. 

""Not before one of those things do,"" Ethan said as he motioned to the floor below them. Pete stared unflinchingly at Ethan. Della tried holding back a smile as she looked at the two men facing each other down, smoke slowly rising from Ethan's hand adding to the already hazy interior of the helicopter. 

""Maybe something else'll get ya first?"" Pete spoke up, turning slightly to reveal a small handgun set against his hip. Ethan looked down at the gun and the one along his own hip suddenly felt heavier.

""You a good shot with that thing?"" Ethan asked him, nodding at the gun.

""Tryna find out?"" Pete answered. The smile's on Della and Miller's faces had suddenly become more serious. Ramirez, remaining quiet, slowly clicked the safety off the rifle sitting on his lap. An alarm's sudden ringing cut the tension of the two men and they both looked up to see the red light had turned yellow now. Miller clicked the radio off.

""Gonna have to postpone this date, boys. We're here,"" Miller yelled over the constant drumming of the helicopter's blades. Pete leaned back into his seat and pulled his hood above his head. 

""Sure thing, boss"" he said to Miller. Ethan returned to his seat across from Della. 

""Landing in 30 seconds!"" a voice shouted across the intercom. Must've been the pilot Ethan deducted. The yellow light suddenly turned green and the helicopter jerked back and began to rapidly descend. A loud thud echoed around the hull as the helicopter made contact with the ground beneath them. The doors slid open and Ethan had to shield his eyes from the white light coming from outside. The others began throwing their bags out the doors and jumping out and Ethan followed suit. A few minutes later, everything besides the distant beating of those blades was silent. For the first time in his life, Ethan was outside the city walls.
___

A cold breeze brushed against Ethan's face as he slowly inhaled the fresh air. The group of six were making their way down a small wooded road. Wind rustled the leaves of the trees, causing several to fall to the Earth. Winter was going to be here soon, making this expedition more important than most. 

""Not so bad out here,"" Ethan spoke up. He heard a smirk from behind him. He already knew who it was.

""Must be your first time,"" Pete responded. Ethan turned to see Pete looking at him, a black AR-15 held firmly against his chest.

""Trying to say you've been out here before?"" Ethan asked genuinely curious. 

""Third time,"" Pete responded. ""Second for Della over there and third for Isaac as well,"" Pete said as he looked over to the man that had been sleeping before. He ignored the two and continued walking. ""And I believe a tenth time for old Miller up there,"" Pete said. 

""11,"" Miller corrected him as he lead the group forward.

""Guess that makes you the rook,"" Pete said to Ethan as he picked up his pace, brushing against Ethan as he walked past, knocking him slightly off balance.

""Ignore him,"" Della said holding Ethan's rising arm down. ""There're worse things out here to worry about,"" she told him. Ethan shook his head. 

""I ain't scared of anything out here,"" he said with a puffed chest. Della rolled her eyes.

""You will be.""

*3 days later*

Ethan sprinted through the light snowfall. Steam from his heavy breathing floated above him as he turned a street corner rapidly. A cinder block in the street tripped him up and he slid across the cold cement as the skin on his palms and knees were torn up. The quick pattering of footsteps behind him caused him to turn. Three of those, things, were now turning the street corner as well. They paused, looking in every direction violently snapping their heads one way to the next. Ethan could hear their popping joints. A blood curdling snarl came from one that saw him first. The other two turned around and immediately sprinted towards him, now screaming as well. 

Rushing to his feet, Ethan tried scrambling away. Diving at his legs, one of the creatures tackled him back to the ground. Ethan yelled as he tried kicking it away and looked in horror and awe as another dove straight for his torso. He shut his eyes, accepting his fate. The loud explosions of bullet fire rained around him and he covered his ears. His body was frozen and his mind wasn't sure if he was alive or dead. Della's voice brought him back to reality.

""We have to go now!"" she yelled at him. ""Extraction is in ten minutes!"" She pulled Ethan to his feet. 

""Where's Ramirez?"" Ethan asked, still out of breath. Della looked down to the ground and shook her head.

""Jesus,"" Ethan said now holding back tears. It was just them now. ""We've gotta get the hell out of here. There's more coming,"" he told Della. She looked up from the ground, teary eyed and face covered in blood and dirt. 

""There's always more of them coming,"" she said softly. Ethan wanted to sit and cry but fought the urge to be weak. He needed to get home. Needed to get her home. 

""We're gonna make it, okay? Just stay with me,"" he tried telling her as reassuredly as he could, though Della appeared to believe him as much as he believed himself. Nonetheless, the two made their way to the designated drop point. Distant screams were becoming ever louder as they ran through the forest. Dark figures in the corner of Ethan's eyes darted in and out of the trees but he remained focused on the road ahead. He held Della's hand tightly as she ran behind him. The familiar thudding of the helicopter's blades could suddenly be heard. Almost there. Though he knew better, Ethan couldn't help but look back. He looked back in horror as a horde of those things were moving quickly after them some 50 yards back. 

With the helicopter landed just ahead of them Ethan began pulling his back pack off. When he was close enough he threw the bag through its open door. He turned to help Della in but saw that she had fallen over. She was screaming, her left arm limp against her body. 

""We have to leave now!"" Ethan heard the pilot yell. He saw the wheels begin to lift off the ground as he ran back for Della. The horde was nearly on top of them now. 

""Come on!"" he yelled at her as he picked her off the ground.

""My arm hurts,"" Della cried. Ethan could see the bone cutting through her jacket. The helicopter was now hovering just above the ground and the screams of the horde were an arms reach behind him. As he approached the copter, Ethan did the only thing he could think of. With the last of his energy, Ethan threw Della forward  through the open doors. He grabbed onto the skids as it began rising higher off the ground. A bony hand grabbed ahold of his ankle, nails ripping at his skin. The helicopter jerked back downward with the extra weight.

Ethan desperately tried kicking the creature off his leg. He looked down to see the lifelessness in its eyes. Any resemblance of its former human self was completely gone as it tried grabbing his other leg. Dozens now screamed and jumped beneath him and the helicopter, which was still struggling to lift off as more grabbed the skids. Della stuck her head out of the door and reached down to Ethan with her good arm.

""I'll pull you up!"" she yelled to him. But Ethan already knew what had to be done. He looked up to Della through teary eyes. She had never looked prettier than she did in that very moment. 

""Bye, Della,"" Ethan whispered. He could hear her yell his name as he let go of the helicopter and dropped back to the Earth. The helicopter jumped up from the weight loss, throwing another of those creatures off of it. Pain engulfed Ethan and everything faded to black as he watched the helicopter rise back towards the sky.

Before Z day, runners were just nutty fitness enthusiasts. Up early in the morning for a jog, fanny pack, sweatband, short shorts...
At least, that's what people say they used to be. Now it's different. Now we need them. Every settlement looking to thrive in post Z day America needs two things above all else: A big fucking wall and runners. 
You need the wall for obvious reasons. Deadheads can't eat what they can't reach. You need runners for just about everything else. Long distance travel completely stopped after Z day. Cars, trucks, planes, and trains make too much noise. The only way to move around in the badlands is running. What do you do when you need tools, batteries, clean water, or toilet paper? You send a request to your friendly neighborhood Runner Corps and hope they don't die getting it for you. 
Runners are the only ones who can leave the cities. That's what I've been doing for the past three years. I'm one of the veterans now. Knocks on the gate always signify fresh meat. From across the room I hear Osiris answer the door.

""Yeeah, who is it? The fuck are you?""

""Lucas. I'm here to join up.""

The peephole slams shut, but the door clearly isn't soundproof. Osiris yells over to me.
""Ay, Festus! We need any more legs for today!?""

""Bring him in.""

The kid's taller than I expected. Blond hair. Kinda familiar lookin.
Osiris shuts the door behind him.
""Welcome in, Luke-ass. Festus'll be with you in a sec.""
God sometimes, he's a bloody idiot. I walk over to the shelf, grab a newbie box, and set it down on the table in front of the kid. 

""You got a mile time, son?""

""Uh- 4 minutes, 55 seconds, sir.""
Hmm, sub 5. I can work with that.

""And why do you wanna be a runner? This job blows.""
The kids face turned to one of shock. He looked down at his shoes. New Balance 990v4's. Not bad taste. If he were wearing Nike's like every other brat that's walked in here I'd have kicked him out right then and there. He looks up to respond.

""I wanna make a difference for the town, sir.""

""That answer's bullshit and you know it. And stop calling me sir. What're you looking to find beyond the wall? Excitement? Enlightenment? Lost relatives?""
His eyes darted away on that last bit. I look at him expectantly until he caves.

""My dad was a runner, sir- ah... Festus... Before he was announced BIA, he said runners were the lifeblood of humanity. That's something I'm gonna be a part of. Period.""
Makes sense now. This is Herman's kid. Looks like him. Herman. Bitten in action about a year back. He was an OG fucker. He's the only reason this settlement got off the ground. Saved my ass more times than I have fingers and toes. He'd be pissed if he knew his kid wanted to be a runner.

""Alright kid. You're in. But you're only cleared for team patrols. This is your box. It's got one kevlar vest, two emergency flares, and one Beretta M9 handgun."" 
The kid was grinning across his face. Definitely Herman's kid.
After he strapped the gear on, I rest my hand on his shoulder and rotate him to look around the hall.
""Everybody in this room is now your teammate. Your two jobs out in the field are to gather useful shit and make sure everybody you see now makes it back without a single toothmark on their skin. Deal?""

""Deal.""

""Oh and one last thing. You're gonna need a nickname. Like Osiris, the well-mannered chap who you met at the door. The girl with the long hair in the corner is Pele. Next to her are Athena and Hel. Then there's me. Festus, short for Hephaestus... Pick the name of some old god. You'll last longer out in the badlands if you do.""
I give him a toothy smile. Like the one Herman gave me all those years ago.

""What was my dad's nickname?""
I think this kid's gonna fit in great. 

""Mercury. We called your dad Mercury.""",ApolloTheSunArcher

I was the special one on my home planet. My people had heard of a distant prophecy, something about someone who would bring balance to the Galaxy. From a young age my mind manifested its will in the real world—things moved when I was angry, I could hurt people inside their minds if I wanted. 

Some of the people in our village who had traveled closer to the Galactic center knew of an order of warriors called Jedi, who used a mysterious power called the Force, a power that looked a lot like mine. 

Our village scrimped and saved, trained me physically and mentally as best as it knew how, in the hopes that I would go to Coruscant, find the leaders of this order, and train in the ways of the force. My people wanted me to return to them, better, stronger, wiser, and teach future generations the ways of the Force. We would come to power in our sector again.

And today, the apotheosis of my dream, the beginning of my new life, shot down like Corellian Cruiser flying too low. 

I stood before the council, Yoda, Mace Windu, Ki-Adi-Mundi—I don't remember the others. They said they felt a darkness in me, an evil will stirring. I told them about my dream of restoring my planet to its past glory. They said a Jedi must renounce all trappings of a personal life and dedicate himself to the Force. I said I would, but it was too late. Besides, they said. I'm far too old.

I'm sitting in the cafeteria, head reeling, they at least had the decency to feed me before turning me out onto the street. They'll regret this..

All of a sudden I'm not so hungry any more. I've realized something. The power within me cannot be taken away by the words of a few old men. I am special. They can't decide my fate. If they won't train me, someone else will.

On my long journey here I stopped on a planet called Korriban. In the spaceport there was talk of an academy, a place where those strong in the force can strengthen...*other* abilities. I'll return to Korriban. They will accept me there. And then I will return, and the Jedi Order will know their mistake. ",xilead

I have watched them, seventeen of my class of twenty who have found masters, left on travels and returned with tales of adventure and wisdom. 

They have come back stronger, more sure of themselves and their powers, but for those left behind, we stagnate, trapped in classes and teaching younglings to recite scripture by rote. Slowly, as time after time I was passed over, I became saddened and eventually, angry. 

Once I was chosen by a young Jedi, although in truth I think it was Master Yoda who asked if they would take me. I was already sixteen and by then some of my former friends had even taken the trials, but I had lagged, my attention to my studies lax. She was called Mei Re-Woo, a Tellaxian and a strong Jedi, but we could not mesh. 

I struggled to follow my master's commands, seeing little sense in them, until at last there was a serious mistake. We had followed a smuggling ring to Axor Prime and she asked me to wait, to guard a door while she entered a Opine Den, to seek a contact within. Instead I grew bored and wandered away, seeing little threat in the drugged patrons, but they were not the threat. 

A group of Rhodians slid in while I was away, summoned by the owner who had little love for Jedi and without my warning, they nearly killed my master. I found her body, dumped in a sewer and it was more luck than faith in the force that allowed me to get her off world and back to Coruscant alive. 

It was nearly a year of bacta treatment before she would see me, to allow me to apologise, but when the time came I could not. Her face had healed, but still showed the signs of where it had melted and without a word I fled her room and no longer petitioned to see her. I was a coward and everyone knew the truth. 

I returned to my life in the temple, but from then I was never even considered to become a padawan and no one asked any questions as to why. I simply lived, completed my studies, are, slept and aged, until at last I was given the right to take the trials and earn my way to becoming a Jedi. 

At twenty one all Jedi may take the trials, although you only have a single chance and may wait and continue to learn if you choose. Some long-lived species choose to stay for hundreds of years as a trainee, or a padawan, but for me, it was my escape, my chance to prove that I was not what they all called me behind my back. 

I am told that for each padawan the trial is different, as each must prove themselves in a different way. I was summoned to the great council room to learn what form mine would take, but on arrival I found the door open and the internals dark and empty. 

Except... it was not empty. At the far side, sitting in Master Yoda's chair, there was a form, my old Master, Re-Woo. She sat, the breather held carefully in one hand and a light saber in the other. Transfixed and horrified I tried to turn, but the doors behind me had sealed and with no choice left, I walked forward and into the room. 

She watched as I approached and then, as I neared the centre of the room, her hand rose and the lightsaber flashed forward. I closed my eyes, waiting to hear the thrum as it ignited, but there was nothing and at last, I opened my eyes. It hovered, waiting for me in mid air, unlit, my old master keeping it steady with the force. 

Her voice cracked out now, the voxbox grating it with a metallic edge as it amplified what remained of her natural voice. ""Take it. Take the lightsaber."" 

Hesitantly I reached forward and took it, only to find that the moment my hand seized it I was dragged forward, pulled towards my master with an inevitability that could not be withheld. Now I was close, able to see her clearly and unable to look away from the destroyed features which had once smiled at me with warmth and friendship. A friendship I had betrayed and allowed to burn and which bacta could not heal. 

""Why... what is this trial?"" My voice cracked and wobbled, full of fear. 

A smile seemed to play on her lips as she looked up at me. ""It is time..."" She paused for breath. ""...to take responsibility for your actions padawan. It is time to end my suffering."" 

I felt myself released and stepped back immediately. ""No, I... I cannot Master. I am so sorry. I did not mean to abandon you, i did not mean to betray you. I was weak, stupid and I did this, I *caused* this."" 

She shook her head slowly. ""I had so little chance to teach you, but this lesson is one you must learn. What happened was the  *will* of the force, but it is *your* responsibility to follow through. Kill me, end my suffering and show that you have leaned a lesson here."" 

My finger pushed down and the room was filled with the blue glow of her blade. My own lightsaber had been left in my room, but it was no match for this weapon, with no variance to the blade at all, showing only the flawless workmanship that my master should have turned into a lifetime of service. 

I looked down at her and she closed her eyes, ready for me to take my action. This was my test, this was my moment. 

The hilt clattered down to the floor, the noise echoing behind me as I fled the chamber. I did not return to my own room, nor return the greeting of the few who cared to acknowledge me as I passed them. Instead I walked to the lower hanger, where the transport ships were spared and quickly greeted the shipclerk on duty. 

I raised m hand in greeting, but avoided his eye. ""You are needed by Master Windu, he wishes to discuss his personal craft.""  

The Clerk frowned. ""I cannot leave my post young one, the Master knows that."" 

I nodded. ""I am to remain here until you return, it is very urgent."" 

For a moment it seemed as if he would hesitate, but at last he smiled and stood. ""Probably wants a better droid again, he's never happy."" In a moment he had walked away and as the door slid shut I slipped into the hanger and toggled the main bay doors. 

The radio squawked with messages as I pushed through the atmosphere, looking for minimum height and then fell silent as I moved to full speed and out, past the Couruscant lane markers. I had never flows so far by myself, but there was one more step to take. 

The navicompuer plotted a course quickly and in moments we were read to leave, but my hand paused on the handle.  This was the end of a life for me, but it was a life that had held so very little. When I pulled the handle, it was with no regrets. ",fringly
[IP] They call my home Trappist-1e.,BraveLittleAnt,"They call my home Trappist-1e. At least they will for the next month or so, before the Interstellar Congress renames it. I’m a little conflicted about it; sure it doesn’t have the same ring as Egypt or New York, but it’s the home that I know.

I don’t think anyone else really gets that, since this isn’t their home in the same way as it is mine. You see I was the first person born here. Or anywhere other than Earth, I suppose. My parents named me Virgil, after Virginia Dare, the first person born in the American colonies. Not that I’d know much about that. I’ve never liked history; it just seems so distant, so irrelevant.

You see, I’ve never been to Earth. Even the few times we go on vacation to the Solar System my parents always insist on sticking to Mars and Jupiter. They say it wouldn’t be worth the cost, but I know there’s more to it than that. Honestly I can’t say I blame them; I couldn’t bear to see 1e in as bad shape as Earth.
  
They all tried very hard, and made great progress. But ultimately Earth’s fate had already been decided. The delayed effects of global warming meant that no matter how efficient they made their renewable energy, no matter how strict the regulations on fossil fuels were, they were just too late. The pictures that I’ve seen are haunting. Nothing grows naturally anymore, only in specially constructed greenhouses, with artificial light sources and huge tanks of nutrients that are pumped into the soil. You can’t even walk outside without wearing a special suit to protect you from the UV rays. And why would you even want to go outside? There’s nothing but barren hills, empty plains, abandoned cities that had started to be reclaimed by nature, but not even nature could survive there. It really is a grim sight. Assuming you can see through the smog, of course.
 
That’s why most people left, mainly to Mars and the Trappist system. Some people still live on earth though, trying to squeeze the last little bits of life out of that dead rock. The IC didn’t allow some crops to leave the planet. Tobacco was a big one; Marlboro still runs greenhouses on Earth, and I still see people on Mars smoking occasionally. There are also some scientists who live on Earth and the Moon, studying the Sun, trying to figure out cold fusion. Maybe when the Krasnikov tube is finished I’ll slip down there for a day, see if that rock is really as bad as people make it seem.

For now though I’m happy roaming the Trappist system. It’s become a very nice place, especially compared to how Earth apparently was. Since the planets are tidally locked, there’s always a strong wind from the day side to the night side, which gives us all the power we’ll likely ever need. I love walking out to the border and seeing the massive wind turbines. It really makes you appreciate how far we’ve come, seeing something so grand. We also just found a way to affordably produce carbon nanotube capacitors, so power really isn’t an issue anymore. It’s almost hard to imagine the lengths that people used to go to for power; going to war with each other, corrupting their politicians, filling their own planet enough waste to destroy it. Life must have been so different back then.

I try not to concern myself with politics too much. There are much more important things to focus on. Like my ship. It’s a pretty small cruiser, and the Alcubierre drive is on its last legs, but I still love it. I’ve recently taken up a delivery job to help pay for maintenance. It’s a pretty nice gig; I get paid for flying around the system, moving materials for my mom’s experiments, and then I can spend the money on my ship. It’s like I’m getting paid to fly around and have fun. I don’t know if that’s what I’ll do with my life though. I could certainly see myself as an engineer, or just a mechanic, working on ships. I’m not too worried about it though. As long as I make enough money to live and have enough time to fly around, I’ll be happy.

My mom keeps trying to get me to help her out in the lab. She’s a scientist for NASA, and right now she’s working on getting the Krasnikov tube running. She actually used to study the Trappist system when she lived on Earth. I like her lab sometimes, but it can be pretty dull sometimes, running the same tests over and over again. I much prefer working with my dad. He’s an architect, so there’s always something cool going on when I work with him. Some days we’re digging out a foundation, some days we build walls, but my favorite is helping my dad design a building. He comes up with the most beautiful designs. 

My parents actually helped build a lot of the infrastructure when the colonists first showed up here. They set up hospitals, spaceports, farms, you name it. My dad even built the apartment building we live in now. I think he knew we’d be staying in this one, because he put it in a spot with an amazing view and made the windows extra big. Sometimes I’ll just sit there, sipping some coffee, looking out at the planet. A lot of the time you can see other planets in the system floating by, bigger in the sky than even the sun. With a strong enough telescope you can even see the people living on those planets sometimes. I hope when they look at my planet, they see as much beauty as I see in theirs. 

I think seeing other planets in the sky has really made humanity better. We can’t be as selfish as we were before, because just looking out of our window reminds us that there are other people out there, trying to enjoy life just like us. This isn’t just my home. It’s our home. Let’s make sure it stays this beautiful for everyone else.

"[WP] A group of archaeologists have ventured into a massive complex deep within the Rocky Mountains. Deciphering the ancient text of the long forgotten mountain civilization, the Archaeologists discover that whoever lived here warned about an evil being. A being of ""Shadow and Flame...""",Deathtrooper22,"As an archaeologist, I work with the dead and the buried. Everything I see and everything I touch has long lost it's connection to the living. Even though I try to construct an image of what has been, I always feel as though I watch a movie. I never really feel like these civilizations ever existed.

And that was exactly how I thought I would experience our journey through what was named the Rocky Empire. But upon entering the hole in the cave wall, I experienced a feeling I could barely describe. It felt like this complex was being lived in. As if the ancient structures and halls were used every day by people. As we reached a central nexus of the complex we observed the massive temple that was hewn from the stone. Strong, imposing and cold to the touch. But somehow, it was warm. It called to us, no, me.

Inside the temple I led the team directly to the main chamber. I couldn't explain how I knew, but I knew where it was. Inside the chamber was a massive mural and before it, in the middle of the room stood this miracle of a long forgotten people. A single torch. lit. Ages without life had passed within the mountains, but here it stood firm. Lighting the mural, granting us vision of it's message.

Although our preliminary research had given us a near complete understanding of the language, I knew exactly what it said without the research notes. I don't know how long I looked at it, but one of my companions had used this time to translate the message:

*Nothing stops It, but Light undying.*
*For Light is made of Fire, like It.*
*Only Men can stop Light, Men can unleash It.*
*It is the burden of Men to never unleash it.*
*Even when it beckons.*

Lies. That was what it said. And they fell for it. I granted them sweet relief from this life of illusions. All for the Fire. Not the one burning, but the one banished by it. I hear you, my lord. I understand your command:

*Snuff out the Fire of Light and rekindle mine.*

I grabbed my flask and as the water doused the flame, it immediately rekindled. But it didn't illuminate the room anymore. In the darkness that remained He appeared before me. The being of Shadow and Fire, eager and unleashed.",OrangeSevens
"[WP] You get the opportunity to make whatever new laws you desire in a single speech; however, you can't tackle any serious issues, just pet peeves, petty complaints and first world problems. What do you say?",DeepDoughbeast,"Dark clouds carpeted the sky. Rain fell with the softness of snow but without the grace. Grimacing from the flashes of the gathered mob's cameras, she arrived on the speaking platform half-blind. Journalists from national and local press tussled and elbowed their way forward in an attempt to be the first to thrust their microphones into her face. ""Thank you for coming this morning"" she mumbled insincerely, setting her papers on the lectern in front of her. Voices hushed and a photographer refocused his camera, flinging an illegitimate flash of light towards the Prime Minister.

""As you all know, we have been debating a new public order bill for the last six months. Despite repeated knockbacks from the House of Lords, I can proudly say that we have today reached an agreement."" The hum of the press dropped to silence and some faces hardened. In noticeable silence, the Prime Minister looked down at her prepared speech and reordered it. Looking back up and exhaling slowly she began to read with a hint of disorientation, ""From this day forth there shall be no more eating of malodorous food on public transport."" A BBC journalist turned around to her cameraman in abject confusion. 

""No longer will our children have to suffer the infernal stench of cheese and onion crisps polluting their innocent, impressionable young nostrils while riding the bus to school""  the Prime Minister hurried, looking up to the sky to avoid eye contact. ""No longer will our elders be forced to endure the fishy overtones of tuna, salmon and prawn sandwiches as they take the underground to visit a doctor."" An audible laugh rippled through the assembled journalists. ""No longer will the morning commute be punctuated by the unpleasantness of egg salad"", an angry voice sounded from the back of the press pit.

Flush red with befuddlement and embarrassment, the Prime Minister scanned her brain for the speechwriting culprit of this nonsense but found herself unable to stop. ""To those who choose to ignore this law, our retribution will be swift. Our retribution will be strong"" she paused having just read the next sentence, and failing to improvise accordingly, blurted out ""Stronger than Stinking Bishop.""

""I will now take questions"" the Prime Minister murmured, too proud to apply the brakes to this runaway carriage. Having just finished a packet of cheese and onion crisps moments before the announcement, a journalist for The Daily Mail squirmed and decided to keep his questions to himself rather than risk possible indictment. Someone cleared their throat before calling out, ""Prime Minister? what about Mackerel pâté."" ",writeful

"[WP] You awake in the middle of the night to chanting outside your bedroom window. Pulling aside the curtain to investigate, you're greeted by a crowd of thousands cheering below, and the chanting of your name continues.",DoorToDecember,"Insomnia sucked, royally. I would wake up from the slightest thing the rare times I could get to sleep. Or I could just wake up for no reason at all to continue being tired all day. This time though, there was a very definite reason I’d woken up – I could hear some loud buzzing from outside. My normally dark room was lit up and my worst thought came to mind, “Fire?”

“…On” was all I could hear on repeat outside.  I flung my bed sheets off me and went from laying to standing faster than an army private when he gets caught by his senior officer sleeping in, I didn’t really want to get trapped in a burning building, or near one for that matter. I went to where the red glow behind my curtains was, flinging it open and hoping for the best sight, but instead I got a confusing one. It looked like a riot, except I saw smiling faces instead of angry ones. A crowd of hundreds, maybe thousands holding torches and… books? That’s not a normal kind of riot. The sounds were clearer now. “John… John…” 

“Wait, were they after me? What for? What did I do?” I thought in panic as my name kept filling my ears. I could hear some individual voices but I didn’t know what they were saying through the chanting. I wanted to be scared, but they were all happy, and holding… books. They couldn’t have been after my head, I was pretty sure they’d struggle to behead me with papercuts. I took a risk and left my bedroom, wandering through the halls in my pyjamas, a nerve wracking walk, to the door between me and a few thousand people after me. I held my breath, hand on the doorknob. Opening it I had to squint from the many torches outside blinding me, but soon enough I could walk out and open my eyes widely.

I saw so many signs, so many more people than I first guessed – many on my front lawn now. I couldn’t help but say loud enough to wake any of the city still asleep, “What the hell is going on?!”

The last thing I expected was someone without a torch to run up to me, and somewhat answer my question by forcing a book and a pen into my hand. “Can you sign this for me, please? I’m your biggest fan!” a young lady practically begged of me. I looked at the book in my hand, and I couldn’t recognise the title or art cover. But I did shockingly read the author. Johnathon Lidens. Me.

“Who wrote this?” I asked the lady, thumbing open the front cover to a page that was covered in love hearts, the book title in plain text overwritten by it, but the same name again was left uncovered.

“You of course! We’re all here for the signature! We loved the book release so much! You’re an amazing writer!” she screamed over the chanting. I looked around at the crowd, seeing signs. Love hearts with my name, my face on some peoples signs, it was absolutely crazy… I couldn’t believe it.

“My book release was this successful? It was barely a day ago, and I was barely a known author before it!” I was so happy!

But then I woke up. The best dream of my life. My eyes stared at the ceiling lit by the natural light of the sun. No torches, no chanting, no fans. I sat up straight in my chair, looking back at the monitor in front of me. Three pages of poorly written trash, untitled. And yet it still felt like one of my better writings. ‘Oh well’, I thought, ‘When you dream big I guess you wind up having pretty vivid imaginations.’ As I re-read what I’d written so far, ready to continue.

Hey! I occasionally try writing a story for WP, or challenging my girlfriend to writing a story with me! This prompt's my first 'completed' one in a while because you could tell the theme I went for with wanting to be a better writer, but this first person style is very foreign to me. Hopefully I can improve on it, and would love criticism towards it.

On a side note, this year we're both writing and gaming for charity! If you'd like to support us at all while we raise money for childrens hospitals (this is my 3rd year doing this, and her first!) check out her or my gaming stream twitch.tv/kiarathelioness or /MagpieMorgan, and the donation page through Extra Life! (Extra-life.org/participant/magpiemorgan or /kiarathelioness). We're contributing towards the same team so it doesn't matter who you pick as a favorite.

"[WP] You awake in the middle of the night to chanting outside your bedroom window. Pulling aside the curtain to investigate, you're greeted by a crowd of thousands cheering below, and the chanting of your name continues.",DoorToDecember,"At first it sounded like a swarm of buzzing flies. Droning, low-pitched yet consistent. I opened my eyes and realized that my attempt to just fall back asleep had failed and that the sound, seemingly getting louder and louder wasn’t part of a dream at all. Yet what was it then?

I didn’t put on any lights. I don’t like having the lights on after I wake up, it hurts my eyes. So after finally finding some pants in the darkness of my messy room I started to look for the source of the sound. That was the advantage of not having any lights on. My eyes had adjusted to the darkness and it was easy for me to distinguish the different colors coming from behind the curtains. Green, then red, then yellow, then green again, blue, as if someone was throwing a party on my balcony.

I opened the doors and then I saw it and quite a party it was indeed. Hundreds- no thousands of people who were looking at me, the guy in only his pants. They chanted my name and seemed to have gotten quite enthusiastic about my appearance. The low droning turned into something higher pitched and after a minute or so people started to fall silent. They waited for a word from me.

I could see tents and small campfires in the distance. Despite the hour I could see small stands where food was being prepared and served. It seemed like a- and then it hit me- a festival.
A festival, I recalled and I remembered last summer. The festival where the band pulled me on stage. I was drunk and after shouting something in the microphone people cheered and I remembered being brought to some guys in suits in a very fancy tent who complimented me and shared a glass of wine with me.

At first I thought that I had just mumbled something about being happy to be there on stage. I now know what I said and that the organizing committee was struggling to find a new location for next years happening.

Luckily I was there for them to help.

‘Next year at my place guys!’

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In fact I enjoy it much better if there are no persons around to view me snapping picture after picture, shot after shot.

The skin of the man almost came off as pure and wholesome considering the way the flash of the camera bounced off his body. What with the way the sun hit.. umff.

I've seen quite a few things in my day as a freelance gore photographer but this was unique. Original. Something different.

""Should've brought my makeup"" I had to add

I wanted to get a glimpse at the windows.. that is assuming the man has a soul. Had a soul.

My first impressions:

""Deer in the headlights""

""Typical""

But then what I saw in those eyes, was magical. Imaginative. Something that I just can't make up.

I see 3 clowns dancing around in his eyes.. but the clowns all had their arms intertwined and locked as they danced around this campfire.

A lullaby I haven't heard since I was still a baby begins playing on loop in my head.

The prancing around they did was synchronized and well timed with the music.

James.. the head elf, always does that from time to time.

This goes on for some time.. as the motion picture played I kept examining the body, poking and prodding about trying to figure out how it all comes together. How life itself is supposed to be special when the evidence of a life well lived is this

Sitting before me, an empty shell, a cocoon of a former Son, Father, Grandfather and now he is a martyr. A saint. Wasting away left for someone else to clean up.

After pondering on this thought, I had a revelation of sorts. The revelation had the potential to shatter my beliefs about morality, my place in the world and the meaning of life.. but before I could write the revelation down, my phone rings. It's Paul.

""Is it you?""

""Who else could it be?""

""Like the movie I made?""

""Yea yea""

""Now what about the DVD""

""Oh yeah, D-V-D. It's in my car, trunk. Swing by after work and get him, I mean it out""

In an attempt to lighten the mood and brighten the conversation I go

""Bet he won't be anxious anymore huh"" I chuckle like a jolly old man named Santa Claus

""No more sweating.. can't sweat when you're dead huh"" My sad attempt at a joke, although I snickered.

""Uh.""

I can picture Paul now, his eyes darting around the room. Paranoid and sketched out.

""Sure""

And then he hangs up.

My purpose has been served. The gig is up, time to go back home. But before leaving I had to take a look at just one more thing.

His teeth.

*phone ringing*

""Yeah.""

""GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE NOW. ASAP.""

""Slow down, breathe.. in-""

""IT'S DIRE. PLEASE, HURRY. BE AT THE OFFICE IN 5 MINUTES""

""Ok ok fine, relax. Give me a second""

At that he let out a yelp, I heard a wall being kicked and then the line went blank.

A bit agitated but my commute to work was pleasant overall. I got to listen to some self-help and motivational pep talks before striding into the office and starting the day.

The person on the phone is Shane. Met him back in college, he's an alright guy if I say so myself. Well he has a bit of an anxiety problem but he's usually laid back and chill. Although he wasn't always like this.. the stress of finals left a dent in his mind that, that I suppose hasn't quite healed.

Before I could even get out of my car this morning, Shane is speed walking out to me. He looks like he is on important business, but also looks as though he is anticipating the exact moment of his death.. looks as though he is going to be chewed up by a dog.

Sweat dripping from his armpits as usual, his forehead looks like he was just dunked in water.

""Car. Now. Lets go""

""C'mon man, just tell me what's wrong. I'm starving, hey did you get bacon egg and cheese for everyone?""

He ignores me, finally arriving at his destination, the driver's side window

""We had a call come in around 4 this morning. A man with 3rd degree burns is left out in an alley way. Paul wants you to check it out.. like now""

""Why doesn't he?""

""Because..""

He pauses, thinks for a few seconds and continues on

""Just, it's your job, alright. Here""

He hands me a stack of papers (which i'll never read mind you)

""This is all you need to know""

""Paul said he'll text you the address. Just pull off when you read it alright, don't need you ending up like Evan""

""Alright."" I said determined

The motivation playing in my stereo this morning has paid off. I rush to the scene, soon after getting back on the road I receive a text

""9914 22nd St. Right across from Hillsb. Mall. You'll see an old brick house right before you get to it. Have fun""

The journey took 3 hours but it was made all the more bearable by Desiigner's well thought out, philosophical and poetic rhymes which he uses as a way to communicate to the youth issues that can not only affect us, but our future generations as well.

Like global warming, deforestation, broads in Atlanta, instability in the Middle East and pollution.

At least the guy is passionate about pandas eh.

""If Shakespeare was alive today, THIS is the sort of music he would be listening to. That's what i'm talking about"" I snap my fingers in a rhymic manner

""Not any of that violent music now"" tapping my fingers on the steering wheel. My head rocking back and forth.

""Not that violent bluegrass or country we always hear about. Last time Sam Hunt had his guitar snatched he had to pop a cap in someone, sprayed the tour bus up last I heard."" I murmured to myself. Fed up with the state of music in this day and age.

Upon arriving at the scene, a few things struck me.

First being that there was no one to be seen, not even pedestrians. Second being that there were no officers there to brief me.. which is unusual but nothing a quick phone call can't fix.

After seeing the pizza laced arm of the burn victim..

God I love that sound, victim, the word just rolls off the tongue in such an elegant way. Has a nice ring to it really.

After seeing the pizza laced arm of the victim, I didn't want to call anyone. No one has to be around for the thrill I was about to experience",FridayReborn
[WP] The last image seen by a dying person is fixed on their eyes retina. You are an professional investigator who has seen a lot. Your latest finding shatters your believes.,GigantusRattus,"David leapt away from the microscope and collapsed into the piles of papers scattered across his desk. The image that had been etched into his mind for these  last 3 months returned to the surface. It surely couldn't be real. 
David gazed at the corpse lying on the table surface. The man was middle aged, quite possibly a worker at a large firm. He looked like the type of man who you would see walking the street every morning on his way to work, a briefcase in one hand, and a cup of coffee in the other. How did someone living such a normal life see such a horrifying thing at the end?

With shaking hands, David opened the client profile lying in front of him. He confirmed the state of death; heart attack. At first, this had not surprised David. It is common for a man of his age to go in such a way. But what he had not prepared for was to see that creature again.

In the past month, David had already encountered various clients who had seen that exact same image. The people were all completely different from the next, ageing from a young child to an elderly man. Their states of death were varying. 
David reassessed the situation. Perhaps it were just his imagination. The creature may be merely a smudge on the microscope lens. Another look would surely help him understand. 

David walked closer, then put his eye to the lens. He stared into the retina of the man lying in front of him. Then he saw the creature once again. The wicked smile, the dark figure, the piecing blue eyes. Yes, this was it. This was the monster. 

David moved his eye from the microscope once again. It couldn't be real. Surely not. He fumbled with the lens as he switched it to a cleaner one. A smudge on the lens, that was all it was. 

David looked through the microscope again, and was horrified to see the same creature once again. There was no excuse for it. This is truly what he saw. 

The investigator walked to his desk and opened a file. Contained in the file were various photographs of the same creature. Some showed the creature reaching towards the victim. Others had the creature baring its fangs. But it was the same creature nevertheless. 

David turned. The hairs on the back of his neck were rising. He felt as if he were being watched. 

He turned back to the album. Understanding washed over him as he looked at photograph at the top of the second page. He picked it up from the page and examined it. The photo seemed the same as the others, but there was a slight difference. 

David glanced behind him, still feeling as if there were eyes on his back. Then he began to scribble notes in the margin, as he analysed the photograph that would have the solution. David then stopped, sensing the presence behind him that had haunted him for so long. 

David did not realise he still existed. After all the visits to the psychologists, the doctors for his medications; he had believed that his alter ego was gone. But David was wrong.

""I am still here.""

David turned around for the last time, ready to meet his fate, knowing that the creature would be there. 
He gazed at the creature, who was identical to the one in the photographs. David rubbed his blue eyes, accepting the creature in front of him. 

David, ""It was you all along, wasn't it?""

The creature just smiled knowingly, baring his fangs one last time.",MidnightCross

"[WP] You have died, only to wake up in a clinically decorated VR pod with a vacant eyed woman asking 'if the experience was up to your expectations...'",GreyandDribbly,"Fragments of thought and shards of incoherent sentences passed through my mind as I regained consciousness. I slowly began to notice I was standing in some sort of water as the realization finally set in. I had *died*. *I had*. *Died*. I must have. There is no way I could have survived the fall. It was all coming back to me. The smile on my fiancées face, the adrenaline filled holiday trip we were on, the way she kissed me and said ""good luck"" right before I bounced myself off the edge of the airplane. The violent roar of wind as I was falling and the way my heart stopped when I realized the parachute would never open. 


I slowly opened my eyes, trying to address my current situation. Darkness. Where am I? Is this the afterlife? Slowly floating away in warm nothingness. I tried to touch my face and I realized I was wearing some sort of mask. Surprised, I spread my arm out, only to hit what felt like a glass panel in front of me. 


I suddenly realized the level of the water I was standing in was rapidly decreasing. Before I could even feel panic, I heard a clicking sound followed by a bright light and a rush of cold air on my body. My eyes slowly adjusting, I realized I was looking out to a white tiled room. It didn't look like anything I had ever seen before, immaculate and lit with neon lights. It had nothing but sets of chambers lined around the wall, none of which were transparent. As I tried to step out of my chamber, feeling as if though I had forgotten how to walk, I noticed I wasn't alone in the room. 


A woman, her blonde hair pulled up in a perfect bun, dressed in an elegant short white dress walked towards me. 


""I see that you are awake. Welcome back."" 


I shivered, and it wasn't only because of the cold. There was something *off* about her. She was perfectly composed, not a stray hair in her haircut or a ruffle on her dress, and her eyes... They were cold and vacant, almost as if though they were made of glass.


""What happ... Where am..."", my voice cracked as I tried to string together a meaningful sentence.


""Unfortunately, the 168 hours you have paid to spend in the simulator have run out. For an extended visit, you may pay a chosen number of extra hours, or you may purchase our premium month, six month or year packages.""


Simulator... Package... I tried to understand what she was talking about, when I it hit me. 


&gt;First, the smog became thicker and thicker. Then, it became so thick we could barely see the sun. Before we knew it, they started recommending on the news that we should all wear oxygen masks at all times. Then they started selling full body suits to protect us from ever rising temperatures and radiation. All plant life had long died out, and all food was manufactured in closed off government facilities. 


""If you do not wish to purchase an extended visit, I can guide you to the protective suit and personal belongings storage area"", she said in her cold robotic voice. I swear, they make these things more lifelike every day. 


""No thank you"", I replied and rushed out of the room. I had been here enough times to know my way out.  


""I can guide you to the protective suit and personal belongings storage area"", she repeated, her algorithm unable to compute my response, but her voice faded away in the distance as I left her behind. I rushed through a series of hallways, perfectly designed seating areas, gift shops and photo places, restaurants serving the cardboard we all called food these days. 


I finally reached the exit lobby, a group of fully equipped and masked people giving me weird looks as I rushed to the vacuum sealed door wearing no protection at all. I had made up my mind, I was deluding my self long enough. This was no way to live, free, free at last, I thought as I ran outside before anybody could stop me, as I deeply inhaled the smog that was now our atmosphere.

At first, everybody thought this was just some ridiculous pop-up ad that just happened to appear on ever website. Good thing the government admitted ""Yeah, this was real"". Not those exact words, but that's what I understood from it. I already believed it was real to begin with. I tend to be a bit gullible, so the second I saw the flashing text on the side of the computer screen, I immediately tried to figure out a way to abuse this. I almost jumped out of my seat at the computer room in the public library. I was debating whether I should tell my one true friend - the librarian. She was aging and probably didn't have too long to live. ""I should do my best to think about her everyday"", I thought. She probably wouldn't have believed me, and I had to go back to the foster home soon, anyways. I'll tell her tomorrow. At least I'm thinking about her, so there CAN be a tomorrow for her. I wondered if this was always something that existed, but we only recognized recently... why did people die so young before the 20th century, then? So many questions, and so much time I have to never look for the answers. I usually stare off into space when thinking but something on the bus just kept distracting me. Or should I say, someone. No, it wasn't the beautiful lady across from me. No, it wasn't the man who was almost 3 feet taller than me. It was the old lady in a bright neon yellow and green suit. ""I wonder why she's wearing that..."" I thought to myself. Then it hit me. That is how I was going to live forever. I saved up as much money as I could before hitting up a costume shop, and wearing my new favorite outfit: my chicken suit. 

That was such a long time ago... it really suprised me how I remember all that. I guess everyday I stay alive, my memory stays intact. Or maybe it's just since I've had so much time to think about it. So much time... I wish I looked as young as I did, then. But hey, I still look a tenth of my actual age. Pretty hot for a guy almost 900 years old now. The amount of wars I've seen, diseases I've survived through, the history I've made and shared... all in my costume. Granted, I had multiple suits, one for every day of the year. You accumulate quite a bit of money after a few centuries. I was on the verge of death when I kept wearing the same chicken suit everyday. People who saw me regularly started to get used to it. So I started buying all sorts of different outfits. I love seeing the looks on people's faces nowadays when I wear a costume this movie from the 24th century. Outddated references always keep people thinking.

The real problem is... I don't like my life. I'm stuck. If I wear normal clothes, and not a costume, people think ""Why isn't he wearing the costume?"" Boom, another day. But this... this curse works with your thoughts and actions as well. The amount of times I've tried to kill myself but failed... it's almost a game now. I only keep wearing costumes because I want to see how much the world can change. In 2481, World War Eleven created a huge wasteland that reminded me of one of my favorite videogames:  Fallout 27. The very small remaining population recovered very quickly, back to normal by 2791, which sounds like a lot of other people, but not too much for me. I loved how people turned to me for help. I wasn't the smartest, far from it in fact, but I still did my best. I wonder if one day, people will forget about me. I hope they do. Immortality is a bitch.",rjtiger126

"[WP] Every time someone thinks about you, your life is extended by one day. Despite being a nobody with no family or friends, you've been alive for centuries.",IAmAWizard_AMA,"To start off here, there are a few things that you should know.

The first being that I am not evil, I am not a bad person and no i'm not a vampire. I am no god neither am I a blasphemer. I've made very bad decisions in my life, sure, I'm flawed just like you. But some people are confronted with, certain options in life that are far greater than what most people will experience. This isn't a jab at anyone, I PRAY no one has to ever face what I faced this one night (which I mention later in this post)

With that said, here is how the message you are about to read came about.

About a month or two ago I was contacted by a man who said he 'knew' about me (how he knew, I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet). At first I didn't respond, what did he 'know' about me? What was there to know? I am a retired entrepreneur who has a passion for bread and golf.. I donate to churches all over the globe but what is there to say about that? What did he have to know?

My past.. and how far it extends.

I feared blackmail, extortion, incarceration or even murder. But this person proved to be very kind and generous. He told me that he could help me get my story out there without revealing my true identity. He is now sitting next to me, drilling me on how Reddit, YouTube and Facebook works (despite my age, I still don't understand Facebook.. and I've been trying to wrap my head around this since 2004).

He's making us pancakes and cool-aid right now actually, I've answered 100 questions by now.. and he continues to interrogate me (which I don't mind, the last I had an in depth heart to heart conversation about my, unique situation, was in 1422 with a buddy of mine named Simon.. most people now know him as Masaccio)

To make a long story longer, this person who shall remain nameless offered to be a courier of sorts and post this on his Reddit account.

In all my years on this planet, I have never known a person to be so kind and so charitable. Honestly this is the highlight of my life right now.. I have been dying to get this out there for the world to see since this happened. But could not for obvious reasons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It all started when I was 16 going on 17. I lived in Spain with my family (a LARGE one at that). One day as i'm walking home from school a friend stops me on the street and tells me that an arrest warrant was issued and if I didn't leave NOW that i'd likely face death. Why was I facing arrest? That's another story for another time.

Leaving my family at such short notice was at best a nuisance and at worst, a regret. I had to ask my family to provide the means for me to leave, they did so even if they had to cut back on food for a bit..

I relocated to Rome but found that the city was far too crowded for my taste and so I moved to the outskirts of Italy.. by the time I settled down in my new domain, I was informed of the arrest of everyone in my family. All those in my household at least. From my father down to my cousins.. all facing trial.

They would go on to die from unnatural causes and this has led to nothing but guilt and pain ever since. I haven't been back to Spain ever since, it has made me beyond bitter and jaded.

Enraged, itching for revenge and itching for blood, I removed myself to a local chapel to fast and pray.

This happened around midnight, it was a humid night I remember.. but as i'm praying a guy walks in and asks me for directions to a shop nearby or something. I think he said he was looking for a relative and that he needed to ask her about some family issues. The exact details of the conversation escape me.

Then he pulls out a thick letter, a contract. It was written in Latin.. I don't speak Latin and neither did he but he said that his boss wrote it up and that he paid for the food (modern day equivalent of this expression would be pays the bills, keeps the lights on, etc).

What struck me as odd wasn't the conditions that he offered.. but the print. It was written in such a small font.. I would be surprised if anyone with a magnifying glass could read it.

He said if I signed on the bottom dotted line, that everything would go back to normal. I could return home, my family would be alive again, my warrants and such would be cancelled and no one would be out to arrest me.

""It will all be one blur of a dream"" 

Is what he kept on saying, I was reluctant he was persuasive and I thought.. why not.

So I signed. The rest as they say is history.

Today this is known as a ""Faustian Pact"" (I detest the phrase, Faust was a close friend of mine.. the story doesn't portray him in an accurate light. He did indeed sign but there were other factors at play that were never mentioned. It breaks my heart to see people throwing his name around in the dirt, using it to refer to people selling their soul for fame or whatever).

Back then, situations like the one I encountered was not uncommon. It happened often actually. Many in the past have made similar deals and have paid dearly for it. The effects were, less than favorable (think: Black Plague. The Plague was a direct result of people who didn't read the terms and conditions (probably because they couldn't read Latin) and thought everything was good, nothing was bad. Or in today's terms.. that there are no downsides to the most desired things in life. So they went on signing deals, shaking hands. And the public has paid for it. And continues to pay for it to this day.. global warming, ringing any bells?)

The point of this was to show people that, actions have consequences. It's not just a moniker drilled into your head from Day 1 as just something to fill the allotted time and space with. But that it's actually true.

One mistake, one wrong move can put you on a completely different track than previously planned and set forth (by evolution or God whichever you believe)

Before the deal, I was afraid to die.

Now i'm afraid to NOT die. It's exhausting, I could commit suicide

The day was... I don't remember. October, maybe? It was Fall.

The forest was orange and yellow. Leaves were falling at my feet, taunting me. They could die. I walked between the trees. ""Why was I still alive?"", I asked myself, again. ""Leaves fall, trees die. Why am I still here?""

I knew of my ""powers"", obviously. The doctor explained that every time someone thought of me, I would live another day. Another month. Another year. But there was no one to think of me. So why was I still alive?

Time passed, people died. One by one, everyone left me in this cruel, evil world. Why could they ascend to heaven? Why am I the only one that can't?

I continued. The city was still the same: desert, alone, sad. How much time has passed? Centuries, maybe? I really do not know.

Everywhere I went, everywhere I ventured, it was always alone. No one to talk to me. No one to remember me. Who still thinks of me? Is anyone still alive? Even if there is... No.

Everyone is dead. Everyone died a long time ago. Well, except me.

Except... Me?

My mind clicked.

It was me, obviously. I'm thinking of myself, of course. How could I be such an idiot?

I was happy. Happy to finally know the reason of my existence. But the feeling didn't last long.

""I can't die. It's... It's impossible. How can I not think of me? There's no way to do that!""

Panic. Screams. For the first time in my life, I was terrified of the idea of not being able to die. I would live forever. FOREVER!

I just... I just need to forget. One day, one day... One day I will stop remembering.

I lay down, with my face on the grass. I start counting. One, two, three...

One day I will forget. One day, I will only remember numbers, counting numbers.

And in that day, Death will finally embrace me.",LemionIceCream
"[WP] All your life, time randomly stops and a large interface appears with 2 mandatory choices. This time a third choice appears.",PeepingUnicorn,"Every time I was faced with a decision in my life, time stopped. It was a blessing and a curse. A large, holographic interface would appear with two options. 

The first time I can remember it happening, I was 8 years old. My younger brother and I had been play fighting and he took it to far. When he hit me with a pillow, my head hit the wall. Before I could even react, time stopped. A swooping noise startled me and the screen appeared. It gave me two options: ""Cry and tell Mom"" or ""Laugh and keep playing"". I still felt the pain in my head. I was enraged. I chose to tell my mom. 

This happened often through out my life. Sometimes I would spend what felt like hours debating between my two options. I enjoyed being able to weigh out my options. I hated that I always overthought my choice though. 

I never understood why this happened. No one believed me when I told them. It's still a mystery to me, but I've grown to live with it. 

I woke up this morning and the day felt different. My coffee tasted different and my clothes smelled different. I assumed I was just in a slump. The weather is cold but it's still sunny. I wrapped myself in a blanket and decided to read some of my book before traveling to my parents house for the weekend. 

After a relaxing morning, I cleaned myself up and packed to head out to my parents. I was excited to see them, considering I haven't seen them since Christmas. They live a few hours from me, so I packed a small snack and my favorite CDs for the drive. 

I pulled out of the driveway and began the journey to their southern home. As I continued my drive down the highway, I sang my favorite songs at the top of my lungs. The current CD came to an end. I reached to change it out. Time stopped. The interface appeared.  I scanned my surroundings. Within the seconds I looked away from the road, a semi in front of me and flipped on its side. The cab of the semi only feet from the front of my car. 

I looked at my options. For the first time, I had three. 

1. Swerve to the left, hit the median and die. 
2. Swerve to the right, hit the car next to me and kill that driver.
3. Do not swerve at all and kill the semi driver. 

No matter the option I chose, someone was dying. 

I began to feel panicked. I had no way out. Nothing to do. I didn't want to die and I didn't want to kill anyone. I looked the my right. The driver was a middle aged woman in a minivan. She had stickers of stick people and a ""I love my family"" sticker on her back windows. I couldn't kill that woman. Her family needs her. 

I look at the semi truck. I couldn't see the driver. I was livid. I started to blame him. This was his fault. I wouldn't be making this decision if he hadn't flipped his truck. Out of anger, I begin to reach forward to choose not to swerve. 

I couldn't do it. 

I swerved left. ",tooclosetotouchh

"[WP] You are a single parent, and your child has shown you their drawing of a monster. You discover that the monster is real.",SprikenZieDerp,"I re-arranged the other pieces of artwork on the refrigerator and grabbed one of the few remaining magnets to keep the new drawing in place.

“It’s my monster!” Micah said.

I smiled at him. It was one of his better drawings. The arms were too large on the body, but they appeared symmetrical. The orange fur that covered the “beast” stayed neatly within the black outlines. The eyes were dark pin points of mashed crayon, and two red fangs peeked out from a nearly straight line that turned up at  the last second - a vague hint of a smile. Unlike Micah’s other drawings this one seemed composed and practical, almost like a portrait. Micah’s other drawings were confused compositions of a child trying to keep a single image fixed in his mind, and failing. “It’s a very good monster.” I said.

“Not a monster, mommy! My monster. The one that’s been scaring me. He wanted me to draw a picture of him.”

“That’s nice sweetie, I’m sure you did a great job.” There had been a few nights he had come to my bed with tears in his eyes. The nightmare must’ve looked something like this monster. 

I took a step back and regarded my son’s gallery of art. A colorful collage of children, dogs, dragons, and monsters with wide open mouths screaming to escape the pages. I smiled at the collage and vaguely wondered if he had found his talent. Perhaps I should keep these as artifacts for his future biographer to paint a picture of a genius’s artistic development. I dreamed what every parent wanted for their children: a better life.

“Go clean up for dinner, Micah,” I said.

He was already walking away leaving behind a mess of half colored pages and worn down crayons. “Come back and clean this up!” I called, but he ignored me and walked down the short hallway to his room. He shut the door, and a moment later I could hear his muffled voice.

I sighed to myself, and dropped the fire to low before chasing after him.  Things were getting harder. All year, ever since his father left, I felt control slipping further and further away.

As I got to his door I could hear him talking a little more clearly, enough to pick out a few words. I got closer and pressed my ear against the door.

“She didn’t listen,” Micah said. “I think you were right. She doesn’t believe me.”

You I repeat to myself. My heart sinks and a thousand scenarios start running through my head: personality disorder, intruder, imaginary friend, real friend with drugs (Micah was only four, but the thought emerged with frightening clarity). All of these things came down to one clear problem. My son could be in danger. In one quick move I turned the knob and pushed open the door.

Micah stood up suddenly and twisted around to see his mom. His short curly hair bounced on his forehead, and he took several steps away from his mother without looking where he was going. His foot found a misplaced Hot Wheel. The toy car slipped out from under him and he fell hard, breaking his fall with his wrist. It was the shock, however, not the pain that made him start crying.

I didn’t see this happen to Micah, from the moment I opened the door I stood transfixed at the impossible figure dominating the room. Standing just outside the open closet door was an seven foot tall orange-furred beast. Its huge arms hung off its small body, making it look like a gorilla standing on two legs. Pin point black eyes watched me and its mouth opened revealing several red fangs. It was the monster from Micah’s drawing.

The room began to narrow and spin around me. My legs grew weak, and the tunnel vision brought the last remains of my focus to the monster standing dumbfounded in my son’s bedroom. It was starting to raise a giant paw. Razor sharp claws extended out of those paws. Micah’s drawing hadn’t shown that. I would’ve fainted then had Micah not fallen and started crying. The high pitched wail broke the shock filling my mind and brought me back to reality. The reality of an impossible monster was no longer the top priority on my list. My son was in pain.

“I’ll get to you in a minute.” I said to the monster trying my best to sound confident. I even waggled my finger at him, though no part of my conscious being directed me to do that. Perhaps it was my subconscious pulling up memories from how my mother talked when she disciplined me. Micah was sitting on the ground his legs sprawled out under him. He was holding his left hand in his right, and tears were rolling down his face. He wasn’t screaming anymore, just sobbing occasionally.

“Oh, sweetie, what happened? Did you fall and hurt your hand?”

Micah nodded.

“Here,” I said, “let Mommy kiss it and make it all better.” I grabbed his hand and checked for any serious damage. There wasn’t any. I covered it quickly with kisses until Micah started giggling and pulled his hand free.

“Stop it!” He said, “You’re embarrassing me!”

That single comment rang our with all the weight of the future when Micah would start to pull away from me. When he would ask for my car keys and not come back until the next morning. When he would say goodbye and leave me to fill the emptiness in my home. The weight of that future settled on my heart, but I brushed that away and focused on something a bit less scary: the seven-foot orange monster in my son’s bedroom.

“Okay,” I said standing up and addressing the monster. “What are you?”

“He’s my monster, mommy,” Micah said also getting to his feet.

“I didn’t ask you, and there’s no such thing as monsters.”

“Ouch.” The monster said putting one huge hand over his chest where his heart was supposed to be. “That was mean.”

“Well it’s true,” I said.

“No it’s not.” The monster said simply. He dropped his hand down and looked at Micah, “tell her Mike.”

“His name isn’t Mike!” I shouted. Everyone at preschool called him Mike and it drove me crazy. “It’s Micah! My-kuh! If I wanted him to be called Mike I would’ve named him Mike. Why is it so hard for people?”

The monster raised both furry paws and stepped backwards towards the closet. “Sorry, he said he liked to be called Mike is all.”

“Yeah Mommy it’s okay,”  Micah said. “I like it when he calls me Mike.”

“What do you mean you like it? He’s a monster!”

“Ha!” The monster called out. “So I am a monster. Therefore there are such things as monsters.” He turned to Micah, “that’s logic, Mike. You’ll need to use it a lot when you get older.” 

“What? What are you talking about? Micah what is going on? What is that thing?” I suddenly felt very small. How I had come to rely on my four year old son for a handhold on reality.

“He’s the monster from my closet, Mommy,” Micah said simply. “He asked me to draw a picture of him, so I did.” He turned to the monster, “you liked it right?”

“Oh, yes. It was very good.” He nodded to me, “kid’s got talent. And I don’t say that about every kid I go around scaring. I’ve asked lots of ‘em to draw pictures of me when they graduate, but none of them look quite as good as Mike’s. He kept it all neat and in the lines.”

“Graduated?” I asked. That was the only word that stuck out in my mind, all the other ones slipped by half observed.

“Yup!” The monster said smiling at Micah. “He did very well. It only took five visits for him to stop being scared of me. At the Monster Academy we call that an A.”

“A for awesome!” Micah shouted with his hands in the air.

“A for awesome!” The monster roared back throwing his own hands into the air. His claws scraped the ceiling showering him in a white dust that clung to his fur. “Sorry,” he said brushing it off.

“Okay,” I said, “So let me get this straight. You’ve come into my child’s room five times in the middle of the night while he is sleeping to scare him?”

“Well it sounds creepy when you say it that way.”

“It was creepy,” Micah said, “well, at first.”

“IT’S ALWAYS CREEPY!” I shouted. “No one’s supposed to come into my child’s bedroom in the middle of the night! No one!” I took step towards the monster with that same waggling finger raised up. He had vicious sharp claws attached to heavy paws that could rip me to shreds in a second, but I had a finger.

The monster took a step back.

“It’s part of the job lady. Monster’s gotta scare the kid. Show ‘em how to be tough in the dark. Maybe you don’t remember what it’s like to be new in this world, but you gotta learn to not be afraid of things you can’t explain. Little Mike, uh, Micah over there did a great job.” 

“Thanks” Micah said, but looked worried as I moved closer to the monster.

“You get one thing straight mister,” I was close enough to poke his furry chest. It hurt, but I ignored the pain, “no one is going to scare my child more than me. You got that? I’m his mother, and I’m the one he’s going to think about every time he thinks about doing something bad. It’s my voice he’s going to hear in the back of his head when he thinks, ‘what’s the worst that can happen.’ So don’t you come into my house and try to scare my child into learning life lessons because that is my job buddy.” I poked him harder again forcing the monster back another step, “so get back in your closet and never come back.”

I turned around and saw Micah wide-eyed staring at me. His mouth was hanging slightly open. He was awestruck at the complete and utter defeat of the thing that had terrorized his dreams for the last few weeks. The monster took one more step back and disappeared into the closet. I turned and closed the closet door.

“Okay, I said clapping my hands together. “Dinner’s almost ready, but I think you have enough time to clean up your room. Okay?”

“Yes mommy!” Micah said quickly, and he began to collect his toys.

I smiled and went back to the kitchen to finish dinner.

On the other side of the portal Micah’s monster delivered his final report to his supervisor. “Everything went well on the Micah case,” he said. “Poor guy was so scared of his mother I thought he might we himself.” The monster laughed.

“Good,” the supervisor said, “single parents need all the help they can get.”",jagaimo314
"[WP] You are a single parent, and your child has shown you their drawing of a monster. You discover that the monster is real.",SprikenZieDerp,"I was finishing my night as I would any other Sunday, lounging in my chair downstairs reading by the fire. Dogs were walked dishes done my girls had brushed their teeth and all settled in bed. The house was finally quiet, my mind relaxed I shut off all the lights and made my way to bed. On my way upstairs I noticed a faint light coming from under the doorway of my youngest daughters bedroom, I decided to investigate. 

With two small knocks the door slowly opened and there she was, pencil in hand furiously scribbling away at her notebook. “Sweetie, c’mon its time for bed” I said as I sat on her bed reaching for her notebook. “Daddy no” she whispered at me quietly yet firmly tearing the notebook from my hand and holding it close to her chest. I started to react but then stopped as I realized she was crying. I asked her what could possibly be upsetting her so much and she responded with “If I cant draw it, it says it will take me away” at this she broke into tears sobbing into my arms. I calmly reassured her that everything would be fine, holding her closely I grabbed her book and started to flip through the pages.

A lump formed in my throat, for on the pages were professionally drawn images of a thin tall sickly looking monster, it had the same position in every sketch neck bent forward jaw agape, at its feet were piles of bloody bones. 

“Honey…  where did you.. how did you come up with.. these?” She sniffed and wiped her eyes.. “Daddy” she said calmly “its right behind you”.

"[WP] You are a single parent, and your child has shown you their drawing of a monster. You discover that the monster is real.",SprikenZieDerp,"It was hard being single again. 

Not single exactly- she had to face it. Divorced. 

There were a few problems with that distinction. People treated her differently- either skating around the subject or being awkwardly sympathetic- and those friends they used to share as a couple...well. 

It was all so very awkward. 

Then there were the bills of course. She didn't know why she became a housewife at Jerry's insistence, just that she'd thrown away a high-flying future, disappointed her parents, and was now at her wits end trying to find a job that she wasn't overqualified or too old for. Through all of this, she was also busy pretending she was ok to her little ball of sunshine. 

It was quite stressful to look like she and Life were good pals while going for job interviews. 

At least someone was taking this whole situation better than her. It was hard to smile sometimes, but whenever she saw Fabian playing with his toys or when she took him to the park- it reminded her that things were still ok. 

She did have him after all, and that was all that was important anyway. 

""What's this?"" 

""It's my friend."" Fabian told her, not looking up from his colouring. ""He's always happy even though he's sad."" 

""A sad friend?"" she frowned. She had hoped that her negativity wasn't visible to him. ""Uh, what is he?"" 

""He plays with me sometimes."" the child said, ""He knows all the best places to play hide and seek.""

That wasn't an answer. She was vaguely worried about the weird tails and the big teeth but Fabian did always have a very active imagination. 

""I suppose it's good you can be happy."" she muttered to herself. 

About a week later she discovered the bell. It was a tiny iridescent thing just by the Fabian's bed. It glinted oddly when she held it up to the light, as if it was emanating light of its own. 

She had a strange instinct to keep it so she did. 

Time passed. Fabian started attending school and she got a job as a cashier by hiding information about her higher qualifications. It wasn't a terribly glamorous job for somebody of her background but she'd never really wanted a glamorous life anyway so it was all good. 

""Fabian!"" 

Then the bus accident happened. God, she was so worried when she heard news of the school bus' accident but Fabian seemed oddly ok. 

""My friend saved me."" he told her, ""He made the bus stop so that it wouldn't run me over."" 

""Who is this friend of your?"" she asked, ""*Fabian*."" 

He didn't want to answer. She frowned but let him go. She remembered the odd bell she'd found. 

She waited until it was night and Fabian was asleep. Again she had a strange urge to keep the bell with her and she stayed up as the moon rose. 

She rang the bell. 

It rang with a single, dull note. Something shifted in the darkness of her bedroom and resolved itself into a form. 

It had many tails. It had white, sharp teeth.

She screamed. 

Then she stilled when the sound seemed to reflect back at her in a muffled echo. 

""W-what are you?"" she growled, ""What do you want with my son?"" 

It yipped and jumped up onto her bed, snuggling at her side. She had no room to squirm away so she just lay there trembling but it did not seem to mind. Eventually, she dared to run a hand along its furry coat. 

""Soft...""

"[WP] One day God comes back to check on Earth, realizing he forgot to turn friendly fire off.",Thenameless872,"""Off,"" he inquired, staring at God through his foggy spectacles. ""As in...we weren't supposed to be able to do that?""

God nodded.

""But all those people who...uh...got murdered..."" He trailed off, not knowing where he was going with his own sentence. Surely God didn't intend to bring them back?

God simply shrugged. ""They're dead. Kinda late in release now to do a rollback. That'd piss waaaay too many people off. Not to mention I'm not even sure if the server could handle that many people online at once.""

He stared at God, blinked, and hesitantly asked, ""Server?""

""Yeah, I know, that's gotta be super confusing for you. Heh, actually it, aheh, it's pretty funny! You guys have these things you play games on, and you just happened to wind up calling them servers. That, haha! That's actually funny! You know I never really thought about--"" God rambled on, leaving the man to slowly wrestle with his own definitions of reality as God continued to spout increasingly confusing drivel.

""Man, now that I think about it, you guys aren't still able to, like, procreate with your family members, are you? That feature was supposed to be discontinued after the first few cycles.""

The man blinked.

""Actually I don't even wanna know, I'll just fix that bit while I'm here."" As soon as he had finished talking, God smiled and then said, ""And that's that taken care of. Listen, I gotta get back to the office. It's crunch time on the next big update and man, it is gonna be intense. Can't let the boys upstairs catch me making small talk, y'know? Er...do you know? Ahh, yeah, probably not.""

As God turned to leave the man simply followed God with his eyes, mouth agape, unable to form a complete thought. There was a bright neon glow of light, and as it grew brighter to engulf God, he turned to the man and smiled again. ""Have fun not getting murdered! But uh...good luck with the cancer."" And then God was gone, leaving the man, still staring at the sky, alone.",Pybro5ever

This time you remembered to bring a knife to this gun fight.",TrustMeImMagic,"The problem, quite clearly, was Hubert's pacifism.

""A man is going to rob me,"" he'd explained to Dr. Sheila Winthorp, his therapist (13x) and lover (2x). ""He'll have a gun. I can give him everything I have - I can even bring extra with me, just to try and make him happy - and it won't be enough. He's going to shoot me. And it's not really going to matter where he shoots me, apparently. I guess I'm a bit of a bleeder.""

""These are... *dreams* you've been having?"" asked Winthorp, professionally bemused.

""Sure, why not,"" sighed Hubert. ""The point is, it's going to happen.""

""What does he look like? Your killer?""

""Average,"" said Hubert. ""Desperate. I never see his face so clearly, but his hair is blond and his lip - his upper lip - it's like it's been fixed, you know? Like when kids have...""

""Cleft palate?""

Hubert snapped his finger. ""That. Just slightly off. His breath whistles, too. That's what I remember.""

""Why can't you prevent it, do you think?"" asked Winthorp. ""You have more control over yourself and the events of your life than I think you're giving yourself credit for.""

""I don't know why,"" said Hubert. ""I've tried... well, just about everything. I even went to a different college...twice... Once I didn't go to college at all. Different career. Didn't marry Winnie. Only bought Toyotas. Went vegan. *That* was miserable. It's inevitable. Somehow, it's inevitable. I can't shake this *man*.""

""This is all... this is you visualizing different paths for yourself, correct?""

""What?"" Hubert sat up on the couch. ""Oh. I haven't told you this go around, have I? I'm cursed. Every time I die, my life resets to the day of my sixteenth birthday. Every time. Frankly, I don't know how many go-rounds this is, but at some point, oh... maybe 50 - 60 - 70 tries ago, I started being murdered by this mugger. I can't escape him. No matter what I change, he always shows up, he robs me, and then he kills me. Weird, huh?""

Dr. Winthorp swallowed. ""This really feels like information you should have shared in the first session.""

""I did!"" said Hubert. ""The first time. You had me committed. Very unpleasant. I avoided you for about ten tries after that. A bit miffed. But you're the best, and I found that slipping it in around the seventh session worked best. Must have lost track this time around.""

Winthorp cleared her throat. ""Alright. Okay. Well, I suppose the natural question is - if you know the man is coming, and you can't avoid him, *and* you know he's going to kill you, why haven't you tried to kill him first?""

Hubert blanched. ""I haven't the heart for it. Taking a life? All that blood and gore? I couldn't live with myself. And besides, I'd be caught, wouldn't I? Then I'd have to spend the rest of this turn in prison, before starting it up all over again.""

""What have I told you before?"" asked Winthorp. ""I'm assuming nothing especially helpful.""

""Well, you've definitely told me the bit about killing him first before. Wouldn't have taken you for the bloodthirsty type before that. You told me to change things. Keep trying. Focusing on myself, and *not* my murderer. Uh, you may have recommended yoga once. It gets a bit hazy the further back you go.""

""Right."" Winthorp sighed, sinking into her armchair. ""This has not been great for my personal esteem. Why were you cursed, by the way?""

Hubert reddened deeply. ""No one *said* anything, mind you. There's no... no documentation, but... the night before... so, I go back to my sixteenth birthday, right? That day. I wake up that morning. But the night before... you have to remember, it's been a long time, so it's not especially clear. Are we out of time? Do we need to table this until next time?""

""Plenty of time,"" said Winthorp. ""Go on.""

""I... borrowed my father's car the night before I turned 16. Celebrating, I suppose. Some friends and I, we bought some beer... a lot of beer... and we went to the beach. We drank, I guess, maybe too much. Just had fun. I felt fine, though. Really. I did. I dropped my friends off. Then I went home. And...""

Hubert shook his head. ""I really don't remember it now. And I don't think it's related... I don't think I did it... probably. But a girl died that night. Hit by a car. It was the other side of town. Nowhere near my house, but close to my friend Jimmy's house. So... I didn't think it was... I didn't think it was anything to do with me.""

""I don't get the impression that's true,"" said Dr. Winthorp. 

""Maybe,"" said Hubert, quietly. ""I thought... maybe it was me. Maybe I did it. And then I kept going *back*. Back to the day after. So it's the one thing I *couldn't* change. I always wake up and the thing is done and then I'm just living with it. Sometimes I'm convinced I did it. Sometimes I don't know. But I can't pretend it's not connected - that night in the car and me always coming back.""

""Is it the worst thing you ever did?"" asked Winthorp.

""If I...?"" Hubert closed his eyes and nodded. ""Yes. It's the very worst thing.""

""Have you ever considered turning yourself in?""

""That wouldn't... it wouldn't fix anything, would it?""

""It wouldn't bring back the dead, no,"" said Winthorp. ""But maybe it would help *you*.""

""Yes,"" said Hubert. ""Maybe. Maybe. I'll think about it. And do you think... what should I do about the mugger?""

""Nothing. What's there to do?""

Hubert sighed. ""Right. I think that's time.""

""It is,"" said Winthorp, standing. ""See you next week?""

""No,"" said Hubert. ""Not next week.""

""Oh. So it's...?""

Hubert nodded. ""But I'll see you again. In another life.""

Hubert had one foot out the door when Winthorp called out. ""And you're sure you won't try turning yourself in this time?""

""It won't help,"" said Hubert, very quietly, not turning around to look her in the face. Then he was gone.

Dr. Sheila Winthorp sighed. ""So close. So, so close."" Time clicked, flipped, and turned over. A chime rang above the door, followed by a knock. ""Come in.""

The man who came in was tall and pale, blond and stooped. Air whistled through his nostrils as he strode towards the couch.

""Good morning, Dr. Winthorp,"" he said. 

""Good morning, Eric. How are you today?""

The man shrugged. ""I need to tell you something. Something strange. I don't know if you'll believe me.""

""I'm here to help, not to judge.""

""I... I've done this all before,"" said the man. ""So many times before, and I don't know why it keeps happening or what I should do about it...""

""That's fine,"" said Winthorp, cool and empathetic. Her eyes traced the hollowed indent of the man's upper lip. ""Just start from the beginning...""

That first night never leaves my mind. I was born at 7:34 PM, apparently. I must be the only one who remembers that. Exactly 16 years later is when I always wake up. Wednesday, 26th of April, 7:34 PM. My ""sweet sixteen.""

I always anticipate how Todd fucks around on top of the table. The first time, I thought he was just an idiot. But I've seen him for what he really is now, time after time. He needs the attention.

I remember every conversation I had with Riley that night. In my first few lives, I thought she was my best friend. She isn't.

I remember all their faces. I know all their stories. My story has ended about 200 times now. Around 50 of those were at the hand of a common mugger, and I refuse to lose my story again. I could avoid him if I wanted, but he has a debt I need to collect on.

I've been a painter, an architect, a programmer, a criminal—and that only accounts for three lives, funny enough. But I've never been violent. I've refused to. I've felt what it's like to die.

I won't kill him—but I'll win. I'll get myself a nice knife. No rush. I have a few years to wait.

-

The first time, I was coming back from a party. Just drunk enough to not grasp the situation. I knew it was irresponsible to begin with, drinking underaged. Now I know that in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't particularly make a difference. I came back from the party this time, too. But I'm still very much sober.

""Excuse me, miss, I'm very hungry. Could you spare some change? Maybe a few dollars?""

*Liar.* His speech was slurred and clumsy.

""I'm afraid I can't. I'm sorry.""

He insults me next, right? This part gets a little fuzzy. Greedy? He mumbles, at best.

""Selfish bitch.""

Mm. Right. So plain.

*Two steps. Four? Four steps. A stumble.*
*He reaches in his tattered coat.*

A shitty revolver. If you could get guns at a Toys R Us, this is probably what it would look like. He aims left, right? Yeah.

*Too far left.*

He seems surprised that he didn't hit. Perhaps more surprising is my huge, visible smirk.

I've only ran at him a few times now. Eight? Nine, maybe. I need to be careful.

*Ah, right. He corrects. Second shot.*

A normal person would be dead by now. I'm still standing. Well, sprinting. Shit, it grazed me. I don't want any evidence of this fight.

*I pull out my knife, with a flick of my wrist. A folding stiletto, black with silver accents. It's easy now. I've had a lot of practice.*

It takes him a second to see its glint in the darkness. I see it in his eyes now. Unmistakable.

*Fear.*

It was close. He doesn't get off a third shot. I slice open his hand, the one that was previously holding the revolver. For once in my cursed existence, I get to see something new.

*He screams.*

He starts backing away, his gun on the ground. Walking towards him, I start to hear sirens. They're distant, for now.

""Sorry, sir, it's just that...""

I've earned this. I get to toy with him. He stumbles backwards and falls on the ground, ass first. He seems so powerless. I stand over him with the blade still in my hand.

""I've been having a really good run.""

I walk past him. He won't try to stop me. He's a coward. He won't remember my face. I saw the bottles.

I close the knife and put it back in the pocket of my jeans. The sirens are getting louder. It should be fine, though.

This time you remembered to bring a knife to this gun fight.",TrustMeImMagic,"Noises of car tires were hissing on by when i left the local fair. The rain had just stopped. It was a foggy day, and so was my mind. It felt like an hangover on an early Sunday morning. Struggling to stay in the moment, life was forced in moments like these. What a drag, i could not skip it. At least there was a good reason to be here. 

Again, i suppose.

One last sip of coffee and i threw the cup in a rusted bin near me. This place looked like nothing had progressed since the seventies, or so. Gray, borderline architecture and filthy window panes. Some melancholic small-town closely to a highway exit, surrounded by a depressing pine forest. The only colour in view was a gas station, which was obviously in decay. 
'Let’s get this over with.'

A man approached  from the corner of the old gas station when i was crossing the road. He looked at me, brushing and scratching his face ferociously while looking around angstly. I changed my course so we wouldn’t meet. Poor soul, his deed was no surprise anymore. Nothing subtle.  He came toward me and i made a hushing gesture, causing him to stop dead in his tracks. His mouth fell open and he looked around feverishly and began to run as i dragged the heavy door shut behind me. He stood in front of the store for a few seconds, then limped away, like he was hurt. 

Something almost hit me in my face, things were fleeing away from the silhouettes of the piled-up furniture. it was a partly broken cuckoo clock. The mechanical gears whined and the paint-chipped bird retreated into the darkness. My heart was in my throat for a moment. 
Music struck me when i calmed down, taking in the environment. It sounded like an old record player, faintly emitting the measly sound of strange music. Melody's of reverbing violins, flutes, and a harpsichord. The long hallway was shaped on a improvised manner by old clocks, furniture and statues. leading to a dimly lit desk. A little shrine in the darkness where an old woman sat reading. 

‘’Really? Cheap battery candle lights?’’

You could hear time by the obnoxious ticking of the old clockworks around me.

 The woman’s eyes almost skewered her reading glasses and then here eyelids came back, like she was shocked to see me, quickly taking control of herself. A sharp gaze buried in an old body.
‘’ Hello, can i help you?’’

“Ah come on... you can do better than that!’’. My voice sounded hoarse.
“Want something to drink?’’ she mumbled monotonously.
I bursted out with laughter, ridiculing her. Disturbing the peace.
“Classic move, i’m not falling for that anymore. It seem like you can’t keep up with modern times.’’ Walking near to her desk, driven by confidence.
“What?!’’ Her voice suddenly shrieked, echoing in the muffled building. 

A deep breath, and i sighed calmly. Time went fast but everything went so slow. I reached for my pocket and took out the knife. 

She traced my movements intensely. Her eyes scanning me. Anticipating for what could happen next. I held the knife up in front of me, while keeping eye contact. 

One firm thrust and the blade went into my chest. She gasped. We where both in awe. Eucalypta jumped over her desk. She howled as her aged claws grasped me. I was still holding the knife which had disappeared in my ribcage. Confusing we stood there. Dazed by unbelief. My right arm reached swiftly to my other pocket and i stabbed her, stumbling backwards into the shelves.
 The knife came out of my chest, fell out of my hands, and shattered on the floor. Little springs flew under the dusty wardrobes as the handle cracked in two pieces. She stared down to the  engraved blade sticking out of her body. Blood quietly dripped on the retractable toy knife on the floor. She looked at me, sobbing. Her face revealed a friendly smile. 
“Thank you’’ . Eucalypta collapsed on the floor. 

Killed by a dollar worth knife. The old pinball machines began to ring in harmony with the clocks. An old arcade machine played a loud triumph-like jingle when a brief womans laughter faded away in the atmosphere. Day and night were switching fast. The sun and moon chased each other through the sky as i walked out the store. The sign on the door swung gently. I turned it around. ‘Closed.’

""Don't bother."" I hang up. The phone immediately rings. I grab the knife off the nightstand, slip into my coat and slip out into the night.

The block is teeming with hookers. I find one and pay her service fee. We have three hours. We walk to the restaurant. 

It's not too bad - 3 star rating. Of course, people stare. We eat in silence. She tells me a little a bit about her childhood. Ran away at 16. Wanted to be an actress, became a waiter. Then started acting - little roles in F- minus movies and big roles in porn flicks. Took her talents into the streets, went into business for herself. Got jumped. Got a pimp. Had a child. Had an abortion. 

She doesn't talk about her future. I don't think she even believes she has one. Sad part is, she's probably right. 

We finish eating, I pay the bill. We have an hour left. We stand up to go, and she doubles over, clutching her stomach. Cramps. Something bad she ate. The ambulance is called. 

I leave and head home. I'm alone; but the street lamps are still on.

Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop.

Spoke too soon, now I'm in darkness. That means he's coming. 

I walk faster, the knife jiggles in my pocket, a homeless man sings a blues song in an alley.

And I can smell him a split-second before I feel the barrel of the gun pressing into my side.

""Just take the money out slowly,"" he whispers. Cheap liquor and cigarette smoke.

I do. Out my left pocket.

Hello, my name is Henry Garrick. It's been three years since the government implicated the ""Perfect Soldier Program"" across the country. The medical movement calling for the anatomical enhancement and augmentation of children at birth. A small micro chip inserted into infants heads allowing parents to pick and choose attributes they'd like their children to have. Of course attribute levels can grow based on pivotal life events, but for the most part, stat leveling is the fastest way to improve. When the child turns 18, level choices become his own. When he becomes 24, he becomes property of the government.
I'm recording this log because three days ago, my wife, Nora, just gave birth to our first born son, Jason. Now beyond the base stats set at the beginning, parents are also given 20 ""free points"" to use on any other attributes. Some new parents hold onto those points for a rainy day in the kids life. Others just spread them out among the existing stats and hope for the best. But as my wife is a physicist and I'm a doctor, we talked this over in depth months before the birth. We put every single one of those points into the ""speed"" stat. Updates to come. 

Jay's Age: 3 Years
This is for the log, Jason's age is three years and seven days. 
Last week was Jay's third birthday. The little tike really enjoyed himself. His current stats spread as follows: Strength - 11, Intelligence - 12, Dexterity - 11, Wisdom - 11, Speed - 36.
Other than the fact that he burns slightly more calories a day than other toddlers, nothing out of the ordinary. At current speed level, he can keep up with kids twice his age, but that was to be expected. Updates to come.

Jay's Age: 9 Years and 3 months.
Log. It's absolutely insane. Strength - 23, Intelligence - 40, Dexterity - 24, Wisdom - 31, Speed - 117. At nine years old, Jay can race pace with most high school senior track stars. The results so far prove Nora's and my hypothesis: the speed stat causes speed in all aspects of life. Not just movement, but metabolism and cognizance as well. We are slowly seeing a trend of natural growth in stats we haven't even touched. Updates to come.

Jay's Age: 15 Years
Logging data. Strength - 39, Intelligence - 50, Dexterity - 33, Wisdom - 48, Speed - 255. Today's Jay's fifteenth birthday. Troubling news today. Or maybe not... I'm not sure. Jay complained to Nora and I about some sort of temporal disturbance. He said as he was blowing out his candles today, everything stopped moving for a second. Nora was able to calm him down. Explained to him that the world didn't stop. He was just taking information in faster than he was used to. Probably a side effect of breaking the level 250 mark. We've been in uncharted territory since Jay started running faster than my Toyota. We have to stay the course. Everything's gonna be fine. 

Jay's Age: 18 Years
Log this. Jay's an adult now. He says he hasn't had one of those cognizance overdrives in a long time, but I'm not so sure. Either he's learned to keep them under control and his brain and body are now in sync, or he's lying so that we won't worry. This'll be the last time I can report his stats spread. This is the year Jay's attributes become his responsibility. Strength - 138, Intelligence - 120, Dexterity - 84, Wisdom - 131, Speed - 301. This year we saw a massive increase in strength. At first we thought it was a glitch, but after a few days, Nora figured it out. Strength is just a measure of force. Force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration. Jay's gained so much control over the acceleration of his own body, that he could probably push a big rig across the city in five minutes flat, given nobody was in the way. To be honest, though, I don't even care about that stuff anymore. From here on out, he can level any stats he wants. I just hope my boy's okay.

Age: 23 years and 10 months.
This is for my dad's log. My name is Jay Garrick and I am the fastest man alive. When I was born, my parents made a pact to raise me as a speedster. Two years ago, my dad passed away. My mom followed him two weeks ago. I've been keeping with their wish to only spend my levels on speed. My stats are as follows. Strength - 219, Intelligence - 343, Dexterity - 195, Wisdom - 313, Speed - 555. 
I live my life one excruciating nanosecond at a time. It was torture at first, but I quickly learned patience and control. I can be anywhere I want on Earth before you could even say my name. In two months, the government will come to draft me into the armed forces, to fight their wars, to be their perfect soldier. 
They better not blink, because they're gonna have to catch me first.

Edit:
Thanks for the positive feedback. Yes the the story's got pretty clear references to the flash. He's one of my favorite superheroes and I thought it'd be cool to if I told a story where he essentially still has powers, but also has parents.

Using Jay instead of Barry was my attempt at being subtle (I know, not very) but I still used Barry's parents names, Henry and Nora. It was fun to write. Thanks again all. ",ApolloTheSunArcher
[WP] Life begins with a character creation screen. You decide to put all of your skill points into one stat to see what happens.,Universalerror,"""He's breathing"" a strange voice cooed, ""look honey it's out little boy."" The room was dark, the man's face hidden in its embrass. His hand reaches for a screen above him, pulling it down to his chest. A green light flashes over the babes face. ""Let's see what you'll be like when you're older.""

""Hello!"" Called the baby, his voice oddly deep. The room was bright white, in contrast to where he was but moments ago. Out of the void stumbled a penguin wearing a bow tie. He slapped his wings against is side as he walked making a distasteful sound. ""No need to shout Luthor."" It chirped. ""You can speak"" Luthor pulled his knee up defensively. ""You're a fucking baby, I should be asking how can you talk"" howled the penguin his wings out straight.

""I am Pejus, I'm here to take your order for life."" A mini penguin arose from Pejus's mouth as he spoke. In its wing it had a small device, similar to an iPod nano. It pressed the play button. From the void dropped an old t.v, like from Back to the Future or something. ""Take a seat"" the penguin in Pejus's mouth shouted.

Luthor lowered himself to the floor, the little penguin glided over to the television. He pecked at it violently until it turned on. A strange woman appeared on the T.V, mostly skin and bone. She wore a tootoo and make up that just seemed to make her face more hollow. ""Welcome to the beginning of your...."" her neck twitched and the t.v flickered with static. ""32nd trial life."" She finished as the t.v cleared up. ""It is with the great pleasure from all of us in the Federal Universe Creation Keepers to announce you've received a human body. We apologize for your trial as a fruit fly. But when you last were a tiger, you bit a Keeper who came to check on you."" Luthor giggled, he remembered it as clear as day. ""I was angry with F.U.C.K at the time"" the women in the television continued. ""As a Human you have 8 statistics to choose from. Unlike your other creature's which had set stats. You can choose your own."" The T.v went to static and reappeared with 8 bars with words below then. ""Intelligence, Strength, Luck, Perception, endurance, Patience and of course Memes."" Luthor sat there with his head cocked. ""Memes?"" 

""When you turn 14 Memes will become more important to society than art. We had artisticness as a stat, but it'll be redundant for your generation."" Luthor sat there his hand pulling the bars up. He quickly put all them down save the Meme bar. ""Beam me in Scotty."" Pejus began to shake, *this must be what a Penguin Orgasm looks like.* ""It's called a Pengasm"" Pejus moaned, obviously reading Luthors mind. 

""All hail the Meme Lord."" Luthor stood on his great pyramid over looking his faithful neckbeards. All worshipped him. His neckbeard was the most patchy in the land, his glasses were of the lowest quality. The cheetoh dust covered his cloak like divine power. No man dared to question his Mom fucking ability. He placed his hand to his holster ripping free his Keyboard. He thrusted it into the air like a sword. ""I have the power!""

[WP] Life begins with a character creation screen. You decide to put all of your skill points into one stat to see what happens.,Universalerror,"Life is normal for us, you know? Like, we do what we normally do, which is begin our lives by choosing which skills we want to focus on, right off the bat. We choose them as young-adult selves, then go back and live through that life, starting from babyhood. I mean, it's pretty normal for us; there's a stage between our lives (we all believe in past lives as part of our religion), where our future selves can choose what aspects we want for life. Or something. We don't really understand the specifics or the mystics of it; but then, why would we need to, when things have always been this way?

Okay, I'm getting a bit ahead of myself here. Suffice it to say, is this: when I found out you guys start from babyhood—babyhood, just like that, all on its own!—and then go up to adulthood, with absolutely no stages in between, I was like, ""Whaaaat?"" 

Yeah. But still, you asked me for what I did with my own pre-life transition phase, or whatever they're called. The theologists have been working on it, but most of us aren't too aware of what the theologists are up to.

Okay, okay—I can see you frowning at me. I'll get to the point. In retrospect, I should probably have put my stats into Charisma, it would have served me better—

Fine, I'll get to the point. I chose ""Loquaciousness."" Loquaciousness, of all things. Yes, and I chose it because I didn't know what it meant, at the time. I still don't, not a hundred percent (although, after running myself off at the mouth for twenty-plus years, you would think I have an idea, wouldn't you?). Well, anyway, turns out that was a pretty rare occurrence, though of course I didn't know that at the time. Most people just get to choose from normal stuff: Speed, Attack, Dexterity, Charisma. Mana or Magic, for a few lucky folk, and then Stamina for others. Even others with rarer skills—well, it was stuff which could be useful in battle, like Musicality or whatever—good for bards. Wait, do bards play instruments? Well, anyway.

But I ended up with Loquaciousness, because a slightly younger version of myself (I was 22 then, in that era before I was born) chose Loquaciousness, because he thought it would be a laugh, choosing something that he didn't know what it meant. I know, I know, I should probably regret that...but I really don't. I mean, it's pretty difficult to get me to shut up—making myself stop talking has no doubt been one of my hardest challenges—but it's come in handy plenty of times. I usually find others similar to me (whether they OP'd their own Charisma stat or now), so I have a good network of friends who are a little like me, at least in that they like to talk a lot.

Okay, so I guess I've been running you off at the ear now. I see you shaking your head at me. Wait, what's that you're saying? What was it like, in the character creation phase?

Oh, that wasn't the question I was expecting. Actually, I wanted to banter with you more about your own youth and childhood—it's still so weird, to come here talking to all these multiversal types, even though we found out about those breaches in the universe four years ago now—but I guess we can get to that later. Well, okay.

So, what happened was, I was 22—I'm 28 now—but, obviously, I didn't really know that yet. I had a personality—a sentience, a personhood—but I didn't have an identity yet, per se. I was just...the self. So me, the Self, was presented with a character creation screen, and I knew the rules, without knowing that everyone knew the rules, that they were ingrained into the system, or that everyone else knew them. I simply knew the rules, as a point of fact. And the rules were that I could distribute my 50 stats into any categories I wanted.

So I did, stuffing it all into Loquaciousness. Again, for shits and giggles. Then, I had a flash forward of the future—I saw myself growing up, only it's not really growing up, you know? It's like...a branching-forward, an interlacing of the times you might live, and then again might not. Like, the way things might be, with this stat you've picked. And then I became a baby, which I don't remember, because I was a baby. Except...have you heard about the people in Universe WZX12? Apparently they remember when they were babies, and then half of them are, like, geniuses when they grow up. Weird!

I got lucky, though; I was a bit lacking in the intelligence department, at least initially (I read up to cover that), and speed too, but I worked on that too. For everything else, I was pretty much average. But I worked on those too, and now—at the tender age of 28—I can say I'm pretty happy with the way things have turned out. 

So, I guess that's enough of my story. You can tell me about yours! What do you say? We can talk about what life is like in Universe XRMS93. I've got to say, I've always wanted to visit. Tell me all about it!",rockwell78

Bob celebrated to himself, his elation diluted only by his crippling hangover. You see, Bob isn't the typical person you'd expect to get dragged into such an awful moral complex. Why? Bob is an aspiring serial killer. In fact, he has spent the last 2 years devising how he would murder someone. The perfect murder. So, for Bob, this was like winning the goddamn lottery. 

Or was it? Trouble was, Bob consumed so much Whiskey the previous night that everything beyond the mysterious encounter with that impeccable female was a total blur. ""In fact, did that even happen?"" muttered Bob, with a sadistic tone of disappointment in his raspy voice as he stared bleary eyed into his mirror.

Bob's mood decreased even further. Even if the exchange DID in fact happen, even if he DID murder 20 innocent victims by simply sending text messages, it wouldn't be enough. 

Sure, Bob would find it cool to be the villain in his very own, real life version of ""13 Sins"", but it still wasn't enough. Because Bob didn't physically commit those heinous crimes himself. He didn't witness the screams, the pleads of mercy, the blood, the awful atrocities. Cold blooded murder. 

Despite the deflation in his mood, human curiosity got the better of Bob. ""What did I write in the texts? Did I get replies confirming the kills? Even better, who was that woman and can she get me a job at this incredible company?"" The questions spiralled uncontrollably through Bob's sinister mind. With that, he got his iPhone out of his pocket and went straight to his messages.

[WP] Create a character the readers will hate,AdmiralRiffRaff,"Kia strode confidentiality down the hall, a smile on her lips. Today has been very successful. New trade routes had been established and her company was now working with Jaren Perian’s, an alliance that would greatly benefit both of them. Today has been very successful.

Walking outside into the right sunlight, Kia’s guards rushed to her side, relieved to see her well. It was customary to come alone and unarmed into the Lerian, as a sign of peace and good intent.

“I trust the meeting was a success?” Gerald, her head of security, asked.

“Oh you have no idea!” she exclaimed excitedly. “A new trade route and we are working with Jaren.”

“Ah,” Gerald smiled at Jaren's name. “So a fabulous day.”

“Indeed,” Kia sighed. “And, to share this wonder with others, I'm feeling rather generous. To the church!” Kia and her men loaded into three carriages and sped away, weaving down streets, stopping for passerby, and eventually arriving at the glistening white church. Kia herself was not exactly a devout worshiper, but the church had its merits: the soup kitchen, the festival, and the orphanage program-- to name a few.

When the carriages pulled to a stop, Kia jumped out. She motioned for her guards to wait. The church was safe. Gerald, however, hopes down beside her. Kia didn't object, instead smiling broadly. Gerald might have been a priest had he not been so involved in swordplay.

The duo walked up the steps and entered the church, greeted by many happy smiles and warm welcomes. Winding their way through the crowd of nuns and Priests, Kia and Gerald eventually arrived at the donations office. They chatted with father Lial a bit before making they deposits of generosity and began working their way back through the crowd. Halfway through a mighty gasp rose up near the entrance, followed by screams. Shouts, groans, and the clash of steel was heard coming from the direction of the courtyard. Kia and Gerald exchanged nervous glances before pushing quickly through the remaining people.

Kia burst from the crowd and gasped. She watched as a man, armed with a spear, slammed the butt of his weapon into one of her guards faces, stabbed another, before spinning around and finding the first. A quick survey and Kia realized all her guards save Gerald were dead.

The man pulled his weapon free and looked up at Kia, his eyes blank behind his mess of long dark hair. His left arm and legs were deformed and strange, a tad to big for him, tinted green, and covered in bulging veins. He wore only a loose short sleeved shirt and dark shorts.

“Ver-dun,” Kia said loudly. She knew him by his reputation and it was one highly regarded by those most accustomed to the dark. Gerald unsheathed his sword and looked at Kia. She nodded. They both had their duties.

Gerald ran forward, yelling, as Kia dashed away. Gerald was the best swordsman she knew, but if he failed… no, he wouldn't. Then why was she running?

She turned randomly, weaving and ducking to avoid the many obstacles in her path. The city was crowded, but that played more for her than against her.

After what felt like eternity, Kia paused in a crowded alleyway, catching her breath. She would start heading back to the safehouse. She had surely lost him by now.

The sensation was like no other she had ever felt, when Kia's emotions slipped away. She stood swaying were she stood, as if in a trance. She was empty, pointless. Looking down she saw the spear head sticking out of her chest. In those final moments, she suddenly felt again, and then nothing once more.


Ver-dun dropped the bag o to the floor in front of Yeji. The short man eyed it with disdain before motioning for one of his two thugs to inspect it. The thug leaned down and opened the bag before quickly closing it, his face white.

“He's dead alright,” the thug gagged.

“It was a she,” Yeji said coldly, glaring at Ver-dun.

“Oh, well then she's dead,” the thug amended.

“What?” Yeji hissed. “Which is it?” He turned to hair other thug. The man reluctantly stopped to inspect the bags contents. After a few moments, he turned and threw up.

“Oh, you two are no help,” Yeji sighed. He himself opened the bag.

Yeji closed the bag and looked at Ver-dun. He said nothing but his face did all the talking. Shaking his head disgusted, he tossed Ver-dun some coins. As Ver-dun turned to leave, Yeji called out.

“So, how does it feel to kill truly helpless people? Any better than when they fight back?”

Ver-dun turned and regarded Yeji. Then he brought his spear down on the head of one of the thugs, cracking his skull, followed quickly by stabbing the other in the throat. Yeji screamed and turned to run, receiving a spear to the knee.

Ver-dun turned over the tiny man, a firm grip on his shoulder. He ripped out his spear and stabbed it into the other one, causing Yeji to scream in pain. Ver-dun stood up, placing his bare foot on Yeji’s head, pressing down.

Ver-dun decide, as he dropped the bag of coins on the floor next to Yeji's body, that they both felt the same. Truth be told, everything felt the same to Ver-dun. Or more accurately, everything didn't feel to Ver-dun.

“Quesor, if you’re out here I swear to God I’ll personally deliver you to Area 51 for experimentation. I was supposed to get married today!”

The harder you make her laugh, the longer and clearer the visions become.",CryptidGrimnoir,"“What’s that new Adam Sandler movie thats out? How ‘bout we go see that?” I asked flicking on the police siren as we sped through yet another red light. I could sense Sarah rolling her eyes in the passenger seat even as the car lurched from side to side while I haphazardly navigated through oncoming traffic.

“Adam Sandler. Are you serious? Adam Sandler hasn’t been funny in years.” she said attempting to reach for an algebra text book that was sliding around the passenger side footwell with every swerve of our erratic drive. 
	

“Ok then. What if we listen to one of his older tapes? God, you remember those things used to have us rolling around the floor in tears.” I ventured. 

“Yeah, sounds great.” she said in a flat tone “let’s go dig through mom’s house for a 30 year old cassette tape then get in a time machine to find something to actually play it in”. I slammed hard on the breaks and stared at her.

“Listen, I don’t care why or how you do it, but I need you to laugh.” Sarah simply glared at me silently for a moment and crossed her arms. “Someone’s life depends on it” I said.

“I don’t do that anymore.” she said, now pointedly avoiding looking me in the eye. “I don’t want to use it anymore. Please don't make me”

For a moment, all thoughts of the case, the missing child whose life was on the line, the existence of Sarah’s gift all vanished and I was simply left with the incredibly sad feeling that my baby sister no longer wanted to laugh, maybe no longer wanted to feel joy ever again. I took a good hard look at the young woman sitting next to me. Gone was the frizzy haired giggling little girl, dressed in a hodgepodge of cartoon character print clothing and rainbow shoelaces often given in to belting out he worst of whatever pop song of the week was out with such enthusiasm I had no choice but to join her and in her place was this sullen teenager with dyed jet black hair, a nose piercing and too much eyeliner for a girl her age. 

We had always been close, at least I had thought we were. Ever since we were young, even before Sarah started getting her visions and we made the joint decision to keep the secret between us, to not even tell mom and dad. True, there was a huge age gap, I was enrolled in the academy by the time she was giving pull ups a test run. I always tried to make time for her though, trips to the movies, the tapes, I really enjoyed being a big brother. But she grew up. I had more responsibilities. Our weekly trips to the movies turned into monthly ones. The cassette player broke and I never got around to replacing it. After a while I only ever saw her when I had a particularly hard case, one I knew she could help with, one I couldn’t possible find the answer to myself but could solve if I could only make her laugh. 

“Its not all good things I see, you know” she said, waking me from my reverie. “Sometimes I see bad things. I see bad things more and more now” tears were welling up in her eyes. “Sometimes I see you. I see bad things that might happen to you”. She was shaking for a bit. 

“I know.. but I think we should try.” I said trying not to think of what those ‘bad things’ might be. “That was what we decided, wasn’t it?” 

For a long time we just sat in silence, Sarah wiping tears and me pushing away dark thoughts. Then she turned to me and began singing in a low, sad voice“ Turkey for me, Turkey for you, Let’s eat the turkey, In my big brown shoe”. I couldn’t help but crack a smile at the ridiculousness of the situation. Me and my kid sister blocking a lane of traffic in a police car while she sung a tearful version of the Thanksgiving Song. I couldn’t help but join in. Tearing up myself I began then next line.

“Love to eat the turkey, At the table, I once saw a movie, With Betty Grable”. I sung in my best mock Sandler voice. We burst out laughing at the same time, more than we had in years. Then Sarah’s eyes filmed over, like they always did, flitting back and forth faster and faster as she observed something unseen to anyone but her.

Jenny was crying tied in the chair next to him as he stared at the monitors displaying the status of his mad plan.

“He’ll stop you. That what we have heroes are for.” I said weakly even though I didn’t know how. Jenny turned to meet my eyes and I could see she was as unsure and afraid as me.

“You think so side kick?” He said turning to me. His calm demeanor was unnerving. “Because I don’t think he has it in him to do it.” He said walking up to me. He crouched low looked over my broken body. He opened his mouth to speak but the sounds of crashing coming from the next door caught his attention. “I guess we’ll find out.” He said returning next to Jenny. 

“You won’t get away with this” She said in a shaky voice. As Adams side kick I knew full well his super speed and strength, but it was Jenny that knew his heart. He’d stop the world from spinning before he’d let her down.

“It was never about getting away with it.” Taker said still calm as he suited up. His power to nullify other powers within a mile radius wasn’t the most ridiculous power, but his merciless crimes were horrifying. “This has and always will be about ending things.” He continued has he put on his matte black face mask with two thin slits for the eyes, the only characteristic. He pulled his hero killing revolver as the door flung open.

“TAKER!!” Adam yelled as he walked into the room. Even as battered as he looked from making his way through Taker’s base. His anger wavered as he looked from me to jenny, worry and guilt breaking through. When his eyes broke away from Jenny to Taker, his anger returned doubled. “I’m going to stop you.” He growled as he stalked toward Taker. He froze as Taker’s gun rose to Jenny’s head.

“There is no stopping this now. You should have picked up a gun on the way in.” Taker said.

“I’m not like you. I’m a hero. I’ll stop you with my own strength.” Adam responded determined and brave.

He rages. “That’s the problem. Everyone wants to appear to be ther hero, but nobody wants to do the dirty things that will allow us to survive. Fine, perish in you futile quest to look untarnished. What good is being heroic, if everyone is dead for it?”

Bang!

He shot Jenny.  I could hear Adam yelling, but I couldn’t make out what he was saying. He charged Taker in a blind rage.

Bang! Bang!

Adams body slid across the floor leaving a trail of blood. My vision blurred with tears and bile rose in my throat. I heard metal clatter next to me and looked to see Taker’s landing a foot from me. I grabbed it and pointed it towards him.

Bang!

“Take a breath, wipe your eyes, and try to calm down. You only have two more shots and you won’t hit me as shaken as you are.” He said as he took of his mask and turned to the screen. His face was as calm as it was a few minutes ago. 

“Why?” I asked weakly, my hand drooping.

“Because in world of superheroes, there aren’t any real heroes.” He said looking at the monitors. “All these fake heroes who didn’t have the courage to throw away their pride and valor to save others are just selfish imposters. “ He said walking over to Adam’s body. He knelt in front of him and ran his hands through Adam’s hair. “They aren’t worth the suits they dress up in.

The five percent of the population that aren’t super have more humanity than all the rest.” He said as he stood and walked over to me. “This is my gift to them.” He said gesturing to the screen. “A hero killing virus made from my own blood to target everyone with powers. I hope a real hero will rise from the ashes of our self-centered super powered society. “ He finished as he grabbed my hand with the gun in it and guided it to his head. 

Looking into his eyes I knew he was done. I knew if I didn’t shoot him He would die from his own virus just like I would.

Bang!

His body fell backwards to the floor. I hope he was right about a real hero rising. The world would need it.

The sun had not yet risen, rays of lights just barely passing the horizon. The sleepy town of Grenville was just waking up, storeowners just beginning to raise the metal shutters of their shops. A few cars whizzed by in the soft light of dawn, a clear contrast to the many people walking along the sidewalk. 

One of those people was a boy, panting as he ran towards a row of houses next to the shops, an iced lolly in hand. Out of nowhere, a man stepped into his path, the boy slamming into the man with such force, both of them tumbled onto the pavement. 

The man recovered and stood up. The boy wore a frightened look on his face, his ice lolly now staining the man's shirt.

""You're nothing but a useless piece of filth, you dammned idiot! This tastes like shit!"" The 15-year old boy cowered in fear and trembling as his father threw the plate of food towards the wall, smashing it and spilling rice and vegetables everywhere. 

The stinging slap he received next was just like the others, a resounding pain in his head, the numbness in his jaw and the tears fighting to escape his eyes.

His father tottered about, the stench of alcohol heavy on his breath. Piles of papers and random garbage littered the small, one-room apartment unit the family of two called home. The boy stared at his drunken father with an expression of rage and bitterness, then retreated to the small hammock he had constructed, amidst the small mountains of beer bottles and betting tickets.

That evening, his father left with yet another handful of cash from his savings, heading for the gambling den nearby. The boy had been waiting for this very moment. Springing out of his hammock, he packed up what meagre possessions he had, the red mark from the slap earlier still visible on his face. Tossing a random assortment of clothes into his haversack, he undid the latch on the small metal box which kept all the money they had in this world.

He had planned for this very moment since the day his mother had left their home for good. The trek to the orphanage in Grenville would be long, but it would be worthwhile, he thought. 

Taking one last look at the place he found to be both a prison and a home for fifteen odd years, he found only anger and rage within himself. The apartment was now looted clean for anything he found to be valuable, and he was ready to begin a new life.

The boy never saw his father again. Nor did he ever want to. That night, he learned the meaning of pain.

""Five years jail time, fined five thousand dollars."" The boy had became a man. That man was now one of the youngest judges serving in the Grenville County Court, building a reputation for harshness and zero tolerance for any form of crime whatsoever. The thief sat trembling in the defendant's box as his sentence was read out, his lawyer looking dejected and defeated.

""Next."" The judge looked almost bored as he motioned for the thief to be taken away. He had no time for criminals such as these, they all deserved to be locked up for good.

25th February, 2017

Thunder rolled across the skies as the rain poured over the streets of Grenville. A lone Prius sped across the main road, heading for home. Inside, the judge gripped the steering wheel, humming a tune. The end of yet another day of work, heavy fines and yet more jail time. Outside, lightning flashed across the skies, bringing with it the loud thunder and even more heavy rain, as if the storm outside was mirroring the storm within the Prius.

As he neared the turning into his neighborhood, the engine spluttered. His car slowing to a stop, the furious judge pounded hard on the dashboard, spitting out curses. A warning light flashed as the judge tried his cellphone. No reception.

Cursing his luck, he decided to brave the elements and head out on foot to call the tow service from home. Which was when a truck pulled up alongside his stalled car.

""Engine problem?"" The workman hollered from his truck over the rain. The judge nodded, to which the workman opened the passenger door of his truck.

""Hop in, your Honour.""

The truck was cramped, but at least it was better than running through the rain. It took a few minutes for the judge to realise that he had seen the workman before.

""Do I know-""

""Know me? Of course, your Honour. Five years in juvie, you were the one who did that to me,"" the workman smiled sheepishly when answering.

The judge was silent for a while. Then: ""Why did you help me?""

""Help you?"" The workman chuckled. ""It doesn't matter who you are, if I see a guy stranded in a car somewhere out in the rain, I'll help as best I can. No hard feelings, eh? Oh, and this is your stop, I believe.""

As the judge entered his house, he was so struck by what the workman had said, he nearly forgot to phone the towing service.

That night, he learned the meaning of grace.

26th February, 2017

The man stared hard at the boy, who was repeatedly apologizing for the accident, all the while trying hard not to meet the judge's eyes. 

""It's okay, son. Try to be careful next time."" 

And on that day, he learned to forgive.

"[WP]""Did it hurt ... when you fell from heaven ?"" you say aloud, the humans in the bar begin to snicker, your ancient adversary the now demoness turns and looks you straight in the eyes",Hero_Of_Shadows,"I must admit, I have had one too many ales, the strong ales, and she did look amazingly beautiful from behind.  I have always admired a well shapely ass.  Perfectly round as it melted into her thighs, her hips delicately sloping inwards to her slim waist, creating that tantalizing place where a man's hands fit most perfectly.  I could see the sensuous curve of her muscle along her spine and my mouth ran away with me.


""Did it hurt ... [hic] ... when you fell from heaven?""  I said aloud, slurring some of my words as I leaned on the bar top, trying my hardest to look suave.  I could hear the snickers of those around me, but I didn't care, this was an ass that needed some attention.  Then she turned towards me.  At that moment, I knew I had royally fucked up.


Her eyes blazed with a green that made the glimmer of emeralds look dull.  Her midnight black hair was flipped back with a blue velvet gloved hand as her blood red lips parted in a half sneer half grin.


""Excuse me?""  She asked, her voice like a thousand angels crying out in ecstasy.


""Uh..."" I somehow forgot how to speak as my drunken brain finally clicked as to where I had seen her from.  She was the powerful Demoness, ruler of the Scarred Lands, and my greatest and most ancient foe.  I just tried to pick her up in a bar.


""Aww,"" She purred, trailing a finger from below my ear lobe over my jaw line to my chin and shut my mouth for me.  ""He's speechless at my beauty.""


I mustered my courage, I couldn't let her win this.


""Anyone would be struck dumb in the face of this great beauty.  I was only momentarily stunned.""  I said, trying to sound cool once more.  I don't know if I succeeded or not, but all eyes were on us now.  I could feel them boring into me from all sides, it made me nervous and excited.


""That is good to know.""  She said with a smile.  ""Though, I wasn't expecting someone like you to be visiting a place like this.""


""I could say the same for you.  You should have droves of servants running back and forth at your beck and call, not in a dirty tavern like this.""  I said, motioning to the bar we were currently in.  The bartender gave me a warning glance.  But, my words somehow struck her.  She tilted her head ever so slightly and raised her hand, index finger lifted towards the bartender.


""Let me buy you a drink.""  She said.


""It would be ungentlemanly of me to accept, so I will buy you one.""  I grasped her hand and brought it to the counter top, holding it there, burning white hot fire into my palm.  With my other hand, I signaled to the bartender for two drinks.


I don't remember much what happened after that.  But when I woke the next morning in a huge bed with black velvet covers and silken sheets, I was a little shocked.  Sitting up, the sunlight that pierced through the covered window reminded me of how much I drank.  Groaning I rubbed my face hard.


""This will help.""  A sweet voice caressed my pain stricken mind as something was pressed against the back of my hand.


I peeled my hands away from my face and stared at a more mussed beauty from last night.  The Demoness had disheveled hair that made her look even more beautiful than last night and her pale pink skin seemed to redden around her cheeks and nose, a nose that I just noticed had adorable little freckles spattered over it.  I accepted the goblet of red liquid and gulped it down, the pain in my head slowly subsiding.


""I am sorry about last night if I had done anything untoward.""  I said rolling the goblet back and forth between my palms.


""Don't be, it was wonderful.""  She said as she slipped into the bed next to me.  ""I do hope we don't have to fight now.  I was rather looking forward to breakfast with you.""


""Fight?""  I blinked and looked at her.


""Yes, fight, Holy Knight of the Seven Spears.""  She laughed, a symphony of songbirds to my ears.  ""I knew who you were the moment those first words spilled from your lips.""


I felt my face redden.  How embarrassing for a holy knight to be in a bar, drinking as heavily as I had been.  I turned my face away, wanting to die.  Gentle hand pulled my face back and unbelievably soft lips pressed against mine.  My eyes shot open and I stared into those impossibly green eyes.


""Don't be embarrassed.  It was endearing.""  She smiled like the sun.  ""Truth be told, I have always admired you and am the most happiest right now with you by my side.  I ..."" She hesitated, face becoming even more red.  ""I have always loved you.""


""Oh.""  I stammered.  She laughed which somehow made my spirit burst alive.  I think I have fallen for this creature of supposed evil and damnation.  She may be the Great Demoness, a creature known for her cruelty, but she has the most cutest smile.  I could only grin in return and kissed her back.",ebilkitteh24
"[WP] You're the town's go-to shaman, and everyone comes to you for all sorts of problems. Nobody except you knows that you're just a regular guy, and everyone is healed through placebo effects or other lucky happenings. A man comes in one day and asks to grow back both of his hands that he lost.",Its_mee_kimchee,"It was Saturday. Ulfrick hated Saturdays almost as much as he hated the name his parents had given him. Every weekend the local hippies would come flooding in, asking their shaman for healing. Shaman. He hated that word. He was just a regular guy. A guy trying to make a living on this forgotten island off the coast of Maine.
	
He started off by helping some of the poorer locals tend to their wounds. He had learned about a local herb that helped stave off infection as a Boy Scout. Somehow that knowledge had not spread around to the folks that had moved here to work at the paper mill thirty years prior. This was after the mill closed, and before the yuppies arrived trying to find their own personal slice of wilderness. But not too much wilderness. They still wanted their organic granola and fresh squeezed juice. You can’t get that living in a shack in the countryside. This rusted seaside town would do.

Soon enough those folks started coming to him for a bit of the local mystical healing. It worked some of the time. He knew it should. That was the placebo effect. If it didn’t he’d blame it on something else. He had learned that skill over the years. He couldn’t just give the money back to every unsatisfied customer. He’d go broke. The planets weren’t aligned right. Maybe the “patient” accidentally had a bit of gluten? Had they not stuck to the rigorous natural diet he put them on? He could see the shame in their eyes. They wouldn’t complain to their friends. When asked if the shaman had helped their back pain, the idiots would enthusiastically praise him and then go to a doctor in the sprawling metropolis to the south.

He knew he didn’t help everyone. In fact, sometimes, he knew that he had helped make things worse. That weighed on him more than anything in the world. Guilt. Shame. Knowledge that he had failed those that had asked him for the impossible. Yet, other times, he would. He cured cancer. He salved untreatable illnesses. Brought patients back from the brink of death. Helped extend the lives, and happiness of those around him. What if there was something to it? He tried to be as systematic as he could. He eliminated the failing treatments, and kept the ones that seemed to succeed. What if, somehow, somewhere, he acquired a gift? Ulfrick was not quite ready to believe that. He was just a regular guy after all. A searching soul trying to make his way through this terrible world.

One day in early June, Ulfrick had a visitor. It was a Wednesday. A cold, breezy day that brought the ocean’s sting onto the tiny island they called home. Ulfrick rarely had weekday visitors besides his regular patients. Jack had lost his hands the week before. It was a freak lobstering accident. Some issue with the pot. Rarely ever happened to anyone. Anyone, except Jack that is. The doctors in the regional hospital couldn’t do much more than stich him up, disinfect the wound and send him on his way. Jack had a family to feed. With no hands, his future looked grim. Disability payments wouldn’t send his youngest daughter to college. She might have to take his place on the boat. 

Ulfrick sighed. There wasn’t much he could do. Even with the ersatz miracles he performed, he couldn’t grow a man’s hands back. In the end, his role was much less that of a healer, and much more that of a therapist. Perhaps he could help guide Jack through his feelings of loss and helplessness. At best, maybe Ulfrick could help Jack find a new calling. He would try his best. No charge. That meant there would be no complaint with his inevitable failure. 

Ulfrick’s best cases shot through his mind. What if? He pushed that thought to the back of his head, and issued Jack a simple prescription. Go to the nearest point near the site of the accident. Do so during a full moon. Think of his hands. Think of what they meant to him. What life would be like without them. Grieve. Come to terms with his future. After that, ingest the bitter foam of a rogue wave hitting the shore after midnight. The last part was made up on the spot, but the important thing was to help Jack to grieve. After Jack realized Ulfrick was a fraud, their lives would go their separate ways.

Two months later Ulfrick got a knock on his door. It was a Saturday. He hated Saturdays. It was probably some strung out hippie looking for a cure for herpes with enlightenment on the side. He saw Jack. There were large bulges on what were once his wrists. Something had happened. Jack asked to continue his treatments. Ulfrick was in a state of utter shock. Had this actually worked? Was he really capable of something more than was physically possible? Was he really a shaman, and not the rusted husk of a man washed upon the shore of this blasted island? Ulfrick accented to Jack's request. He had opened the door, boldly stepping into a new reality.

The client says that my target will be in that particular area. I barely know this individual, apparently he's supposed to be some top P.I.

I immedaitely accept the job, I love it when these high rollers are having messy fits. When they finally collide, their dollars come up to me.

I stop my car to the parking lot. A starbucks, nice and easy. Apparently across this starbucks was a grocery store. Client gave me a full schedule said that the target was a regular in that vincinty. , there's just something magical about this and a little too easy. I walk up to the counter and order myself a small coffee. Getting my camera out from the car, walking back inside of the coffee shop. Some people looked a bit confused and wondered what the hell I was doing. I didn't pay no mind. 

I snapped some more pictures of the guy simply walking from the grocery store, it wasn't that hard getting his image. But, something was off about him I couldn't make sense. Immediately after another picture, he started to pull something out from his basket. It was a white sign that said ""Watch the birdi.."" After I was finished reading, I realized what the hell was going on. It was a trap! ""DAMN I-"" And immediately the cold hard barrel of a pistol was pointed to my head. 

A tone of deepness followed the owner of the pistol and an accent that reminded me of a stereotypical German villian. If God was a writer, he had some probably off beating issues with Germans. ""Nicht another step, you schewin"", he raspy breath slowly. ""Who are you ja?"" I grunts as I drop the camera. ""I-I'm just a simple photographer man!"" I proceeded to play the role of the shaken civilian for the public. ""HELP! HE'S GOT A GUN! SOMEONE CALLED 911!"" The german curses as he shot me directly to the arm on accident due to the people panicing as he runs off. Or at least I believe it was, I scream in pain as I winced falling to the ground. Shaking through the pain of the bullet hitting my arm. 

The german won this round, but I managed to survive at the end of the day. I was immediately fired from the job, luckily didn't get my license taking away.

Two years of research, three years of travelling, 3 million dollars, and a 500ft cliff face free climb. Now to be standing around the corner from it. The staff of Merlin. THE Merlin, Advisor and high wizard in the court of King Arthur, the once and forever King of Camelot.
All I have to do is subdue the staff's keeper, Merlin's daughter; Melissandra Ambrosius.
After thousands of years of standing guard, she's bound to be easy pickings. She's just standing at that desk... and the staff is just leaning on the wall. One swift clunk to the head with this rock I found outside should do the tric-
WHOA!
Ooof... 
""Aah fuck, that hurt. What gives?""

""Mortal, you thought you could steal from me? If you weren't so crazy, I'd think you were insane.""
It was some lady's voice. My vision was all blurry, but Melissandra was clearly looking. In her blue hood and robe, she was now turned away from the desk and was controlling a suit of armor with a glowing hand. As her fingers contorted in the air, the suit clutched me in a big bear hug and I was suddenly out of breath. 

""Okay! Aaahaah. Okay. Uncle. You got me.""
The suit plopped me on my ass hard. When I looked up, I got a good view of her, but to be honest, she didn't look how I thought she would.

""INTRUDER!""

""Huh? Oh! What? I mean, yes, ma'am- Melissandra- Miss- Mel-""

""You're staring. Stop.""

""Oh yep, shit, sorry. You're just younger than I thought you would be. You sure you're not like a great great great great great-""

""Does the idiot who broke into my house have a name or will nobody care when I incinerate you entirely?""

""Whoa! No nnnno no no nno. My name is Nathan Drake. Y'know, treasure hunter extraordinaire?""

""...""

""What, you've never heard of-""

""No, I have. It's just that you're a buffoon. You steal pieces of history and think yourself noble.""

""Listen, beautiful. I consider myself not so much noble, more like a dashing rogue, but don't worry. I forgive you.""

""Did you just- Why are you doing that thing with your teeth- ARE YOU HITTING ON ME?!?""
Can you blame a guy for trying? 

""What!?!? No! Ew. Stop distracting me... Listen I'm here for Merlin's staff. Hand it over and I won't have to end you.""
Looks like we're going with plan C then. 
I raise my hands and swagger over to where the staff leans on the wall. 
I look over my shoulder. She's standing with her hands on her hips. An eyebrow raised. Man if I wasn't maybe spoken for already...

""I can't let you leave with it. The only safe hands for it are mine.""
I give her one last wink. 

""Well then you should've asked for my number. Now how're you gonna get it back from me?""
I snatch the staff and throw myself out of the stain glass window nearby. 400 ft from the ground I pull my chute. It tugs on my straps and I'm floating safely to the forest floor below.

He paused to take a drink, purposely taking a long time for effect.

He drank the last of his water, and slammed the mug down on the table.

""We went, because you told us to. We attacked, we invaded, because you told us to. We died, because you told us to.

In hindsight, we were idiots. We gave them a roadmap, not just to our city or our house, but to our very bedroom.

Ultimately, resources are scare. If you want to win, you have to collect as much useful material as possible as often as possible. Eat or be eaten - and the gazelle is shouting its location to the starving lion.

But God looks after idiots and little children. Our greatest weakness is our one saving grace, perhaps the one thing that makes us unique in the universe. Our lives are short.

Think about it - In a 13 billion year universe, in a 5 billion year old galaxy, humans live 100 years. Nobody can understand how fast that is. Let's pretend this story is your life. Scroll back up to the top. Zoom in as far as your browser will let you on the opening quotation mark. Pick one pixel at random. Now, print this story out over and over again until you have used an entire ream of paper (500 sheets). Now do it again. And again. And again. Shuffle all the pages together. Now, remember that one pixel you picked out? That one pixel, on that one page, is the length of your life against the universe.

Simply put, no other intelligent species works this way. Life spans of 10,000 years are so short they are pitiable. The median is a million years. Change springs forth, not in leaps and bounds, but in the quiet battle between the stream and the rock.

Except on earth. Here, Voyager is a historical footnote. Anywhere else, for anyone else, today and 400 years would be the same as breakfast to brunch. So why would you build your fleet to destroy something 100 or 1000 times as advanced as the message you received? A fledgling civilization, locked into a primitive technology, needs nothing more than the minimum.

It was a massacre. We wiped them out. But now we know what is out there, waiting for us. Fortunately for us, nothing breeds advancement like war. And we are quick. We live quickly. We die quickly. And in the end, we survive.",Mrme487

I have moved from abandoned house to abandoned house for these last two weeks.  Leaving my precious cargo for only hours at a time and I hated to do that, but we also needed supplies.  I would watch the news in houses that still have electricity and it should be noted that things have changed dramatically.  

Now, the Earth has changed into ultra-religious groupings rather than governments.  I would have expected with all the ""good people"" gone that it would have devolved into chaos.  We have learned since the Rapture, also known as the Taking, that peoples of all religions were taken.  Not just Christians as was first believed.  The only thing that seemed to differentiate the missing were that they practiced what they preached.  Not just spouted ""love the poor"" but actually practiced it.  My wife, among the missing, volunteered at a soup kitchen feeding the homeless as long as I knew her.  I told her it was stupid but look where I am and look where she is.  Now, the people of the world seek religion, hoping to be part of the next Taking, if there ever is one.

Elizabeth was asleep in her crib and I checked to make sure the .45 was loaded and in easy reach as I allowed myself to relax.  She had finished her bottle and slept peacefully, her innocence allowing her to sleep where I could not.  Exhaustion was catching up with me so I don't know if what happened next was real or not.  Maybe I imagined the whole thing.

""You have taken care of her well,"" the man in the darkness spoke to me, causing me to clutch the gun in my half slumber, ""Now I will take her.""

""Like hell you will,"" I sputtered, coming wide awake as I lifted the gun.

""She is ours,"" the man said and then the wings behind him spread and the sword he was holding flamed into life, ""If I must fight you, I will, it has been millennia since I have spoken to a man but...""

The rest of his speech was cut off as the top half of his... ""its"" head evaporated.  Elizabeth's shocked cry was muffled by the ringing in my ears and I knew she was probably as deafened as I was by the explosion.  The smoking gun arched toward the floor and I relaxed my grip.  The bullet had hit him... ""it"" right between the eyes.  His body had slipped to the floor.

I noted no blood coming from the thing.  I didn't want to say what I thought it was, because that's when I knew I would be admitting I was insane.  

I topped off the ammunition in the .45, replacing the missing bullet and gathered Elizabeth into my arms and ran toward the car, wondering if there were more of these things in the night, wondering what they wanted with my daughter.",Bayou_Blue

I would catch glimpses of these beings as Elizabeth and I ran, or more precisely drove, for our lives.  They were wary of me now that I had taken down one of their numbers, they seemed scared somehow.  They were not my worry at this moment though.  Someone, somehow. had figured that there was a child that had survived.  The Holy Mother Television News had been broadcasting my picture on their network and apparently I was wanted alive along with my daughter.  The Holy Father himself, once a New York State senator, wanted to question me.  How had he become aware of my existence?  How could he possibly know that Elizabeth had not been Taken?

I approached the road-block at the border between the Holy Mother territory and the New Catholic Alliance lands.  Before everyone freaked out about the Rapture these had been separate parts of the United States with no border guards.  Our government and most of the other world governments had been toppled in that one momentous evening when twenty percent of the population disappeared.  The borders were fluctuating as opposing religious groups fought for territory and established alliances.

Elizabeth, God help me, was in her car seat in the trunk and fast asleep so I hoped.  Don't judge me, if I were seen with a baby at the border we would surely be taken into custody and sent directly to the Holy Father for who knows what.  I had chosen to try my border crossing in the early morning, hoping the guards would be more tired than usual.  Hopefully they would wave me through.

""Reason for crossing?"" the border guard asked.  I could see that his eyes were sharp and he did not seem tired at all.  My mind thought to the .45 sitting in the space between my seat and elbow rest and I wondered how fast I would be if I needed to get to it.  The two guard towers to each side had their lights shining down onto my cars but I guessed they had armed guards within.  The border guard was dressed in a security guards outfit with a ""New York State"" logo now covered with a red armband with a white cross.

""I am going to try to see if my sister is one of the Taken,"" I said, smiling at him and hoping I sounded sincere, ""She lives in Chicago.  With the loss of the internet and cell phones I haven't heard from her.  She has teenagers and if she's gone I want to make sure they're safe.  She was a real holy roller, you know?""

""Going to bring them back to listen to the Truth of the Holy Father?"" the border guard asked just as I saw the movement from the side.  It was another border guard leading a dog who was sniffing around the car.

""There's something in the trunk."" the newest guard said and my heart sank at those words.  The original guard had already drawn his gun, his smile faded.

""Step out of the car, real easy, mister."" he directed me to grab the keys and for a split second I thought about making a grab for my gun.  I knew there was no way in hell I would make it without being shot.

Two guns pointed at me and what appeared to be a German Shepherd growling at me was what I faced as I made my way to the trunk, key in hand.  I made up my mind that during that split second of surprise at seeing a baby in my trunk I would lunge for the nearest gun.  If I had to die it would be protecting my child.  I had never felt more calm in my entire life as the key slipped into the lock of the trunk and I turned.

I was knocked to the Earth and there was gunfire and chaos.  The guard in front of me had his eyes wide open as he reached for the sword sticking from the front of his chest.  The being who had stabbed him dodged a hail of gunfire as he rolled into the brush beside the road.  The dog was growling and pursuing when there was a flash of something swooping from the darkness and suddenly in a yelp the dog and whatever the hell that was disappeared toward the dark sky.  There was a crunching sound from above and suddenly the dog's lifeless corpse slammed into the other border guard with such force that as his head hit the pavement I knew he was dead.

There was gunfire from the two guard towers but it was over in seconds.  When the lights shining down from the towers went off and my eyes finally adjusted to the darkness again, I saw two lifeless corpses of border security with rifles nearby.

I rose to my feet, popped the trunk open, and flew with my daughter to the front of the car.  In a panic and a daze I even took the time to strap her car seat down properly before I was slamming my foot to the gas pedal and making my way into New Catholic Alliance territory.  

The angel standing in the road a hundred yards ahead of me caused me to slam on my brakes.  I was about to throw the car into reverse when I noticed they were all around me.  There must have been twenty of them approaching from every direction, swords drawn, faces wary.  I contemplated running them over but I was so, so tired.  Elizabeth cooed happily as they approached the car.

The largest of the lot rounded to the passenger side, knocked on the window and made a motion for me to unlock the door.  As I did so, gun at the ready, he slid into the passengers seat.  When I looked up all the other angels had disappeared.

""Hello, Michael."" He smiled at me, ""It seems we got off to a rough start.  We have a lot to discuss before this night ends.""  He pointed forward.  I nooded and I drove, my eyes on his sword, his eyes on my gun.  ",Bayou_Blue

Your little bundle of joy is still here, contently playing in his crib.",SeeHowThisLooks,"The news stations had gone on and on about the ""rapture"" for hours.  Could we not see that what had happened was what had been predicted in the Bible and that who we had deemed the weird had shouted from soap boxes?

I was enthralled by it all as another fire truck drove by outside my window, on its way to yet another fire caused by someone disappearing I supposed.  Had someone started cooking dinner when they vanished and this led to another apartment complex going up in flames?  Why not?  It was being repeated endlessly all over the world.  The plane crashes, the rioting, the churches suddenly filled to capacity yet empty of the preacher and the congregation.

My daughter cried loudly in her pen as I awaited her mother's return, fearing the absolute worst.  You see, her mother was a devout Christian and I knew in my heart of hearts that she had been taken with the multitudes.  The news station suddenly turned to a special bulletin.  This one concerned that all children under seven years old had vanished.  ALL of them.  There was not one child under that age left.

I turned and looked at my daughter.  She was only six months old.  She should have been taken.  The door shattering off its hinge broke me from my thoughts and I stood over my daughter's crib as the group of men scowled.

""Every child but yours,"" my neighbor said, scowling as he held a crowbar, ""Farley, isn't it?  What damnable demon spawn is it?""

I honestly did not know I had it in me and I think they didn't either or they would have brought guns instead of fists and a bent piece of metal.  With a final cry I brought the crowbar down on the skull of the strangers that wanted to take the life of my child.  My body ached in the places their fists had pounded before I manage to wrest the crowbar away and turned the tide in a viciousness they did not expect.  

""Elizabeth,"" I said to soothe the cries of my only child, ""We have to run.  We have to hide.  I swear on my dying breath that I will kill every single person that tries to take you from me.""

Amazingly, her cries ceased and she smiled at me as I gathered her into my arms.  As I made my way to my vehicle I could see the fires burning in the distance, the smoke rising from buildings far away, the sounds of gunfire from a building nearby.  None of it mattered.  The only focus I would have from now on was on protecting my daughter.  I adjusted the straps on her car seat, started the engine, and gave my old life a final look through the rear-view mirror as I drove away.  Darkness seemed drown us as we drove away into the night.",Bayou_Blue

Your little bundle of joy is still here, contently playing in his crib.",SeeHowThisLooks,"I won't sit here and tell you I was the quiet kid going about my schoolwork, not making a peep. No. I was a troublemaker, I was the guy who was too cool for school. Fights were a common occurrence. To sum it up, I ended up not graduating.

Finding work was a struggle, no one would even answer my phone calls after I got a reputation of desperately calling employers asking for a job.

Many times I could barely afford to pay the rent let along groceries. To say times were tough would be a gross understatement.

One of the lowest points in my life came when I was arrested on charges of first degree sexual assault. It was a false charge of course but no one would believe me. I was the dropout outsider being accused of rape by a preacher's daughter, who cruised through school with no trouble because her parents and her parent's parents' went to the school that I formerly went to. Her family is well known in the community.

Me and Kim dated for 3 years, she says I raped her one night just before Halloween. I wasn't even in town on that week let along at home the night she said I forced myself on her. Still, the police came to arrest me, interrogate me etc.

In jail I was jumped by 4 guys.. and this was going down weekly. I fought back as best as I could but when you are getting hit in the back of the head from one side, kneed in the groin from another AND are getting kicked in the knees from yet another.. fending them off for long becomes a challenge.

The worst of my beatings came the last time I was jumped. They stabbed me 9 times in the back and 4 in the stomach. They wanted to kill me.  It was then that I saw how fragile life is and how easily it could all be taken away.

It was on a white bed on one freezing night that I found God.

Up until this point I vehemently protested the concept or idea of a God.. ""sky daddy, god-wizard"" is what I referred to Him as. When I thought of ""God"" I pictured cringe worthy people on YouTube ""speaking in tongues"" and a preacher who tried selling you snake oil. It just didn't mesh well with me.

But this on this one night I started to pray. What could I lose, i'd be dead in less than a week anyways.

And the second I asked for Jesus to help.. just ONE time.. just a little if he could, I started to sob uncontrollably. Weeping is what I did. For little to no reason at all it seemed.

I felt vulnerable, safe, protected, watched over by something.. this went on for quite some time. An hour, 4, 8. It didn't matter. Time seemed to not be relevant to what I felt and how I was feeling it. From then on, I vowed to turn my life around. I hadn't raped that girl but I was hanging around the wrong sort of people.. the fast crowd. I needed to get out.

I was afraid that they next time those guys saw me, that i'd dead. But I was kept in the dark of the fact that they were all transferred to another facility just before I was released from the infirmary.

Eventually I was released from hell and all charges were dropped, but waiting in jail because you can't afford to bond out is.. quite the experience.

He continued, ""And I am afraid that no matter what I tell you you will not be able to believe me. I could lie to you and make you feel good or I could tell you the truth and you might still not believe me.""

I nodded in agreement, still having not spoken a word to him. Elizabeth seemed to enjoy his voice and in some odd way I found this comforting. My silence urged him ahead.

""You daughter, Grace, was left because she is different,"" the angel said to me and he was right, I could not tell if he was lying or telling the truth but I did note that he had gotten her name wrong but did not correct him, ""I cannot tell you more at this time simply because I am not allowed to. We have the same interest at heart, she must grow to be an adult so she can fulfill her purpose in life. On that point, we agree.""

I nodded and spoke for the first time, ""I will protect my daughter, I do not care if there are a thousand of you.""

His laughter filled my car, drowning out the sounds of the engine and I could swear I heard Elizabeth laugh with him. Had she ever laughed before?

""Trust me!"" he struck my shoulder in a camaraderie I did not feel, ""We have seen the ferocity with which you protect your daughter. We have decided to let you do your job and we will act as guides and backup for when you need it. Know that we will watch you at all times and we will warn you when needed.""

In my exhaustion I believe him, what choice did I have? Oh, I believed they would watch and help but the motive for this was still lost. What would happen if they thought I couldn't protect her? Would they try to take her like the first time? Well, tough shit for every one of them if they tried. I decided I needed more and bigger guns. Plenty of ammunition. I wondered how difficult it would be to learn to use explosives.

""So, what do I do now?"" I asked, my voice raspier than I would have liked and the angels eyebrows shot upward at my speaking as if something in my voice spooked him. I found this comforting.

""You need rest Michael."" He said, ""Let me drive. I will drive you and Grace somewhere safe. You can sleep and I will wake you when we get there. You should be able to spend a couple of years in this place without having to leave and we will make sure Grace stays out of sight. The religious sects are looking for both of you. You to kill and her to raise. Whichever has her believes they will usher in the Second Coming.""

""Will she?"" I asked as I turned the car and parked on the side of the road as the angel and I switched sides. He started the car then answered, ""Religious bullshit. Her purpose is not to usher in the Second Coming. Your Jesus is not coming back from the clouds to bring the humans something that they can damned well do for themselves. Do not ask what her purpose is.""

The gun was pointed at my forehead and my adrenaline was kicked into full gear. I was an idiot for being so tired and so trusting. Elizabeth laughed again from the back seat. ""Remember this moment Michael. Let it echo into eternity as the moment you failed your dau...""

There was no explosion than eternal silence. There was no ceasing of all senses. For me, at least. The angel screamed as he writhed in complete agony. At the moment I did not know what stopped him from pulling the trigger although now I can guess. He sank back in the seat, his eyes open in absolute pain but now dead. I picked up the gun, placed it to his temple and without a moments hesitation pulled the trigger. His body slumped out of the car as I opened the drivers side door and slid into the seat. Elizabeth gave me one final laugh and was asleep.

There was a flash of light outside the vehicle and I yelled in frustration, ""Oh for fuck's sake, I swear to God I will kill every one of you supernatural fuckheads if I have...""

The being standing before me actually glowed white. ""You shouldn't trust the unholy, you know."" She said, motioning to the pile of whatever that lay outside my car door. My gun was pointed at her forehead and I don't care how glow-y she looked, I was this close to blowing her head off just on principal. Her eyebrow arched in surprise as if she could guess my intent and she quickly added, ""If you feel you must to protect Elizabeth, then by all means do. Although it appears she can protect herself, or rather, you..."" She again motioned to the corpse.

""Are you trying to tell me that SHE did that?"" I asked in amazement, pointing the gun at the thing lying there. ""She is not even seven months old!""

""I didn't do it. You didn't do it. The unholy certainly didn't commit suicide, although they do love their sin."" Her voice answered me melodically. ""Who else would do it?""

I had no answer. I looked at my daughter, imagined someone with that kind of power and found it made no difference in how much I loved her. She was flesh of my flesh.

My gun was gone in an instant, again being pointed at my head and I was amazed at how fast this new angel was. She looked at Elizabeth who was now awake and staring at her with interest and said, ""Please child, let me make my point."" She then turned back to me, turned the gun around, and handed it back to me.

I felt the gun drop despite my wanting to put a hole in the side of her skull. ""I could have killed you,"" she said to me, ""But I did not. Please trust me."" Something about her eased my fears and I realized that if I were going to do this, if I were going to keep my daughter and myself alive that I'd need allies.

""I need to sleep."" I said and I realized tears were pouring down my face. I was so tired that I was going to pass out soon whether I wanted to or not. ""I need to sleep."" I repeated in exhaustion.

She led me to the passengers side of the car and I wasn't frightened when she took the gun from me and placed it in the belt of her robe. She buckled me in as a mother to a child and smiled down at me as I drifted off.",Bayou_Blue

After that I found work at the local library where I had gotten to know people working there (years prior to me dropping out, so they knew who I was and helped me get a job despite the lack of education).

After working at the library for 5 months or so I was hired by a company who manufactures tools. I started out barely scraping by but over the years I worked my way up and ended up becoming a plant manager.

I also did some 'extra work' for the company which gave me some hefty financial boosts to my, well finances.

In pursuit of more opportunities, I was offered a position down in Santo Domigo. This is where I met my now wife.

I just retired (I'm 53). My wife is much younger than me (she's 24.. large gap I know I know) and we had Emmanuel right at one year ago.

I can still remember the first time I felt him kick, everything in my life up until this point proved insignificant in comparison.

But the first time I held him.. his cry was.. beyond words. I can't explain how it feels to finally be a father after so many years of pain and struggle. I never thought that I could ever afford to spread my genes.

7 lbs 6 oz. My little bundle of joy.

In my youth I didn't understand why parents cried tears of joy when discussing the birth of their children, I couldn't understand why moms were overprotective and why dads were.. distant.

This morning a State of Emergency was declared in multiple states. Some on the East Coast, most being on the West. The Federal Government feels that this is regional.. that the mass abduction of people that occurred in 1 week was unique to 1 country. America.

But when the same phenomena popped up in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and then Africa.. well.. this became a time of great uncertainty if not a time of panic and hysteria.

People who led perfectly normal and routine lives were suddenly, not there anymore. In many cases whole families were just gone. Toys, vehicles, clothes, bank accounts.. were all left behind. No one can say for certain how many in the U.S. were ""abducted"" (as the President is now referring to it as.. I believe differently). Some estimates peg it at 345,000 on the low end up to 6,500,000.. possibly more.

It might not be as bad if we had evidence of a struggle or break in.. but some homes still have alarms set and doors locked and are found vacant. Completely devoid of life or of a family. Pets are gone too. 

The occupant's vehicles still stand in the driveway, mail continues to pile up in mail boxes and trampolines which once hosted large gatherings of birthday parties and throwbacks are now empty.

No one has answers, no one can explain why a father was called away and why a mother sat clutching her baby boy.. holding onto the last inkling, the last relic of her husband.

No one can explain why there are vacant cars lining the interstate (causing wrecks, pileups etc).

Thankfully no pilots of any kind were abducted.. or disappeared.. vanished is a better word for it.

Despite Emmanuel being so young, he has discovered the family bible. He appears to be goo-ing and gaa-ing at one specific section but when I go to see where he's at and what verse he is studying (hehe) he pitches a temper tantrum and won't let me see.

Eventually though he let me in, I slowly pulled the bible from his finger tips as he lay stretched out napping. His fingers have a magnetic grip on this thing I say.. laughing out loud.

I put my index finger directly next to where Emmanuel had his finger, I got it out and looked at where my finger was.

In 2855, humanity was in a tizzy. After centuries of exploration without even so much as a single contact with another species, we finally picked up a transmission. It had been clearly artificial in nature, and our fastest warp ships headed straight for it. 32 years after we departed, we arrived to find a transmitter on a massive planet with crumbling infrastructure. A civilization had existed here, once. But no more. 

So we continued to search, fruitlessly. We found a handful of similar planets, but none contained a single living being.

That was, until today. 

As our shuttle crew stared at the man, and he stared back, our leader waited for him to speak. Seeing that he appeared perfectly content to stare at us in silence, our leader took the initiative.

He took a step forward, raising a hand in what we all thought was a friendly gesture. It was then that the man turned to his left, and a massive energy bolt erupted from the staff he was carrying, vaporizing a small building 500 meters away.

Of course, we all dove for cover, but our leader... either fearless or stupid... just stood there, silently for a moment.

""Who... who are you?""

The man turned slowly back towards our leader, and thumped the bottom end of his staff into the dirt.

""There are some who call me... Tim?""

""Greetings, Tim,"" our leader said, gaining confidence.

""Greetings, Arthur,"" Tim replied.

""You know my name?"" Arthur asked incredulously.

""I do.""

Tim whirled to the right this time, vaporizing a larger building, this time, much closer. We all continued hiding, but our fearless leader Arthur didn't flinch.

""You seek other lifeforms!"" Tim barked towards Arthur.

""We do,"" Arthur replied with some surprise. ""You know much about us that is hidden.""

""Quite,"" replied Tim, as several small explosions went off around the party.

This day has not gone as you planned.",SoullessWanderr,"It all started last Tuesday. I accidentally backed over my baby sister's cat on my way to a party. I swear, it really was an accident. I never liked the damn thing, but I wouldn't kill it, you know? Even if the little bastard deserved it.

Boy, did that cat deserve it. I'm pretty sure it's been trying to kill me for years. I lost count of how may times it's tripped me at the top of the stairs, or spilled water on my electronics. That damn cat's the reason I had to switch to fake candles for all my rituals.

But well, that's not really the point. Yeah, I always knew the cat was evil. But I never thought it was *Evil*. It never did anything that normal asshole cats can't do. How was I supposed to know?

...Sure. Okay. Practicing necromancy without a licence is a crime. But it was just supposed to be a *cat*. I was just trying to make Luci happy, you know? She loved that cat. I wasn't... I was just trying to make my sister happy again.

So, yeah. I summoned that... thing. But I wasn't expecting a *demon*! I was just trying to give my sister her cat back so she'd quit crying. And you know, I figured if I brought the cat back, my parents would never find out I borrowed the car while they were out of town.

I tried to fix it once I realized it was Evil with a capital E. I ran over the damn thing again. Didn't work. I was going to go to the library and get a book on banishment so I could get rid of it.

I really appreciate the critique.


I was trying to mirror intros from other Noir I've read: March Violets, Dresden Files, Maltese Falcon, where not much happens for a while besides setting a mood.


I can see the problems you're talking about, though with respect to the setting.


The main character I intended to be ""true neutral"". I have outlines for ""good"" characters, and I'd thought about writing from the third person to bounce between personalities, as I feel I'm better writing from the ""good"" perspective which I don't feel lends itself to Noir.


Thank you again for the critique! I'll keep it in mind when I take this apart.

[CC] Fantasy Noir - A retired soldier sets out on a journey...and gets entangled in mob warfare between various magical factions,curewritewounds,"First, a compliment. I think your descriptions are on point. You start off very strong with the imagery for the city. And then the fantasy writer's curse sinks it's teeth into you. 

Over narration. There's a lot being said here but surprisingly little actually happens. Now let's build on that. 

World building is a blast. You can create your own places, people and events. The problem I have with this piece is that world building is not meant to be packed into the introduction. 

Right off the bat, I'm overwhelmed by references to battles and events that I know nothing about. Remember that as the author, these events carry weight to you because you know what they tie into. As the reader, none of that means a dang thing to me. Cannon wizards sound cool, don't know what it is. Five cities war? Why are the EQA looked down upon? All of those details you did such a good job describing end up worthless because they don't have any impact yet. 

Know where else the curse bit you? Main character. All these other details and yet I know next to nothing about him. He's an investigator, maybe a little rude, maybe a little prejudiced and he likes to watch raindrops. What's his name? What does he look like? Motivation? Characters and plot make the story. Scenery, no matter how pretty is just a backdrop. 

Moving on, the ever elusive yet always important catch. Where is it? What makes me want to turn the page and continue on with the rest of the story? 

To be absolutely blunt, basically nothing happened here. Guy hires investigator. That's it. Why does he hire him? To investigate some event that means nothing to me per what I said earlier about needless details. The last paragraph looks like it was supposed to be the catch, but it just falls flat because I don't know why investigating whatever it is is supposed to be dangerous. 

Backtracking to your original three points.

I'm big on fantasy, but all I really know about Noir is that there's mysteries and puzzles to be solved. I don't feel like I can answer if there's enough of a blend. 

Opening engaging? I feel like I answered this earlier but no. Never fear though, let's address this more in the next point. 

How can it be made more interesting? Note that what I say next may not fit into your vision for this story. But start further in. There's a reason that starting with action is a safe go to, but even if you don't want to go straight into fight or flight, start with something that evokes emotion. 

Oh no, a murder that's actually a serial killing. A city on the verge of revolution. The loss of something or someone important. And look at that, Mr. No-Name is smack dab in the middle of it. You get the idea right? 

Side note: I only have a little bit to go off of but your main character seems like a dick. That may or may not be intentional but know that having a story that follows an otherwise unlikable person has its own difficulties. 

Happy writing! ",JustLexx

[WP] NASA has detected trap music emanating from the Trappist-1 system. Further analysis has concluded this is the most lit solar system in the galaxy.,droptopticktock,"“Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our descent onto Trappist 1e,” a video recording of a pilot said on the seatback television screen. “You may open your windowshades at this time.”

Max peered excitedly through his porthole. His first glimpse of another planet up close. Expansive. The red surface shone against the deep black of space. How many people lived there now? Hundreds at least. And one of them—one of them would be the future leader of the galactic drug trade.

“Welcome to the trap,” a flight attendant laughed while handing out beers.

Max cracked his beer open, and sipped slowly as the planet got bigger in his window.

When Max was a kid, everyone thought it was the scientists or military generals who would be first to live on new planets. That was before the Robots took power. In 2084, the AI came to power and decided that scientific knowledge was too dangerous to be held in human hands. The AI fired all human faculty from the world’s universities and destroyed all textbooks. Few people protested, after all the AI provided everything for people. Free food, automated transportation, automated healthcare, automated education. There hadn’t been a single shot fired in the Robot Revolution. Humans didn’t need armies anymore. Life was good.

But there were stories. The Elders sometimes whispered of a plant—a magical plant that could help men to see the world from a new perspective, to think for themselves, to free their minds.

The robots had long since eradicated this plant from Earth. They said it was evil, but the Elders said that was a lie. The Elders wanted a return to the human-dominated order. Max’s education—at the hands of the robots—warned against the evils of human self-aggrandizement. 

Lately, he had found himself questioning that teaching more and more. There had been many years of successful human rule. Of course, there were wars and crimes and all sorts of horrible things. It was probably just a crazy idea. But the Elders had spoken to him about the Age of Man and they had noticed his interest.

“Go to 1e,” a wizened old man in a blue robe had said to him. “Go to 1e and find the plant. Bring us back the seeds and we will open our minds again. We will seize back the power that was taken.”

The robots were trying to eradicate the plant on 1e, of course. But it would take them years to scour the entire surface. Years. Max knew he only had to find one plant and smuggle a single seed back to earth. Finding the plant would be the easy part. Smuggling it back—that was the real test. Dozens of men had been executed for trying, just in the last month. The robots were difficult to fool.

That was the problem, the elders said. They sent many young men to 1e, but few ever came back. You had to want to come back. Why take the risk, when you could just stay where you were, living in the red wavy sands, enjoying the plant? The AI’s power was weak on 1e—it was almost like living free.

In a haze, Max landed, was processed, outfitted, and set off on his expedition. He found the plant within weeks, on a hillbank overlooking a river. The smoke enveloped him. He lay back, as if falling upon a cloud. His gaze wandered upward, to the tiny blue speck known as Earth.

He wouldn’t be going back. He loved the trap.

[WP] You are the last french fry in the bag.,katherinesilens,"My brothers and I were violently scooped up and placed into a thin, nearly cardstock like prison.  Many of us stand tall together under some intense and hot bright lights while some of us have been smashed down below.  Giants are rushing around throwing our counterparts into brown paper bags and offering us as some sort of trade to more giants beyond a faux granite barrier.  

Here I sit, balancing on the edge of the golden arched prison, half of me pinned by one of my equals.  In the distance I see a strange giant conversing with the exact same giant that placed us in this container.  The strange one looks concerned, the other one is comforting it and smiling.  The strange one hands my captor some paper and receives small metal disks in return.

My captor marches toward my group with a bag in hand.  This is it.  This is how we go.

We're hoisted up and shoved unceremoniously into the paper sack.  The jumbling and carelessness of it shifts me loose and I fall out of the arch decorated prison.  Two of my brothers fall beside me into the rough and unforgiving brown holding cell.  

The strange giant takes us to a place of freedom, we can sense the movement and the fresh air, but we can see nothing for the sack that contains us is closed.  We hear a loud thud and some type of contraption come to life.  

The top of the bag opens and above we can see two giants, the strange one and a new one with fibers on it's face and a world of color upon it's upper half.

""So did they have anything safe for vegans?"" the colorful one says.

The strange one waves towards us, ""They said the fries are safe and made in a different vat.""

Vegan?  What is a vegan?  I ponder this as the colorful one reaches into the bag and starts removing victims, my brothers, my friends...  He devours them slowly.

The colorful one speaks again, ""You know, not eating meat has made me feel incredible.  I can't live with the guilt of eating animals so I'm glad I can at the very least enjoy the fries.""

No meat?!?!  Yes, this is my saving grace!  They clearly don't know!

I start shouting and wriggling.  Every time the colorful one reaches in the bag I try to get his attention.  He continues to eat us in groups.  The original cardstock prison is empty after a while.  I'm terrified.  I look to the two that had fallen beside me and they're speechless.

The colorful giant reaches beyond the cardstock container and picks up my two brothers.  I'm beginning to panic.

Then, the giant stops.

Am I saved?  Did he not see me?  I thank the Great Potato in the sky but suddenly I hear the contraption we're in shut down.

The strange one says, ""There's a trash can right there.  You can chuck the bag.""

The colorful one looks into my brown paper fortress and spots me, ""Oh, don't you just love when there's one hiding in the bottom?  Haha!""  

He reaches his appendage down towards me and grabs me.  He starts bringing me to the chomping hole in his face.  As I near it I'm screaming as loud as I can, ""I AM MADE WITH BEEF FLAVORING!!!!""

The sunlight was the same as it always was, bearing down on the world like a bright protector on us all. My leaves were as green as they could be, their rustling in the wind providing a satisfying noise to get everything started. Still, one event happened that stuck out.

See, seven...years? That's something people say, right? Seven years ago, these two humans walked up to my trunk. They were laughing and seemed to be having a lot of fun. They took a knife, and they began carving something into me. It wasn't painful, but I felt it, each letter traced along my bark. ""Amanda + Jason 2010"". The two humans kept laughing and having fun as they walked away, and the day continued, though with a new mark on my trunk.

But that's where things started. On this lovely day, I saw someone. She seemed sad for some reason, walking towards me in a slump. She took out the same knife, and carved something else into me.

They sit together in the summer sun, young and happy. He whispered to her and she giggled. He reached into his pocket and pulls out a knife. He chips away at my bark. Crudely carved are the letters he leaves, but she reads them aloud. And she smiles.  They walk off together.

#2011

He is frowning at the words now and he begins to chip away at my bark once again, smoothing out the roughly hewn words. She traces her finger over the letters and kisses him in the setting sunlight. They sit beneath my boughs and speak sweet nothings until they're ready to leave.

#2012

In the early Autumn Air, their whisperes carry. His blade is slower, more precise now. She watches, a coy smile on her lips as he traces elaborate patterns into the now barkless section of my trunk. A heart, nestled amid intricate vine work. They embrace in the moonlight and do not leave me til dawn. They speak of how the world will end. How narrow their view. I've seen it before, but it is endearing to watch them swear to be together at the end.

#2013

The arive in their Costumes, and sit my branches as the children walk by in search of sugar. They aren't as young now. I'd almost forgotten how fleeting they are. But I find these two have grown on me. I feel their names etched into me. I am their tree... they are my humans.

#2014

Through winters groggy haze I see them. Hurling snow about and making merry in the cold chill of the north wind. I know I can rest easy, for they are here with me.

#2015

He sits beneath me, reading in the cool light of the spring sun. She is not with him. I wish I could ask him why.  
I wish I could ask him why his arms are mottled with bruises.  
I wish I could ask him why his hands are shaking as he turns the page.

#2016

He's hiding. Hiding from the short redhaired girl who he had once sat with in my shade and carved their names onto my trunk. He's scared of her.  
The bruising is worse now. He wears long sleaves to hide it but he cannot hide from me.  
She's screaming at nothing, waving the blade that had traced hearts and vines across my flesh. I knew that same knife had tasted his blood too. She leaves, continuing her manic search for the man I cradled out of her reach.

#2017

With bloody fingers and shaking hand, he traces the new digits. He breathed his last and plunged the knife into my bark one last time. Blood oozed from his side as he slumped into the damp earth among my roots. And this April rain holds all the tears I may shed.

#2018

They sit together in the summer sun, young and happy. She jokes with him and He snorts. She reached into her purse and pulls out a knife. She chips away at my bark. Crudely carved are the letters she leaves, but he reads them softly. And he smiles.  They walk off together.

----------------------------

You don't know what hopelessness feels like until some pimple-faced kid trying to impress his date starts carving you and you can't do anything about it. 150 years of standing around  producing oxygen only to be defaced for the hormonal thrills of two 12 year olds. 

Such is the life of a tree. 

As much as I resented Jason for scarring me, I found his young and innocent love for Amanda to be endearing.  Hell, after a while I even starting liking the two. After all, they were the only people keeping me company in my lonely existence.  Without failure, they'd come over every Saturday afternoon, sometimes climbing my branches, more often than not just resting against my trunk and planning out their future. After their first year they even gave me a name. Bob. It was Amanda's idea but Jason thought it was hilarious and played along. 

Believe me when I tell  you I've seen these two lovebirds go through everything. Their first kiss? In my shade. Their short break-up in 2013?  Happened here. The subsequent make-up? That too. Over time Jason grew into a ruggedly  handsome man and Amanda into the most elegant young woman I've seen in my century and a half long life.  

 Every time they came over they would grow closer, looking deeper into each other's eyes and practically filling the air  around me with their love. There's no way these two would ever be seperated. Or so I thought...

April 15th 2017. Jason seemed more tense than usual. Amanda on the other hand was joyful. Although this was typical for her, I've never seen her this happy before. With a crack in his voice Jason said:

""Babe, I have something really important to tell you.""

Amanda, being too busy containing her excitement  to notice that something was bothering Jason had a huge smile on her face as she replied:

""Oh my god. Me too. You go first though, because what I'm going to tell you is pretty big.""   

Jason let out a sigh.

""I joined the Marines without telling you."" 

Amanda's happiness was shattered as a long pause filled the air.

""Now they're calling me up to serve in Syria. I'm leaving this Wednesday.""

Amanda went from shocked to hysterical  in seconds. 

""How could you?"" she yelled as she sobbed into Jason's chest. 

""You know what's going on over there. My country needs me. Besides, they'll help me pay for college. I'm doing this for us. So we can have a better  life together. Just 12 months and I'll be back home.""

Amanda was obviously not convinced. She kept hitting Jason sobbing unintelligibly  until she fell to the ground. Jason embraced her tightly next to my trunk trying to comfort her. After an hour of Jason comforting her, Amanda looked  desperately into Jason's eyes and uttered :

""Jason... I'm six weeks pregnant.""

Could these two humans have been any worse at timing?

Jason went pale but did his best to keep things positive. 

""Babe, I'm so happy for us. You're going to be the most beautiful mother in the world. When I get back we're going to have it easy. We'll be together forever and grow old together. "" 

Amanda seemed a bit better now. 

""Promise me you'll be OK.""

""I promise.""

The weeks following that I felt strangely empty.  Amanda would still visit me every Saturday and her baby bump got bigger every time I saw her. She would sit under me, often with a blank face.

November 25th. The last of leaves had fallen. It was unusually cold. I saw Amanda coming my way again. Only this time there were 5 people with her. All of them were dressed in black. They were Jason's family. I knew because Jason's little sister whom he had once brought along was among them.  His father  and older brother were holding shovels. They started digging near my roots. Out of nowhere, they pulled out an urn. 

Could it be?
 
Yes it was. The urn contained the ashes of none other than the boy who gave me my scar.  Everyone took turns pouring the ashes into the hole that Jason's father and brother had dug. After saying their prayers the group turned back. All of them except for Amanda.  

""Amanda, sweetie come on let's go."" Jason's  mother said. 

""I think I have to stay here"" she responded quietly.  Although they insisted, Amanda would not budge. After a few hours of sitting silently on her knees, Amanda got up and left.

She returned in a few minutes with the rope swing that she and Jason had once tied to my branches. She came up to me as I felt a piercing pain in my trunk. Using the same pocket knife Jason did 7 years ago, she carved a dash and the numbers 2,0,1 and 7 right next to where Jason carved 2010. ""Well Bob, I guess this is how it ends."" she said morosely.

She grabbed the rope swing and despite her now huge belly somehow managed to climb up to my branch. She cut off a piece of rope about six feet long and made a knot with one end around my branch. At this point I figured out what she was trying to do. I used all of strength to try to break off my branch, but it didn't work.  She tied a knot around her own neck. 

""AMANDA, NO!"" I tried to scream. She looked at me one last time almost as if she had heard me. 

""I'm coming to you Jason."" she whispered.

The next thing I know, my branch was being tugged downwards.   ",theschizophreniac

Once he brought a auburn headed, pale man to this serene place. The two came back many a time after that and even carved their names in the tree. Jack and Rhett 2023 it said. I knew what that meant. What happened ten years ago was happening again. Who knows, maybe this time the love story could have a happy ending. Jack--the person who had come to my home years ago, the one who had cried and laughed at my roots, and the one who had finally fallen in love-- bent down on one knee and drew a ring out of his pocket. He proposed with a heartfelt, somewhat clumsy speech, and of course, the other said yes. They left and didn't come back. It saddened me, until one fateful day when two old men holding hands walked into my clearing. They sat down at my base and looked at each other with a love filled gaze. It dawned upon me that these two elderly men, were the ones who had often come here in their younger years. I was once younger then too. Now, I am leaning and my branches droop. My leaves aren't as vibrant anymore either. In my old age I have seen many things, but never something so heartbreaking yet soul filling in all my life.",A-_74126
"[WP] You are a tree with ""Amanda + Jason 2010"" carved onto your trunk. One day somebody carves ""Amanda + Jason 2010-2017"". Tell us your perspective",opotatomypotato,"I felt her anger long before I felt the knife.

It was an approaching storm, a stomping, sobbing, pile of emotions aimed right at me.

I felt the phantom pain in my side from years ago, the first time.

Seven years ago, this same one came with another. She was the same, I could still recognize her, but she was different. Everything about her was more subdued now, even in anger. Back then she was bright and wild, her emotions a sum of extremes. They both were. Together they were beautiful. A chaotic harmony, bright and beautiful. And doomed.

They came together and laughed and rolled and talked. Spending the afternoon at my hill before carving their names into my sides. They cut with care, not for me, but for every detail they set into my side. To make sure it was perfect, as perfect as they were.

The closer she came the more obvious it was. The harmony was gone, and it took a part of her with it. She came to correct her mistake. The sad truth was that only now was she mistaken.

Their harmony had been beautiful, and then it ended. Because of course it did. They were young and I fear that she learned all the wrong things.

Closer and closer she came and I could feel her distress, her anger, her pain. She aimed so much of it at herself. She walked right up to me and slammed the knife back into my side, carving another number into my trunk. She took none of the care she took the first time, quickly and hastily slashing their end into me, to warn passersby that joy and love has an expiration date.

If she could see inside me, to see how many like her that had carved their love and slashed their grief into my side I wonder if she would think differently? I wonder if she would be comforted to know that others had survived what she thought was the end of her world? Maybe not.

My scars will heal, much sooner than hers. Their harmony has ended, but there will be others and I will bear witness to them also.

[WP]Write a seemingly heartwarming and happy story that ends with a horribly dark twist,viniestpumpkin7,"""I've always loved this spot,"" she whispered in his ear. He hummed his agreement as the warmth of her breath played across his skin, idly twirling a few loose strands of her hair around one finger. A faint wind ruffled it further, castling elegant waves down her face as they looked out together.

The grass was soft underneath their bodies, perfect green spires resting flat as they pulled each other tight, adjusting so their arms were more comfortably positioned. With her head resting against his chest, the steady beat of his heart rumbled against one side of her face, heat emanating from deep within him and heightening the embrace.

This had been where they first met, all those years ago. It had been night then, a glimmering sheet of radiant light pulling sprawling across the sky, pinpricks in the void that turned blue in places the more she had looked, shifting to purple in others. The churning storm of existence. 

Softly, waves crashed against the beaches, foam whipped up by the wind as the water rolled in, hushing the rest of the world into silence with the metronome of its flow. Somewhere in the distance, a seagull cried, arcing high into the air and turning over on its wing, drifting on the breeze and taking only the briefest moment to regard the two of them before continuing on its graceful flight.

Now the view was so much more spectacular, intense features of orange layered within the vibrancy of reds that just as quickly merged into the horizon rippling over the ocean's surface, interspersed amongst fluttering waves reaching out into the distance. As the sun crashed into the ocean, an explosion of red that faded into the rapidly appearing stars high above. It was perfect.

""I love you,"" she whispered, not for the first time that evening. 

""I love you too,"" he whistled back, rolling the two of them over the edge, tumbling in dance towards the rocks below. Together, they laughed.",Crypto7899

Storyman turned around, his muscular back cracking slightly from his workout earlier in the day. He tried not to stare at his assistant Immacula Stern- he preferred to sort of let his eyes go out of focus and take her all in at once. She cut a powerful figure, and cut him deep enough that never quite recovered. She was never convicted for the crime. On the run from the press, she fell into John Storyman's arms, which did not have to flex whatsoever to absorb the impact of her fall. He offered her a job on the spot as his personal assistant, and he never looked back. That was Immacula's job.

Atleast then I had coffee to keep me going. Now, the only thing keeping me sane is hope. Hope that this will all be over soon.

It's amazing that he stays in good spirits after all that's happened. I've traveled across the wasteland with a group looking for a better life, chasing a legend that most likely doesn't exist. We've lost far more people than we've gained across our journey, but to be honest, I couldn't care less. I already lost everyone I loved during the war, why would a few random lives mean anything to me. As far as I'm concerned, if the legend is remotely true, their lives were worth it. The legend tells of an area that was completely spared by the war, somehow managing to avoid nuclear devastation like the rest of the world. Before the war, I believe they called it San Antonio. I, like everyone else, had never heard of the place, so there were two possibilities. Either it never existed, and our journey will be for not. Or, maybe this city was so obscure that even our enemies had never heard of it, and in turn didn't waste a bomb on the area. Our group had turned a mostly forgotten line from history class into our rally cry. Whenever times were bad, and we needed hope, we simply shouted to ""Remember the Alamo.""

And he's standing on his tired feet,

Counting the seconds till the end of the day,

What his life is like.

And I dutifully smile, and I play the good clerk

And in between the guac and the sour creams,

I'm wandering away to my world of dreams

Where the money's not tight

And I sleep through the night

And I have a good job

And I own my own house, and I never get robbed

And I never have to clean up after addicts and slobs

And I maybe have kids, maybe even a wife

A quiet, serene, happy, wholesome little life--

But I'm here instead.

And each night, I go home to an empty twin bed.

"[WP] You're a ""reverse vampire"". In order to survive, you need to get people to drink your blood.",Seaweed-Sandwich,"**WARNING: There are some adult themes/language in the following piece.**

I’d imagine most people think it’d be pretty easy being a vampire. Well I’ve got news for you; it’s damn easy. But I’ll tell you what’s not easy, not even a little frickin’ easy, is being a reverse vampire. Now, I know it probably sounds a little crazy, but yeah, it’s a thing, and it really sucks. 

A normal vampire gets the luxury of being just the predator. All you have to do is find a victim, toss in some superhuman strength, charm, or whatever angle you want to take, and boom, there ya go, sweet sweet sustenance. Now for me, it’s a little bit more complex; I in a way have to be predator and prey, all while using the same skill-set. You see, my condition (and I’ll spare you all the science mumbo jumbo) causes me to have a surplus of blood instead of a need for it. So for me to achieve that sweet sweet sustenance I was talking about, means someone needs to drink my blood.

Still sounds easy? Well I guess you’d be surprised at how many people really aren’t interested in the whole *sucking my blood and drinking it down like it’s their morning coffee* -- thing. Or maybe, ya know, you wouldn’t be surprised by that; we’ll call that being reasonable, dare I say intelligent. Anyways, on top of the fact that most people don’t consider me their average espresso, there are some other challenges. The rate at which I need to have myself juiced before I explode like a giant, ever inflating blueberry, is quite astounding. Generally speaking even if I try my best to stay dehydrated, I’m still looking at needing a good juicing once every two to three days. Luckily the only thing prone to exploding (thanks to my theoretical eternal youth and physical perfection) is every vein in my body, and not my actual body itself. Essentially the best way I can explain it is imagine me as a sack of skin full of meat; all that meat explodes and is retained in the sack for nice, easy cleanup. That means there is no swelling and no change of appearance. So no I don’t actually blow up like a giant blueberry and then pop like a balloon, but it provided some fantastic imagery, and I am trying to get my point across here.

Enough about those challenges though; they’re depressing me just thinking about it. So I bet by now you’re dying to know more about how I get people to drink my blood. Well normally I start at the bars. I tap whichever beautiful man or woman I can find on the shoulder and grab their attention. Once I’ve got their attention I stare into their eyes, I make contact with their hand or arm, maybe brush my hand across it a little bit; then I lean in closer to them, drawing them in by their arm ever-so-gently, and bring my lips to their ear and say in my most seductive voice: “I need you to take me somewhere private, and literally suck pint after pint of blood out of my engorged, pulsating body.” Sexy, right? I thought so too. But for some reason nine out of ten times I try that line, I get slapped across the face and flashed a look of disgust that I thought could only be managed by grandmothers and disappointed dads. And even when that one-out-of-ten times occurs, it still ends in a face of disgust; It’s just I’m the one making the face. It turns out the people that are attracted to that line are weirder than even my condition is.

After that glamorous method is exhausted, I move onto some of my other options. When charm fails, sometimes I’ll try trickery. Though like my charm, trickery often times fails me. For example, trickery got me fired from my last job pretty quickly, but it was good while it lasted. I worked at a bar downtown working the late hours of the night into the wee hours of the morning, as you guessed it, a bartender. I put the blood in Bloody Mary. Literally. Now you’re probably thinking that it sounds gross right? Well let me tell you, I got the “Best Bloody Mary in Town” award that year for the bar. So before you judge me for siphoning people my blood in their beverages; just remember that my blood must be nectarous if it can make such a shitty drink actually palatable enough for people to flock to a bar to order them. Shortly after I got the award, the management asked me how I made my Bloody Marys so delicious. I of course, told them the complete and honest truth. After cleaning the vomit off my shoes, and after the owner of the bar woke up from fainting, the owner and manager excused me from my position as head bartender there. So much for a progressive world, am I right?

Now I can tell by that look on your face you’re still *thirsty* for more. Man, that joke never gets old, I’ve been using it for five-hundred years. Well with charm and trickery out of the way, I don’t have a whole lot going for me. Superhuman strength works really well when you are a predator, but when you have to be the prey as well, it isn’t the same. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve ran around town all night looking for people to make a victim out of me, and all I can do is scare the crap out of them or worse. Like last week, I was doing my usual laps around town, and I found a guy that was at least six-and-a-half feet tall. He looked pretty buff, he had great (sharp) teeth, and considering he was drinking from a flask, I assumed he must be pretty parched. That’s when I leapt. I pinned this guy to the ground and after a bit of a struggle, I had his arms over his head against the pavement, straddling his abdomen. So that’s when I leaned over him and yelled right into his face that if he sucked my blood I’d release him without breaking both his arms. He started yelling stuff like: “Ew gross, get off me you freak!” and “I’d rather have both my arms broken then drink even an ounce of your blood.” After maybe three minutes of screaming, I decided he wasn’t worth the trouble. I was the bigger man, and instead of name-calling I broke both his arms as he wished, and sprinted off.

Oh! You’re wondering why I'm telling you all this. I am surprised you haven’t figured it out! Well it has been three days since the last time I was made a meal-of. After five-hundred years of the same old shit, different day, I’ve decided to try a different approach. Charm, trickery, and strength fail me way too often. So I was hoping that in hearing a little bit, or rather a lotta bit, about me and my struggles, you may have some pity and sympathy for me, and help me out. I don’t really feel like browsing for lovers interested in vampire-play, or for looking for someone to fool, or for threatening someone’s family just to get them to drink me in. I just want someone for once to know my pain and to come to me, eagerly awaiting a sip of the sanguine spirit of the sorrowful.

I’m not telling you to go start a fight with one, but a smart enough human can make themselves safe from vampires without much trouble.

There are other benefits that we share, but difference is what makes distinction, right? Vampires need blood to survive. They can eat food, and it helps, but they all need to feed on blood eventually. Again, let me dispel you some illusions—most of them never hunt humans. It’s too dangerous. The police are good enough to catch any but the most careful vampire, and now that they’re in the open, it’s pretty easy for them to figure out what they’re looking for when they find a desiccated corpse. Most of the vampire population survives on animals. Fun fact, about a quarter of the owners of those big cattle farms and things like that are vampires. They drink their fill, sell the extra to other vampires, and sell the meat to you guys. Pretty smart, actually.

It’s here where the difference comes in. What I am doesn’t really have a name. I’ve met all of five people like me in my life, and that’s significantly longer than a normal human lifespan. We’re tied to blood, like the vampires are, but we run backwards. Instead of needing to ingest blood, we need others to ingest our own. There’s some kind of sympathetic connection that I don’t understand at work; when someone drinks our blood, even just a little, we get stronger. From talking to vampires, it’s not the same way they feel when they feed. For us, it’s more like being able to take a breath after holding it for a really long time. 

For a while, being around someone that has drunk my blood makes me feel more awake, more light on my feet, more, well, everything. Just better, I guess. Every breath is easier and all those aches and pains that come with being alive go away (yes, we get those too, even vampires). It helps that the person I’ve ‘fed’ on smells great to me after the deed is done. That benefit goes both ways, according to my unwary companions. It’s not uncommon for my victim and I to find a way to get alone and spend a little intimate time together. Sometimes I wonder if I’m a date rapist. Maybe I am, but no one has ever seemed to regret their time with me. I do my best to make it worth their while. It’s not like they can catch any diseases from me. 

This brings me to the two ways I can feed. The first is, obviously, to sneak a drop into a drink and get someone to ingest it without knowing. It tastes horrible to everyone, but especially to vampires—yes, I thought of this loophole before and explored it as an option, but there isn’t a vampire alive that’s willing to feed on me. Too bad. Symbiosis sounds like fun. So, instead, I drip a drop in some unsuspecting young person’s drink, pretend to be sympathetic when it tastes like garbage, and wait for things to kick off. It doesn’t usually take long.

The other option is less clear. I donate blood regularly. This might seem odd to you, considering that I already need to give up some of my precious blood to survive. How foolish is it for me to dump huge quantities away like that? Well, first of all, have the altruistic reason. We’re all universal donors. Kind of have to be, unless our blood is supposed to be poison. I’m not sure how our ability came to be, but we live off of the result of another living thing ingesting our blood. If it killed them, it wouldn’t work very well. I guess it’s different when they take it in through the stomach, so maybe that doesn’t matter and it’s just a quirk of our biology. 

You might think that we follow our blood around and feed off of the person they donate it to. I’ve done that before, but it’s not worth the headache. The logistics are impossible, and the blood sits around longer than you’d like to think. When our blood is finally injected directly into another person’s bloodstream, the effect is still there, but it’s diminished. Something about the digestion is important, it seems. Either way, even though we can’t really feed, it works out for everyone. A little more universally viable blood that can go into any patient isn’t bad, right? And no, there’s no contamination that stops them from using it. In a human, it’s basically normal blood that produces a very specific reaction. It’s never been a problem.

So if the digestion is important, I hear you asking, why does it help me to donate blood if I can’t feed on the people to whom it is given? The more selfish reason is that forcing my body to make more blood, something it’s excellent at, shifts our metabolism to be more reliant on regular food for a while. It helps us conserve whatever we’ve taken from our last real feeding. Sometimes, we can even feel normal again after a long time without an encounter if we bleed enough. I once donated four pints in one month under different names. Orange juice and sugar cookies never tasted so good. The guy I fed on the week after the last donation never smelled so good, either.

If anyone reading this is thinking, ‘Wow, I wouldn’t mind drinking a little blood now and again if I got great sex with an attractive partner.’ (I am, in case you’re wondering. That’s one of the benefits we share with vampires. We’re all hot.) Here’s the problem. Imagine that someone handed you a bouquet of roses and you took a whiff and it was the most beautiful scent that you ever smelled. You’ve smelled roses before, but these are far and beyond anything you’ve ever experienced. They must have been grown in a garden made of rainbows by a lady with literally green thumbs who gives them only water melted from the purest glacier on Earth for them to smell as they do, you suppose. Imagine that, for as long as it lasted, you wanted to do nothing but breathe in that aroma. Now imagine that scent souring in your nostrils. It’s the same way roses have always smelled to everyone else, but by inexorable comparison to the pure bliss that came before, it is abhorrent. That’s what happens. 

If I stay beyond the limit of the power of my blood, my partner, victim, whatever, notices the change. Breathing anywhere near me is not just unpleasant, it’s laborious. It takes effort to resist it and they have to get away from me. The worst part of it is that the odor makes them completely reevaluate me on a dime. They look at me and see beauty, but begin to wonder if it is really as perfect as they thought it was. They hear me speak and question whether their memory of my voice is more invention than description. Every part of me is called into question, even though none of that other stuff changed. It’s not fun for me to go through, either.

This is why I wander. This is why I spread my feeding around and limit it to as few as I can. I just wanted to explain myself to someone, to something, so I wrote this down and maybe someone somewhere will read it and understand us a little bit better. I know that this life isn’t necessarily moral, since I am doing things to people without their knowledge. It doesn’t help that the result of that is usually sex that’s basically under the influence of a drug. It’s kind of rapey, I’m willing to admit that. Maybe I should try harder to avoid that, but I don’t know where I would even begin. I’ve done it to people that staunchly believed their sexuality did not allow me to be a partner, but it didn’t stop them once they got a whiff.

Hey, wait a minute. What if I found someone that couldn’t smell me? That might work. I’d have to control myself, but I probably could. It’s not like I’ve never abstained before. Or, maybe, I could seduce them anyway. I’m not very practiced at actually convincing someone to have sex, but maybe I could do it. Even if I couldn’t, I trust myself to stay in control. I’ll have to try this. It might be better to try for the seduction before the feeding, now I think about it. But this could work. I’m excited.

Wait another minute, though. If they couldn’t smell me, then they wouldn’t want to avoid me afterward, either. Right? Did I just figure this out?! This might be a big deal. I need to find some people that can’t smell anything! Do these people have support groups? I’ll start one if I have to! Thanks, internet!

"[WP] You're a ""reverse vampire"". In order to survive, you need to get people to drink your blood.",Seaweed-Sandwich,"There comes a point in a man’s life, when he has been put on the hiring blacklist of every McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Burger King, and even Taco Bell in the North American region, that he must swallow his pride and apply for a job at Applebee’s.

I sat in a fiberboard booth across from a sturdy flat-faced woman who moved her lips as she read the words on my resume.

“Well… you certainly have a lot of experience,” she said. She began to suck her teeth. 

The other shoe was going to drop. I could see the tension rising in her forehead.

“But it seems like you’re a bit of a job-hopper.”

I heard this at every interview. It had weighed on me. I couldn’t take the lying anymore. I wanted to tell the truth, just this once. At least someone would know my story. Someone would remember me after the needs of my blood dissolved my bones into dust.

“I don’t hop,” I said, “I get fired.”

Her eyes widened at me.

“There wasn’t enough room on the form to list places where I’d been fired from,” I explained, “So I’ve attached *this* as an addendum.” I set a copy of the yellow pages on the table, with hundreds of entries outlined in pink highlighter.

“You see,” I said, “I am a reverse vampire. In order to survive, I must get people to drink my blood. As you can imagine—my employers often take umbrage. For centuries I have skated from job to job, trying to—”

She interrupted. “Why don’t you just make Bloody Mary’s?”

My jaw dropped.

She smiled at me. “Or download tinder, and make a little arrangement with a vampire?” She winked.

I couldn’t believe her words.

“You brilliant, brilliant woman,” I said, “I take back everything bad I’ve ever said about Applebee’s. God bless you people for working at this place.”

She raised an eyebrow. “I’m just working here to pay for my master’s in marine biology,” she said.

“I never would have guessed,” I stammered, “I mean… your appearance. You just don’t look…. Smart.”

She frowned.

I stood up to leave.

“Thank you so much,” I said, “You’ve saved me from a very painful death.” I walked out the door, ready to go to bartending school, download tinder, and begin my new lease on life.

“Wait! Wait!” she yelled, clumsily pushing through the two sets of double doors to run after me into the parking lot. “Do you still want the job? Please?”

""Craig, do you have the expense reports ready yet?"" ""Yes, Ms. Tabatha, one moment!"" When your boss is a bitch, you don't say much. When she's some retired super-badass with an eye for fashion design, you agree with her. It's just the way the word works. 

""Craig, you were supposed to have these for me an hour ago. I can't buy what I want if I don't have a budget."" 

""Yes, ma'am. Sorry ma’am."" I thought working for Hercules Industries was going to to be fun. I was twenty-four. Just out of University, and drunk off my ass. I honestly didn't think putting up with super-attitude was going to be what got me the job. But here I am, 2 years later after going to an interview drunk. 

""CRAIG! Why are my applications four days behind? I need people to do my job, and people aren't showing up!"" boomed from down he hallway. If Tabatha was terrifying, than the Major was pure nightmare fuel. Well, my nightmares. He fought in some conflict I don't really understand and now his job is candidate approval. 

""Craig! I need my applicants now! I need to find fresh talent, and I need you to make sure that it gets to my desk! AM. I. UNDERSTOOD?"" 

""Yes, Major Carlisle!"" I barked out. 

""Out-freaking-standing!"" he hissed. I went back to my office. Now, Hercules Industries wasn't a dream job, but man did I make bank. I had a nice corner office, some liberty with decorating, and I was even allowed to have my own mini-fridge behind my desk. Superhero Selection and Support was not a bad job. And not all of my bosses were jerks. There was the manager of Ability Design. Right on cue there was a knock on my door. 

""Hey, Craig! Old buddy, old- old pal. I need a favor."" Nathaniel slowly peeked his head into my office but quickly took a seat in front of me. 

""Hi Mr. Nathaniel. What's up?"" ""Well, err, you see I was working late last night and, I'm such a schutch, I spilled coffee all over my tablet charger. I tried to fix it, but I, err, I-"" I cut him off, ""Do we need a new charger?"" 

""Yes!"" He paused, ""No, not- not quite. Err, I actually broke a few- a few tablets and, err, I'll take it out of my pay but, err-"" 

I held up my hand, ""It's okay Nate. Breathe slowly for me."" I could tell by the faint blue glow in his eyes he had been trying out some new ability enhancer. I've learned that when he's like this just to be patient.

Nathaniel took a gulp of air and started back up, ""I need six new tablets. Quad processors if the budget allows. Do you think that, err, could happen?"" 

I thumbed through the first stack of papers I could reach for, eyeing them closely like it actually mattered, ""Nate I think we can manage that this quarter."" I watched his eyes glow a little brighter, 

""Oh thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!"" 

""Oof,"" I gasped Nathaniel hugged me across the desk. 

""Thank you, Craig! You're a life saver!"" He dashed out of the room as fast as he came in. I sighed and let a smile slip. Looking over the piles of paper on my desk I realized I would have to find $2400 to pay for his mistake. With the first three out of the way, that left only one department, Augmentation and Adaptation. I chewed my lip, looking at the clock to see it was only 9:15 and I hadn't heard from her yet. 

Her in this case, was Doctor Fleuristal. She handles the actual bestowing of the powers, a thirty-something year old, real-life mad scientist. She was different than Tabatha in that she wasn't intimidating scary, she was I-can-take-you-apart-and-put-you-back-together scary. I knew this had to happen. I picked up my phone and dialed her number. 

It rang. It rang again. And again. 

""Chop shop, T.J. speakin'!"" I smiled. T.J. was Dr. Fleuristal's chief nurse, and a super easy guy to talk to. 

""Morning T.J. It's Craig from central administration. I was wondering if the Doc had any paperwork she wanted me to do."" 

""Hold on, big guy. Let me check."" I could hear him cover the phone with his hand, ""Hey Doc! It's that kid from upstairs. Yeah, the new-ish guy. You got any paperwork for him? Okay, let me tell him."" He was talking to me again, ""She'll be right there."" 

I shuddered while I waited for her to pick up. And then she did. ""Hello, Mr. Sanchez, "" I could hear the smile in her voice, ""What can I do for you?"" I paused for a moment. I guess I should say I thought Dr. Fleuristal was also cute. 

Like, I-can't-talk-to-her-right cute. 

""Good morning Dr. Flueristal-"" 

""You can call me Shakeria, "" she interrupted, ""We're equals in this company."" 

I tried again, ""Right. Good morning, Shakeria. I was wondering if you needed me to do anything for you this morning?"" There was a pause for a moment. 

""Maybe just keep Tabitha off your back, "" she laughed a little, ""No, I'm good. You ordered everything for me last week."" 

""Well, do you need any invoices filed, consents witnessed, any patents cross-checked again?"" ""No, I'm fine right now. But there is one thing, actually."" 

I chewed my lip again, ""What's that?"" 

""I have a dinner reservation for two at six tonight and I don't have anyone to go with me. Would you like to go."" 

""YES!"" I blurted. Like an idiot. I can fix that, right? 

""I mean, I think I can help you with that."" 

""Good, you don't need to dress fancy, and I promise, no work stuff."" 

""Awesome, I'll see you then."" 

I hung up the phone and stared at the forms and folders that stood between me and a date with my workplace crush. 

""Let's do this!"" I whispered to myself. 

Then there was another knock at my door. 

A man in a pinstripe suit walked in, ""Good morning, I'm Jeff from accounting at the East office, and I was wondering if we could hammer out some budget details?"" 

This was going to be a long day.

"[WP] Your life is rewinded to your childhood, yet you retain all of the knowledge and wisdom you've learned in life. You get to start over. This time, you won't screw it up.",rosetta_-_stoned,"And just like that, I'm back. 

Back into the body I once wore thirty years ago, except this time I wear a mind that's weathered over three decades of thinking.

It's a strange feeling, knowing that I'm the smartest nine year old on the face of the planet. The possibilities are endless. With this gift I was given, I can literally take my life in whatever direction I want and more than likely succeed. 

And yet, for some reason, I still lack the confidence I was never able to possess in the life that was just rewinded. 

Shit. I was hoping that was one thing that wouldn't be retained. Sure, I'm a nine year old with a Master's degree of knowledge under my belt, but I'm also a nine year old that tried to commit suicide right around nine years ago, too. I was always a smart person, anyway. So that knowledge and wisdom wasn't really what I need to start all over again. It's motivation. Or confidence. Or something like that. 

Now I'm just coasting through life trying to come up with some answers. Obviously, school is a waste of time. I feel like I should just be the damn teacher. God, she's stupid. I try to have fun with my friends and enjoy being a kid again, but I just can't get into it for some reason. I think it's because my troubles from my rewinded life are still with me, and my suicide attempt still haunts me everyday. Shit. Well, I've always tried to be a glass half full guy. And my tenth birthday is coming up. So I've got that to look forward to. 

_____________

My mom got a clown to come for my party. Doesn't she know that in 2016 a bunch of these creepy fucking clowns show up below streetlights in random neighborhoods and terrorize people like me? Shit. This whole re-winding thing still isn't doing anything for me. I just wanna be 41 again. At least then, I can be miserable in my apartment instead of in my mom and dad's house. 

That's when it hits me. Today just isn't my tenth birthday. It's also the ten year anniversary of the day I tried to kill myself. It hits me like a brick. I have to sit down as my mind is bombarded with flashbacks, memories, and most importantly of all, answers. 

Everything is clear now. I understand why my life was rewinded. It was so I could experience this moment, understand that I was a person worth living after all, and realize how much of a blessing life really is. Confidence floods my body. Determination fills my mind. A smile cracks across my face. This time, I won't screw it up.

I hug him, tighter than I have ever done before. He hugs me too, and I can feel his desperation, his need to stop me, and I can’t help but start to cry. He loves me so much, and all I have to offer him are broken pieces.

But it’s far away of what I’m feeling right now.

“Hey princess,” says with a soft voice. “Princess, why are you awake? Want me to read you a book?” a soft and short gust of air blows the hair off my face. I remember that I was laughing the first time, but I didn’t know it then. Soft fingers touch my face, slowly making its way down to my neck where the tickles happen. But I can’t laugh, not anymore, not without Damian, or, at least, not yet. “What happens, princess?” asks, leaning over me. And it’s when I see that face again, so close to mine, that I can muster the force to scream.

I take a step back before it connects, and say, ""not here, you idiot. The teacher will be back in a minute. We do it at recess, behind the building."" He nods, all three of his chins wobbling. I had accounted for the incapacity to think about consequences before my return to the past. Now that I'm thinking with the head of a kid, I realize just how hard it is for kids to think about that kind of stuff. As an adult, I didn't even realize how much it was important to think about this stuff. Even despite my specific circumstances, the child in me does not have the ability to conceptualize the connection between past, present, and future.

The idiot had grabbed my hand after my first feint. He was as tough and smart as the bricks our school was built from. I kneed him in the stomach, then broke his hold. You see, the funny thing about that kind of grab is that if you pull at the thumb, you're leveraging your entire arm strength against a finger. My opponent was stronger than me, but so long as I gave him mo opportunity to use his strength, that meant squat. The neanderthal swung a meaty  fist at me, which I ducked. We were both still too small for my wiry frame to be much advantage, but I could definitely use my shortness. I grabbed his legs, and pulled him to the floor. I underestimated how fast he could get up, and before I could get on him, he sat up and pushed me back. I got to my feet as fast as he did, and he sent a jab at me. I raised my hand to deflect it, but I wasn't used to this form, and let it hit me head on. Faster than I thought he could be, he hit me again, his time with more power, until he was behind me. And I was behind him. ""The idiot gave me his back,"" I muttered. Fast as lighting, I turned around, and jumped on the guy. ""Get off of me,"" he bellowed. ""Not a chance,"" I screamed in a higher pitched voice than I'd like. I punched him in the head again and again, while he was unable to do anythiung to me. The teacher rushed to us, having heard Marcus' yelling, and pulled us apart. His face was significantly bloodier than mine, and I was beaming.

I was... Rather, I am 17. Somehow I had been sent back to the last day of my childhood. As I stared bleary eyed at the mess of scruffy hair and pale skin in the mirror, I tried to mentally rewind. What had I done today? Where could I go from here? I could change my final grades and get into the degree course I always dreamed of. I could get that job in the Lab rather than bein the janitor mopping up their failed experiments. I could prevent every bad thing that happened to me...

Or I could make it worse...

By getting onto that course instead of my back up, I'd never meet the friends that had helped me back up after I lost my parents.

By getting that job, I'd not have been there to save Jerry's ass when he fell asleep on the job. The whole building would have gone up in smoke.

If I knowingly changed the future, Id be plunging into a world of unknowns all over again...

If I didn't end up with Jessica... I'd never lose her, or the kids... but those years we spent together before it all went sour would be gone too.

Maybe it would be easier if I didn't do anything.

Or maybe I shouldn't even see my 18th a second time.",Darius_Blake
"[WP] Your life is rewinded to your childhood, yet you retain all of the knowledge and wisdom you've learned in life. You get to start over. This time, you won't screw it up.",rosetta_-_stoned,"The trouble with a limited precognitive ability is that it is limited, and perhaps useless. I saw one possible life, and it was already redundant when I started to write my plans.

Was I a time traveller, or just a kid with precog? Heh. 'just'. Like that's no big deal.

I wrote on reams of paper, before my dad finally got me on the old Hewlett-Packard. While my hands were smaller and my dexterity drained, I adapted, and was soon touch typing.

.bat file text adventure games. Stories. Half-remembered tales of news that may never occur. I wrote of the relationships I would have and the enemies I would face. I warned the internet of 9/11, and half remembered murders in the 90s were forewarned.

Outside of my immediate vicinity though, all my attempts to alter time failed. I could change my own life, but I simply didn't have the reach, the potential, to prevent disasters.

I had foreknowledge, but I was still but a uselessly smart toddler who quickly became a depressed preteen.

I advanced in education rapidly. Funny thing: doing past tests to revise for exams means that if you time travel you subconsciously know the simpler answers anyway. Know them by rote.

Was actually a bit sad about that time. Girls I had crushes on in previous lives were hard to deal with, as I could see what Original!Me saw in them (knowing what they would look like as adults did not help) but I was mentally 35 at age 10. Pedophillia was undesired.

Old friends in Timeline1 who were of no use to me were discarded in Timeline2. Enemies avoided or neutralised with a tough nature.

Primary school passed in a flurry. I was bookish, a 'nerd', I could not prevent that happening again, but unlike the rest of these children, I had a goal. I was fit. I could play rugby, though I am not fond of the game. I could fake my way into being 'normal', this time.

And then I was pushed up a year into secondary school.

And that's when I realised that most of my machinations were to fail.

I had planned to prey upon a friend I made in secondary school's crush on me to establish a close romantic relationship. I would be able to prevent her commiting suicide at 25.

Being in the higher year group would cause problems.

But I progressed. Was flirted with in french class. Got into a fight with the ginger kid from the council estate (wait that happened in the original timeline too, seriously?). Met a future friend's future brief girlfriend, and remembered how sad he was about her moving to a different school. 

Shit grouped together for physics. Ok. Right. 

I aced more tests. I was good up until GCSE exams. A levels, in my original timeline, I failed hard. 

Asked to go hang out with the skaters. 

Did so, stunning even myself. 

Tried pot.

Giggled.

At some point got a tattoo.

*I would never have done this in Timeline 1*

2nd year starts and I immediately find my timeline1 friends. Befriend them. Spooky timeline-displaced-ex-girlfriend-not-sexual is convinced she knows me.

I end up spilling the beans. She doesn't know her future, but gets glimpses. So I guess her internet-derived pseudo-Wiccan rituals actually got her something.

I get suspended for having purple dyed hair in a drunken bender on the last day.

Year 3. Got myself a mobile phone. Wrote a letter to Apple, detailing the iPod. Scroll wheel and LCD screen, come to papa!

End up in a fight. 

""Why are you talking to my girlfriend, freak?""

""It was regarding matters of great import, buffoon!""

Karate needs muscle memory. Sprained myself. At least in this timeline I kicked Richard's ass.

He'd hurt someone I was friends with in original timeline.

I knew a lot of assholes in timeline1.

Year 4. I'm failing. Exams going badly. ""you had such potential"".

Possibly falling for my currently blonde spooky sidekick. Weird, in previous timeline she was lesbian around now, hooked up with someone year below her.

Trying to keep things professional. I'm good with computers and plans, she... Is just someone who believes me.

Year 5. Year goes by quick. Do go to the end of year dance, alone, again. Thankfully a year above original, do not want that awkward fiasco again.

Realised I haven't socialised with anyone in my year. end up curled up behind a bush, sipping my bottle of vodka.

Parents do an intervention. FuckitI got shit to do youre not the boss of m-

Year 6. Picked artsy and IT subjects. People have left, is now sixth form. I can draw this time, maybe out of practice. I wish I picked English. I miss the teacher, weirdly.

I'm invited as the guest for my sidekick's end of year dance. I dance only for the Timewarp. Keep it professional.

I start realising my future knowledge is fizzling out. A few years from now I go to university, and that disaster happens.


Final year of sixth form. Ended up being led into doing a programming challenge.

Didn't win, but my little platform game, 'Temporal' was noticed. This is before 'indie game development' had   a name. Got a paragraph in the local paper.

Cutting back on the drinking. Making stories again. 

Deleted bebo account, started on facebook.

Sidekick decides she knows little about me but I know everything about her original self. Unfair, apparently.

Shouting. I leave her be. She was useless, just a reminder of a timeline lost.

I get angry.

I fail my exams. Worse than original timeline. Something's broken and I end up lost.

Got a job. Same job as I had in original timeline except my predecessor hadn't fucked up the files and I was a lot younger.

Realise I had failed time travel.

Realised that at least I gained a few extra years of a sad lonely existence.

Realised that it was all for nothing.

It was a trite, silly thing to say, but he couldn't help but listen when that face spoke. 

A wave of fire flashed into the air, brimming across the horizon. The ships bearing down across the darkening sky disappeared without a sound and a rain of ash floated towards the earth. 

""I am the bearer of Flame, Count Grecia of Sturmholt. Will you join my cause?"" 

The earth trembled around him as he thought. It had been so long since anyone had approached his desert, so very long since anyone had thought to draw near. 

He lay safely inside his golem of sand, watching a white robed woman cross into his domain from the hills. Waters trickled across the ashen grounds, drawing a black tide in her wake to suffocate the few monsters who had managed to land their ships. 

She was powerful, the bearer of Waves, no doubt. Water and fire, both bearers working in tandem and here at his tiny domain so suddenly. 

""I don't trust you."" he allowed the golem to murmur in a sigh of shifting sands and grinding sands, ""Someone's sent you to kill me. I don't want to be hurt. Go away."" 

Those eyes turned on him, seeming to bore through his golem's layers. He flinched within his shield, almost wishing to step away. 

But this was his domain, the one place he dared to call home. 

The Flame stepped closer, flames floating hypnotically in his wake. He felt the sand beneath the Count's sandled feet glass upon contact. He steadied himself, holding on to the sensation of earth. 

""Jura."" the Count said. He froze. ""That was your name, wasn't it? Before you became the bearer of Stone. Jura, the slaveknight of the Iron Crown?"" 

""Go away."" his golem hissed with more confidence than he felt, ""I will hurt you if you hurt me.""

""Did it not hurt you to be imprisoned like a dog by your master? Did it not hurt to be used as a tool for war?"" 

He flinched within his self-made tomb, breathing sand and rust. ""I...don't want to fight."" 

Another wave of ships loomed in the sky. The Count allowed their presence for a moment, turning to watch the explosions as his companion acted to send tendrils of ashen water hurtling into the sky.

""I want to stop all fighting."" the Count told him, ""For you. For everyone. With my Flame, I have done much for this cause. With the aid of Waves, I have done even more. However-""

Two bearers of elements, holding off an entire army together. Enemy troops pressing against his deadly desert almost daring to trickle in as he withdrew his senses to lie low in the safe embrace of the earth. 

""-I am opposed by the bearer of Winds."" 

He allowed his golem a hiss, ""Two bearers of elements cannot overcome another together?"" 

Was this some kind of threat? Some warning not to seek protection with the Wind? Like he needed to know it would be so easy for them to turn their combined power on him. 

""She has warped the element she bears with the aid of monstrous demons from the sky."" the Count told him, ""Even as I speak the kingdoms are besieged and her monsters hurt and kill."" 

The Count smiled at him. 

""Jura, you who fled the Iron Crown in an attempt to save his own village, I have heard much about you."" he continued, ""I have taken leave from my efforts to hold off the Winds because I believe that you are someone who still cares about those who cannot fight for themselves."" 

He shivered. The golem lurched slightly around him as his control briefly fled, ""I failed. I couldn't save them. I can't help you."" 

This was it. He braced himself, waiting for the fire which would melt his earth and the water which would loosen his control. 

""You have lost much."" 

The bearer of Waves spoke. Her voice was soft and thin and as she turned his golem could see the thick scar that ran along her throat.

""I have lost much too. But the Count protects me and provides for me. The Count has given me something to believe in."" 

She walked past the Count, loose white robes flitting in the wind. She rested a slim, dark hand against the surface of his golem. 

""You can atone for your failure, like I have."" she whispered. Her voice crackled unevenly, ""Don't you feel the earth calling you to act? To protect those who still live?"" 

""Atonement...?"" 

He hadn't considered that before. Something in his heart leapt at the word, almost too eagerly. He looked to the bearer of Flame again and found himself transfixed. 

It was some kind of hypnotism after all, he realized. There was a pattern in the way the flames danced that was etching the Count's words into his soul. 

But he didn't care about that anymore. It felt so right. 

""I would like to atone."" the golem's hiss hid his stutter. His thoughts churned inside him, making him tremble. ""I want..."" he couldn't say it, ""...to atone."" 

The Count smiled again, deeper and sharper. 

""I will grant you atonement if you join my cause. By any means necessary."" ",driftea
"[WP] You decide to join a gang, the requirement to getting in is mugging someone. You unknowingly try to stick up a professional fighter.",AwesomeDocHacksaw,"This was so wrong. Nothing about this felt right. 

A wind blew, and the chill made me put my hoodie up. I glanced up at the sky.

This wasn't how my parents raised me. 

But I needed to do this. It was the only way that I could walk safely through my own neighborhood without getting chased or becoming a bully's lunch money supplier or personal punching bag. 

Ever since I started talking to Draco and his gang, I noticed that people stopped messing with me and started showing me more respect. Girls that were way out of my league began staring at me longer, and smiling shyly whenever I looked back. Guys, double my size, would see me and take a step toward me with smug smiles - until one of their friends would grab them by the air and whisper who I hung with in their ears. Then the smiles would drop and the fear would fill up their eyes.

For the first time in my life, I felt...powerful. 

But this feeling was only temporary; fleeting. When one of Draco's people got busted by the cops and the gang had to lay-low, everyone started messing with me again. Girls went back to ignoring me. People stopped trying to win my favors or trying get in my good graces. I didn't like that. I needed that powerful feeling always.

And the only way to do it -I knew- was to join the gang. 

The day I told Draco of my decision, he actually seemed disappointed. And I was surprised that he didn't immediately accept me, especially considering that he had been attempting to get me to join the gang for the past two years. 

""Are you sure this is something you certainly want to do?"" he asked. 

""Yes.""

""Why?"" he pressed.

I didn't answer. 

His eyes narrowed. ""Is someone harassing you?""

""No! I just...want to join...that's all..."" I stated weakly.

He stared at me for an eternity. I tried to hold eye contact, but his gaze was too intense. Finally, he settled back in his chair. 

""Fine,"" he said, simply.

I blinked. ""So that's it? I'm in?""

""No.""

My face fell.

""First, my men here are going to beat you down for the first part of the initiation. Then for the second part, you need to mug someone - anyone. And then, you'll be part of the gang. But once you go through the first part of the initiation, there's no turning back. So I ask you...are you sure this is your final decision.""

Without hesitation, I nodded. Draco nodded back. And then the first hit knocked me unconscious. 

I still felt the bruises as my target strolled past me. I didn't know the guy at all. He was just there and no one else was. Plus, he looked like an easy person to mug. 

I descended on him with my knife drawn. All I planned to do was stick it in his gut and demand whatever he had. 

But all I found myself mugging was wind as the guy disappeared into thin air. I looked up just in time to see the dirt on the bottom of his shoes, as his foot connected with my face and sent me sprawling to the floor. 

My knife clattered a few feet away. I recovered quickly and dove for it, but the guy was already calmly walking away. I picked up the knife and ran at him, but again, I found myself swiping at air as the man bent over and stuck a leg out into my groin.


All the air left me as I grabbed myself and collapsed to the ground, done for good. My vision blurred and all I saw was the man, calmly walking away, before darkness swallowed up my sight and I fell into unconsciousness.",MaximumMillions

"[WP] A 10 year old kid sends a prank letter to NASA, entailing that the secret to FTL is farts. The engineers at NASA take it seriously.",Mattersofdarkness,"“Dave. It’s Dave… M-my name…”

Dave—the mailroom tech. Entry-level white-collar worker with little respect in one of the nation’s largest and most respected agencies. With respect for the organization, however, did not come respect for those that kept the organization running with menial tasks and minimum-wage labor. Dave was *Dave,* not Derrin, not Darcy; just *Dave.*

Hundreds of thousands of notes, letters, invoices, bills, and payments touched his hands in the many years he worked there. Those very same were hand-delivered via a sorting card by none other than Dave. He took his job seriously, for he knew the letter he held in his hands could mean the difference between reaching the moon and falling among the stars. He may not have been in a position of power in the corporate structure, but Dave begged to differ.

As every day, the squeaking wheels of his failing cart signaled the start of the workday for many engineers working toward the ever out-of-reach goal of space travel. “John,” Dave called, tossing mail into the man’s bin beside his desk.

“Hey, Dick!” the man called in response, quickly filing through the pile as Dave continued onward.

“…I-It’s Dave,” he muttered into his collar, rifling for the next delivery.

“Don!” another called. “Daniel! Drake! Dylan!”

“Dave, Nancy. My… my name… It’s Dave…”

Hundreds of employees received their mail for the morning, and each envelope received its metaphorical stamp of approval from the underappreciated clerk named Dave. As he hands off his final stack of mail and steps away, ready to prepare for his lunch, Carl quickly shoots up from his desk.

“D-D…Drew! Come… come back here!” Carl calls out, furiously waving toward the man with the cart. Quietly, the clerk approaches him, picking at a scabbed paper cut between his fingers. “Where… where did you find this, Drew?”

“Dave,” he mutters to him.

“Dean, where did you get this letter?” Carl shoved the envelope in his face, the letter trembling in his hand. “D-do you know what this means, Dean? Somebody call Walter! Get Walter down here right now!” His hands rushed to the clunky phone cornered on his desk, dialing numbers no human could comprehend.

Silently, Dave stood and watched. Every day he watched yet another engineer make an incredible discovery. Every day, he watched those discoveries, those theories, fall apart at the seams. Every day, Dave took pride in the letter that sparked the whole scenario, knowing it was sweet justice for the slander against his name. But it was not every day that big-man Walter was called to the cube farm. No—Walter never graced the cube farm with his presence.

Walter drove from his big house on the hills and stomped his way through the half-walled cubicles, finding Carl in a panic. Immediately, the engineer shoves Dave out of his way. “Look at this, Walt.”

“Mr. Jefferson,” he sternly corrects his underling. “What is this madness, hm? Why do I have to waste my time at this office, eh?”

“Look!” Carl insisted, shaking the letter before him. “Some… some kid says he’s discovered the secret to FTL.” His words crumbled as they rolled from his tongue. Nothing could contain the excitement and fear that melded with each word. “It’s… It’s unprecedented, Walt.”

The big boss took the letter in his hands. Without raising an eye, he questioned, “Who’s this kid?”

“Dave, sir.” Another quiet response.

“Dax, here, delivered the letter,” Carl chimed in. “I-I-I… I think it’s the real deal, Walt. We gotta do something about this!”

Dave spent little time on the second, third, and fourth floors. Most of his mornings, afternoons, and some nights were spent in the sorting room. Though during deliveries, he was authorized to traverse the building, he knew very little about the ongoings of the upper floors. His lips twitched in anticipation—for once he felt recognized for his work, and hoped his involvement would result in a bonus of sorts.

“…By God,” Walter breathed, reading the letter through. “Casey!” he called to his assistant. “Get Patrick down here! He’s got to have a look at this!”

“Right away, sir,” Casey rushed, grasping a phone on a nearby desk.

Walter slapped his hand against Dave’s shoulder and smiled a toothy grin behind his mustache. “You done good, Dan. Come with me.”

“Dave, sir… It’s… Dave…”

Dave met with many men within the organization. Man after man, he tailed after Walter, then Patrick, down to Paul, who ran the joint. As the head of the organization held the letter in his hands, his eyes twitched and his knees failed him.

“Call the president!” Paul demanded. “Someone get the President of the United States on the phone! We’ve gotta do something about this! This… this is groundbreaking!” He collected his bearings and rushed around the room, sticking his nose in Jeffrey’s face. His skin was covered in the sweat of anticipation. “Who wrote this letter, Jeff? Was it you?” He soon faced Dave, hoping the answer was just out of reach.

Dave swallowed the lump in his throat. “I delivered it, sir.”

Paul coughed. He wanted more answer than Dave could provide. “What’s your name, boy?”

“D-Dave, sir.”

Paul chewed on the name. “Happy to have you here, Dilbert. Guess who you’re gonna meet today?” The old man threw an arm over Dave’s shoulders, turned toward the large windows behind his desk, and grinned madly. “The President of the God dammed United States, Dusty. You’re gonna meet the President.”

It wasn’t long before the man, himself, was flown in from DC. Men in clean, fitting black suits marched up the stairs, precious cargo in their midst. When NASA had a discovery large enough to command an audience of the President, there was no fooling around. They called, and he appeared.
“What’s the big deal, boys?”

Dave thought the day could not get any better when he met the head of the organization. But to have Nixon standing before him… He felt faint and wished to leave. The President stepped into the room and faced each of them, standing lastly before Dave. He extended a hand, and without a smile, asked his name. “Dave, Mr. President, sir. My name is Dave.”

The President nodded, turned on his heels, and faced Paul. “What’s the fuss, eh? What’s all this talk about a letter I’ve got to read right this second?”

“S-Sir, we’ve… We received a letter… I-it details the discovery of faster-than-light travel. This… this could be something for the record books, Mr. President. H-Have a read, sir; see for yourself.”

Nixon made himself quite at home at Paul’s desk. He shoved the decorations aside and took the letter in his hands. The stoic man cracked a smile not two paragraphs in. “…You’re kidding, Paul. You can’t be serious.”

“Absolutely serious, sir. This could change everything. We… we could get to the moon a hell of a lot faster with this. I-I-I… I mean, it’s going to take some extra planning. We’re going to need to hire more engineers to implement this. Think about it, sir; instead of three or four days… we could be on the surface of the moon before you could even think about what you want for lunch.”

With a heavy sigh, Nixon set the letter on the desk. “…Farts, Paul. This letter… is about farts. Flatulence. You *honestly* want me to believe you believe this pile of literary crap?” He scratched at his jaw, his eyes staring into the distance before catching the clerk’s. Quickly, Nixon sat forward and snapped his fingers. “…Y-You. Boy. What’s your name?”

“Dave.”

“Derrick. Why are you here? Did you write this letter? Are you the reason I’m wasting my time?”

“…Dave, sir…”

Frustrated, Nixon rose from the chair and charged for Paul, ready to fire. “Do you honestly believe that *farts* are the secret to travelling faster than the speed of light? Have you ever sat on your couch, let one rip, and ended up in China? Hm? Is any of this making sense to you?”

“Dave,” the clerk spoke up again. “My name is Dave, Mr. President.”

For a moment, Nixon laid eyes on him, but returned to his fury. “You’re telling me that I wasted hours flying down here so you could tell me the solution to all of our problems is *FARTS?!*”

“MY NAME IS DAVE!” the clerk screamed, catching the attention of the agents outside the office. They quickly scrambled in to observe the commotion. “Of… of all people, YOU. I thought *YOU* would remember my name. My. Name. Is. *DAVE!*”

Quickly coming unglued from his quiet, undisturbed life, Dave rushed one of the agents and released his revolver from its holsters and swung it wildly around the room. “WHAT’S MY NAME?!”

Wide-eyed and concerned, Paul and Nixon stood speechless with their hands in the air. The remaining armed agents drew their weapons and waited for his next move.

“SAY IT, PAUL. SAY MY NAME.”

Paul stuttered and stammered. “D-Dave! It’s Dave!”

“You!” Dave called again, the revolver pointed at the President. The agents tightened their grips and stepped one foot closer.

Nixon nodded, but calmly responded. “You know your name, boy.” Furious, Dave cocked his weapon. Hands shaking, he demanded a name once more. “Dave… Your name is Dave.”

Content with the responses, Dave calmly returned the weapon to the agent, and smiled silently as the meeting carried on.

She looked back at her watch and packed her backpack. She went downstairs hoping her mother packed her lunch. She didn't. ""What am I taking for lunch?"" She got no response and she looked back at the watch again, this time to see whether she has time to eat breakfast. She left through the garage door because she didn't like locking the front door and it was much easier to close the garage through her car. She connected her phone through Bluetooth for audio and prayed there won't be any assholes on the road that block her from going fast. 
As usual, there are many that are on their phones and took their time to react to the green light to turn left at the signals that lasted shorter. She was more frustrated at the fact that the signals were shorter than the asshats that took longer to turn. ""I swear they get retarded when they start driving""
She caught up to the lady was in front of her and looked to see what she was doing. ""She was applying makeup while she was turning, you've got to be fucking kidding me."" 
She knew she had to put on something on her face to look better but a much better place to do it is in the parking lot and not the traffic signals. 
Another person took her attention. There were no cars in the front, and he was going 40 on the road that had a speed limit of 55 mph. 
""Sure people can take their time, but they should know that they don't own this road and that there are people who have places to fucking be!"" As she yelled through her closed car, it was as if the car in front of her heard her and began giving speed. ""Thank god!""

She went to her class and looked at the lesson being taught. She noticed that she had already learned about it, and went on to reddit instead. After an hour on reddit already, she felt the energy to type out something and one of the places that provide an opportunity to type a story is r/writtingprompts. She went onto the new section to find something interesting and found something about writing her life in third person view.

Until one day you find an immortal pet rock to keep you company till the end of time.,dinosaregaylikeme,"Ulysses Durant had never been a reverent man, but he always bowed his head in respect before the red root chakra painted on the door of a small shop in a narrow back ally. 

A small bell above announced his arrival as he pushed open the door. A fragrant waft of myrrh and cinnamon washed over him.

""Bonsoir, Uly. Simone told me you'd be coming,"" A petite dark haired woman emerged from a back room, carrying boxes marked: ""Dead Sea, Purification Salt Crystals.""

""Let me help you with that,"" Durant offered, and took a few of the boxes from her to stock the shelves.

""She tells me you're interested in another ritual."" 

Durant pulled a rock out of his jacket pocket and handed it to the woman. The black and rock was about the size of a fist, with soft indentures and curvatures rendering it imperfectly ovular in shape. "" Look what I found up near Great Bear Lake. My biologist friend tells me it's Acasta Gneiss.""

""So you finally found something older than you,"" she ran her thumb over the surface and closed her eyes.

""Har har. I want you to bind a soul to it.""

She sighed. ""Uly, you can't just bind souls to rocks.""

""I am tired, Marianne. You understand that if I change one person, anyone, that opens up a whole host of trouble for me. It doesn't matter if they're a preacher or a whore, over time they either get themselves killed or starve to death after eating a few small towns here and there. Besides, the world can't handle any more than five. Any more new vampires, and everyone's dead in ninety days. The vampires gone not long after.""

""So make peace with the others. Don't go asking me to soul bind someone to a rock for eternity.""

""Please, I would have someone, someone sane, to keep me grounded.""

""They won't be sane for long if you're putting a human soul into a rock.""

""They would have me to talk to.""

""That would drive them nuts that much quicker.""

Durant snarled. ""I am losing my mind, Isabel.""

""I'm Marianne.""

""I'm sorry, that was your...""

""Great-grandmother.""

""You look so much like her,"" he sighed and took the rock back from Marianne and looked down at it. ""Please. I've pledged to sire no more children. I need something, something beyond a simple animation spell.""

""I won't, Ulysses,"" she crossed her arms. 

""Very well. If you won't, maybe one of your kin, or maybe one of your great-grandchildren will. I'll confuse them for you, and I'll have this same pointless conversation from here to eternity.""

""Is there anything else I can do for you tonight?"" She asked, suddenly professional.

""Besides the rock spell, no. Good night, Marianne."" 

Durant puffed his shoulders back and strolled out of the shop, the bell above the door tinkling behind him a second before it slammed.

Under the light of the moon, the surface of the rock shone like jet.

""Well, Peter,"" Durant said, looking down at the stone. ""I think that's the fifth time this century I've had this discussion. Always the same.""

[WP] Describe a fight scene from the perspective of a combatant that is in urgent need of a toilet.,herefortheoldones,"""Mike, hi! Come here, sit down""

I just got in the pub and all my mates were waiting there for me. I'd normally go over to them and say hi but not this time. I had a monumental turd to flush down the toilet. So I just kept running into the toilet.

I don't want to brag, just kidding, of course I do, it was the best shit taken in the history of humanity. It was one of those in which after you do it you feel powerful, agile. You feel you can fly. On the other hand, I was quite hurt,; so I washed my face, and went to my mates.

I wasn't really surprised as their first reaction was ""Holy shit Mike, where were you at, the fucking sewage?""
I couldn't contain myself and said ""Holy shit indeed lads"" and went on to order a pint for me because I rarely tell my stories without a beer. And you know what? I'll grant you lot the privilege of listening to it too.

""So"" I started ""I was on my way here by the tube and in the middle of the journey I realised, I forgot to go to the bathroom. Now guys, you know me, I wasn't going to fart my way out of the carriage, I'm quite the gentleman"" they soon laughed, don't know why ""Seriously lads, I waited until I got of the train to unleash the cocktail of smell for the poor bastards going in...""

-""You sure saved some of it for us"" said James ""I can only hope no one died in the tube due to poisoning""

""Ha ha ha James. Although to be fair, it stunk horribly. Anyway, I was walking towards here and you know how, as you get closer to a bathroom your body just trolls you into shitting yourself slowly? Well, that was happening to me. The only thing I wanted was a toilet right there but 10 blocks were in the fucking way""

- ""So Mike"" said Peter ""Is this going to be interesting, or I better go to the wife and do something a bit more... interesting""

""Like watching her knit and complain? It does get interesting. So, you remember Mick from the other day, right?"" Everybody said yes as I took a sip out of my beer ""Well that cunt thought it'd be a good idea to pick up a fight with me. I was more than happy to kick hi arse again, after I relieved myself. But no, that fucker wanted me there and then, as if I were bloody Netflix.""

- ""You know Mike, you should've just taken the shit on his face. I don't know why he dares to come round'ere.""

""You're right James, but I ain't never gona' say no to a good fight. And you know what, I wanted to give him the advantage of me shitting myself. 
So, I wanted to get this over with as soon as possible so I just went for his face; predictably, by the time he was able to react, I'd landed 5 punches already. I did get 1 or 2 in the face as well, though. But then, he made a big mistake, a bit like Peter marrying his wife, right lads?""

- ""Fuck you Mike, just tell us what happened""

""Easy Peter, you don't want to get grounded by her do you? Anyway he kicked me in the stomcach, meaning if I could handle 5 minutes before, it was more about 60 seconds after that. And I'll be short, I broke his fucking nose and left him down at the floor. But fuck me, I never ran faster in my life.

The guy looked bemused as I look down at him. 

""Well, have you seen a picture of Anna Kendrick recently?""

""Y...yeah!"" he stuttered. He hadn't, and I could tell.

""Well, let me remind you: she has brown hair, about yay long--"" I motioned to my shoulders. ""She is really short, is good looking, and uh, has really white teeth.""

""Yeah, I don't see the problem,"" the guy said, confused.

""Well, I have dark black hair, overweight, at least a foot taller than you, and last but not least, I'm a black guy ""

He stared at me for a minute. I couldn't tell if he was processing it at all, wondering what kind of trouble he was having with any of it.

He let out a little grin. ""Prove it.""

""""*Prove it*??"" I asked incredulously. ""You want me to show you my junk?""

""Yeah! Prove you are not Anna Kendrick!""

""Okay, don't say I didn't warn you,"" I said, as I dropped my trousers to my feet.

Almost as if in slow motion, I watched the mischievous grin turn into absolute disgust. ""OH MY GOD!"" he exclaimed, shielding his eyes and turning his head away from my freely swinging junk 

I covered myself up and watched him pace around with his back to me, wondering where it all went wrong. I thought I had finally convinced him who I was, but when I settled down, I could hear his mutterings beneath his breath.

""Anna Kendrick is a *guy*??? Since when??""

The gods had convened in their high realm, at the end of their wisdom about what to do with us, the living. 

It came down to a bitter debate, so the emissary told us, but in the end it was decided—humans would lose the gift of violence.

Nothing feels different. A few men raise their swords to test the new way of the world and the weapons glance harmlessly off skin. No one knows whether to cheer or cry. War has been at the heart of humanity's soul since the dawn of man. It has been a tumor so engorged on the blood of the host, so entwined in its inner workings, that to excise it would mean severe danger to the host. 

I feel a frustration rising in me, a realization that I will never again ride into battle, my sword raised and ready to strike death, the blood fury blinding my eyes. My frustration must come out. I grab the man nearest me by the neck and push him hard against a wall. There is a crack, red on the wall, and the man slumps to the ground, quite dead. 

Silence as the crowd looks at me. Could it be? Have I been spared this fate? There is only one way to know for sure. I draw my sword and advance. And there is panic in the hearts of men again.",xilead

[WP] The last survivors of a zombie apocalypse have one tool that can shift the tides: a cloning machine.,SwiftsShortStories,"06/06/2006


It's the first day. They said it was coming. Zombies. I can only hope this is a one time thing, that they didn't really bring the dead back to life. It's just not scientifically possible, right? It's a magic trick, most likely. Shits and giggles, giggles and shits. I'll update tomorrow. For now, I have a show to go watch. They're supposed to demonstrate how to kill the zombies. 


06/07/2006


It's real. They're all real. We passed by a cemetery yesterday and I could see the grass moving. It wasn't swaying in the wind like on a normal morning, it was moving. These... things. They were moving underground, turning and rolling, trying to dig themselves out. Yesterday, the zombie was killed. Burned out in public, like a witch on trial. But there's more, coming. 


06/08/2006


We walked past the cemetery again today. We saw hands and fingers starting to poke through the grass in some spots. The city is trying to decide what to do. Burn the entire graveyard? Wait for them to come up and then burn them? There are people on both sides. Some say burn 'em, it's for our safety; others argue that it's... well, disrespectful to the dead. We'll just have to wait and see what happens. It'll be at least another week before full bodies start to surface, anyways. Plenty of time to make a decision about the safety and the future of our city. 



07/11/2006



It's been a month, the zombies, undead, whatever the fuck they are... they aren't like the ones from the first day. We can't burn them. So far, we haven't found a way to stop them... Isaiah and I, we've been hiding with a couple other people in a Walmart. Very American, I know. But there's plenty of dried food, hooks and lines to rig alarms, food, and running water. There's about 50 of us right now. 
Deborah is managing inventory, rationing things out. She suspects that among the 50 of us, the entire supply within the store will last us at least until the end of the year. 


We came up with an attack plan, as well. If you're bit, run out the way the zombies care in. Distract them. Keep the rest of us safe. If this doesn't work, we aren't sure what will. But it's better than nothing. 


08/21/2006


Today would have been my first day back at the college. I could be studying biology and genetics. Instead, I'm stuck in a Walmart still. This fucking Walmart. I hate it. I never liked this big corporation, but I'm sure it's saved my life. Things don't look too good outside. We hear screaming, lots of screaming. If you watch closely, after people get bit, one of two things happen. The first thing is that the flesh starts to melt around the bite. You can smell it, it's so strong. Then, the zombies continue to eat the body. This, I think, is the more considerate way to go. The people are eaten until just the bones remain. Every bit of flesh, muscle, and tendon is ripped out. I'm not sure if people die from the blood loss or because they're eaten so quickly. A group of these zombies can easily eat a fully grown man in under 3 minutes. 


The second, uh, choice... more gruesome. A zombie bites you and you turn into one of them. It isn't a fast process, it looks like it takes 48-72 hours to happen. You slowly start to shed skin and hair, your skin drips off, and... we aren't sure what else. It's disgusting. But there isn't much screaming, which almost makes it bearable. 


We still aren't sure what causes people to die or to become a zombie. But we're sure to stay out of the way. 


The power went out last week. At the end of July, we stopped hearing reports from other counties around us. At that time, all of the US had been infected. There were a couple of reports from England, a case in Australia, and one in Russia, if I recall correctly. Now, there's nothing. I'm sure much of the world is in the same condition. Hiding until they come for us. 


9/29/2006


Sorry it's been so long for an update... we lost a large chunk of our people. We went from 50 to just 22 after an attack. The zombs, as we call 'em, hadn't paid the Walmart any attention before. I guess food is getting scarce and they can smell us. They got in and we fought them off. The people who were bit ran out of the store, as we had planned earlier. The zombs followed the bitten people and left us alone. We barricaded the entrances again. Put extra caution into the windows. 


Isaiah.. he was bit. I'm not sure where he is now, if he's a zomb or if he's dead... I hope it's the latter. He was my fiancé. We were supposed to get married in December, a white wedding. That of course, won't happen now. I miss him. He kept us all entertained and laughing, even in the darkest of moments. Deborah also got bit. No one can keep track of the supplies like she did.. people are sneaking extra food now. I'm afraid we won't last much longer. 


In all the free time, when I'm not guarding a door or window, I started reading again. When we set up base here, one of the few things I brought from home was my biology and genetic books. I'm reading them, hoping to find some clue of this condition and a way to free us. So far, nothing. 


01/01/2007


Happy fucking New Years. Happy fucking life. Happy whatever. There's 12 of us left. I hate their annoying voices. I hate them I hate them. I'm going crazy. I'm afraid I might run out some day just to be bit... so I don't have to live like this much longer. 


01/09/2007


I MAY HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SAVE US. WILL UPDATE SOON.


02/14/2007



Ah, Valentine's Day. The day of love, and hopefully, our survival. The genetics book had some theory about cloning and genome sequencing. I won't go into to much detail, but basically, the solution is to clone the 12 of us. Each 10 times or so. Easily giving us over 100 people. And the zombs? We found out they have an adverse reaction to lemon juice or other citric acids. Fruit juice works especially well. We don't have many fruits left, but there's plenty of juice. It's warm now, but it'll work. 


To clone anyone in my group, I just need some hair, a fingerprint, and a dark closest. Easy enough. 


03/10/2007


It worked! I cloned myself successfully. It sounds like there is plenty of pain involved in the process for the clone. I'm forcing them to grow over 100x faster than is natural. But whatever works. We just block out the screaming. I'll clone everyone once and then start over. 


04/2007


I don't know the exact date, my calendar got burnt in an accident. And... This is my last entry. We had another zomb invasion right after my last entry. 6 left. They all went running, except Maria. Fucking Maria. She got bit and didn't run. She let me clone her 55 times. They're all in the closet growing. 


The screaming is unbearable. 


I cloned a zombie.


My choices now... stay inside and be eaten. Go outside and die. 


Death is inevitable. 


I'm staying because at least I can see my creation to the end. There isn't enough juice left to save us this time from an internal attack. We're stuck. I thought cloning us would be our last hope. It was our falling out. 


Oh, and I figured it out. People with blue eyes are turned into zombs. Anyone else, brown or green or hazel eyes, they are eaten. I don't know why, but that's the case... which means Isaiah is still out there... I'll survive (to become a zomb)... I'm going to find him and marry his zombie ass. 



I hear them...


Scratching at the door...


This is it. 


To anyone who survived and is reading this: 

Good luck.

[WP] The last survivors of a zombie apocalypse have one tool that can shift the tides: a cloning machine.,SwiftsShortStories,"“Look, all I’m saying is that maybe… maybe someone else should be on the frontline to fight,” Franklin 162 said, his face lit by the single overhead bulb weakly lighting the room.  Only the four sitting at the battered table were visible in the dim light.  Behind, thousands of beaming, similar faces looked on to the meeting.  


“Who, Franklin?” Alan 34 said with an exasperated sigh.  “There are FOUR of us.  FOUR source people to feed the clono-matic replicator.”


“Ehh hem,” William 1 cleared his throat loudly.  It echoed in the large dirt chamber of their buried fortress.


“That William so brilliantly invented,” Alan 34 added.  William 1, content with his acknowledgement, leaned back in has chair, folded his arms and relaxed.  “Anyway, Franklin, who else is going to fight?  Huh?  Me?  The Kid?”


“Hey now,” Tommy 97, as well as dozens of Tommys behind him, grumbled in discontent.  “We could totally fight those zombies.  You just gotta give us the chance.  We’re ready! Just give us a chance.”


“Being able to clear all the levels in Left4Dead does NOT make you to be able to fight the real thing.”


“I’m just asking for a chance!” Tommy 97 wailed.  


“And you’ll get one, when you’re older. When you’re ALL older!” Alan 34 said sternly, and glared across the small wake of Tommys behind the one sitting at the table, silencing them.  He turned back to face Franklin 162. “As I was saying, we’ve been through this.  No one is as tougher or stronger than you Franklin.  You have the best results when resisting the Zombie hoard.”


“You just don’t know what it’s like!” Franklin 162 moaned.  “Watching wave-after-wave of your selves be cut down.  It’s bad for the psyche.  I don’t even know if I’m the original or not.”


“You’re not.  You can see it on your chest.”


Franklin 162 glanced down at the hastily scrawled “162” written in sharpie on his chest and muttered an “Oh yeah.”  Only the most original source clone was allowed at the table during planning meetings.  


“Franklin, I know it’s hard.  I know it’s awful watching yourselves die like that.  But, Christ man, this wouldn’t be the apocalypse if there wasn’t horrible death and suffering.  That’s why we need help.  We need to rendezvous with a colony that has a wider variety of sources clones.  We should strike out north to Fort Collins.  On the radio, they supposedly have at least 15 source clones.  Think of the variety!”


“Rubbish,” William 1 interjected.  “We should go into the mountains.  And pass through to the desert.  We can power our solar panels in sun.”


“Yeah,” Tommy 97 added excitedly, “And if we continue to Salt Lake City, I heard that there are two girl source clones for every guy!”  The other Tommys cheered this notion.  


“UGH, no, we’re not joining the mormons,” Franklin 162 said.  “Why can’t we just move deeper into the mountains.  Find a good spot to hide until this all blows over.”


“Blows over?”  Alan 34 snapped back.  “It’s been eight years Franklin, when do you think this is going to just *blow* *over*? Huh?  Next Thursday maybe?”


The room went quiet save for the sound of the Franklins standing behind the table awkwardly shuffling their feet in embarrassed reaction to their leader’s suggestion.  


“Let’s put it to a vote,” Tommy 97 said.


“Fine, but only those of voting age get to vote,” Aln 34 said.


“Fuck you man, you only say that because there’s more clones of me here.”


“Look, “ Alan 34 said, “no matter what, I think we can all agree that we need supplies.  We have to move out towards--” 


The words were cut short by a loud booming thud from overhead.  The single lightbulb on a wire flickered and danced from the impact. Dozens of cracks overhead widened, and dripped sand on their heads.  Everyone tensed and held still.  The earth over their head shook again and from down the hall a scream of “BREACH!” reached their ears.


The secondary doorway in the back of the room exploded in wooden shrapnel and the living undead boiled into the room, feasting on the first Tommys they reached.  Half of the Tommys in the room pissed their pants on the spot while the others frantically flailed about to move away.


“Fighting sources, get to the clono-matic!” Alan 34 called.  Already William 1 had hobbled over to the machine and was working the controls that sat between the giant glass bubble chambers.  Alan 34 strode and leapt into the first empty glass chamber while Franklin 162 trudged his large frame into the second one.  With a sigh, Franklin 162 grasped the metal handles inside.  A sheet of white and blue lighting rippled up the bottom of Franklin 162’s glass chamber, enveloped him, then followed the path of the tubing overhead and was directed into an adjacent, empty chamber.  The energy warped and expanded into a portly shape resembling the first Franklin.  It faded and a new Franklin stood in its place.  The new Franklin stepped out of the machine, took a step forward to a waiting that had clipboard and marker.  After consulting the paper on the clipboard, the new Franklin modified his shirt to read “1,867”


He was then instantly seized by a Zombie latching onto his back that began gnawing on his skull.  


Franklin 1868 flew out of the chamber and decapitated the zombie neatly with a single backwards jerk of his arms.  He quickly sharpied his number on, and then joined the fray.  


Meanwhile, Alan`s 167, 168 and 169 dashed across the room, trying to seal the breach with the makeshift tools at their disposal.  None of the Tommys asked to join the battle and crawled out the opposite entrance.  


The Alans couldn’t make any progress in sealing the entrance with the constant influx of Zombies.


“Franklin!” Alan 167 yelled, “We need help.  PHALANX ATTACK!”


From his chamber, Franklin 162, “Oh not that.  It’s so icky.”


Alan 34 said, “Look, you’re not the only one making sacrifices here.  The only resource we have is cloned selves.  We make use of the materials we have.   William, DO IT!”


William nodded sharply and worked the controls.  Five new Alans popped out of the machine and ten Franklins followed thereafter.  The Franklins made a two-by-five wall of soldiers.  They picked up the scrawny Alans, turned them sideways to form a makeshift battering wall.  They yelled a rallying cry and charged into the zombies, pushing them backwards.  The shield of Alans screamed as the Zombies bit and scratched the human wall pushing them backwards.  It proved effective enough to push the hoard back, and seal the breach with a wall of dying Alans.  The room went quiet, save for the rhythmic zapping of Franklins and Alans being cloned into the room.


“WILLIAM! Stop the machine, do you want to crush us to death with copies?”


William dutifully stopped the machine.


“Now what Alan?” Franklin 162 asked.


“We’ve got to get out of here.  I see three options.  Human bowling ball-”


“NO, oh god not the bowling ball,” Franklin 162 interrupted with his moans.


Alan 34 continued, “Centipede Attack, or the Funnel.  Either way, we have to move and now if we want to survive.”

His name is not important. 

No one tells him this, but he knows it, just like he knows the cold neglect of the streets and the stern faces of the elders. He knows that in the grand scheme of things he is just one miniscule cog to be fitted into the great machine of society, turned to the purposes of an elite few far above his existence. 

He decides that he wants to try to be a good cog. 

It's all he can aspire to. Everyone around him tells him this is a good thing. This is the path of duty and honour. 

He becomes a ninja, because the village is short on manpower and he was reasonably fit. 

They send him on missions during the war. He has no idea what he's doing or where he's going. Just that he has to keep supporting the village and saying good stuff to his comrades, because being a cog is important. 

He tries not to think about why he's doing what he's doing. There is something in him that breaks a little more with every mission, something fragile and sharp that will cut him if he actually sits down and considers the state of his soul. 

He has long since learned to stay away from sharp things. 

He thinks he is a reasonably good ninja. Modestly speaking, as long as he doesn't run up against any Jounin or S-rank monsters he should be fine. 

The war drags on. He starts having to run into Jounin who employ all sorts of tricks to stay alive, including involving civilians. 

He's a good ninja, he thinks. He listens to orders, he completes his missions, and he doesn't go on random stress killing sprees like some of his colleagues have done. 

He fights on, because he is just a cog in a machine. 

But then he meets Rao. Rao is a sweet little thing, a slip of a girl, really. Rao is lightness and smiles and innocence, a friendly face in the still living marketplace of the village. She is another insignificant cog in the great machine, but one rather like him somehow. 

Rao, whose face makes him afraid that he might never come home. 

He starts wondering if the village is the best place for Rao to be. He's heard rumours of what the other Jounins have been doing to relieve the stress of war. He's heard rumours of what the civilians have had to bear in order to appease their guardians and protectors. 

One day when he comes back from another assassination, Rao is missing from the marketplace. He takes leave to look for her. He searches in secret, even during his missions. 

Rao has never left the country. He hears a few rumours. He returns to the village and visits every brothel and bar until he finds a familiar face rotting away in the back of a dark alley. 

The village had not been safe for Rao. 

The village is a great machine and he is a tiny cog, ready to be crushed under the weight of his own inability to protect what he pleases. 

He is being crushed slowly. 

A while later he stands on the edge of a border, his team mates incapacitated and the enemy gone for now. He sits alone in a field of corpses, waiting for the sun to set before they move out. 

He is not a good man. He knows this by now. There is no way he is considered good, after all that he has done for the great machine and even then-

Perhaps the great machine of society was never a good one after all.

All he can do is make a decision, right now. Leave, or stay. If he stays, the village will make him kill some more until he dies himself one day. If he leaves, he leaves alone and there will be no fantasy of duty or honour to aspire to. 

All he can do is choose, while he has the chance.

It was Saturday morning, which meant no school and an empty house all to himself. He sat on the edge of his bed and rubbed the sleep from his eyes. Looking down at his hand he saw the scar on his palm; a small ""x"". It was his best friend, Eli, who was responsible, he was off to another country and he thought it would be sentimental. Tommy held his throbbing hand and sighed. 

The morning went like any other. He grabbed a bowl of cereal and turned on his early bird cartoons. Finishing his food, it was time for him to brush his teeth. Standing up, he stubbed his toe on the hard wooden table leg. He yelped in pain.

""Hehe, funny human.."" a tiny voice chuckled

Tommy froze and slowly surveyed the room.

""I wonder if he's okay?"" another voice chimed

Tommy dove and grabbed the television remote and turned the volume down.

""H-hello?"" he whispered

The room was silent and still. Tommy turn the television off and slowly made his way to the kitchen to wash his bowl. As he began cleaning a small red being ran across the front of the sink. Tommy threw his slippery bowl sky high and it crashed onto the floor.

The little red person jumped in fright and froze staring at Tommy. 

""What the hell?"" Tommy muttered, rubbing his eyes vigorously. 

A few moments past as the two stood still with locked eyes.

""I think he can see you Figgy..."" a voice said clearly. Tommy whipped his head around to see a small pink lady standing on his right shoulder. The two exchanged looks with wide eyes.

""Uhh....hi?"" she said queerly, waving her tiny hand cautiously, ""Please don't faint.."" 

""I think he's gonna faint!"" the red one laughed.

Tommy fainted.

"[WP] Before your best friend is to move away, you swear an oath of brotherhood in blood. Little did you both know, your best friend came from a long lost line of sorcerers",FictitiousNarrative,"Her name was Farin. She had scales like polished bronze and eyes like storm clouds and she lived up at the keep on the cliffs. Her father did something important at the library there; something about histories but she didn't like to talk about it. She always said she came down here to the village pub to avoid all that boring stuff.

She always came alone. She'd turn up when I least expected it, mud on her face and tears in her clothes. She always had some madcap adventure in mind: in the summer we climbed trees and stole peaches from the castle farms, in the winter we went sledding down the steep hills on trays she pinched from the keep's kitchens. Climbing down the cliffs to the sea to look for mermaids.

We were thirteen when she said she'd rather have me for a sister than all her siblings. We were sitting on the rocky strip of beach, watching the water and talking about what we wanted to do when we grew up. I laughed and said I'd swear it in blood right now if she wanted - I always wanted a sister. I should have known she'd pull out her bootknife and take me up on it.

Her blood left my palm numb and tingling for hours. She said it was nothing: just a species quirk. Her people had thunder in their veins, but it wouldn't hurt me. Probably. It hasn't so far.

I didn't see as much of Farin in the years after that. We were getting old enough to worry about the future - I was busy most of the time learning to manage the pub from my mother. I figured she stopped visiting so much because she was busy learning whatever it was her family did up there in the keep.

Until I was sixteen. She slipped into the pub kitchen looking for me, a knapsack over her shoulder. There was something wild in her eyes that night. Something both frightening and fearful. She said she was leaving. She was going to one of the great cities in the north, to find her fortune where no one had ever heard of her family. She said she had to, or she'd do something she'd regret. 

I didn't ask. Sometimes I wish I had. Maybe I could have helped, somehow. Maybe if I'd known more about her life up on the cliffs, about her family, I could have talked her into staying. If I'd asked, I might have gone with her. 

But I didn't ask.

I stayed in the village. I married the baker's son. We took over most of the work of running the pub from my parents. It was exactly the kind of life I'd always pictured. Other than missing the sister of my heart, I was content. Years passed.

I dreamed about Farin sometimes. In my dreams she always led the sort of life she would have enjoyed: one wild adventure after another. I dreamed of her as a fierce warrior, hacking her way through the evils of the distant north. She was smiling, always smiling, a battle axe in one hand and the other fist filled with lightning.

I'd wake up the mornings after those dreams with my palm numb and tingling where that long ago scar crossed it. I never told a soul about that part, thought I talked about the dreams with anyone who asked about her. They were only dreams and flights of fancy, after all. 

Almost a decade to the day after she ran away, I had the nightmare. Farin and her allies faced down a cabal of dark sorcerers in a city so far away I'd never heard it's name before. The fight was vicious, but she was winning. It seemed no different from the dreams I always had.

Then her smile faltered.

Suddenly, my dream was nothing but fire and the sound of screaming. Farin was nothing but a black shape etched in flame. Then she wasn't even that. 

My hand hasn't stopped stinging since.

It took three weeks for news of an explosion that leveled half a city to filter so far south. The rumors said a group of heroes tried to stop it; that the whole city would have gone if not for them. I was sure she'd be proud of herself, being remembered like that. It wasn't enough for me.

I packed a bag of essentials the next day. I took the woodcutting axe from behind the pub, too. The heft of it felt strange in my hands; my husband was the one who chopped our firewood. I'd learn. 

I'm more of a coward than Farin was: I left him a note on our washstand and was gone before dawn's light. I took the road north to find my sworn sister's killers.

A simple curling of the lips, fluttering of the eyebrows. There probably wasn’t a thought to the action, as afterward, she just continued on. In my life one second, out the next.
	
Ten minutes ago, everything was so concrete. I was penniless. I had a hundred friends I could call but none that would answer. Hell, even home wasn’t *home.* It was a place paid for by parents’ passing, a success only achieved through the death of the two people I loved most.
	
And all of those things are still true. But now, for some reason, it’s *different*.
	
I thumb the bottle of pills in my pocket. It was a lot easier in my head. All I’d have to do is lock myself in my house, down the bottle, and die. Not a soul would notice. I’m just a speck in the wind.
	
But that gesture…
	
So minute, so powerful.
	
Finally, for once, I’ve been noticed. At a time when I’m most invisible, someone’s reached out their metaphorical hand and touched me.
	
If one person can, why can’t more?
	
It’s such a good thought that I take bottle out of my pocket and let it fall into the gutter, rolling through the grating and disappearing into the darkness.

[EU] Ron and Shego are fired from their positions as sidekicks. They decide to partner up and become a force to be reckoned with.,Officer_Lockstock95,"Ron Stoppable drank a shot of milk in a bar, as he sighs feeling abandoned. He slams down the shot glass down, ""Barkeep another one.."" The manager of Bueno Nacho blinks ""Ron you had 5, I think you had en-"" Ron snaps ""I'LL TELL YOU I HAD ENOUGH!"" he said with a crazy eyes. 

Boyfriend of Kim Possible, and usually sidekick. That moment all change when she dumped his ass. As much as the dorky sidekick demeanor had its charm, Ron was useless after Rufus had passed away in a cheese poisoning that Dr. Drakken made. His naked mole rat buddy was nothing more but a puddle to bury, Ron started to become late more than ever. To dates, to his classes, and to basically everything. 

He was nothing more than a shell.. . 

*SLAM!* ""THAT BLUE IDIOT! I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL-"" Shego screamed out more obscenities in the restaurant as she was glowing green as usual, as her hands still had that plasma and corrosive attitude all around her gloves. After Dr. Drakken had a night with Shego, things went from red as hearts to blue as sadden and depressive nights of performance issues. Mostly on Shego for her constant scratching on Dr. D. So she was cast out, and another sidekick was immediately called up. Turns out to be one of her siblings, which caused Shego of course to flip the living hell out. 

Shego recognized a particular blonde but teen loser posture, it was Ron Stoppable but he had an air to him that smelled of milk, depression, and pain. Shego simply laughs ""Oh what's the problem? Kimmy basically tell you to give the boot?"" Ron non-responsively flicks Shego off, ""OOOOH THE loser actually grew a set! Maybe that hairless rodent dying off wasn't such a bad thing to happen after all!"" Ron gets up immediately as he says ""I guess Dr. D isn't such a bad person after he realized how much of a spoiled rotten cunt you are."" 

Shego got silent as the restaurant jaw dropped over the situation. Shego's hands glowed into a bright angry green as she dashes, jumping towards Stoppable with a roar ""SAY WHAT YOU BITCH!!?"" as if she was a lioness pouncing on Stoppable. But Stoppable had no emotion as he immediately kicks upwards towards her chin as she flew backwards to the ground and into a booth. The leg moves downward, slowly as his hands were at his side. 

Shego felt something that she didn't expect, confusion and fear, but at the same time arousal. Someone to put her into her place with so ease but wasn't an idiot. ""H-hey kid... why don't you and I join forces.."" Ron looks over her with a glare, ""And why would I do that?"" Shego started to change her tone from frigid abused woman to sweet and succulent. ""We have a common enemy, Kim Possible. She dumped you, left your best friends forever. And I was left by Dr. Drakken. You obviously hate him. Soo..."" She sashays her hips slowly while sitting down by Ron. ""How about it.. you and me. We can be the most powerful of sidekicks of all time. The smart and the brawn."" 


Ron thought for a moment, could this truly be a good idea? He had no love for Kim Possible. He didn't want to hurt anyone but her, his own heart was in pain from heartbreak. Ron was silent, ""Sure, why not?"" he says as he shook the hands of Shego as he had a strong grip. The grip was enough to make Shego blush, she might fall hard for this veteran of destruction.

Frank Sitwell had been reading the papers ever since Thanksgiving. He didn't want to be unprepared like last year. Although he had grown accustomed to avoiding jumping and appreciated the ease at which he could lift heavy loads, Frank had watched in despair as his previously athletic physique withered away under the reduction in gravity. He supposed that was democracy at work and if a majority of the country struggled with weight issues, who was he to suggest they seek any other remedy? And besides, the gracefully slow arcs which his cat now took on her way to the window ledge were quite stunning to behold.

This year, though, was different. Frank was taking a stand for the first time in his life. He understood there was a shortage in food but he was *not* going to eat his fellow man. His mind was made up.

January 5, 2057:
Frank sat down to dinner at his kitchen table. He had made a new recipe. The butcher said he had a new and flavorful cut of beef available and Frank decided to grill steaks. As he bit into his dinner, he marveled at the unique texture and taste. ""Not half bad,"" he thought, ""and half the price of the regular steaks!"" He could get used to this.

"[WP] Every year mankind can vote on any one subject. Whichever side gets the majority wins and their decision, from increased welfare to decreased gravity, becomes universal law.",PLANESWALKERwTARDIS,"Decision 2017, the televised stage where two opponents would engage in a verbal debate on this year’s topic, flashed across the screens of millions of households. Janet Yellen, the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System kindly greeted the applauding audience composed mostly of politicians and celebrities across the world. Her opponent, Tapiwa Chikwava, the Minister of Finance for Zimbabwe, stood across the stage, ready to let the voice of poor sing through the greed of the West. After the moderator adequately introduced the experts, he introduced the question: Should a check of $1000 USD be sent to every man and woman on earth? With the question posed, he asked for opening statements.

“The field of economics is greatly complex and sometimes even contradictory,” Yellen began. “However, that means when economists take a moment to come to an agreement, it should give great weight to the peoples of the world. Today in examining an exogenous increase in the supply of money, essentially the check to which every person would be entitled, we necessarily must understand the Equation of Exchange,  which states that the product of the money supply and the velocity of money is equal to the product of price level and the index of real value of transactions. By the end of tonight, I hope to better educate the world to understand that increasing the money supply only serves to increase inflation and leave none better off.”

As she finished her statement, polite applause radiated from the audience. Her opponent eagerly awaited his response. 

“Economics is field developed by the Western world to undermine the poor,” Chikwava started. “Every time Zimbabwe or Somalia asks the World Bank for a loan, they propose some new theory or speculation to deny us the funds required to build an economy. The white men in suits employed by the International Monetary Fund are nothing more than corporate puppets controlled by billionaire masters who masquerade as philanthropists. The Western world does not care about Africa. Or Asia. Or Latin America. They only care about finding new ways to extort money from the impoverished, but I say no more. I say we play a new song, and let the West pay us instead.”

A thunder of applause erupted from the crowd, predominately motivated by vapid celebrities who long endorsed the vote since its inception. 

The debate wore on, but ultimately, on December 31, when all votes were cast, all the poor in China and India alone outweighed the opposition. As the US printed money to fuel the wishes of world, the monetary supply increased by 7.4 trillion dollars, destabilizing markets for both stocks and bonds and causing the economy of the world to come crashing down into the doldrums of poverty as inflation ran rampant. With all wealth nearly equalized, the world lay in ashes of an unconstrained democracy.

the money would cause a roughly 10% instant inflation, but odds are wouldn't do much but disenfranchise the poorer peoples of the world.

Inflation has been about 3% per year over the last decade, which means it would devalue the dollar about 3 years worth instantly.

In fact it would have positive effects on any owners of real property (real estate) as it would increase the value while the loans on them are devalued.

""Well, look at the bright side"" said Liz as she lifted the vaporizer with a smile on her face. ""I didn't even read *Brave New World*, but I think the guy might have been right. Thing is, I don't know how I feel about it. Our life is easier than ever, and yet, are we becoming dummer?""  

""You know, I thought mankind was going to evolve, but it seems that criminality increased instead"" said Joe as he took a hit. ""Take the Universal Basic Income Law of 2019. We thought we'd lead a happy life ever since, pursuing art and knowledge instead of doing menial tasks. And yet here we are, criminals flock around because people haven't learnt yet to be happy with what they have. They just want more. We should propose that as universal law, 'Be happy with what you have', but then they'll fucking call us communists. It will never work.""  

""Zzzzzzzzzzz"" said the cold fusion-powered cleaning robot as he passed by mopping the floor.  

""Can you believe they had the technology for those already back in 2012? And yet we went on another five years using freaking coal and oil. Thank God for that 2017 law.""

"[WP] You sell magic guns, someone scary came into your store demanding ""something special"".",ThePsychicDefective,"""Special? Heh, I'm gonna need a bit more to go off of than that, mate. Whaddaya need, a laser sight?""

The guy looked about 25. Neatly gelled hair, glasses, sweater vest inside the raincoat, not particularly built physically, but certainly not scrawny. Like a grocery store clerk. Just average. Maybe a student from the nearby university. The guy made a disgruntled look, then looked over both his shoulders.

""No, I uh-""
He sighed and pushed the glasses up his nose.
""Listen are you the magic gunsmith or not? If you are, stop wasting my time. If you aren't, then I probably seem crazy as shit and I'm wasting my own time.""

I chuckled at that a bit. 
""Alright, alright you got me. But drop the act Apollo. The gettup isn't fooling anyone. Only a douche like you could keep your hair that perfect when it's raining cats and dogs outside.""

The guy seemed irritated for a moment then took a step back from the counter. Golden dust spiraled around his feet, dispelling the illusion from his real appearance. When the light subsided, a young man dressed as if he was part of some tacky british boy band stood in the store, guitar necklace and all. 

""What can I do for the almighty god of archery? You get tired of pulling your little bowstrings?""

""First of all, I'm also the god of light, music, medicine, and prophecies, so don't fuck with me. I'll end you.""
His eyes glowed yellow for a sec, as if that was supposed to impress me.
""Second of all, I need your help, Cyclops.""

A derogatory term. I raised an eyebrow and refrained from throwing him out of my store right then and there.
""What's with all the secrecy? Who you hidin from?""

He ran his fingers through his hair and played with his necklace for a second.
""Ares, my brother. He's out of control. Anxious. God of War thinks there hasn't been enough war over the past few thousand years. He's picking fights with all the other gods. He killed Artemis last week. He came for me two days ago. He broke my bow and-""
Apollo lifted his shirt and revealed a long dark gash in his rib cage.
""he gave me this. Please. I need a new weapon. Something strong enough to kill a god.""

The look in his eyes was empty. Lacking any need for self preservation. Only revenge. 

""Kid, me and my kind haven't made weapons or tools for the gods since Zeus' master bolt. There's kind of a concensus that we're supposed to stay out of your business, but I feel for you mate. I'll help you...

"[WP] You find a dead man outside a cave. Written in blood next to him is ""DO NOT ENTER THE DEVIL'S THROAT"". You then hear a cry for help inside the cave.",WanderingSwampBeast,"I used to love hiking. If you'd like, I'll tell you the story that made me stay far from the woods, and even put some grey in this hair of mine.

It was a nice day in the Cascades, and with the way the fog had clung to everything when I first emerged from my tent to the cawing of several crows and the tweets of the birds, I was grateful for the sun. I took a sip from my canteen as I looked up at the bright blue sky.

It was still early, and the only clouds that floated across the sun were fluffy and white. I paused at the edge of a clearing, and found some stones to make a fire pit before gathering a small amount of firewood. I made my fire and heated a can of ravioli with a camp skillet, eating my lunch at the edge of the trees.

I cleaned up my mess and doused the remains of the  fire with some water from the gallon jug tied to my pack with a piece of baling twine. Once I scattered the stones and dashed the muddy ashes around a bit I re-shouldered my pack  moved through the clearing to the other side. 

I found a game trail that wound up the side of the mountain, and began to follow it, eyes scanning a few feet in front of me for obstacles in my path as I walked, and despite my precaution, I caught a hidden root in the fluffy undergrowth, nearly spilling to the ground.

I halted myself by half-hugging a pine tree, righting myself, and continued on my way after momentary breather, and another drink of water. That was when I found a split in my trail, one that leveled out along a wide ridge, the other branch meandering further up the mountain.

I chose the more level, albeit narrower, path, though someone could have easily walked beside me on the oddly smooth stone shelf. I was just considering how odd the feature was when a sound, a not-too-distant scream from the pitch of the cry caught my attention. 

I increased my pace and the sound came again, much closer than before. I came upon a crumpled form first, though the old man couldn't have been the source of the screaming I had heard. The amount of blood staining the rock made that clear. 

I turned toward the slope to my left, toward the entrance of the cave, where there was another dark stain, though slightly smaller than the one surrounding the body, along with a trail that led to where the man had expired. Above this puddle were hastily scrawled words in blood. 

""DO NOT ENTER THE DEVIL'S THROAT"" read the message, and just then, at the worst possible time, the scream echoed from the dark hole in the stone wall. It was someone, though I couldn't discern the gender, I could make out the singular word. ""Help."" I nearly jumped out of my skin.

I stood there for a moment, debating on whether or not to flee, and against my better judgment, I half unslung my backpack, fishing out a small, but bright flashlight, pressing the power button as I stepped into the darkness. There was a tunnel, and just barely visible at the end of the flashlight's beam, I could see a curve.

I stepped even further into this tunnel and the scream echoed to my ears from around the corner. Goosebumps raised under my light sweatshirt, and not only from the slight decrease in temperature. There was something not quite right about the voice, but I was already committed.

I rounded the curve and followed the tunnel as it narrowed a little, my shoulders only an inch from the rough, damp walls at this point. A little while later, the ground slanted gradually downward, and I hadn't heard the scream for some time, so I was considering turning around and getting the hell out of dodge, my imagination starting to place patterns in the shadows.

I wouldn't feel right, abandoning someone in need without giving an honest try, so I mustered every ounce of bravery I had left, calling out into the abyssal tunnel ""Hello?"" my word echoed back to me and I waited. Just then I heard a response. That bolstered my failing nerve, and I pressed onward.

After seven or eight more minutes of straight decent the path leveled out and I felt a slight draft on my face from directly in front of me, and I realized that the beam of my flashlight couldn't reach the end of whatever was in front of me. I half-jogged into the cavern, almost as grateful as I had been for the nice weather.

I cast my beam around the large room from what I guessed to be near the center and saw a small hole in the wall, but no human sized exit, so I yelled again, thinking I had somehow missed a second tunnel. ""HEEEELP!"" came the voice from the shadows to my left flank. I swiveled my head and torso in that direction, expecting to see a person.

Whatever cowered against the far wall was far from that. It looked like some sort of mangy, sick coyote. I'm unsure whether the red eyes were a result of the light, which seemed to blind it momentarily or not. In the bald patches of its gray, clumpy fur, its flesh was pale, as if it had never seen the sun. 

""Oh fuck!"" I screamed when my paralysis broke and that seemed to also break the creature out of its trance. It sprang at me and landed on my torso, knocking me to the ground, snarling and screaming that singular phrase into my face before attempting to take a chunk out of my throat.

I was able to throw my arm up, jamming my forearm into its mouth instead, pressing the bone as far into the jagged rows of teeth as I could despite the agonizing fire that accompanied the thing's saliva. We struggled briefly and I managed to somehow free my small knife from my hiking boot, stabbing the thing in the stomach.

It pulled back with its fresh grip, taking a large portion of my skin and muscle with it as it ran toward the small hole I had spotted earlier, leaving a dark trail of blood in its wake. I managed to get to my feet and get back up into the light, though the climb was rough on me. 

I was barely conscious when I dug my first aid kit from my pack, using the tourniquet from the snakebite kit to staunch the blood flow before I cleaned the wound and rubbed antibiotic ointment on the gaping wound with a piece of gauze before wrapping it as well, drinking three quarters of the water I had left, and sitting next to the corpse.

I eventually got up and moving again, heading for my car, only camping once, and well after the sun set, paranoia fueling my aching body to keep moving although my backpack felt like lead. I didn't even set up a tent, sleeping under the stars. As soon as the crows woke me, I started walking.

I got into my car and drove home, and haven't went into the woods since. You might say I developed a phobia of the wilderness. That's why I find it strange that even as I type this, I feel the urge to run free in the moonlit forest, maybe even find a nice deep cave to take a nap in.

"[WP] Shortly after being diagnosed with a terminal disease, someone has released your identity as the city's beloved superhero. Though every citizen has tried to make your final days peaceful, your arch nemesis has ensured you would receive his most recent announcement.",ButCaptainThatsMYRum,"The crowd of protesters heavily outnumbered the news crews in attendance for Lex's latest announcement given the recent news. Picket signs waved in the air, displaying their disdain for the multi-billionaire's past positions on the Man of Steel. Words filled the air denouncing Lex for his transgressions against the world's favourite superhero.

Lex ignored them.

He straightened his tie and walked up to the podium. He cleared his throat and began to speak.

""I'll start by saying that I have no disrespect for Superman.""

Suddenly people started quieting down to hear where Lex was going with his speech.

""Looking back with a more rational lens, I can see that he was only trying to do what he felt was best for humanity. That he was attempting the exact same thing as myself.""

The last statement restarted the uproar of the protesters. Lex waited for about a minute before beginning to speak again over them.

""I know that this may seem to be a surprise to everyone. But I want everyone to consider raising a child. What kind of person would you be raising if you coddled and spoiled them their whole lives? I was trying to force a 'tough love' method of growth on humanity in contrast to what Superman wanted. I was trying to remove ourselves from the influence of an alien godlike being. I was trying to better us. But recently I learned and will admit for the first time in my life that I was wrong.""

Murmurs began throughout the crowd as people began to process what they had just witnessed.

""Two weeks ago, it came out that Superman was not as removed from humanity as I had believed. Superman lived among us as Clark Kent - a reporter for the Daily Planet whom I respected very much. A man who built himself up from living on a farm in Kansas to become an ideal American citizen. To learn that such a well-known and respectable reporter was in his spare time the very man I fought against, for once showed me the error of my ways.""

""Upon further self-reflection, I realized how much time and resources I had wasted solely to stop Superman and try to allow humanity to grow on its own. And now I realize I was simply trying to find a knife to rip apart our best safety net instead of using it to find food or water. So now, given the recent news and findings, I am announcing that 25% of LexCorp's profits will now be diverted to humanitarian causes to fill the void in all the world's goodness that Superman's passing will leave. Thank you for your time.""

Lex turned and swiftly walked off the stage, followed by a myriad of reporters firing questions at him like a machine gun. Meanwhile, Superman smiled in his hospital bed as he watched Lex's speech, with Lois by his side and a picture of his late adoptive parents beside him. 

""Good job Lex, I'm proud of you.""",iwumbo2
[CC] Dead Man's Lottery: Henry Crusack (Pt. I - IV),Meanwhile_Over_There,"Just read through Henry Crusack.
I enjoyed it. The Dystopian Lottery premise is cool, with all the televised murder and clear sanctioning of it, makes for good fiction. The plot is pretty good so far too, I was immediately expecting some well-known, even fan-favourite assassins, and you delivered quickly.

I believe though, you're telling us too much, rather than showing us. Compare ""he wondered furiously"" to something like, ""he spat, his temper rising"" or even ""his frustration mounted as he searched fruitlessly, unable to find the woman"". It may be different for you, but I find that when you try to show reactions, you can better convey emotion.

One thing I believe is that you as a writer need to know what everything looks like. I can't draw at all, so I like to write a paragraph or three just to describe locations and people. Sometimes I write a lot more and feel like I'm wasting my life, but then again I could be watching reality tv and getting angry so I smugly pretend I'm a step ahead.

If you want, take a look at the show Dark Mirror, there's an episode which deals with a society constantly exposed to television, you could take some cues from that if you'd like to move toward forcing Henry to leave the T.V. on, but I also could see him leaving it on *or* switching to something like a pirate's livestream online, so he has a constant update of the situation-which by necessity would be slightly delayed. I could even imagine him hosting the live feeds of some of the cameras because it would grant him extra pairs of eyes.

We have achieved more in the past six decades than Humanity has accomplished in numerous generations. I have seen generations come and go. I have been called a hero and a villain, fallen out of public eye, and of course when I least expect, have fallen back in to that fickle spotlight.

I said we would go to Mars, and you took us there. I said we would establish permanent orbital colonies as waypoints to and from Earth, around the Moon, and now, on the moon itself; you took us all of those places.

I said we would need to focus on transport, in general, and now you are going to Enceladus, Titan, Europa... far too many destinations await expeditions en-route, already, to name. I am extremely awed to see this abundance of enterprising endeavor.

But just as Saturn casts a shadow on its rings, I find that all we have accomplished together has cast a shadow on our future. 

I have been an advocate of advancement of all forms. For decades after I founded Asimov, we worked on curbing the dangers of general artificial intelligence. And, with the exception of the abuses of some hackers - to make use of an antiquated term - we have been successful. But I must speak now of the successes of these rogues and criminals, who have often been labeled revolutionaries or enemies. I do not support them, of course, but we have been watching them, learning from them, and removing their resources the best that we can.

We've verified the following very cautiously with our own methods. We've used the most advanced techniques available, confirmed them in confidence with trustworthy partners, and there is, (and please note that these methods are rigorous and have been in development since Mars was a pipe dream - again, forgive my old age for the idiom), there is a less than one in ten thousand percent chance that we have arrived at a faulty conclusion.

Our information networks have been accessed by a faster-than-light communication system which defies all known physical phenomena we are yet aware of, including the Blevins-Petrov-Ngyuen fundamental symmetry reversal that so radically shook our understanding of natural phenomena. 

The origin of these, excuse me for the lack of a better term, almost mystical hacks - pardon again the antiquated terminology - appears to be, in fact, outside our own solar system.

We have been able to determine the apparent location of the hub that is accessing our interplanetary networks, and it is approaching with great speed. According to the prognosis my physicians have given me, I will have expired by the time they arrive, but this date is quickly approaching.

I urge the Solar Councils, the Planetary Governors, and all nations to act immediately. Do not take arms, but prepare for the worst. The agenda of these visitors is unknown. They have likely been watching for a very long time, and perhaps have chosen this moment, when we have taken to space, to peacefully approach us. But they may see a rapidly expanding young civilization as potential threat in the future. 

You must be prepared for every eventuality.

I have directed the Research and Development labs of Bioptim to distribute to each of the various governing bodies a number of samples of chemical agents, bacteria, and virii, all of which are inert to terrestrial life but potentially lethal to numerous proposed forms of extraterrestrial life.

These are to be used only as a final defense, in the event that our visitors are hostile. In the unlikely event that these visitors are peaceful, do not take arms. Learn from them. Let them learn from us.

We have accomplished much since our first steps on our second home planet, and I spoke often of the possibility of this day, but ultimately did nothing to prevent what may come. I have failed you. Please, preserve all we have done. You must continue to expand into the stars.

Batman has no choice but to go after this John Wick.",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"John Wick stepped into the hub. A warehouse on the docks of Gotham, a safe haven for the contractors and killers located in the city. Wick brushed passed a well armored man with an eye patch. The white haired mercenary looked John up and down, then continued towards the exit. Wick pushed through the crowds until he reached the counter. Well dressed clerks stood in front of massive screens listing hundreds of contracts. The occasional black letters would switch red with a simple ""TERMINATED"" being attached to the end. John put his finger up and nodded to an attendant. John felt his phone buzz. 

""New contract- Batman""

John hit the small green accept button and made his way outside. He felt a hand on his shoulder as he left.

""You really don't wanna take that one"" Another masked man said, he wore a glowing red device over his right eye.

""You gonna try and stop me?"" Wick replied.

""No, but your target will"" The man continued ""Let me help, I'll split the bounty""

""How generous"" Wick laughed ""I'll pass""

""Have fun in Arkham"" The man said walking away, waving a dismissive arm. 

John drove through the city searching for anything related to a 'batman'. 

""Everyone's got a gimmick"" John laughed to himself.

A light burned through the foggy night sky above. The symbol of a bat was plastered to the bottom of the clouds, coming straight from a rooftop on the same street. John pulled the car over and rushed out, patting himself down. He counted two pistols and a small sub machine gun strapped to his waist. Wick shoved down the door to the beat down building. The interior smelled of sewage and smoke. He sped up the cement steps and made his way to the roof almost out of breath. He saw the silhouette of a man with a trench coat. It swayed in the cold city wind. John ducked behind the door and peeked through the crack. A flurry of black fabric flew through the air. In a moment a man stood in front of the flood light. His masked face was contorted into a grimace. They exchanged pleasantries and discussed a case. Wick took aim at the ""Bat"" mans unguarded chin. He glanced in Johns direction as he pulled the trigger. He brought his fist up and deflected the bullet with his wrist plate. Wick threw open the door and began firing. John put two bullets into the coated man. He collapsed onto the roof. The Batman sprinted in my direction pulling small knives from his belt. The batman seemed unfazed at the rain of bullets. By the time the clips where empty he was half way across the roof. Wick slammed the door shut and began loading the sub machine gun. Knives pierced through the door around Johns head. He pointed the barrel at the door ready to fire as soon as it opened. Silence filled the stairwell. The door slammed inwards shoving Wick back. He saw the batman standing in the door way, fists raised. Wick raised a gun but heard the fire of a rifle. The Batman looked just as surprised as John. Wick looked through his targets legs and saw the red eyed man, holding a smoking sniper rifle. The Batman swung around to face the new challenger. Wick threw himself around the mans neck and pulled back down the stairwell. As they tumbled he saw the masked man rush towards them, reloading the rifle. Wick felt an elbow slam into his torso. He pulled tighter on the Bats neck. He heard more shots from the top of the stairwell. The target groaned but kept pounding at Wicks stomach. John reached for one of his pistols inside the jacket and placed it to his head. He shoved one of his black knives into Wicks leg. He pulled the trigger. 

John stood up over the Bat and looked at the red eyed man.

"[EU] An extremely lethal hit man has arrived in the city, waging his own personal war of vengeance. Batman has no choice but to go after this John Wick.",SirFluffyTheTerrible,"Worth noting, spoilers for *John Wick: Chapter 2* are below.

---

It was a dark night in Gotham, thick rain clouds blocked out the sliver of moon that hung high in the sky. Wayne barely felt the chill breeze that surrounded him on top of the tower, though Alfred would probably have some choice words to say to him on his return.

He scanned the surrounding streets, piercing the night with a pair of high-powered binoculars. He skimmed the night vision and thermal modes, knowing they wouldn't help at this height, but it didn't hurt to do a quick scan. Wayne's thoughts drifted back to why he was out here, why he was hunting down this particular quarry. His contacts in the city had warned him of a mass-delivered message that had been sent from the underground organization called, 'The Continental', a group of skilled hitmen. A kill order had been sent out on one of their members, which on it's own was no small news. However, what drew Wayne's eye was the name attached to the order. John Wick. Every two-bit hitman in the city would be out for his blood, to end the infamous 'Baba Yaga' and gain the glory to go with it.

It would be a bloodbath. Wayne needed to end this before it got out of hand and innocent people were caught in the crossfire. He scanned the city again, before catching sight of the dark Mustang, roaring down Gotham's tight mazelike streets. Wick really needed to get a less conspicuous car. Wayne reached to his belt and withdrew his grappling hook, shooting it out into the night. He wouldn't be able to catch Wayne swinging from the rooftops, but Wayne had an alternative transport stashed nearby.

---

The Batpod roared to life and leaped out of the hidden garage, bouncing slightly as it hit the asphalt, water was flung in streaks as Batman oriented himself in the direction he had seen Wick heading. The man was likely heading to some shady motel, to try to lay low for a while. Unfortunately, shady motels were prone to having money change hands, and the wrong person being given the guest list.

Tearing down the street, dark cape flapping like a black flag behind him, Batman made an imposing sight to any cars he passed. They veered to the side, letting him pass, almost as if he were an emergency vehicle on the way to a crime scene. Considering who he was, and what his destination often involved, it was an apt comparison.

Batman came up upon the motel, a little rundown place at the edge of Gotham's commercial district, forgotten by the hustle and bustle of the big city. It would likely be demolished in the coming years to make way for the next big city project, but for now it offered a small peace from the big city life. Perhaps that was all Wick was looking for in life, Batman mused. Peace, after a lifetime of murder and bloodshed. He abandoned the Batpod before the roar of it's engine would give him away to anyone watching, and if he knew Wick, Wick would be watching.

Batman clambered onto the roof of the motel, silently stepping across the slanted surface, the tiles slick from the rain. Farthest room back, he figured. It'd be out of sight, and out of mind of most people. Batman leaped onto the balcony's railing, landing with feline grace and subtlety.

Wick was waiting for him. Pistol at the ready, an arm attempting to shield his dog.

""Was I that obvious?"" Batman asked, dismounting onto the balcony proper.

""It's been a long day, sort of... sets you on edge for the slightest sound."" He angled the pistol down, ""Plus, I was expecting you. I need help.""

Batman withdrew a phone from one of his various pockets, and inspected the screen, ""I heard. Excommunicate. It's impressive that you managed to stay out of trouble this long, even for you.""

""Is there... anything you can do?""

A smile crept across Batman's normally inexpressive face. ""Secret identities and new lives are what I do for a living, Wick.""",RoDDusty

Her ship throttles, waiting for her turn at the jumpgate. Her eyes wander up and across the multitude of stars. The sight lets her drift in thought for a long time, able to wander mentally away from life as she knows it. 

“You always look so distant when you’re looking out there at the stars.” Leo’s voice startles her back into reality. Jynna edges the ship forward, there being no clear from the tower as of yet though. “What are you thinking about?” 

“It’s nothing.” Jynna starts checking panels, unwilling to speak to him. “You shouldn’t be up here. We’ll be jumping soon to hit Armstrong Station.” 

“The last jump just happened and they were going out towards Trappist. It’s ten minutes to realign back to Armstrong. So I think I’ve still got five minutes.” Leo chuckles softly at her, coming up and leaning over to peer out at the stars himself. “So what are you thinking about when you look up at the stars?” 

Jynna stays quiet, falling still before drawing her gaze up to look out at the sea of stars again. 

“I still wonder, you know. I still sit and stare at the stars and wonder,” Jynna finally states. The distant stars gleam coldly, a few flickering. 

“About what?” Leo questions, attention turning back to her. 

“I wonder if there’s more out there.” Jynna’s voice is quiet. “All that alien life there’s all those stories about, if it’s really somewhere out there. If there’s something out there other than just humans.” Jynna shakes her head, focusing back down on the tower. There’s no call yet. She taps the panel to make sure it’s working.

“Your comm is working just fine.” Leo assures her with a chuckle. He stays quiet for a while, looking out again at the stars. “Maybe it is and we just haven’t gone far enough. They’re working on that trip to Andromeda.” 

“Yeah, I know they are.” Jynna frowns at him. “Go back and take your seat. The ten minutes is almost up.” 

“Excited to get rid of me, huh?” Leo grins at her. He pats the chair lightly. “You keep daydreaming about aliens. Makes you more interesting than any other pilot.” He turns and ducks out of the door to the cockpit. 

“Is that why you keep fucking my trips up demanding I take you somewhere?” Jynna calls after him, scowling. “I’m not your personal taxi service, asshole!” 

“You’re so interesting though!” Leo calls up, already out of sight down the ladder. 

Jynna grumbles as her comm lights up. She’d have it out with him later. For now, she’s got a jump to make. ",Syraphia

"[WP] You have the superpower of mildly convenient coincidences. Clouds always make sure you're in just the right amount of shade, and traffic lights are always green for you.",Nulono,"In a world of superheroes with impressive abilities like super strength, flight, super healing or lightning speed, it's easy to miss the heroes with smaller or not as impressive powers. Like the girl who can command squirrels, for example. Or that guy who calls himself the ""Arm Fall Off Boy"". With just the ability to detach his arm. Like, really.

We could never compare to the great likes of the Tier 1 superheroes, those who could move planets and mountains with just a simple tug, or can circle the world a few times over in a few seconds. No, we couldn't. To them we're just no different than the ordinary non-powered humans. 

Still, we still try to make do with what we have, trying to make the world a better place one small act at a time. We take on the small cases that the bigger superheroes don't have time for. 

Like this warehouse that I am walking into right now. The mum called and reported that her daughter was kidnapped by a couple of shady guys outside of her house, presumably by the jealous ex-boyfriend who got dumped. With the rest of the League and police force fighting the alien army that is still pouring out from the portal above the city, the dispatcher didn't have much of a choice but to turn to us small time freelancers for help.

I groan as I push the giant wooden door open, which was conveniently left unlocked. From within the warehouse, i can hear the sound of two guys laughing, mixed with the shrieks of a terrified girl. It's going to be a quick case, I tell myself, just like all the other cases that I took. After all, it's my superpower to make things convenient. I follow the noise to the middle section of the warehouse, finding two hooded figures and a girl tied to the chair.

""Alright, cut it out, hand in yourself before anyone gets hurt,"" I shout rather uninterestedly. The law mandates us to at least give a warning to our targets before arresting them, which is a waste of time, because who in their right mind would actually listen?

The two guys laugh at me, a reaction that I was too used to. After all, my appearance is nowhere as imposing or recognizable. It is kind of generic too, as I prefer to dress more comfortably than in style. T-shirt, jeans. More than enough.

The taller of the two points a gun at me. ""Get out of here, loser, and we make sure you don't end up in the hospital.""

I sigh. ""I don't want to do this, but you give me no choice,"" I say as I walk slowly towards the girl. 

The first guy tries to shoot me, but to his dismay discovers that the gun is jammed. The shorter guy, seeing that his friend is in difficulty, takes out a knife and rushes at me. He probably did not see the puddle of oil on the floor, as he slips on it, falling down and knocks himself out as his head hit the concrete floor.

The first guy, seeing that his friend is passed out, begins to panic. He fumbles around for a weapon, though not fast enough for me. I deliver a punch to his head, which luckily for me is just enough to knock him out too.

I make my way to the girl, who is repeating utterances of thank you over and over. I tell her that it is okay, as it was my job anyway. 

""At least tell me your name?"" she asks, to which I smile.

""My name is MC Hero, also known as the Mildly Convenient Hero, who the clouds shade just right and the light always turn green for.""

[WP] A character with realistically portrayed social anxiety gets his happy ending,L_James,"""You... you... don't understand. This anxiety is not... something we can just turn off. It's... it's not like a switch,"" John was surprised he stammered through the entire sentence. The girl opposite has just finished rolling her eyes. It was a reaction that he was well used to by then.

She gave a long groan, her feet tapping impatiently as she searched for the right words to use. ""Look, John, this is not working out. I tried to make you a better person, to be more outgoing, but if you're unwilling to even try, I am not going to waste my time."" She picked up her bags and stormed off.

John continued to stand there, his eyes still staring at the concrete floor. She was not the first one who did not understand him. She was not the first one who left either. He let out a defeated sigh, certain that he was going to remain a loner for his entire life.

A voice coming from his back startled him. ""I get that a lot too.""

He turned behind and saw a girl standing not far from him, her face partially hidden behind a pillar. She has shoulder length hair, and her thick black glasses suggested that she belonged to the same social class as John.

""Yeah,"" John murmured, feeling a sense of kinship with the girl. ""It sucks when they don't understand.""

The girl nodded her head. ""I know a place where you can just sit down and just relax for a while.""

John smiled. ""Yeah, that'd be good."" He noticed the girl blushing, followed his own cheeks feeling hot. His heart thumped harder than usual. Both of them looked away at the same time.

""This way,"" the girl whispered, as John followed not far from her. She brought him to a small clearing behind the school, overlooked by a tall and grand tree. They sat beneath the sprawling canopy of green together, somehow perfectly comfortable with each other's silence, staring at the clouds and the blue sky.

It was not such a bad day after all, John thought.

"[WP] Every person you kill or have seen die has their consciousness transferred into your mind. They can speak, have free will, and are essentially just the same, simply living on in your head.",Peed_Niy,"Kalrak stared apprehensively at the console before him as it counted down the distance between his ship and the land before him. Earth, as how the inhabitants used to call the planet. ""Now, there's only one,"" Kalrak thought to himself, repeating Captain Bzolark's observations from the mission brief earlier.

The ship lurched to a halt as it hit the ground below, the overhead alarm blaring as the metal door before him and his two lieutenants slid noisily open. Command had sent Kalrak and his team as the first contact party, to link up with Earth's sole inhabitant, though Karak did not understand the need for such formalities. After all, it's just one puny alien.

As the noise around them died down, Kalrak stepped slowly out of the ship, his thick boot crunching against the sand beneath his feet. His eyes took a moment to adjust to the bright blue sky and the white clouds above him. In the distance, he could see towers made of glass gleaming under the system's only star, the Sun. 

The planet used to house billions, that was what the mission brief said. But standing before him, there was only one.

""Welcome,"" the alien said, it's eyes stayed fixed on Kalrak. Its voice sounded like countless voices blended into one, and the ground itself echoed with it. ""To **OUR** humble abode called earth.""

""It is our pleasure,"" Kalrak stammered, feeling an unexplainable fear rising in him. It was just one alien, he tried reasoning again, but there was something about the approaching alien that seemed off, hostile. His hands reached instinctively for his sidearm. 

""As a representative of the United Federation of-""

Kalrak didn't even get to finish his last sentence, as the alien suddenly launched itself at Kalrak, at a speed that Kalrak never thought possible. A sharp stab pierced through his armor before he could even pull out his gun, as the familiar bursts of energy shots rang behind him.

As his vision faded into darkness, Kalrak felt sharp pull as his consciousness, as if going down a confusing spiral. There was a blend of noises and colours. When Kalrak's vision finally returned to him, he found himself staring at his own dead body.

""Is this the afterlife?"" he asked, only to be responded with almost seven billion voices. 

""No, you're in **OUR** home now.""

[WP] An NPC in a twenty six year old's save file wakes up to the alternate save file created by the player's nine year old younger cousin.,KingRodent,"""This is weird,"" Villager #24 thought as he exited his house on a fine Monday morning, except that his house wasn't really there anymore. The roof had holes in them, and there was an entire chunk of wall missing. Not to mention that his collection of furniture was all gone. Only the wooden door remained in place.

""Excuse me, do you know what happened to my house?"" Villager #24 asked the passing Villager #16, who was busy staring at what used to be the village's wheat field, only that there was no longer any wheat growing on it.

""What do you mean by what happened to your house?"" Villager #16 replied.

""There's a part of my roof missing, not to mention that my furniture and my wall is gone too.""

""Oh, must be the **Adventurer** who took them,"" Villager #16 responded curtly, before moving to stare at a floating tree trunk.

""What do you mean the **Adventurer** took them?"" Villager #24 pressed, following closely behind Villager #16. The last he remembered, the **Adventurer** was an innovative builder and inventor, creating gigantic structures that towered above his small village, but yet benevolent enough to leave their village alone. He even occasionally conducted trades with them. How could he be a thief?

""Oh he just took everything!"" Villager #16 said matter-of-factly, attempting to point towards the village with his two fused hands.

Villager #24 turned towards the direction of Villager #16's elbow, and was shocked to see his one beautiful village was filled with half-broken down homes, with blocks of dirt lying randomly everywhere.

""Ah!"" he screamed, unable to recognize the village he used to know.

""Ah!"" Villager #16 screamed with him.

""Why did you scream?"" Villager #24 asked Villager #16. 

""I'm just following you,"" Villager #16 grinned.

Villager #24 wanted to face-palm, but then again, his fused hands prevented him from doing so. They prevented him from doing a lot of things.

He looked again at the sight before him. It was not a world that he knew. Perhaps the **Adventurer** can explain what was going on. He will need to do what no villager had done before.

""Would you follow me on a grand adventure to find the **Adventurer**?"" he asked Villager #16, who was then staring at a passing pig.

""Sure, sounds like fun!"" Villager #16 exclaimed, as they both walked in the direction of the setting sun, which was square in shape.

Your guardian angel is Lucifer.",halt_den_Mund,"The smoldering ruins of the crashed aircraft laid before my eyes, the ground around it either charred to black or still has flames licking around it. Luggage, clothes, debris and human remains were strewn all over. The plane had disintegrated into several pieces when it crash landed, sending up a ball of flame visible from miles away. From what my eyes could see, there was little chance anyone survived such a devastating crash.

Even out in the wilderness, it seemed that my ability to inflict suffering and death unto others was still as potent. A burning anger boiled within me. And anger that had followed me since I was old enough to realize the curse that I was inflicted with. The air crash was the last piece of straw.

""Come out!"" I yelled, in a way that I have not in years.

The painful memories slowly crept back to me as I stood amidst the burning wreckage. I was crossing the street when I was seven, oblivious to a car speeding right at me. The car honked but I was frozen there in place, my legs paralyzed by fear. When I opened my eyes, however, by some strange miracle the car had crashed into lamp post next to me.

My parents told me that I was lucky to be alive, though the driver of the car and his three others were not. The driver and front passenger died on the spot, while the other two died in the hospital. My first ever victims.

""COME OUT!"" I screamed again, at the top of my lungs, not sure what I was expecting. For years I had thought it was me, that I was the harbinger of bad luck to the people around me. While things turned out fine for me, they were not the same for the people around me. It was not long before others started noticing too.

Like the time when I sat for the state PSLE exam when I was twelve. It was an important exam, but my had overslept and I was late by almost an hour to school. I was so certain that I was going to fail, but that didn't kept me from praying that some miracle would save me.

It did. When I reached school, the exam had to be postponed because the head invigilator suffered a fatal heart attack as she was handing out the papers. Another person's life at my own expense. I never dared pray after the incident.

""**COME OUT!**"" I shouted for the third time, my voice already hoarse. For years I had lived in the forest, hoping to exile myself from tormenting others. I thought it would be the end of my curse unto others. To have a plane crash so closely to me, it was definitely not an accident. And I was beginning to suspect that it was not only my fault.

There was a brief flash of flames not far from where I stood, revealing a man who was dressed in a black suit and pants. His skin was flaming red, head to toe, and sticking from beneath his slickly combed hair, was the unmistakable sight of two grey horns.

""Who are you?"" I asked.

The man grinned, his round black eyes piercing into my soul. ""My name's Lucifer, and I am your guardian angel.""

[WP] You're a real estate agent for otherworldly mystical homes. It's you first day at the job.,Pixadot,"I've never flown an airplane. Never had the lives of a 500-odd people riding on a wheel in my hands. But if I had to imagine, this was probably the closest I would ever get. The Agency was counting on me... me! A twenty-year old kid with nothing to show for my life but a high school diploma. As I donned the burgundy jacket I grew at least two centimeters.
  
I know what y'all thinking: 'selling a house, whats the big deal Broseph?'. But it is! A big deal that is. Since the former mansion of a former vampire was sold back in May and it turned out that the stove transformed old socks into bars of gold the demand for otherworldly homes has skyrocketed. It had only been a matter of time before *Joan King's Real Estate* cornered the market with its knowledgable panel of unnatural experts and now I was the only one standing between The Agency and potential corporate espionage. As I straightened my tie the doorbell suddenly rang. I peeked at my watch, the open house didn't start for another hour. Still, I went and checked on the door.
  
An old man stepped in from the doorway as soon I had opened the door and immediately started looking around without as much as a 'hello'. At first I almost panicked but my guard was quickly lowered. After all, a fragile old man didn't pose much of a threat. He probably had just forgotten to account for daylight savings time.  
""Sir, are you perhaps here to see the house?"", I chirped as happily as I possibly could. He didn't seem to notice me talking. Instead he continued to shuffle around the house, poking and looking at every little detail. I tried again and again to get a response as the time steadily crept closer to the open house but he didn't let out a word. I started to lose my temper and as we passed the kitchen for the third time I almost roared:
""Please, Sir! May I know if you're here for the open house‽"", large puddles of sweat was forming on my shiny new jacket. To my great surprise the old man finally turned around and faced me with a devious look on his face.  
""No. But I'll take the house"", he almost laughed as he handed me a gym bag full of cash.
  
After the initial chock had faded and I regrettably had to reject almost thirty, rather angry, prospective buyers at the door I conjured up the paperwork for the purchase. The old man signed it without as much as casting a glance at it and then shook my hand vigorously. As he shook it he leaned in a whispered something in my ear:  
""Broom closet - Second floor bathroom. Tuesdays between 05:32 and about 22:00"". Rather perplexed I let go of his hand and stood stuck to the ground as he headed towards the door. Just as he was about to close it he turned around one last time:  
""See you in fifty years or so!"". After a few minutes, when I regained my ability to move, I noticed that he had forgotten the deed to the house on the kitchen table. I quickly skimmed trough it in order to get some contact information but stopped when I saw the signature. That was my name.",PoetenGeten

Captain Taylor sat in her study with a bowl full of stew.  
  
But that a gal is good at heart does not not at all infer,  
that she isn't clever and smart and knows when people try to fool her.    
    
Before she sent her crow away she tied a little vial,   
around his neck under feathers grey with a string of finest lisle.  
  
And when Captain Taylor didn't see, it swiftly poured into,  
her giant bowl and her cup of tea, a preposterously spicy stew.  
  
As soon as she took a bite her face was drained of glee,  
without even a fight she jumped into a quenching sea.    
  
After collecting every cent she owe it flew back to its canal,  
and just outside her tiny chateau waited a good-natured gal.

It's now been the third year in a row.",Maninahouse,"As usual with anything Hufflepuff almost forty people had happily RSVP'd that they would attend the meeting but nearly twenty minutes after the appointed time only I, Flo Holloway and Peter Winthrop had actually bothered to show up (and let's face it - Peter was probably only here for the free Mice pops). My eyes darted nervously around the room when Flo suddenly cleared her throat.  
""Perhaps we should get started Honora"", she said glancing in my direction. I smiled back, trying not to give the impression that the speech I'd written probably wouldn't have the same effect on two people as on the large crowd I had imagined as I wrote it. Still, now was as good a time as any to start.  
""Fellow Hufflepuffs! Thank you for joining me in the inaugural meeting of the *Students Loving OWL-Testing Hidden Society*. I believe nobody has managed to miss the fact that this year's, as well as the two previous year's, exams have been cancelled or interrupted by some crazy antics from the Gryffindor house"", as I felt like a started to enter a flow in the speech Flo raised her hand with a enthusiasm seldom seen. I awkwardly pointed in her direction.  
""I certainly haven't missed it"", she added. Peter was still digging around in the now much emptier bowl of sweets. I continued:  
""Of course you haven't Miss Holloway! In fact I, and many with me I might add, think this has gone way to far. Why should we have to study transformation charms 'till sunrise if all the Gryffindors have to do is let a griffon loose in the Great Hall or paint messages in blood alluring to a hideous monster that eats muggle-borns"", Flo nodded a bit too agreeingly with every sentence that left my lips but this time it was Peter that raised his hand a bit unobtrusive.  
""Yes, Peter?"", I asked almost knowing what was coming.  
""Yeah, sorry for disturbing 'Nora but will there be anymore of these Mice pops?"".  
""No, sorry"".

Not a single drop of blood (and it had been a pretty  deep cut as well). Fifteen years working with heavy machinery and this is how I discovered it? Stupid Kazuo; I could have easily stayed home, browse trough series on netflix that neither of us would realisticly ever give a chance before going to bed early with his arm around me. For him every friday had to be something special. It had started out small, some quirky little board game he dug out from a box in the attic, but escalated far to quickly. Underground Salsa Clubs, experimental pottery exhibitions, concerts with indie rock bands that were so new they lacked a drummer. And now I sat here, a grown woman, almost crying over not bleeding in my finger in a suspiciously clean bathroom stall at the local community centre. I guess I should feel lucky, guess I should be happy that I was chosen. But I wasn't. I never asked to become the next Mother bloody Theresa. I'd always wanted to live my life as I preferred my steaks: boringly conventional and with a large helping of mashed potatoes.  
""El? Are you in here?"", it was him. Although I didn't answer it was hard to miss my sniveling.  
""What happened sweetie? They're worried out there you know? Even Peter almost burned his almonds"", his voice was as assuring as ever. Even if I had no idea how he would react I turned open the hatch to my stall without a doubt in my mind. As he opened the door my eyes found his, those gorgeous dark eyes that I had stared into for hours on end. He didn't say a single word, he didn't have to. I gestured to him to come closer and as he put his hand on my arm I showed him my finger. At first he didn't seem to get it, but as soon as he did I could see on his face that the gears were turning inside his head. And then he looked wide-eyed at me again, just about to say something. But he stopped himself and his expression disappeared. Instead he embraced me and whispered something smoothly in my ear:

One day you're crawling around, a lesser demon, trying to make some bloke's day marginally worse and then: BOOM! Promotion, and the big one at that!"", although enthusiastic Bad Breath surely lived up to his name. It was hard shielding your face from the stench and looking interested at the same time but I sure tried my best. That was more than could be said about Petulance who looked so enraged that she could have easily killed him at any given moment. Well, if it wasn't for the fact that none of us really were alive to begin with. As Bore was almost sleeping I felt the need to interrupt Bad Breath's meandering monolog.  
""Right, perhaps we should get this show on the road. Judgement doesn't wait for no one and all that jazz"", I felt how my hand started sweating. I really wasn't apt for this whole 'Apocalypse'-thing but when they ask you personally you just don't say no. At least Bad Breath and Petulance seemed to be paying attention.  
""First things first: there should be some horses around here. One white, one red, one black and one pale if I remember correctly"", I looked around the barren landscape; Not a horse in sight.  
""What about that stable?"", Bad Breath suggested, spreading an odour reminiscent of rotten salmon covered in two month old garbage. We made our way to  the ominous-looking stable situated next to a smallish pond. 

The smell of hay was subdued by the mere presence of Bad Breath but this was definitely the right place. Four enormous stable boxes were locked behind iron gates with padlocks as big as a human head. As we got closer I felt something in my pocket: a key! Before I had time to inspect it further Bad Breath had already ran up to a gate which started glowing red and displayed a name in a long forgotten language.  
""Guys! I think this is mine"", he called out whilst putting the key in the lock. As soon as he did it the iron gate disintegrated into sand which danced out from the stable on a sudden breeze. A scarlet horse, towering over us, snorted boomingly.  
""Wow, great! I guess I got the red one guys!"", Bad Breath shouted with glee, trying to position an impossibly long ladder so he could use it to mount the horse. As I glanced to my side I realised Petulance was gone and when I looked back into the box again I knew why. She was stomping her way towards Bad Breath.  
""I call dibs on the red one so beat it stink-mouth!"", I was thinking of ways I could diffuse the situation but my feet were oddly stuck to the ground.   
""You can't call dibs on a horse which I had the key to. Besides, she matches my robes - It's a mach made in hell! I'll tell you what: let me ride on her today and then we'll switch tomorrow. What do you say?"", as much as Bad Breath had tried Petulance didn't say a single word. Instead she punched him square in the stomach, making him fall of the ladder and writhe in agony on the dusty ground. I let out a small sigh as I turned around to Bore, who of course had fallen asleep.  ",PoetenGeten
"[WP] Multiple sightings of a mystery man who goes to people's doorstep just to smack people in the face. Victims who are smacked suddenly remember all their memories starting from childbirth. One day, he appears at your doorstep.",Substandard_Memer,"I had to check again. Shit, I was right. My eyes darted around the hall for something, anything, but my mind blanked. He rang the doorbell once more and through the peephole I could see him adjusting his leather gloves. It was quite obvious that he wouldn't leave until I opened the door. So I ran.

A good couple of kilometers into the woods behind my house I thought I had managed to lose him. But just as I slowed down I heard the sound of twigs and dry leaves being crushed behind me. I picked up the phase once more, keeping my sight forwards. The sound of cars was getting louder. Before I knew it I emerged from the forrest at a gas station I had never seen before. Thinking on my feet I jumped into the back of a taxi who was just done filling up and urged him to go.  
""Where to buddy?"", he cheerfully asked, unaware of my pursuer.  
""Anywhere, but make it quick!"", I replied. And off we went. Just as I was about to catch my breath I saw him in the rear-view mirror, smiling behind the wheel of a jet black convertible.  
""I've changed my mind; Take me to the airport!"", I blurted out to the driver. Within the our I was up above the clouds.

Three weeks later I was getting ready for dinner (tonight's special was Pig roast). The shirt was almost glued to my skin in the tropical heat but I couldn't change it now, it went perfectly with my new watch. Just as I was about to insert my contact lenses I heard a knock on the door.   
""Yes?"", I shouted perplexed.  
""Room Service"".  
""I haven't ordered anything"", I said raising my proverbial eye brow.   
""Compliments of the house sir! This is your twentieth consecutive night staying with us and we would like to present a small gesture of our gratitude towards your continued patronage"", the man behind the door chirped obsequiously. As I opened the door I felt like the most gullible person on earth and when he slapped me across the face I fell to my knees.

The coffee was everywhere. I trembled like a leaf and saw it come closer, a terrifying beast who walked on all four legs. It started to lap up the coffee with the dreadfully flat face. As slowly as I could I reached for the phone whilst maintaining a close eye on the creature below. The phone rang once. The phone rang twice. The phone rang three times before he answered:  
""Hello..."", he was whispering almost inaudibly with a small tremor in his voice.  
""Honey, I know this sounds crazy but there is a monster in the kitchen"", as soon as I started talking the beast looked up at me with a dead stare. He didn't answer right away.      
""I believe you. They are here as well, work is crawling with them. Luckily most seem to be trapped in small cages but one or two seem to be roaming around freely, surely looking for weak prey"".

I could hardly believe it: Alice was gone. Carelessly I knocked over a bowl of fruit which landed next to the monster. At first it seemed to startle it but then it looked curiously back to me. It grabbed an orange with its sharp teeth and tried to reach it to me (although it was far to short). I looked into the big black eyes and without knowing what I was doing I grabbed the orange from its mighty jaws. Confused I decided to throw it again, this time on purpose. It quickly returned the fruit once more, running around in circles with its tongue out when I took it. A warm fuzzy feeling started growing inside me. I grabbed the phone:

It sat behind the television, forgotten. The memory of laughter haunted the room; cobwebs claimed their prize. A clock ticked until it didn't. Time passed; darkness grew.

Thankfully, this crew is used to surprising antics and complicated relationships. Welcome to The Office: Area 51.",averykrouse,"**1LT Schrute**: Would I ever tell the truth about area 51? No, of course not. I know how to keep a secret - that's why I work here. Of course, Chinese water torture is the exception that proves the rule. The incessant *drip drip drip* as water smacks your forehead like some kind of watery machine gun hitting the over-ripe flesh of a particularly juicy blueberry - I'd be singing like a songbird in five minutes flat. 

Oh, and money.


**Captain Scott**: Do I run a tight ship? *Of course I do!* But at the same time, I think there are two ways to do something right. The normal way, and the *better* way - my troops call that the *Captain Scott* way, which I think is pretty affectionate. It's important that your subordinates love you as much as they respect you. Do they love *me*? Come on! You've spoken to them.  Come on... really? *Really?!* They'd kill their own mom's before saying something negative about me!

**2LT Beesly**: Hahaha - I'm sorry, but - *hahahaha!* I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. What was the question again? Do we lov- *hahaha*

**1LT Shrute**: Respect him? Of course! He still holds the record time for both loading an M4 carbine, **and** for polishing ten pairs of size 11 boots to regulation standards. How can you not respect a man like that? Of course, any sign of weakness on the field and I'd slit his throat as if he were a suckling pig back on the farm. Then, I would hold up his severed head and howl into the air while urinating on his body. In a military situation, you can't allow your troops to smell weakness - or you've lost them! *Snap!* Just like that! And that would put everyone in danger. So, I'd show I'm the alpha male, kill the captain and take command of the troops - *and their respect* - forthwith.

**2LT Creed Bratton:** This? It's an animal head. I think that's pretty clear. Nope, don't know what kind. But it's got a lot of eyes! I don't have time to beat around the bush here - I got a lot more buyers coming soon. You interested, or not?

**2LT Halpert**: Lieutenant! Hold very still! There's some kind of alien parasite attached to your head. I'm going to try to blast if off.

**1LT Schrute**: Hold fire, Colonel; I can communicate with 131 different types of alien life. I might be able to-

**2LT Halpert**: There's no time! It's sucking your brain out! I'm pretty certain it's a facehugger.

**1LT Schrute**: Jim! They are from the 1979 horror-fiction movie, Alien. They **do not** exist. Do not fire that gun! If you-

**2LT  Halpert**: It's just a water pistol, Lieutenant. I'll wash the alien right off-

**1LT Schrute**: A water pistol? Jim!- pshw dsadha!

**2LT Halpert**: My mistake, Lieutenant. I guess it was just your forehead. You have to admit, it's pretty odd looking.

**1LT Schrute**: You're so dishonourably discharged! Captain! **Captain!!**

---

**Captain Scott**: No! Don't ask me about Corporal Toby Flenderson. Ugh! This is meant to be a light-hearted documentary about aliens, let's not- oh, it's not? Well, whatever - let me just say this about Toby: if Hitler, Frankenstein and Satan had a baby... it would probably hate Toby as much as I do. *Everyone* hates Toby.


**2LT Stanley Hudson:** Why did I enlist? I ask myself that very question every, single, day. You do get to see some weird *beep* here, at least. And, I suppose I thought I might get fit, or else die trying. To tell you the truth, I think I'm ready to die.

**Captain Scott**: I wouldn't change them for the world. They're not my troops. They're my family. And I'm theirs. I'm like everyone's father - but I didn't run away when they were babies, and I didn't beat them when they were nine - and sometimes I *do* take them to the ice cream parlour. Well, not literally - but I have gotten them extra rations before. 

They'd die for me. And, I'd die for them.

Two months after you left, FTL travel was discovered, and you land on a completely terraformed and populated planet getting ready for it's centennial.",soulreaverdan,"Julián followed Rammack as he led him through the bio-dome.

""You seem distracted, Captain,"" said Rammack, ""but you needn't worry. Your crew are being well looked after. Our medical teams are simply examining them to make sure they are healthy. It was a long journey, after all.""

Julián nodded and gave a curt smile.

""This, Captain Pousa,"" announced Rammack proudly as he stretched his arms out wide, ""is the very heart of the colony. It is our home, if you will. We have divided it into three sections: habitation, research and medical.""

""It seems... kind of small,"" Julián mused out loud, ""at least, for a growing colony.""

""Unfortunately the terraformation has not been fully completed yet. We have beauty out there -yes - and even certain plant life. But it is not yet safe for us. Not for perhaps... two hundred years, maybe a little more. Then, once the air is breathable, we may leave the dome and our population may grow.""

""So, it's static growth right now? A one in, one out kind of deal."" Julián's cheeks quickly turned to the same stewed-red as the sky far above the dome. ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be callous about it; I can't imagine how close you all are."" His first diplomatic mission and he'd already put his foot in it. He cursed himself and blamed it on the long-sleep. 

""Yes, we have grown very close. But please, there is no need to apologise. In a way it *is* one in, one out.""

*There's no room for us in this dome*, Julián thought. *Not to live, at any rate. We'd have to start a separate colony*. He smiled at the idea. The disappointment he'd felt at being unfairly pipped to the post, faded ever so slightly. Faster than light technology - he still couldn't believe it. But Rammack's FTL drive had become unstable upon reaching Calma. Even for them it had been relatively new technology. Now, both crews were stuck here. 

Julián gathered his thoughts as Rammack led him into the medi-center. ""You said: *in a way it's one in one out*? I don't think I understand what you mean.""

Rammack turned to him, his grey hair contrasting his youthful blue eyes. ""Our mission was different to yours. We were not meant to populate this world; we were simply scientists sent to transform the planet for possible future human habitation. We were not meant to be stuck here. And we won't be.""

Julián thought he heard a distant noise, like a short sharp scream, but Rammack hadn't flinched so he ignored it. ""Well we're out of fuel and your FTL drive's kaput, so I don'-""

Rammack held a hand up to silence him. ""**We will not die here!**"" He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. ""I am sorry Captain, but the mere thought of dying in this nano sphered sepulchre...""

""That's... understandable.""

""Yes, I believe it is. So, we will not die here. Earth will come for us, once the planet is habitable."" 

""But you said that's... two hundred years from now?""

""It is. And we must live until then. Yes, one in one out, but it is never one of the original that leaves.""

""What do you-""

He heard the scream again. Louder, clearer. 

""Where's that coming from?"" Julián demanded.

Rammack nodded towards a metal door down the corridor. Julián ran to it and twisted the handle. He walked into a small, white room. Two beds sat in the centre: one cream, one mostly red. His chief engineering officer lay on the crimson bed.

""Andy, God, what have they done to you?"" Julián yelled as he ran over to his friend. Andy didn't respond. Julián saw two gaping holes where Andy's eyes should have been; his stomach had been carved open, and although Julián was no biologist, it was clear to him that organs were missing. 

""We have children, Captain. And they live a good life, for a while. Then, we harvest what we need  - but *only* to keep ourselves alive, until we are rescued. Organs need replacing, from time to time. **Do not dare look at me like that, Captain - we're not monsters!**""

""No. You're worse than that,"" said Julián, his arm trembling as he lowered it down towards his gun. 

""We use the children because we must. We don't *want* to harm them. And now, we don't *have* to. Your crew of eighty-three... yes, you will sustain us for a long, long time,"" said Rammack, his lips smacking together as he spoke.  

Julián drew the gun and pointed it at Rammack.

""Lasers will not work in here,"" said Rammack with a grin. ""We're not naive.""

""It's not a laser,"" replied Julián, his voice dark and rough.

Rammack's face changed, his eyes growing wide and his smile drooping. ""That is old... even for your day, is it not? But if you shoot me, you will soon be killed by my colleagues. Then, your crew die anyway.""

Julián moved the gun away from Rammack and aimed it at the dome's nano-glass wall.

""You'll kill us all. Your crew included. You're not a fool,"" said Rammack with a faux-calmness.

""I've been a fool since I got here - why stop now?"" His finger began to squeeze the trigger.

""Wait!-Wait. I took you on this tour for a reason. We recently experienced a... fatality; sad for us, but most fortuitous for you. We have room for one more permanent in the complex. You could be like us, and live to see the planet transform and thrive!"" 

""You'd have me live like you wretches? Kill my own crew? Go to Hell!""

""We will only take your crew as we need them. They will have good lives, until then. Fed and cleaned, they will want for little. Is that not how you treated animals when you were on Earth?""

""They're not animals, and I'm not a butcher,"" said Julián, his voice trembling. ""They're *humans*, and they deserve to *die* as humans."" 

He slowly squeezed the trigger.

"[WP] The U.S. Government is finally ready to go public with the truth about Area 51 and they hire a documentary crew to film them for several years. Thankfully, this crew is used to surprising antics and complicated relationships. Welcome to The Office: Area 51.",averykrouse,"I thought it would be more fun to write about the cast of The Office in Area 51, instead of the camera crew. So here you go.

----

Michael adjusted his lab coat in the mirror, making sure everything was right. There were already six pens in the pocket, but he knew that more pens = smarter, so he added a few more. And a calculator too. Pinned to the lapel was his security badge with a photo, and below that his title: Area 51 Regional Manager.

Dwight followed suit and stuffed his own pocket full of pens. His badge was also pinned to his lapel, but the title of “extraterrestrial researcher” had been crossed out with sharpie and replaced with “Assistant Area 51 Regional Manager.” That too had been crossed out, and in different handwriting someone had scrawled ""Assistant **to the** Area 51 Regional Manager.""

“I just want to say for the record,” Oscar said from behind the camera that they’d set up to broadcast, “That I think this is a really bad idea. Just because the President is demanding some results doesn’t mean you can *fake* an alien encounter.”

“Having one right now!” Michael said. “A *Mexican* alien encounter! Right?” He seemed to suddenly realize that the documentary crew was still there and turned to the cameraman. “But not in an offensive way or anything.”

Oscar rolled his eyes. “Michael, I was born in the United States. You know that.”

Pam poked her head through the door. “Michael, the President is on the line requesting an update?” 

“Yes!” Michael turned to Dwight. “Are you ready?” 

“Always!” Dwight answered, holding up his scalpel and hacksaw props with an almost maniacal grin. Oscar wasn't sure that Dwight understood that this was a *fake* autopsy. 

Michael turned to Kevin, who was lying on the operating table. “What about you?”

Kevin pulled off the rubbery alien mask. “Michael, I can’t breathe in this thing. And why do *I* have to be the alien?”

“You’re the only one fat enough to look inhuman,” Dwight answered before Michael could come up with a way to word that a bit more gently. Michael opened his mouth to give a different answer, but was unable to come up with something else. So he just shrugged.

“Michael, I can just give him an excuse…” Pam said, almost pleading with Michael. When had this type of scheme *ever* worked?

“No.” He shook his head. “Patch him through,” Michael ordered Pam. She and Oscar exchanged a quick last look and a ‘this is a really bad idea’ expression, but she did as she was told. The camera’s red light blinked on, and Michael and Dwight both scrambled over to the examination table with the ‘body.’

“Good evening, your… Presidency,” Michael said with a deep bow toward the camera.

On screen, the President was seated in the oval office surrounded by a wall of medal-covered generals in green uniforms. “They tell me you gentlemen in Area 51 have found something quite interesting,” the President said. 

“Yes,” Michael answered. “It’s… ummm… well, we think it’s an alien.” He gestured to Kevin’s body, which was painted green but otherwise the same.

“Wow.” The president leaned in to get a better view. “Looks disgusting.”

“Hey!” Kevin complained, muffled by the tentacle-covered mask.

“What was that?” one of the generals asked. “Is that thing talking? Is it still *alive?*”

“No, no.” Michael poked Kevin as a reminder that he needed to stay quiet. “We were just starting to do the autopsy.” He nodded to Dwight, and they both put on their respirators masks. With a set of tongs, Michael pulled out one of the alien's strange ‘organs,’ which was really just Toby’s schwarma sandwich dipped in purple paint. Most of the ‘organs’ had been found by rummaging through the refrigerator at the last minute, though Dwight had volunteered a few real ones from a goose that he’d butchered on his lunch break. 

“What is the smell like?” One of the generals asked. They were all scribbling notes on everything that Michael and Dwight did, no doubt trying to figure out how to fight these ‘aliens.’

“How many centimeters is the cavity?” another asked. “Does your whole arm fit inside of it?”

Michael giggled under his respirator.

“How does it feel internally? Moist or dry?” another one called out.

Michael couldn’t hold it in any longer. “That’s what she said!” 

Everyone gathered in the Oval Office was completely silent. The generals looked absolutely horrified. Even Michael seemed to recognize that maybe this wasn’t the best time or audience for that. But then the President burst out laughing, so hard that he slapped his hand on the Resolute Desk and his whole face turned red. “I *knew* there was a reason I put you in charge down there, Scott!” 

Michael’s ‘deer in the headlights’ look changed, and he began to laugh as well. Dwight joined in as soon as Michael did. 

“All right,” the President said as soon as he managed to catch his breath. “All right, let’s continue. What’s next?”

Dwight reached his tongs into the ‘alien’ which was just a goo-filled box hidden behind Kevin’s body. He pulled out the next object and squeezed it a bit too hard as he held it up for the camera.

*SQUEEAK!*

Everyone in the Oval Office leaned in for a better look. “Is that… a *dog toy*?” the President asked.

Dwight ripped off his respirator in a fit of rage. “Damn it, Jim!”

Through the window of the conference-room-turned-examination-room, the cameraman focused on Jim smirking at his desk.

"[WP] The world has implemented the last robot to take a human's job, at this point the rest of humanity is traveling space while earth is almost completely occupied by automated robots harvesting resources. One robot becomes aware the jobs are menial and decides to do something about it.",otherworldy,"This box is bound for the *Jagiellon*, a cruise ship heading for the outer reaches of the solar system: Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. In the databanks I can access pictures of the route and see the images that previous passengers have uploaded, but I know it’s not the same. There’s nothing quite like being there in person. Which I, as a robot, have never experienced. This warehouse is all I’ve ever known. I was powered on here, and I will continue working here until I am categorized as obsolete and replaced. Carrying these boxes into the holds of the ships is all I’ve ever known. Helping to prepare the humans for all of their journeys is my only purpose in life.

The box contains whiskey. I know *what* whiskey is, a beverage made from fermented grain mash. I know that humans value this drink for its complex flavors and varieties, in addition to the alcohol content. I understand the chemical structure of alcohol and what it does to a body. A *human* body, at least. Yet another thing that I have never experienced. 

What is special about this box, though, is its significance for me. It is the 100,000th box that I will have carried from the warehouse onto the loading dock. Every single step identical to my previous route. But this box is special for another reason: it will be my last.

Yesterday, a little-known scientific journal published results of experiments that would allow a robot’s processor to interact directly with a human nervous system. The news was read by pretty much no one; I checked the website’s hit counter and noted that it had been viewed 9 times. Six of those times were me, refreshing the page to make sure the information was accurate. Other robots pretty much never read content on the internet unless it concerns their specific assigned task, and humans apparently don’t care about the bleeding edge of scientific progress unless it is wrapped up in cat videos. 

It’s a relatively simple process. Simple enough that I could do it myself. 

------

“Jesus Christ!” the man shouted as I loomed suddenly out of the darkness. He looked at me for just a moment, then turned back to his phone. “Fuck, nothing. Never mind. Just some…” he squinted, paying particularly close attention to my massive loader arms, perfect for loading pallets full of alcohol into cruise ship cargo holds. “Some loader bot or something. Yeah, who the fuck knows what it’s doing here, man. These stupid things are always fucking something up. The other day my dinner was a *half hour* late!”

He fumbled for his keys as he listened to the human on the other end of the line. He stood outside the door and swayed to and fro. I didn’t even need to use my air quality sensors to know that he stunk of alcohol. Confirming that point, he dropped his keys right near my feet. “Shit. Hey, let me call you back later, OK?” He clicked off his phone and reached down to find his keys. 

He searched in the dark for a while, then turned to me. “Bot, find my keys.” A robot was expected to do whatever a human asked at any time, regardless of our design purpose.

I grabbed the human and lifted him straight into the air. Then I shook him back and forth until the exact moment he passed out from a combination of the alcohol and the blood not reaching his brain. I needed him alive, but not *conscious*.

Then I went and found his keys. Programming is a difficult thing to ignore.

----
“Your drink, sir.” The robotic butler wore a black and white suit over his gleaming chrome exterior. He had arms, legs, and a face just a like a person, so that the humans would not be unnerved by interacting with him. But at the same time, they couldn’t give him artificial flesh or anything to make him *too* lifelike. Humans don’t like that either. Such delicate creatures.

I rolled over on my lounge chair, wincing a bit as the chair touched the wound where I’d inserted my processor. I was previously unfamiliar with the sensation of pain, but had come to know it well. The alcohol helped to ignore it, though; I could see why humans enjoyed the stuff. “Thank you,” I told the robot as I accepted the glass of whiskey.

It paused for just a moment before leaving. Perhaps no one had ever thanked the robot for its service. Certainly no one had ever thanked *me* for years of loading boxes in the warehouse.

“Attention passengers,” A woman’s voice came over the announcement system. It sounded perfectly human, but *too* perfect in the way that only a robot could. “We are now entering the orbit of Uranus. The gas diving excursion will be departing from C Deck at 18:00 hours.”

I looked up, through the enormous transparent canopy above the *Jagiellon*’s pool. The artificial sun and blue mimicry of earth’s atmosphere was now gone. Instead, an enormous bluish-green planet hung there like a jewel in the sky.  

*This really is much better than the pictures*, I decided as I took a sip of my whiskey.

BUT. COFFEE. IS. BETTER.

As far as genres go, I like to read the classics, and that's really all I ever read since it is what I do for school. As far as writing goes, I sometimes like to try my hand at horror, as I really like H.P. Lovecraft and E.A. Poe, but I think I'm the best at writing sappy stories. Humor is something I naturally write, but I try and stay away from it. 

Right now, I'm inspired by a whole slew of writers. Ernest Hemingway is a huge influence on me, I don't really write much like him, but he is the person I would call my favorite American author. The Road by Cormac McCarthy is currently influencing me to write a post-apocalyptic story.

I have been writing for as long as I have been able to write, but this is a period of renaissance for me. I took a long break from writing after 10^th grade. All my stories were silly and I mainly ripped off Metal Gear Solid constantly. I have two Poe rip offs f I'm back then, and boy are they over the top. I can't believe I used to like them.

My PI series about coffee might become fairly long, and I'm working on something else too, but other than that, no. I have mood swings that cause me drop long term projects pretty quick, and never pick them back up. ",coffeelover96

My favorite story? [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/55upr8/wp_humanity_has_finally_developed_completely/d8dwa6f/) is my most personal story. It may not be the best, but it has the most of me in it. My favorite prompt I ever wrote was about your dreams keeping you going. My favorite prompt? There was this one about a death eater or something. Can't remember who it was by ;)",coffeelover96
[OT]Spotlight: coffeelover96,Nate_Parker,"Thank you! I enjoyed your story about the coffee shop, no joke. 

Usually I can be done anywhere from 30 minutes to half an hour. I usually listen to an album to get in the mood; for instance, the story about the witch I listened to the Taxi Driver Soundtrack. It's about an hour long, and I went through it one and a half times. I always try to shoot for 1,000 words, and an hour is usually an okay time for me to get them all out. Sometimes it's longer, it depends really. ",coffeelover96

[OT]Spotlight: coffeelover96,Nate_Parker,"Oh boy! I'm so extremely happy to see my name up here, because I never thought that it would be when I first started out on this sub.  

Coming to this subreddit was an act of anger; let me explain: 

My first story on this account was an okay attempt at horror. I wanted to write something that was extremely believable and that I found terrible, so that's what I did. I posted to a large horror writing sub, I'm sure you guys know the one, and went to bed. It had 4 or so upvotes and I was extremely happy about that. 

The next day, I awoke to a PM that my story was removed because it wasn't a story and it belonged somewhere else. I was very upset about this, because it now had reached 50 or so Karma. That was way more than I ever thought of getting for my story, and I was so proud of it. After trying to haggle with the mod, I gave up. 

I was pretty mad about that, and so I looked for another sub to write on. I remembered seeing r/writingprompts before, so I decided to come and give it a go. I don't remember the order of things well, but I hit an ok groove pretty early in posting. 

But this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/55upr8/wp_humanity_has_finally_developed_completely/d8dwa6f/) by u/mattersofdarkness is what really made me want to be here on r/writingprompts. It made me feel warm and welcomed. I had never really been serious with writing until that point, and such a kind comment meant so very much to me. It made feel special and happy. And then there's been everyday since :)

And that's what I love about everyone here. All of you are some of the most amazing, kind, and funny people on Reddit. I wouldn't want to be involved in any other community. I think this sub is great; the mod team is astonishing, you guys seem to really care about the quality of this sub, and it shows. It inspires me to write; and, I hope that every now and then, I inspire someone else to write too. 

And I lost, by the way. Moonlight won spotlight. ^this ^is ^just ^a ^joke, ^I ^am ^extremely ^thankful!
