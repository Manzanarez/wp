[WP] The last dream you had became true.,C-XD,"Hell yeah! I get to drink milk!

"[WP] ""We fight them to the last bullet - THEIR last bullet.""",YDAQ,"General Emille Vernedad was happy. He always loved the smell of the Vats in the morning. It smelled like victory. He sipped his coffee, reviewed the morning news paper and snapped over a subaltern and pointed to his plate of biscuits, still steaming in the early morning chill.

""Lieutenant,"" he said, ""what the hell do you think you're doing?""

The young Lieutenant blinked and adjusted his glasses before replying.

""Ah, sir?"" he ventured.

""These biscuits,"" said the General, ""where the hell is the honey?""

""Terribly sorry sir, it seems to have been lost in transit.""

""Lost in transit?"" said the General. ""Hmm... tell the Quartermaster that if he doesn't want to be Typed and forced to watch us throw a few billion copies of himself into the grinder of the enemy, he'd best locate the honey and make sure it finds its way to joining the formation Sergeant Smith spends so much time in the morning assembling as my breakfast in this godforsaken wasteland.""

Happy, yes, but it was before he'd really had his coffee and some things cannot be overlooked. Vernedad took another sip of his coffee and sniffed at the biscuits disdainfully.

""Well,"" he said after a moment, ""I suppose since it is the day of battle certain things can be excused. Convey my message, and then collect the unit reports for review.""

""Yes, sir,"" said the Lieutenant, ""only, the reports are already collected in the folder placed beneath the morning paper just there, sir.""

""Anticipating my desires, eh? That's the proper way to go about a promotion, Wilkins. I'll keep my eye on you for advancement.""

""Thank you, sir,"" said Lieutenant Wilkins.

The General bit into a biscuit, winced, and put it back on the plate before putting aside the morning paper and placing a hand on the slim brown folder underneath. He smiled at the young officer still standing poised nearby.

""Well,"" he said, ""what do the reports say?""

""All units report ready for battle, sir.""

""Do they?""  

The General regarded the biscuits and the possibility of chipping a tooth with such ability that it was a few moments before the young Lieutenant realized he was being subtly prompted to expand on that statement.

""Right, sir,"" Wilkins said, ""sorry, sir. To clarify, the Vats units report they are operating at full capacity, with estimated creation time below projections. The Armory states that the new addition to the forces--""

""The metal masks with the clever gag mechanism,"" added the General.

""--just so, sir. With these additions, the Statisticians project a loss coefficient of 25% off mean.""

""That's incredible,"" said the General.

""I believe their reasoning is that for a combat troop that can only be destroyed by cranial damage, a metal helmet that encases the entirety of the head is a boon. The gags are more for psychological effect.""

""Yes, yes,"" said the General lightly running a finger across a slim rod with a single button on it.  ""Something to do with our human forces having to hear the moaning being distressing and thus this small device to spring open all the gags at the proper time when the Dupes meet the enemy.""

""Exactly, sir,"" said the Lieutenant.

""You know,"" mused the General, ""in the old days we just learned to ignore it. Those were bloody, awful times. It's nice to see that technology has improved so much.""

The Lieutenant had nothing to say in response so he remained silent.

""The Scooping units?"" asked the General when he finally returned from his reverie.

""Prepped and ready, sir, though the Statisticians are projecting an overall loss of their number in the area of 47%. We've begun enhanced Typing and Vatwork to preserve as many of them as possible. This battle though is going to be a rough one on them.""

""It always is,"" replied Vernedad, ""it always is. Those poor bastards have to keep quite the sharp eye.""

""Just so, sir.""

The General stood, dusted off his immaculately creased uniform, placed his cap on his head after smoothing back his hair, and gave the Lieutenant a nod.

""Thank you, Wilkins,"" he said. ""It appears all is in order for battle. Operation Skullcrusher is go. You may relay the order to the communication team.""

""Yes, sir!"" said the Lieutenant with a sharp salute. He spun smartly on his heels and walked briskly, but without running, toward the comm tent. Vernedad watched him go, noticing a slight bit of internal nostalgia at his own time serving under the great General Kublen.

After a moment, the General walked toward his Strider and placed his arms inside the cradled equipment and allowed the ports along his forearms to sync up with the systems inside. Then with a mental command, the various cables, servos, and pads surrounded him like a cocoon before lifting him into the Strider's body.

Inside the Strider, he was connected to a real-time satellite overlay of the battlefield.  In the far distance, the walls of the enemy city fairly glistened with metallic antennae already starting to arc blue with electricity despite the morning light.  Vernedad could easily make out their arrayed troops in front of the walls. The fools still insisted the best method of war was to put their own lives on the line. Idiots.

He flicked a finger and changed the display to show his own forces and gave them an inspection. The Dupes were already stirring now that the sun was coming up and warming their bodies. A statement of the discipline of the Herders, the entire massed lot of flesh of the vanguard ranks were pointed directly at the enemy city. Behind them, the Cages where the Dupes were printed hummed into life and the steam curled menacingly around a partially finished musculature here, a quickly sheathed skull there. The Armitures dashed in and out in reverse vivisection coating things almost too quickly to be shocked by. A sound of grating metal split the morning air as a Cage descended and the Armory-designed helmets were roughly attached around the necks of the Dupes like so many bowling pins being organized. The ones that didn't quite line up were crushed but the sluices would collect their biomatter and pump it back up the various cables through purifiers to the glowing green Vats placed just a bit further back. Finally, a pressplate would push the barely formed Dupes out to where the Herders would arrange them for battle. Due to the gags built into the helmets, the entire affair was eerily silent except for the sound of the Cages slamming into the ground near the end of the cycle.

General Vernedad clicked open the comm channel and across the line his forces stilled.

""Men,"" said General Vernedad, ""you have done well to bring us here and prepare us for battle today. We will win, and for those of you who fall, know that your Typing and Backup is underway even as we speak. The enemy before us risks their own lives without Backups and stands arrayed against us as if their stupidity is noble. Let us ruin them and prove their folly to all who seek to oppose the Empire. We shall fight them to the last bullet--*their* last--and then we shall burn their pitiful city to the ground, salt their earth, and melt their corpses for our Vats. Cry havoc, and release the Dupes of war!""

There was a ragged cheer that ripped across the comm channels and popped the speakers for a few seconds before General Vernedad switched to the command channel and the much more subdued chatter of his Majors and Captains going about their business. He cued up a small timer into their HUDs and issued his last few adjustments. In less than a minute, the first Dupes of the vanguard shuffled forward toward the enemy. The Battle of Joren's Pass had begun.

Ten minutes passed as the General's forces slowly staggered their way into engagement range with the enemy with their Herders in Striders keeping them in a roughly massed block of printed meat and murder. The enemy forces began firing at the Dupes to counter-attack, and the General noted with small satisfaction that the Armory domes kept most of the bullets from doing any real damage as his line advanced. Those Dupes that lost a leg or an arm, or even were cut in half by the storm of metal flung at them, were simply trudged into the muddying ground and remained until the Scoopers came to scavenge them by placing what remained into the mini-Vats they carried on their backs. When a Scooper was full, he would signal and an aerial drone would arrive with a new mini-Vat, drop it, pick up the flagged unit and carry it back for reuse.

The lines clashed and the enemy forces with their mechanized bayonets make short work of the vanguard by slashing their heads off their bodies. The Dupes so decapitated fell where they had stood and the heads became a grotesque game of soccer as the enemy kicked them back toward his lines. The General gave a grim smile and pressed the button on the slim rod he'd loaded into his Strider with. There was a massive, singular *clack* as the domed helmets of his forces fell away to reveal the toothy-mawed horror of his Dupes on the front lines. The screams of the enemy were soon drowned out by the moaning of the Dupes. While the fools cut down many of his forces, they couldn't match the Vats for production and the waves of Dupes even now closing on their city spelled certain, bloody doom.

A few hours later, the clean-up operation was well under way. The enemy city was being razed to the ground and the extraneous forces under his command were joining the captives that had surrendered in being melted back to biomatter before being fed into the Vats.  

Satisfied that his work was mainly done for the day, General Vernedad dropped from his Strider and returned to his paper and the tray of now rock-hard biscuits from the morning. He made a mental note to follow-up with Wilkins as to the conversation with the Quartermaster before pressing on tomorrow. There were always rebels for the Vats, after all, and his job was to put them there. As the sun set and the glowing green illuminated the night, Vernedad smiled.  

It had been a good day.

[WP] You've always been an adrenaline junky; flirting with death at every opportunity. Now Death has started flirting back.,ClRuM," I've jumped 65 times, ask anyone who has mainlined methamphetamine and also base jumped or sky dived and they will tell you natural adrenaline is far more intense. I could tell you what it's like using elaborate metaphors interwoven into some trendy story but words cannot do it justice, it's the experience you want not the story that comes after. I was emotionally damaged until my first jump and letting go of all that repressed anger and fear will fix your life, brother, fix it nice and tight.

  Hard decking is protocol, up until jump 42 I always pulled at 2,000, I had a beat up CYPRes unit that would pop my reserve at 1,500 ft. if ever shit went sideways. It never did until jump 66, jumps 18-29 I played a bit in the air, then it got more serious I became a speed jumper. Tensing my muscles with such precision that I could top out at 180mph, my weekly jump team named me blurjam joking that one day at most I'd be a blur then WHOP! become jam in the drop zone. 

  I never realized completely what it became, an addiction to teasing death, until jump 66. I felt great that day, it was another solo dive, just me and 18,000ft. of empty space. I can't remember what the pilot said exactly,""a great day to dive"" or maybe ""a great day to die"". In hindsight paranoia becomes less opaque, I know most of the pilots and Morty was never on the main roster of licensed pilots.

 The second I let go of the shit handle I knew something did not feel right, my left leg felt like it was being shocked with a taser and fifteen seconds in it seized up. A fucking cramp, 65 jumps prior and not so much as a twitch and I get a cramp on jump 66. I tried not to panic and let the wind grasp the seized muscle but contracting it only made it worse. My CYP unit beeped as I tried to yank the ripcord my gauge read 1,900 and the main was jammed.

When the C02 cartridge hissed and my reserve shot out I felt relief waiting for the tug of my straps as the cramp got worse and I screamed...but it never came. I looked up to see the last of the nylon and elastic tear free from the reserve like kite string in a hurricane. I accepted death and tugged one last time on my main with the ground close enough to piss on and I heard the main flop out and then darkness.

  I woke up in the ER with a full pant cast, eighteen hairlines, two distinct breaks in my left and right femur, and my foot technically came off were it not for my Achilles tendon. When my jump buddies visited me in the hospital and I told them about the new pilot, they had no clue what I was talking about. In fact, no one in the companies history ever had the name Mort.

[WP] You've always been an adrenaline junky; flirting with death at every opportunity. Now Death has started flirting back.,ClRuM,"Do you remember how it felt, as a kid, when you rode a bike for the first time? Maybe you felt a sense of accomplishment or pride, or perhaps pure, unadulterated joy. I wouldn’t know. I don’t have a clear memory of riding my bike for the first time. No, what I remember is how it felt to fall.

A thrill of fear rushed through me. In that split second between awkwardly tipping over and hitting the pavement, I was scared to death. I think I freaked my mother out a little, because I didn’t cry. Excitement overwhelmed me. Rather than whining about the pain of scraping up my knock kneed legs, I silently marveled at the “fun” I had just experienced. It was nothing like the sort of fun I was used to - jumping on the trampoline, riding down the slide at the park, having a water gun fight - all seemed boring by comparison. And I wanted to experience this new form of fun, “scary fun” as my little mind dubbed it, more and more. I started by falling off my bike on purpose. I padded up in sweatshirts, pillows, towels, anything I could get my hands on and duct tape to myself. It’s too bad nobody ever took a picture. I must have been a ridiculous sight. Then, I would hop on my bike and try to get as much momentum going as I could before letting myself topple over. The desire to go faster and faster and fall at greater speeds, which was more “scary fun” the faster I went, kept me outside for hours. I knew my parents thought I was just determined to learn how to ride. I knew the “scary fun” feeling I was after was my little secret - and that only made it better.

Through the years, I kept trying to go faster and faster and fall at greater speeds, greater heights, always searching for a bigger adrenaline rush. That empty-headed, bandage-covered kid and her bike was always inside me, scared to death and loving every minute. It wasn’t my little secret any longer, though. My parents became well aware of my “habit,” as my mother would say. Whether it was skateboarding, parkour, ski jumping, or just jumping off bridges and cliffs, I spent the best days of my youth seeking the rush every way I could. Of course, no matter how much I begged, my parents never signed off the many permission slips I brought to them for paragliding and whatnot. My eighteenth birthday, when my friends were getting tattoos or buying cigarettes, I saved up all of my summer lifeguarding money to go bungee jumping. It was the best day of my life. Although, I think my mother had an anxiety attack. I try not to think of that too much. 

Growing up, my sister always got herself into trouble being boy-crazy. Whenever I teased her about it, she always answered, her pretty little face scrunched up with spite, “You’re flirting with death. Who’s worse?”

I guess you could say that, while my sister is boy-crazy, I am death-crazy.

Now, as I’m being carted off for emergency surgery, slowly passing out under the fumes of the anesthesia, I think I might be falling in love.

Now you’re probably calling me just plain crazy.

I wasn’t doing anything stupid today, unusually enough. My adrenaline junky hobbies are expensive. I was just walking across the street to deposit my paycheck at the bank. I looked both ways before crossing, and, I swear to you, there was not a car in sight. The one that rammed into me must have appeared out of thin air. I can’t explain it - and no witnesses came forward, either, not even the driver. The jet black car sped off into the distance, leaving me for dead. I could almost swear that, far down the street, it vanished into thin air as well.

This wasn’t my first “unintentional” near-death experience this week, either. 

A group of my buddies and I went out for beer and grub this Saturday, after our jump. It was a good jump. The rush was even better than usual, almost as if fear itself was putting effort into giving me a good return on my thrill-seeking investment. Can you believe that, after plummeting through the air on the slack of a springing cord, and before even taking my first sip of beer, I almost died just walking through the door of the steakhouse? An oak beam from the tall, open doorway suddenly broke - I don’t think anyone ever figured out how - and narrowly missed clobbering me in the head. Seeing it plummet right down in front of my face, hearing it woosh and bang on the floor, gave me a rush even more potent than the bungee jump. I stood there, stock still, confused. The near-death accident was far more frightening than any thrilling adventure sport, when in the back of your mind you always know that it will end alright. In that moment of fear, I actually thought I might die.

And now, my consciousness leaving me, I really think I will die. But that fear is the greatest joy I have ever felt.

Let me explain it a little better. In my whole life, I’ve only had a crush on one boy (okay, maybe three). The thrill you get from interacting with your crush is entirely different from the thrill of falling or jumping or adventuring. There’s a naive hope that courses through your veins, along with the anxiety and excitement. Do you remember when your crush smiled at you? How that felt? Well, maybe death is smiling at me now. Because that’s kind of how I feel.

Don’t get me wrong. I don’t want to die. If I die, the thrills stop. I’m scared to death of dying. But that doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy that fear while it lasts.

What is this blackness now? This isn’t what it’s like to be under the anesthesia. You don’t experience the unconsciousness, you just suddenly wake up in a hospital bed. Am I in a coma? 

That’s odd. I feel the same way I felt at my junior prom, when Spencer Johnson asked me to dance. Yes, death. Let’s dance. There isn’t any music. But my heart is racing. Let’s dance to that. I feel so scared. But isn’t that what it feels like to chase someone you love? To flirt - and have them flirt back? ",RedbookRay
[WP] You've always been an adrenaline junky; flirting with death at every opportunity. Now Death has started flirting back.,ClRuM,"James was a tall lad. Too tall for a war reporter but he was of a mind that we'd all die one day and might as well make it interesting. He got bored of Iraq and the constant Islamic scarecrows, at least on a declarative level. He was very aware of the fear of being burned alive and unaware of other fears, like claustrophobia or entomophobia but he was about to find out about them.

James was white too, too white with a hue of pink that hated the sun as much as the sun hated him. He could never get a tan, only burns so he pampered himself with sunscreen all the time, even when he was hiding behind a makeshift barricade while holding a selfie stick above his head to check on the front line. He even got his GoPro shot in an exciting display of skill by a sniper.

James hated the heat and after a two-year stint next to the military and five consecutive nights spent in 40 degrees Celsius he said fuck it. The money was good, the work exciting, like being the main star in your own version of a war movie but sleeping in heat was pure misery. He didn't mind the smell as much as he thought. Once you become accustomed with your own, you can withstand about anything.

But James had little of an imagination and so he went to the border between Bangladesh and Burma to report to some refugees fleeing ethnic cleansing. It was a grisly story than needed to be told, one with deaths in the thousands and a Pulitzer looming around the corner waiting to be picked up so he booked the first flight from Baghdad to Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, departure in a day. 

James had no idea what a ""green season"" was just that it was good after coming from the dry and rocky monotony of the desert and where there was rain, there was somewhat less heat. Thumbs up. That's all he needed. So he got to Dhaka, amazed by the throng of people everywhere and he set himself on photographing everything before checking in to your local average 5 star hotel. The air was nice and humid and the rain wasn't so bad, washing all the unnameable waste of the streets with torrents of water.

The next day James left in a shabby rent-a-car for the border with Burma, to a place called Cox's Bazaar. Somewhat of a local deluxe resort with a wide beach to the Indian Ocean. And conveniently placed close enough to the main refugee camp. 

James didn't get there. Not far from the place he was supposed to reach, the road circled the base of a hill that decided to expand with the help of the season's rainfalls exactly when he was whistling past, happy about his exotic life, with his elbow resting on the lowered window of his Tata automobile. The landslide hit his car on his right side, overturning him heads down in a flooded rice field next to the road. Now he was just standing there, unable to move or take deep breaths as the soil was holding him in place, exuding myriapods over his eyelids, pinching his skin and trying to slid their way into his mouth. How could such a crowded place take this long to find him? his only thought as soon as he imposed himself to just breath and don't struggle.

"[WP] God has, for the first time in a long while, worked his way through the prayers for missing car keys, touchdowns and passing grades, and finds out just what has been sitting in the prayer backlog.",Hrtzy,"Despite popular belief, God had difficulty anticipating the future. It was the way he made the world. His grand scheme: to not know what would happen next. It was a huge idea for an immortal and all-knowing being to pull off. It gets boring knowing everything, so he created the world and let it runs its course unknown to him except in the communications of the creatures whom populated said planet.

It was simple at first. He actively communicated with each of the small beings on a daily and even hourly basis. They asked his help in the small matters and affairs which press upon them and he found great joy in guiding their hands. *Should I eat this?* No *Should I eat that?* Yeah *When should I slaughter my goat?* He made a complicated procedure for that one as a joke. They didn't get the joke. *Should I murder my son?* Eh, no.

But then it got complicated. The little creatures started reproducing. And reproducing. And reproducing. Faster and faster. Soon he was swamped beneath the labors of answering so many prayers. He found himself taking shortcuts: mass replies, simple answers, and even ignoring some requests and ""letting things work themselves out.""

Unfortunately, things didn't slow down. He was behind to the point that the prayers he was hearing were too dated. Their senders were long dead, and the requests were beyond ability to answer. He shook his head and sighed. It looked like he would have to delete some requests. ""I am sure,"" he said to nobody in particular. ""That they won't do too much damage in the 40s."" He nodded. ""That will catch me up.""",Test_411

Finding out I live within the confines of a fictional narrative nearly overwhelmed me but I managed to capture the weapon I could use to my advantage. When I took the shamanistic herb and saw visions of my life and how it is being narrated by a rather talented multi-dimensional author who's invisible, my emotions drained out of me. At the end of the long ego-trip, something poked out at me in the forest, and I grabbed it and the instruction manual that was attached. It said I can activate the device and remove Plot Armor from any of the author's favorite characters. I could even become a narrator myself. 

I set up the multi-step bank robbery with planned precision. I gave each person a role they could play in order to get the millions of dollars out of the vault. I clicked on the walkie talkie. ""Go.""

My minions infiltrated security and de-activated security protocols. They weakened the outside of the vault with pressurized machinery. The escape vehicle orbited the bank in readiness. It wouldn't be long before the favored ones showed up, the FBI agents this entire universe centered around. I was in the bank lobby, pretending to take out a credit loan waiting for the right moment to use my weapon. 

Here came the uniformed heroes, alerted by a silent alarm. They split up, so I would have to capture them individually. First, I approached Sergeant Thompson and read the secret commands to activate my new powers. ""It was a dark and stormy night..."" I read, getting to the part where I could insert my own narrative into the plot. ""His weakness was in his suit. It would not block a taser's electric shock. It was easy for the villain to take him down."" After deactivating the plot armor, I used my taser against the Sergeant. He recoiled on the floor and I bagged his head up and drove him to an escape vehicle.

For the next two agents, I snuck into the main offices of the bank and began reading the page. ""It was a dark and stormy night, and the agents had forgotten to put on their body armor. They were vulnerable to non-lethal projectiles. The villain readied his bean bag gun."" POP. POP. They were stunned by the excruciating pain of the bean bags, and I put a sack over their head and carried them out to the escape vehicle. 

One last task. ""It was a dark and stormy night, and the bank vault was overflowing that day. There were billions, not millions, in its coffers."" I was as powerful as the god-like author who wrote out my existence. Eventually, I would overtake him and narrate everybody's life in this entire universe. First, I needed an intelligence boost.

"[WP] Write an unnecessarily long and sentimental story about a simple, everyday object.",Psuet,"This is actually true story about a shirt of mine. 

I own a tuxedo t-shirt, that was given to me by an old man named ranger. I never knew his real name, the only time I ever saw it was on a tombstone after which I forgot it, it wasn't his name and in life and it wouldn't be in death either. Ranger was an interesting character who rode around town on a feet forward bicycle, with a 6 foot American flag and would go around doing odd jobs comprised mostly of painting. On top of this ranger wouldn't wear a shirt but rather just an open vest. This meant his normal attire was paint spackled skin a vest and cargo shorts.

Given this was normal attire, even dressing nicely for ranger was interesting as he would often wear his old Vietnam hat, a tuxedo shirt and pants to formal events. Being a young teenager who had little want or desire to dress nicely, and quite frankly thought the amount of effort people made to look nice was silly i always found it refreshing, to see an old man enjoying life his own way, not conforming to everyone else's standards. 

After seeing me show up to graduation in gym shorts and a t-shirt under my cap and gown he gave me a tuxedo t-shirt as a present, so that I could dress up in my Sunday best if I ever needed too. Ranger did not have a lot of money, and growing up neither did we so good and labor was generally what we exchanged as well as long conversation outside on summer nights. This old tuxedo t-shirt was one of the only tangible things he ever gave me, and I remember him by it ever time I wear it. ",Mic1994hael
"[WP] Write an unnecessarily long and sentimental story about a simple, everyday object.",Psuet,"Micah pulled another mug from the cabinet and dropped it to the floor from his perch on the cabinet. 

""Oopsie!"" He proclaimed. He grabbed another mug and another. He pulled all the mugs from the cabinet that his chubby little hands could reach and dropped them one by one until they all lay splattered across the floor. 

After hearing the first crash, Rachel didn't budge. She was too invested in scrolling through free games in the iTunes store. But after hearing her little brother's voice and a second noise of broken glass, her mother growled from the other room.

""Goddammit, Rachel, get off your ass; you're supposed to be watching him!"" And with that Rachel hid the iPad under her pillow and scrambled downstairs. 

Her eyes fell first on Micah who began to chatter on her arrival. ""I just cleaned up the kitchen. Just like Mommy does."" The chair he had climbed up on the counter top now knocked over, preventing his escape. 

The remains of her treasured museum mug stood out among the porcelain rubble. The blood red handle was stripped clean off and broken in half. One part was under the kitchen table, and the other across the room. But at her feet was the cup, a large crack running through the center, and when she picked it up and looked inside, she could see the porcelain chipped through the paint. 

The crack had severed her friend's signature at the bottom, written in permanent marker. Rachel had been adamant to gently wash it after each time she used it with no time to spare. The mug never soaked in the sink or festered in the dishwasher waiting for steam and hot water to blast through caked hot chocolate or soup. Rachel only ever bathed the mug in water warm enough for suds to easily form with a little bit of soap. 

Printed lemurs danced around the circumference on vines and branches, although now one of the lemurs was missing its eye from a chip. Those lemurs were based off the ones she and her best friend had witnessed together in awe on their fourth grade field trip. It was only one year ago, but now it seemed so far away, the pieces of her mug weighing her hands down as she thought about how she would never see Caitlin again; that one last object her best friend had gifted her before passing now broken and ruined by her ungrateful little brother who never seemed to learn or listen or do anything but turn everything into garbage. 

Micah could sense something was wrong as his sister clutched the pieces of her mug so hard her hands began to bleed. Her eyes were angry and her face wet, but she didn't look at the ground, and rushed at him with her hand raised. 

She stepped on something--the pain was immediate, and cried out. The pieces of her mug fell to the floor as she limped away, her foot bleeding too with a piece of ceramic poking out from her heel. It made her sick to look at it, and she dropped to the floor and crawled to the pieces of her mug, staring up at the traitor while she pulled out what she could. ",lexovinix

Yeah its like one of those moments right now. I'm going to have to rewind back a little bit to give you the full story.

I've been with Jackie for 3 years now. it was amazing at first we had ate, drank had sex all the time not to mention, shes been putting up with my alcoholic ass since day one. That bitch held my hair while I was spewing out the Del Mar Fair's deep fried Klondike Bar after drinking almost an entire two12 pack to myself. Shes got my back more than countless times, so you're probably wondering why I'm a piece of shit that's cheating on her?

I honestly got no good reason to give to you but other than that fact I guess I got bored. She started to turn into middle class wife that cooks and clean the house while I'm out at work bringing back the money. I guess In some sort of fucked up way I turned into my mother, wanting to fight over absolutely nothing and making sure I fuck everything up. Then came along Tiffani.

I met Tiffani at a strip club off the ""Dirty Midway"" area, and well somehow we clicked. It started off with me seeing her at the club, getting coffee after her shifts and snorting rails off her tits, down to the good ol' motel rooms to pound her brains out. We've been doing this for about a year now and shes been a hell of a fucking ride. Shit she told all her stripper friends I was pretty much her boyfriend despite me telling her not too, shes gotten to clingy at this point. In a way I care about her, ya know? I've found her easier to talk to than Jackie at some points. I might be in love with her tits more than anything but shes a good listener.

I had a hell of a night recently and came to the realization that I was getting older, stuck in a dead end job and actually had someone who gave a shit about my ass for once in my life. Here I am doing everything in my power to give her ammunition to leave my ass if she ever found out. I decided it was time for me to grow up and actually settle down. Maybe raise a few dogs, my kids would be fucked up if they had me for a dad.

Here I am now in a motel room with Tiffani who thought it was a good idea to go through my shit looking for blow and came across the wedding ring I bought for Jackie. Shit had to end here and now

""Oh my God! David, Oh my Gawwddd!"" She screamed ""Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes! A thousand times yes, oh come here!"" she practically jumped into my arms and started kissing me all over. I laughed and placed her on the bed and entertained her for a second kissing her back before I got up, placing my hands on my hips I was trying to figure out the words to say.

""Yeah, you got that mixed up"" I bit my lip ""I'm not marrying you"" I looked her straight in the eyes just to show her how serious I was.

""Wha..what do you mean Davy?"" Jesus Christ I fucking hated that name

""I just fucking told you what it means, I'm not marrying you this is for Jackie, what we got we're fucking done, I should of ended this shit months ago anyways"" I grabbed the ring from her and threw it back in my bag, starting to pack my shit up I knew I had to leave before she threw a tantrum

""What the fuck is your problem David? I've been nothing but amazing towards you, I've been loyal to you! You fucking piece of shit!"" She grabbed the phone and tried throwing it at me, only for it to just hit the floor due to it still being plugged in the wall I couldn't help but laugh at her, I knew that would of made her more pissed. 

""Loyal?"" I asked while making sure I grabbed the rest of my stuff from the room ""You've been sucking that greasy Arab guys dick since I've known you at that strip club, I don't even want to think how many other dicks you've grabbed since we've been fucking. This was just a distraction, you knew it, I knew it so don't act like a fucking Disney princess when you're a bootleg Snow White, alright? Besides you think I'm loyal? Nah, if I said that I'd be a hypocrite""

I left quickly out of the hotel room to walk down to my car only for me to look back at the Devil herself, Jackie. Oh shit

She stormed up at me with eyes of a thousand eyes ""I knew it, I fucking knew it you piece of shit!"" She gave me a hard slap across my face and I stumbled back, accepting it

""Ugh! You make me so mad David, you make me so mad, I've done everything for you, I've been there for every hard moment these last few years, I've basically been your wife and this is how you repay me? Huh? Fucking hookers or God knows what else in sleazy hotel rooms. You better find a place to stay and get movers because I'm kicking you out"" She basically ran off at this point and I was almost at a lost for words

""J-J-Jackie?"" I shouted at her, I quickly went down to one knee as she turned around fumbling for the ring I pulled it out, opening it to her. 

""Look. I know I'm a fuck up, I've always been a fuck up. You have been nothing but short of amazing and I've realized that. I've known that. In my own fucked up way I know you're the only woman I want to be with for the rest of my life, its why I was here I broke up with that crazy bitch. All I want for us is to move on from this and start again. Please? Forgive me"" I was on the verge of tears at this point, it was probably the most honest thing I ever said in my life.

She walked right back up to me just to spit on my face. ""I'm pregnant. I'm not keeping it"" as soon as she said that my heart dropped, I couldn't even think of a way to say something back to that. She walked off as I was still on one knee, I turned to the side to notice a family of four just staring at me.

""The fuck are you looking at, Brady Bunch?"" I snapped as I got my shit and went straight towards the car. The manager of the motel stepped out of his office and ran up to me already out of breath

""Hey! Your hooker came down and told me she trashed the place, I'm going to have to charge everything on your card, you hear me asshole? The fat piece of shit was out of breath after shouting all that.

""Yeah. You got a smoke?"" Sins of the parents always passes down I guess.",krakenbum

"[EU][Star Trek] You are a freshman at Star Fleet Academy. The majority of the class are humans, but not you.",iteoi,"""Get up Cadet! Keep up with the others. You can run can't you? What's the matter? Humans are tougher than you Cadet Vracj? Is that it?"" sneered the lieutenant commander, as he stood over the Klingon lying on the track. 

*If this were anywhere else I would rip your tongue out for that...* thought Jalok resentfully, pushing himself up onto his feet. Fighting to keep his temper he faced the foul faced human. Though young Jalok stood a head taller than the diminutive lieutenant commander, and stared over him. ""No sir. I fell Sir.""

""Why did you fall Cadet? Gravity too different? Are you injured? Need to see the nurse?"" The sneer grew and some of the other jogging cadets snickered hatefully. 

Jalok ground his teeth but said only, ""No sir. I am unharmed. I can continue. I was...tripped."" 

The lieutenant commander opened his eyes in a wide mocking glance. ""Tripped?  Who would dare trip you? Can you point them out?!""

Jalok's head didn't move but his eyes followed a group of cadets who barely concealed their laughter, pointing at him as they jogged. He bit the inside of his cheek and tasted blood. ""No...sir. Perhaps it was an...accident.""

""An accident huh, well I hope it doesn't effect your 'honor'. If you are fine then I would continue jogging if I were you. You're very much behind.""  The lieutenant commander snorted and walked off the track, in a fashion that was similar to a small Terran dog that yapped shrilly. 

*You would not know what honor was if it bit you in the rear end you petaq.* Jalok thought resentfully as he started to jog again. Thanks to his twin hearts and alien physique he managed to recapture lost ground, catching back up to the other cadets and outstripping some of them. The ones that tripped him tried to keep him from passing but failed and spent the rest of the time panting and falling behind. Jalok only sneered at them, careful to keep his lips tight to not show his teeth as he ran past them. *Cowards. Striking a warrior from behind. Oh for an honest battle field and my blade...*

Eventually the laps were run and the lieutenant commander stood in front, glaring balefully at Jalok and the pack of exhausted malefactors. Knowing he could not say anything without showing favoritism he dismissed them. Falling back to an earlier tactic of isolation, the small group of jeering cadets made a show of organizing a social gathering. They talked in loud tones of the fun and how difficult it must be to be cut off without friends or family. 

Jalok walked past, sparing them no attention. Such actions were unbecoming of a warrior and he tried to take no heed. However inside his stomach roiled with anger at such underhanded acts. He craved to call them out. To duel them. To prove his superiority. Unfortunately that was not the norm at Starfleet Academy and he would eat dead gagh before failing his house and casting shame on their honor, much less his own. 

He entered his dorm room with a sigh and sat on his bed, anger simmering below the surface. His fingers twitched, aching for a hilt of a bat'leth or mek'leth. Perhaps he would go to the holosuites. No he could not, the lieutenant commander stripping that from him in the guise of ""academy regulated programming.""

The door slid open and Jalok saw his room mate walk in. Stephen Chambliss was a kind human, never once lamenting that his room mate was a Klingon. In fact he had embraced him as a friend from the beginning, which was very fortunate for Jalok. Stephen assisted him with early Starfleet History and provided valuable assistance when interacting with the other cadets. In turn Jalok helped Stephen endurance and strength train and proved to be a tutor for basic engineering. 

The young man's face broke into a tired grin. ""Sorry about that Jalok. A few of us saw what happened. We could talk to Commander Graves about it.""

Jalok shook his head once, a sharp motion like tearing meat from bone. ""It is no matter. My honor remains unharmed by their poor actions. I...appreciate the offering however.""

""Anytime pal."" Stephen smiled back and Jalok felt more at ease. ""Sorry you're having a rough time of it. Humans, can be a little dumb about differences. Or with people different from them.""

Jalok raised an eyebrow. ""Really? So the gloss of humanity has such cracks beneath it? Ha. That is amusing.""

Stephen's mahogany features shared Jalok's incredulous grin. ""You'd be surprised. Anyways, a few of us are going out to eat tonight. Why don't you come a long?  Don't worry, idiot squad won't be there.""

A snort at the moniker eases Jalok's grimace. ""Appreciated, however I do not feel 'up to it' as you humans say. Another time. I promise.""  

Stephen nodded understandingly and after changing left the dorm room. Moments after he left Jalok's console beeped. Wondering who would be contacting him he walked to it. *Perhaps it will be Mother. That would be enjoyable.* he mused as he accepted the call. Then his eyes opened wide and he sat up straight seeing the Klingon on the screen. ""Commander Worf! An honor sir!""

The grim visages Klingon male nodded back. ""At ease Cadet. It is good to see you. Would you be available this evening? My ship is coming to Earth and I would enjoy speaking with you.""

*Thank Kahless I declined Stephen's invitation.* ""Yes sir I am. I would also enjoy speaking with you this evening.""

The face remained stoic but seemed to soften slightly, a not quite smile on his lips. ""Excellent. I will meet you at the Academy Quad at 20:00. Until then."" The screen went black. Jalok smiled broadly for the first time in weeks, a knot of tension loosening in his chest. ",WokCano
"[WP] You are one of a villain's henchmen, and you are trying to explain to your in-laws why you do what you do.",Airmeo,"I used the bottom of my spoon to squash the mashed potato further around the plate. My chin had sunk into my right hand, my left continuing to paint upon the dish with the remainder of my meal.

They really had to ask that question, here, at the dinner table. Didn't they? This was a situation I would have trouble escaping. Suddenly, I felt my right shoulder shoved as I snapped back into the room, raising my posture and looking to the source. It was my Wife, and she seemed irritated with me.

""Honey, you were asked a question."" She said, a nervous tone about her, and an awkward expression to boot. She side glanced to the other side of the table, where my in-laws sat. They had that kind of red faced glare that could churn butter, face all wrinkled and generating heat.

""I mean, why does anyone do anything?"" I said in response, clutching at straws. I desperately wanted to avoid the question. It was one I battled with everyday.

""What?"" Her Father had said. I thought it impossible for his face to contort any further. Apparently he had proven me wrong. ""What do-""

""Dad, let him finish."" She had said, nudging me once again. This time she was serious. I slunk a little into my chair.

""Look, I didn't exactly dream of this as a child."" I said, growing irritated by their questioning. Who were they to stick their nose into my business?

""We're concerned."" Her mother chimed in. She always had to get a word in. Always had to poke the bear.

""What's the problem?"" I said, my mind clouded with a hurt response of anger. At least I was working, not like their worthless son.

""You ruin peoples lives. You lie to them, a- and steal from them. All their hard work, gone in a flash."" He said, snapping his fingers as if to reinforce his point.

""I know..."" I responded, hanging my head in shame. ""I'm trying to leave.""

""Will that really undo everything you've done?"" My mother-in-law said.

""No, but it's a start, isn't it? At least I'm providing. What abo-"" I stopped myself before I brought up my brother in law. This was my argument. It wasn't worth expanding the scope. We didn't need two of us in the firing line.

""Really, Marie."" He said, looking to my Wife with an expression of disappointment. ""An Estate Agent?"" He continued, shaking his head as he looked down to his plate, squashing his peas in a silent contemplation.",wakeupsonofmine
"[WP] You are one of a villain's henchmen, and you are trying to explain to your in-laws why you do what you do.",Airmeo,"I married my wife three years ago, and I was certain my line of work would remain a secret. I work for The Jefe, a human trafficking top dawg, we are based out of the port of Oakland. I'll be honest, human trafficking doesn't begin to describe the realities of the trade. And I don't usually see the consequences of our actions, first hand. I am a bookkeeper. I work in an office just like my peers and in-laws.

My wife, Sofia, comes from a standard Catholic upbringing. She isn't particularly religious but she plays along to please her mother. ""If I can make Mom more comfortable by pretending, I will."" She would laugh, ""Maybe if there is a god, she will recognize my good intentions.""  We generally keep the church out of our home. But my wife's mother, Mary, brings the church to us. Mary comes every other Saturday and asks for our donation. 

My wife and mother in-law look very similar. Both taller than average with a slim build, the shape of everything from their calves to fingers are exactly the same. They are still mistaken for sisters. From behind, I can’t tell them apart, with my eyes closed they sound the same, and in the dark, good luck. I am a lucky man. My wife will age beautifully, like Mary. 

The cash in my pocket fluctuates, depending on the season. But it has become routine for Mary to peak inside my wallet while I am donating, to see if I am truly giving ten percent. Mary doesn't know that the two gun safes in our living room hold more cash than guns and ammo. 

She came earlier than usual yesterday morning. I was getting ready for our bike ride around the lake, pumping the tires and checking the brakes, when Mary knocked on the door. 

""Good morning Hijo,"" she said and kissed me on the cheek. “Where is Sofia?” 

“She is getting ready,” I brought Mary inside and gestured for her to sit. “Would you like some coffee?” I said. “We just brewed it.” She nods. I grabbed the coffee and set it on the table in front of her. “Excuse me Mama,” I said, “I have to run upstairs to grab something.”

“Don’t keep me waiting too long,” She laughed. 

I ran upstairs to grab my wallet. 

“Honey, your mother is here.” My voice cut through the steamy bathroom. 

“Don’t keep her waiting,” she said. 

“You don’t keep her. Hurry up.” The front door slammed and I ran downstairs. I thought Mary might be grabbing something from the car, but it turned out to be a surprise visitor. The Jefe, Victor, with a stranger, a young girl dressed in a short blue skirt, six inch white heels and a tube top. It looked like they were going out on the Town, but it was half past eight.

“Oh, I’m sorry, I thought you were Sofia. I see where she gets it from. Nice to meet you, Mary.” Victor is holding her hand with both of his and he looks embarrassed.

“Victor, brother, what brings you in?” He looks straight at me and seems to forget the young girl’s presence. “Whose your friend?” I add.

“Marc, we need to talk. Lets step outside. I need a smoke.” He gripped at his jacket pocket for his cigarettes. 

“Don’t be rude,” Mary said, “Introduce us to your friend.”She has a raised eyebrow and steps closer to the girl. 
 
“I’m sorry, forgive me.” He subtly bows to Mary and puts his hand on the girls back. “This is Rose, she is my new friend.”

“Rose, sit here with me.” Mary says, “The boys can go outside and talk. But first, Marc, grab her some coffee.”

I signalled for Victor to step outside, I grabbed the coffee gave it to Rose. “Nice to meet you, please make yourself comfortable.” I felt guilty, concerned and irritated as I stepped outside. “What’s going on?”

“I need a favor Marc. Rose needs to stay here for a bit.” He took a deep inhale off his cigarette. “You know I don’t show up unexpected, it’s serious.”

“Sure, boss.” 

“Your Wife is a spittin’ image of her mother,” he crushed the half smoked cigarette and reached for another, offered me one, even though he knows I don’t smoke. “You are a lucky man.” 

“Did you say anything to her?” I looked back at the front window, where the girls were chatting about who knows what. I wanted to get back inside, before Sofia came down. 

“What does she know, bud?

“Nothing,” I said.

“She might know something, now.”

“What did you say?” My heart started to race and my negative mind started to run. 

“I thought she was Sofia.” He said, “I came in. I said, ‘Hey baby, we got a situation, I need to leave Rose here, she is fresh off the boat and I need to find her a home.’ I started to explain how I’ll be in touch when Mary interrupted me.”

“Well if you said that half as fast as you told me, I don’t think she will think much of it.” I looked back at the window and could see Mary looking out, I waved to her. 

“Look, you figure out what you have to do, I need to go. I got a lot of things to fix.” He reached for his pocket. “Here’s some extra cash to take care of her.”

I stepped in front of Victor to block the view. “Don’t give it to me now, worry about it later.” The front door opened. 

“Victor,” Mary said, “I forgot to ask you, the reason I came to the house today was to receive the church’s donation. Can you help out the local St. Anthony’s?” Mary started walking towards us. 

“Don’t worry Mama, I have some extra cash I can contribute for -”

“Don’t be silly Marc, I can donate some”

“Victor, No”

“Marc, a man gives what a man can. Victor, we would appreciate anything you can offer.” She faced Victor, as I stood to the side. He pulled out a wad of Benji’s and flicked a crisp, one, two, three, four. She wasn’t satisfied by the look on her face, despite Victor’s gift being close to what the whole church would get on Sunday, like a kid wanting seconds of cake before finishing their first slice.
 
“God bless,” she said. The door was slightly ajar and I could hear Sofia coming down, calling for Mama. 

“It was nice meeting you Mary,” Victor said, “But I have to run. Marc, call me if you need anything and tell Sofia I said hi.” Victor got in the back seat of the running, blacked out Tahoe and they took off.

The rest of the day was different than planned. Instead of riding the bikes, we took Mama and Rose out to breakfast and then went for a walk around the lake. Mary’s demeanour changed, she was quiet and solemn. It was nice by the lake, a perfect mid-summer weekend day. There was the farmer’s market, people jogging, riding bikes, selling jewellery. 

It came to mind that the world continues to spin no matter how many bad things are going on. And I wouldn’t consider myself or Victor bad guys, its just our line of work, it's bad. 

“What exactly is it you do?” Mary said. She ate the spicy shaved ice treat I bought her with dirty money. 

“I’m a bookkeeper.” She shook her head.

“Bookkeepers don’t have wads of cash and their bosses don't drop off a ‘Girl fresh off the boat’ on a Saturday. Don’t insult me, I’m not stupid. I wondered how you two were able to purchase that beautiful home so young. I guess naivety and faith go a long way.” 

“Mama,” Sofia said, “Somethings are best left unsaid.” Mary stopped walking and looked at Rose then at me. 

“I don’t want your money any more. We don’t want your money any more. Something isn’t right here.” She latched Rose’s arm, “Honey, you can come with me, you don’t have to listen to these people.”

“Mama,” Sofia said, “She is not going with you.”

I watched them, Mother and Daughter. My ears started ringing and a cloud ran away from the sun, blinding me. For a second, I couldn’t tell them apart, and I didn’t want to. I knew that things would never be the same. I’m not sure for better or worse. ",Greenismyfavor
"[WP] You are one of a villain's henchmen, and you are trying to explain to your in-laws why you do what you do.",Airmeo,"""I've said it a hundred times, and I'll say it again,"" I enunciated slowly to my in-laws. ""I'm in private security.""

""Yeah, under a villain, that's what you are,"" Martha retorted. ""So you rob people for a living?""

Every single frickin' time.

I slammed the table and stormed out of the dining room. How many times have I had to explain what I do for a living?! I gritted my teeth and slowly counted to ten, pacing about the corridor.

Okay, I thought to myself. Okayokayokayokay, I got this. Maybe this time they will get it. Or maybe they won't.

""Dear?"" my wife poked her head out of the dining room. ""You wanna talk?""

""No, I think we've been through this before. I don't work for the villain per se, I've been subcontracted out.""

""Honey...""

My dear Moira walked up to me and gave me a long, wordless hug. I held her, beholding the same beautiful blue eyes I saw the day I married her.

""I don't like this any more than the rest do..."" I shook my head slowly.

""You could stop this, you know. We have enough money, just come home. We'll start that business we talked about."" she whispered, looking up at me.

She was referring to her idea of setting up a bakery and using her family's cookie recipes. Much as I wanted to make a quick break, I couldn't.

""I can't, dear. Not just yet. I'm bound by the contract. Just a little more, alright?"" I pleaded with her.

""But the things that are happening on the news.. All the killing you guys are doing there, it's all wrong.""

""You know that's not me, dear. Those guys run PR. I just guard the base.""

Yeah, that went real peachy with her parents, alright.

""I know, but...""

Moira rested her head on my chest. She was about to cry, I could feel it. She always looks away from me. Time to try and wrap it up.

""I just don't want you to get hurt.""

""Honey, I promise. Life's boring in the base, you know? And boring is good.""

""But what if some superhero swings in and you take a hit?""

""Don't worry, the heroes know we're just hired folk, they won't actually kill us.""

""But they don't care who lives or dies either!"" she hugged me even tighter. ""All they want is what they think is justice. They don't care if hundreds have to die for them to achieve it.""

""Honey...""

""Promise me that if a superhero attacks, you will find a place to hide.""

""...""

""Promise!""

""Okay, I promise.""

If a superhero does attack, I'm bound by contract to ""fight or face termination after the battle"".

We locked in embrace there for what I wished could have been an eternity.

He could see the questions forming in his horrible in-laws mouths as he finished his spoonful of food. The old woman and unofficial but very obvious head of the band of pacifist hippie con artists was the first to break the silence. Her long winded spiel about how evil Derrick was and how her daughter, the family's black sheep, was going to be divorcing him came as no surprise.

Derrick watched impassively having witnessed the scene over and over through the years. He waited a few moments before grinning and turning on these horrible people.

""I joined Destructo, because he needed a man like me, but more importantly I needed a man like him. See I'm not one to be violent for no reason, to destroy for no reason, and more importantly make billions off of my criminal activities. Destructo is such a person, and he needs accountants who are also willing to be his couriers and occasional hitmen. So the deal I brokered was for his help. He owns the bank that owns your house since you lazy assholes are deeply in debt. You make Cynthia cry once more and I'll burn this place to the ground. After that Destructo and his henchmen including me will destroy the various agencies that you've been scamming, so no more free money. Now homeless and without a dime, you'll be easy to sell to any of the various supervillians that need spare body parts. So be nice to your relative, or the man who loves your daughter more than goodness itself will make whats left of yours miserable and short."" Derrick explained.

"[WP] In 2020, we received a signal from outer space. Somebody had decoded our language and sent us a message. It was short: ""Be quiet. They'll hear you""",Alpy94,"There was no time to calm the approaching crowd with words or even the threat of firearms. I only had the time to scrambled around to the driver's side, hop in, and pull my door shut behind me just as the first set of hands hit the side of the vehicle. I could hear them all shouting, though I couldn't understand what any single person was saying. The message was clear, though. *We saw what happened to the big cities on the news. Get us the hell out of here.*

My mouth was streaming profanities as I put the beast in gear, but I couldn't hear myself over the engines and the voices. I laid on the horn, hoping Jefferies would hurry the fuck up already. It seemed to do nothing but enrage the assholes gathered around the Humvee, pawing at it. 

A sudden rush of air and increased volume hit me like a smack in the face. Fuck, I cursed at myself, the doors don't lock, you moron! I stepped on the gas just as the torso of a stranger started hauling themselves into the back seat. 

In retrospect, it was not my finest moment as a soldier or a human being. I think *most*of the people in front of me managed to move out of the way in time before the huge mass of rumbling metal that was the Humvee tore free from their clutches. The asshole in the back hung on until I ran through the ditch separating the parking lot from the road. He bounced out and tumbled off like a rag doll, the Humvee door swinging wildly. I yelled my apologies, for what it was worth.

As the HumVee righted itself on the smooth pavement of the road, I looked toward the way we came. I could just go. The Captain's daughter wasn't in there. Anyone with a running vehicle with any sense would be on the road as soon as any news of the aliens hitting cities got out, not waiting in a library for their old, grumpy as Dad to drive a hundred miles out of his way.

I looked back and forth from the library and the open road. My pursuers were recovering from their shock and staring at me again, except for the guy in the ditch. He didn't look like he was having a good time. Sorry man, I thought. There's only so many seats. 

Just as I began to turn the steering wheel towards a direction that might have been construed as *away* from the library, a shot rang through the air. Captain Jefferies was circling the mob, a young woman hanging on to his left arm and his pistol in his right hand. I let out a cry of surprise and brought the Humvee around. 

The Captain kept his pistol trained on the mob as he loaded who I presumed to be his daughter into the back seat. The crowd seemed more scared of the pistol than they had been of getting run over by the HumVee. They kept their distance for the moment, but the second Jefferies climbed in the passenger side they rushed in again. His daughter yelped, and for the second time in just a few minutes, I drove through a crowd of fellow humans.

The HumVee was silent as I got us back on to the road and started towards the highway. It was the kind of uncomfortable quiet, like the lull in conversation on a first date. Given that I had probably just seriously injured civilians with a government vehicle, I suppose it was warranted.

""You okay, Jeannie?"" The captain was the first to break the silence. He craned his neck around to look at his daughter, who did not respond.

""My name's Fuller,"" I said, trying to look in the rear view mirror to see her face. HumVee's don't have rearview mirrors, jackass, I thought. I really wasn't a fan of the oversized, uncomfortable things. 

""That's a weird first name."" The voice from the back sounded one part sarcastic and two parts scared.

""James is the other one. You can use whichever,"" I said, trying to laugh a little. She didn't, though. 

“Specialist Fuller will suffice for the both of us,” Jefferies said, turning back towards me, his eyes narrowed.  You would think I’d just asked to see her tits instead of introducing myself.

“Jesus, Dad. It’s the end of the world. Cut the shit.”

Jefferies looked at me, then at her. His expression softened a fraction, but his voice was still just as gruff. “It’s not over just yet. I’ve got this genius, his laptop, and crew of other geniuses waiting at Fort Morris.”

She didn’t respond, and I couldn’t tell if the genius part supposed to be reassuring or sarcastic, so I kept my mouth shut. This ride was shaping up to be more uncomfortable than riding alone with my captain, which I had not thought was possible.

After about ten minutes of me struggling to navigate the way we had come, the captain finally demanded that I let him drive. I abandoned my seat with little resistance, partially because I needed to fire the laptop back up and partially because I hated driving the damn thing anyway.

“Wait, wait!” Jeannie jumped out of the HumVee just as the captain and I settled into our seats. It was the first time I’d really had a chance to get a good look at her. She started pointing towards the line of unmoving cars on the highway. Before the captain even finished yelling “get your ass back in” she was gone, nimbly moving through the tall grass on the side of the road and headed straight for a gray Prius. She was tall for a girl and in good shape. Mid-twenties probably, about my age. I tried not to stare at her while she bounced off, lest the captain catch me eyeballing her. Jefferies wasn’t worried about me, though. He hopped out too, his face contorted with worry and anger.

“I’ll be right back, just wait!” She yelled over her shoulder, her blonde ponytail bobbing. 

I couldn’t really see what she was doing, but I did see people getting out of their stopped vehicles to look at us. I really, really didn’t want to be part of running any more people today, so I silently wished she’d wrap up her sudden errand and come back before these people realized they weren’t moving, and we were. I saw the captain draw his sidearm as he moved into position around the vehicle, his eyes scanning over the area Jeannie disappeared to.

Maybe a minute later she emerged from the line of cars, carrying a backpack and something small and brown under one arm. She was smiling triumphantly as she approached us, and I have to admit, it was a damn nice smile. I didn’t see at all how the stiff-neck captain had ever produced anything this lovely. 

“You brought a god-damned dog?” Jefferies was furious. “You stopped us to pick up a stray?”

Jeannie’s face grew dark. “Are you serious?”

The silence told us that he was, in fact, serious. She continued. “This is my ‘god-damned’ dog, Dad. You’d know that if you gave a shit and actually visited occasionally.”

“Just get in, both of you!” I said, pointing at the growing amount of people watching us with interest. Some of these people would be armed and ready to take whatever they needed to survive. 

After they both shut their doors, I spun around. The dog was still a pup, a chocolate lab. 

“Name?”

“Gravy.” She stroked the puppy’s head and gave it a kiss. “Biscuit was my cat, but when we left the house we couldn’t find him.”

“How did Gravy get all the way out here, and how the hell did you see her?”

“Fucking Darrin,” she said, her voice suddenly hostile, “left without me. We had everything packed, just waiting for Dad to get there. We were going to take two vehicles if we had to.”

The captain cranked his head around. “Darrin? Who the fuck is that?”

“My boyfriend. Well, ex-boyfriend now.”

“Wait, he didn’t want to stay put at the library, so he left without you… And we just passed him, and took your dog back?” I was trying hard not to smile. That was justice for abandoning your hot girlfriend to her fate if I’d ever seen it.

“I slapped the shit out of him too.”
“That’s my girl,” Jefferies said, smiling as he looked ahead at the narrow path along the side of the road.

I turned back towards the front myself, smiling as well. I liked this girl. Maybe the ride wouldn’t be so bad after all. 

One glance in the door mirror ruined the moment for me, however. In the distance, a large, red wall of light erupted behind us. Middleton was no more.

"[WP] You are an information thief, delving into the minds of famous writers, artists, and musicians to steal their ideas for profit. Tonight is your greatest heist yet: the mind of Justin Roiland.",CBoy64,"Subconscious Plagiarism is a bitch, right?

You know, when an artist creates something that turns out to have been fundamentally the same as something before it.

A story that reads like another, but with the names changed. A riff borrowed entirely from a musician the artist never heard.

Yeah. Most of those are cases of thought theft. An older artist turns to the occult to get another hit, or just more inspiration. They seek the creative, people whose brains are full of ideas, people who don't even realize it. The youth who writes that ""plagiarized"" story doesn't even know it until the day the idea floats to the top. That's when he gets a hard lesson about how unfair show business really is.

Granted, some thought thieves try more ambitious methods. I learned it from a Pop songwriter who had founded a record label that was making tons of money, seemingly predicting every trend. He had just shown up one day with a bunch of cash and started the label. How did he get it? He was happy to tell me. Most people weren't that interested, and he loved the attention. He had spent over two decades ripping off young singer-songwriters in their bedrooms and giving their surprisingly well written songs to hugely successful artists. Who the hell was gonna call him out? ""you ripped off a song I wrote on a sheet of notebook paper without any kind of date on it that's been in my Journal in another state this whole time!"" You'd sound like a nut.

I've done it a few times, hitting up all kinds of people. I've ""written"" some songs for pop musicians, submitted a painting to to a gallery under a fake name, sold a screenplay or two. But lately, I've grown tired of pre-empting unknown artists for petty cash. I want to go big, and going big means getting your ideas from better sources than unknown songwriters and screenplay writing hacks in coffee shops. I want something that'll become a beloved property, something that'll be a goldmine of marketing and merchandise. Tonight's target, none other than Justin Roiland. Anyone involved in Rick and Morty is a potential goldmine, but him? A perfect target. THE goldmine.

I've got all that I need. The candles, a grounding object (a fancy name for a wooden dowel with your name on it, used to guide you back to your own mind once you're done), and everything I could find written by the man himself. Scripts, internet postings, audio, all collected for use right here in my room. The material is here to help you get into the headspace of the target. If you don't have a clear idea of what you're looking for, you'll probably get lost in the mental energies of all the people around. You'll end up with a nasty head rush, too, but that's nothing too serious in the scheme of things. I've spread the candles out in a circle on the rug, read and listened to everything I could, and taken hold of the grounding object.

I light the candles one by one.

I begin to think about consciousness. The nature of the brain, the mind, the feeling a creativity. 

I have closed my eyes, but I can see. The mindscape. 

Everything is blurry. A mixture of colors.

A greyness. That's my own mind. A void. I'm not a particularly creative guy. Just a sucker who happened to know a guy who wanted to talk. There's no art in my head that isn't stolen from someone else.

I push that thought from my head. I have no time for introspection. I have to focus on the heist. On the mind of my target.

The view begins to sharpen. Black lines. Bright colors. A giant cartoon. A mingling of every thought, all in the same familiar style.

[WP] A Tax Collector goes to inquire a Dragon about his undeclared hoard of gold,Kiloku,"He had thought the whole affair was ridiculous. The only thing more ridiculous about the situation than the thought that they could get their hands on any dragon gold, was that they had sent him. He marched up the hill anyway, wearing a nice suit, and holding an official looking briefcase.

He knocked politely on the enormous door to the dragon cave. There was a deep rumbling and shaking  from inside for a few minutes, but eventually a twenty four foot dragon opened the door. It only opened it a crack, so one could only see it's face.

""What is it? I'm only half dressed,"" Said the dragon, in a deep intimidating voice.

The tax collector gulped.

""I-I'm Tobias Stanley III,"" The tax collector stammered, ""I've come to consult you about the town of men and women a few miles west.""

""Just a minute,"" replied the dragon, and shut the door.

Ten or fifteen minutes past. The tax collector was beginning to doubt the dragon's return when the enormous door opened in it's entirety. There the dragon stood, on it's hind feet, dressed in silken clothing.

""Please, come in,"" The dragon inquired, stepping aside with two great shakes to the ground.

The tax collector hesitantly stepped inside. He was surprised to find a human sized set of furniture along with a dragon sized arm chair. 

""Have a seat.""

Needless to say, he did.

""So, the town of men and women. Last I heard it was just a town of men."" Said the dragon, taking a seat as well.

""Well, we have... er, changed our ways a bit, in the last few hundred years,"" The tax collector responded.

""So, what is it you wanted to consult me about?""

""The town of men and women has recently expanded it's territory. In the process it has declared this mountain range it's own,"" the tax collector started. The dragon began to let smoke lift out of it's nostrils, ""As such, we do require those who live in our land to pay... taxes.""

The smoke stopped short. The dragon seemed taken aback. It mumbled to itself for a bit, then finally spoke.

""What are the benefits of paying these taxes...""

""Well, you will be protected under our laws. If such are violated, our forces will do their best to enforce them.""

After a minute if consideration the dragon said, ""Fine.""

""Just fill these out. Someone will come by to collect them in a few weeks,"" said the tax collector setting down his briefcase.

As the tax collector left the dragon's cave he could have sworn he heard the sound of a quill breaking and a furious yell.",FredrickTheFish
[WP] A Tax Collector goes to inquire a Dragon about his undeclared hoard of gold,Kiloku,"Gerald Dignator, assistant undersecretary to the Crown's Assessor at Reva craned his neck out the window of the carriage to get a good look at the peak of Horchendraak. There didn't *seem* to be any motion up there, but you never could tell. Vulkaan was an elder dragon after all, and after even a handful of centuries dragons learned well how to make themselves unnoticed by the crown's tax collectors. Which was, Gerald admitted to himself, rather quite preferable to the former state of affairs, when any collector foolish enough to confront a dragon wound up a convenient afternoon snack. 

The carriage continued to rumble it's way through the village at Horchendraak on towards the mountain for which it was named. It was tucked into the vale near the dragon's local cooling lake, and shielded from the worst of weather by the mountain range of which Horchendraak was a part. It would have been a prosperous enough town without the shadow of a great dragon casting doubt over the nearby countryside. Still though, the road well paved and the streets clean of the detritus of human poverty that would have clogged the streets back at Reva or any other city of the realm. At first blush it struck him as odd - in his previous visits Horchendraak had been possessed of the mean poverty the assessor had come to expect of dragon trading outposts. Only the desperate and the greedy willingly traded so close to dragons, and the type of people drawn to those enterprises were rarely the type Gerald would have been comfortable sharing a tavern with. Odd for the village to seem so quiet and deserted, certainly - but as the carriage pulled through the town Gerald let it fall from his mind. The prospects of a dragon trading outpost were as the wind, and if Vulkaan had decided to rescind payments from the village as he had the crown the town could have dried up within a week.

His musings on the economics of the realm were brought to an abrupt halt when the carriage stopped, and the door was pulled open by his driver, ""We have arrived at Horchendraak Honoured One."" The man helped him out of the carriage and assured Gerald he would await his return while sitting down in the front of the carriage and unwrapping a flask that had been tied to his shin. Suddenly wishing he'd thought to bring a little liquid courage of his own, he turned to make his way up the path to Vulkaan's ancient lair. 

It was an odd thing, the strained relationship between the humans and dragons of the world. Much as man had domesticated the sheep or the dog, the dragon's almost seemed to have domesticated the humans. The Last Great Dragon War had been the twenty-seventh of its kind according to the handful of historians who could be bothered to remember it, but the handful of dragons who had fought in it reckoned it the twenty-sixth. Regardless of which side was harboring the bookkeeping error it had left both of the sentient species of Verdriet devastated and seeking a different way, perhaps one where both might survive. 

The results of that desire were reflected in the broad stone path winding its way up the foot of the mountain. That a dragon as old as Vulkaan, who often spoke of the mountain on which he lodged as a favorite hillock from his youth, to answer a summons from a man like Dignator, whose family name was scarcely older than his assumption of the office of an assessor from the crown was a mark of just how deep that integration had become. That so few people dared to live near the dragon was a testament to how far it had yet to go. 

At length he made his way to the base of the dragon's great hall, and was struck by a profound sense of wrong. The harsh acrid scent of brimstone and quicksilver that indicated an active dragon's roost seemed to have faded, to be replaced by an undercurrent that churned his stomach, the sickly odor of decay drifted on the wind now that he was high enough to scent it. Swallowing his nerves Gerald ran a hand over the Idol of Zon strung around his chest and pushed the great doors open on well-oiled hinges. 

The wave of death that assaulted his senses had him doubled over and heaving out his guts before the tears could even blind him. Where the great treasure of Vulkaan should have laid was instead a mass of decay and destruction. Human viscera left to rot in an airy tomb, without so much as a glimmer of riches. Gerald could not quickly come to an estimate of the dead, he was not a hard enough man for that, but he knew what he was looking at - the demise of the village at Horchendraak. As he stumbled back out to the base of the mountain he fell to his knees and let loose another great heaving of his insides. Under the warm sun of summer his heart knew cold, Vulkaan was no young pup to be taken by emotions. If he had abandoned the Accords of Zon then soon more dragons would join him. 

Gerald Dignator had gone in the name of the crown to demand proper payment of debts owed. Now he would return to Reva to report that an elder dragon had put an entire village to the torch. How many would already be dead before he could return?",victorged
[WP] A Tax Collector goes to inquire a Dragon about his undeclared hoard of gold,Kiloku,"Summer spent most of her time these days sleeping on her heaps of treasure, and this afternoon seemed to be an especially good afternoon for it. You can imagine then, why upon hearing a voice shout ""Is this the residence of the dragon known as Summer Storm?"", she promptly sent a ball of flames toward the entrance to her cave.

I'm sure you can also imagine her even greater annoyance upon hearing another voice shout, ""Summer Storm, we regret to inform you that your tax payment is overdue by sixteen--"", and I'm sure you could understand her choosing to breath fire rather than listen to hear by how much her taxes were overdue.

Finally silence reigned again in the cave and she laid her head back down to--

""Are you finished with your fire-breathing?"", the second voice said again.

""What is it with you people and not going away? Don't you know not to toy with dragons?"", Summer said.

""Ms Storm, with all due respect, we do not aim to toy with you, only to collect our taxes and go"", the second voice said.

""to collect your taxes? What makes them your taxes?"", Summer asked.

""We come from the great bank, which all manner of creatures answer to. We monitor the--""

""Bullshit!"", Summer roared, ""you've been sent by old Timothy Taverner, the snake-dragon. Well you can go back and tell him I've got no more gold for him. Not since the leprechaun incident!""

""Ma'am, we assure you, we come from the great bank. We can show you our badges if you only assure us that you won't attack us""

""Alright, come out then""

A short little goblin came out and said with the second voice, ""here is my badge, and my card, my id number is 337, and here I have a warrant to collect your taxes by any means necessary, signed by Sir Torriff himself"".

""... and your compatriots? Have they got badges too?""

""They are irrelevant. Under my command""

""I don't believe you"".

""Ms. Storms, you don't need to believe that my compatriots are licensed tax-collectors. If you give us 16.53 percent of your-- ""

""SEVENTEEN PERCENT?!!??"", Summer screamed. The mountain shook.

""SIXteen"", the goblin corrected, ""and fifty three hundredths"".

""how will you carry seventeen percent of my riches? I've got more than a hundred times what you could carry""

""My compatriots will help to transport the wealth, you need only--""

""Your Compatriots! How am I to know they can be trusted? I don't even know if they're licensed tax-collectors"".

""Again, Ms. Storm, you need not worry about that, you need only give us 16.53 percent, and I'll give you a copy of the receipt saying that you paid. Then you shall not be bothered again"".

She eyed the goblin. The goblin looked up at her. She licked her lips. The goblin didn't stir.

""Why don't I just eat you?""

""They'll send more of me""

""Sounds like an all-you-can-eat with delivery""

""except you already can't find my friends. It may be a happy meal, but in a place this size it'll be a noise-maker for an hour first, at least"".

""And that's why you can stand there so confident?""

""Just doing my job ma'am""

""And you say if I give you 16% of my wealth you'll leave me alone?""

""16.53 percent"", the goblin corrected.

""Fine, take what is owed to you"", she said.

At once, twenty people came out from behind walls, or even just from the shadows, and no sooner had they appeared that Summer began spraying fire at all of them. Each of the tax-collectors zoomed away from the dragon by some means or other. Three flew up to the ceiling with what Summer imagined must have been some ingenious pulley system, some simply ducked, perhaps into holes or tunnels. Others simply ran back behind their rocks and hiding places. She looked around for a moment, but couldn't seem to find them.

""You've really got a lot of people here, haven't you?"", Summer said.

""we've got enough to do the job"", the goblin said, ""and we can play until you're tired""

Summer sat there for a moment.

""Ms. Storm?""

""Give me a moment to think""

She continued to sit there, pretending to think until she began to snore.

""MS. STORM!"", the goblin shouted.

""Fine, have your gold!"", Summer said, pushing a pile of gold out the door and rolling over.

Remaining completely out of sight, the various tax-collecting creatures began creeping out the door.

When the sound of their feet had left the main chamber, Summer began creeping after them. Suddenly she saw it-- the silvery wing of the snake-dragon himself.

""Timothy you no-good toad, it doesn't make a difference to just steal gold from other dragons! You've got to pillage the kingdoms of men and whatnot!"", Summer yelled after the young dragon.

But the dragon had already begun to fly away in an excitable frenzy, and this was not an afternoon for chasing rogue dragons. Today was a day for napping, and perhaps a little bit for planning revenge.

[WP] A Tax Collector goes to inquire a Dragon about his undeclared hoard of gold,Kiloku,"All the king's men and all the king's horses including the little tax collector paraded around the town for the morning courses.

The men doffed their hats and the women cried ""try"", the children stared at their brothers and simply asked why.

The dragon to the north was a tired old creature who terrorised the town as a monthly feature.

The king had enough and called his men, his horses and even the little tax collector came too and said to them:

 ""bring it to me, I want it's gold and it's head,
Alive or dead.""

So the men, the horses, and the little tax collector too,
Went up north to the dragon and maybe run him through.

With a clang, a clop, and a squeak the troop approached the cave.
From it's mouth came the snoring, the roaring, and the susurrus of gold pouring knocked by the dragon's tail wave.

The men faltered
Their bravery altered
The horses bucked
Their riders chucked.
But the little tax collector had faced his own dragon,
He said ""give me a minute and you'll all owe me a flagon""

So he climbed into the cave until he saw the beast
The cavern lit, a placard​ above said ""God bless this feast""

""I made it myself"" the dragon roared
As he bent low to see the tax collector his tail moored.

""What brings you to my humble abode, could it be the gold?""
The dragon was close and loud but his breath was still cold.

""My Lord, the king of this land is tired of fighting you and seeks peace""
The tax collector heard the gold and was smart and knew not to lay eyes on a single piece.

""Why should I desire peace?"" The dragon spoke this time more calmly.
The offer was interesting and his greed was matched only by his laziness awfully.

""Because in peace you could not only serve the king
 but be rewarded more than you yourself could bring.""

""Become a tax collector like me, I'll show you the ropes,
You'll never have to flex your wing, you surely grasp the scope.""

""All the king asks is ten percent,
All the subjects pay their ten cent.""

The dragon his opinion swayed
 grasped the little tax collector and on his back he was laid.

""Take me to the king little tax collector,
And I will offer him my service as an economic protector""

The dragon flew, it left the men and the horses,
With the beating of his wings the town was in it's courses.

With a gust the dragon landed in the yard
The collector climbed down and placated the guard.

Dragon bellowed ""I have come to give my service to the king""
But the king was scared of what the dragon would bring.

The little tax collector approached the throne.
He said. ""my Lord throw me a bone"".

""I have brokered peace with the dragon, he will collect our taxes
He just ask that you and your men would lay down your axes.""

The king encouraged said ""let it be done""
And as requested threw the little tax collector a bone.

Later that week with new renovations,
The bar included the tax collector with some extra accommodations.

The dragon enjoyed his drink,
The liquid he'd never think
Was so tasty and made his head fizzle
His laziness was never more chiseled

And all the king's men and all the king's horses, the king himself and the little tax collector too
Had a great feast with the beer, the wine, the bread and the meat times two.

The roar was heard by the barkeep who was wary of the dragon
The king's men cried ""get this man a flagon!

The barkeep obliged and collected the coin,
The dragon roared ""10 percent!"" And fell through the wall adjoined.

And that is the tale of the little tax collector who hired a dragon to be the economic protector.",waldosan_of_the_deep

"[WP] Write a story detailing either the inner monologue, or dialogue, of a character as they grow older and older",Phylar,"You don't realize that you've grown old until one day you come across something that you simply cannot do anymore. Maybe the bike seat is just a bit too high to swing your leg over, or your fingers fail to grasp a pen that just last week spilled ink onto the grocery list as easily as you just spilled the glass that suddenly slipped from your grip. Age sneaks up on you. It comes from behind and grabs your shoulders softly as you sit in your chair, squinting through glasses so thick it's a wonder they don't make your vision worse.

And everyone else knows it before you do. Your children offer their arms as you walk up the steps to your home, and you're surprised to find that you need them. The waitress smiles a little more warmly as she hands you a check with a ten percent senior's discount. You make to remedy the mistake before you realize that there hasn't been one, so you accept the markdown and decide whether or not to be offended.

Your daughter warns against adopting a dog, though the house has grown quiet and more than a little lonely and the framed photograph on the mantle is only good company every once in a while. She offers to bring the grandkids to visit more often. 

Grandkids? When did that happen? Only yesterday you were walking her down the aisle, twirling her in her immaculate wedding dress, crying as you watched another man lead her across the floor. Now she has grey in her own hair, though not much, thank God.

And suddenly, you're bound to a chair. You begin to notice the youth in everyone around you as they smile and run and *live*. The resentment lasts only a little while before your joints ache too much to care. You try to stand, to prove to yourself that maybe you're not degrading as fast as you fear. But all it takes is one tumble before you're sent to a nursing home to be surrounded by others that only remind you of your own frailty.

They don't visit as often. You miss them more than you care to admit to yourself.

Where did the time go? You can feel the days slip by like soft breezes across your face. The hours are in the sunlight that fades each evening, the minutes in the wind chimes, the seconds in the crickets that chirp you to sleep one last time.

You wish you had gone out with some burst of splendor, taking your youth on your own terms.

But this will have to do.",nildrohain
"[WP] The planet is ruined due to global warming, our celestial creator arrives from the skies and explains humanity destroyed the world faster than any other species before us.",Roybit,"Log entry - 16 august 2118

This might be my final entry.

At first we tought it was just a scam. Political leaders seemed to confirm this, telling the world it wasn't as grave as the scientists made it seem. Ofcoarse we, the common folk, didn't think to much about it. Our current way of life was to comftable.

Earth started changing, our nature started dying and humanity started struggeling.
It started with the less fortunate people of 3rd world counrties.
What once was the cradle of human life, now lies barren, unhabitable by those who once came from there. Later, by the lack of supplies, the rest of the world went in a crysis.

Now its been almost 2 months since 'they' returned. They told us they were back to improve the world, to fix it. Never knew fixing things would involve so many of us beeing killed. They told us we were a virus to this world, the worst kind they have ever seen. the 'ones before' lasted at least a bit longer they said.
I guess they must have gotten bored of just watching us... Now they wanted the show to be a bit more... interactive.

Now rumours are going around, talk of our next attack. I don't have high hopes for this, but what can we do otherwise? Just stay here and let ourselfs be suppressed? Our freedom taken away? No! The rebellion must remain strong! I just hope we can keep our plans a secret until tomorrow.

D-day... this time we take back what is ours.
If you are reading this, that means that the attack is over. Whe either win, or we lose, but after this one... their wil be no second chances, not for us, or not for them. 

Seeing that this might be my final log, I have just one request for whoever reads this.

Please,
Remember me...

End of log.

[WP] You just found out that your parents are paying people to be your friends.,axmszr,"“Hi I’m Gregg! Isn’t it awesome to be here?! What’s your name?” he said with the enthusiasm of a toothy evangelist. 

“Uh, hey man. I’m Stevie.”

“Wow Stevie! What a cool name. We should hang out sometime! Like tonight, or tomorrow! Give me your phone and I’ll put my number in,” he said, snatching my phone from my hands. I looked over to my mother who was smiling warmly at this interaction. 

“Cool there you go! Now you call me so I’ll have your number,” Gregg shouted.

“Uh, ok,” I said and pressed the contact he had put in titled ‘G Spot’.

“AWWWEEESOME!” he gasped. “Hit me up whenever dude!” He grinned, shooting a strange look to my mother before bounding down the hall.

“That’s like the fourth person today to run up to me and give me their number,” I said to my mother, deleting G Spot from my contact list. Too eager, too engaged.  

“Well, you weren’t voted ‘most popular’ at your high school for nothing!” she chirped as we walked out the lobby of the dorm building and into the parking lot.

So far, move in day had involved a lot of weird interactions that overly friendly people. Not what I expected at all.  

“Well anyway, thanks for helping me move in today mom. You’re a really good parent, and I appreciate everything you’ve done for me. I don’t think I’d be here without you.” I said.

“Oh Stevie. You always have such beautiful things to say. I feel so lucky to have you as my son,” she said, wiping a tear from her eye. “Have a great time, and call if there’s anything you need!”

With that, she got in her car and began the journey back home. Just then, my phone buzzed. I looked down to see a number I didn’t recognize. 

--Ok so it’s an hourly rate right? I can clock in and upload proof on the site, and you PayPal me the cash?--

Thoroughly confused I wrote back:

--Wrong number, friend.--

--LOL SMH no worries, srry--

Back in my dorm, while unpacking some clothes from a box, a very enthusiastic 
“What up DAWG?!” shattered my first moments of quiet since moving in. It was Kelly, another hyperactive and uber-friendly kid I had met schlepping boxes. 

“Wanna go get some burritos? I hear they’re killer!” he suggested hopefully.

“Thanks but no thanks man, still unpacking and moving in. Maybe later,” I replied.

“Cool ,cool ,cool, no worries my manI! Hit me up later! You still have my number right?”

“Um ya I think so.”

“Rad. I saved it in your phone under ‘Killa K’,” he said throwing me the shaka sign and walking off, sandals flipping and flopping down the hallway. 

“Fuck me,” I said to myself. Just then, my phone vibrated. I picked it up from its resting place on my new desk and opened the screen.  Another number I didn’t recognize stared back at me.

--This bro is hard to crack! Up for the challenge for sure tho, might need a few extra duckets for the trouble lol--

At the end of the message, a shaka sign emoji glowed up at me. 

“WTF?” I thought. I had deleted Kelly’s number right away after he gave it to me. He had also been, well, a douche. But who did he think he was contacting, and what was this about ‘extra duckets for the trouble’? I decided to investigate and see how far this went.

--That can be arranged. Could you be more specific about what you plan to do?-- 


I sat, waiting for the response, the pieces slowly coming together in my mind. I re-read the other foreign numbered message I received earlier. …hourly rate…..paypal....proof. It didn’t fully hit me until Kelly’s response came through:

--Shit I dunno, take him out partying, introduce him to some homies and homegirls, normal stuff that’s on the website. I’ll let you know tho, thanks Shelia.-- 

Shelia.

I blinked and looked twice at the name. The magnitude of what she had done hit me like a ton of bricks.

--Right, can you send me the link to the website I sent you? Just want to make sure it’s current. Thx--

I sat back, disbelieving, waiting for his reply. 

--www.friendsforcash.com/StevieM--

The reply flashed in my inbox, and I quickly opened the message and followed the link. It was terrible. There was my picture with my vital statistics and things I liked to do listed off like some auction profile. I scanned further down the page to see a blurb about me, the different services my mother was paying for, and some rules and regulations for friendship. Further down the page, testimonials from familiar faces littered the section:

“Great buyer, fast and on time payment”

“Kid is a bit of a dud but the money is great!”

“The sex was mediocre but the cash made up for it!”

I smiled. 

The irony of what had taken place was so palpable it clung in the air like old laundry smell.  

I opened my phone’s contact list and pressed the name ‘Carlos’ while simultaneously pulling the black binder out from the box I had buried it in. 

“Account number?” the voice on the other end prompted. I pushed in my numbers and waited.

“Carlos Portonos here. What’s up Stevie?”

“Ya listen I have a contract violation on my hands here. I’m voiding,” I said, still smiling to myself.

“What’s going on,” asked Carlos.

“I have the contract in front of me,” I said, removing the document from the black binder it’d been given to me in. 

“Section 6.4, article 3: ‘If client attempts to knowingly deceive, manipulate, hinder the growth of, or abuse the agent in any way, this contract will be voided’” I stated into the phone.

There was a pause on the other end as Carlos shuffled papers around. 

“Her parents won’t be pleased Roger. This is a 60 year contract. They’re also getting pretty old, and they might take this news hard. Are you sure you don’t want to stick it out?”

I let the thought linger for a moment. I thought back to all the times Shelia had cared for me, all the nice things she had done, and all the checks I had collected over the years playing this role. I thought back to my “adoption”, and the look on her face when she met me for the first time. I had carved a nice little niche out for myself here. Besides, what opportunities were there for a 35 year old out of work actor who looked like an 18 year old? I knew the role so well, it was too easy at this point. 

“I want $1,000 more a month,” I said finally. 

“That will have to be negotiated with her parents, I’ll get back to you.” Carlos hung up before I could object.

I sat back, letting the situation wash over me like a warm blanket. She had played me, but I had been playing her all along. Perhaps we were family after all.

"[TT] You've been talking to the stars for most of your life, about your successes and troubles. One night, the stars answer back.",axmszr,"“They say the gods descended out of the sky on a ladder made of stars to save us all,” Mortimer’s father read, putting on his best impression of an old wise prophet, his voice hushed and strained. He trailed each word with his finger, but Mortimer did not watch. He was too engrossed by the picture of Sol and his kin, climbing out of their beautiful heavens just to save Earth. The nine shining gods are too perfect to truly be drawn. Their faces were inscrutable white pools of light, like they themselves were stars too. 

“And that,” his father finished, “is why we still serve the Nine to this day.” He closed up the picture book and ruffled Mortimer’s head. “Now you need to sleep, little boy.”

“Okay,” Mortimer said.

He waited a brutal hour and a half until his father fell asleep to creep out of bed. It was raining, gently, an inviting *tap tap tap* against the window pane. He put on his rain slicker over his pajamas and carried his rain boots until he reached the back door. He slipped his boots on, eased the knob open soundlessly, and slipped out, into the garden.

The sky was cloudy, but he knew the stars were there. Listening. The books his father read him said every light in the sky represents a person, that Sol listens to the prayers of his people through the very stars. Mortimer believed it, ardently.

He wandered through the garden, eyes on the sky, and told the night about his day. Little had happened in it. Another child hit him at school and the teacher didn’t believe him. He hated writing letters. He hated writing at all. Music class didn’t last long enough. His father made him eat all his green beans even though they were like terrible soft fingers with runny bones.

Mortimer spilled his worries to the stars and the rain. He figured this was what adults meant by praying. By now he had been out so long his hair was soaking and his throat aching. He yawned, told the stars, “Okay, I have to go to bed now,” and turned to go inside.

He paused at the door and looked up at the sky one last time, all gray and angry, and saw something falling out of it. The boy froze on the threshold and watched as a star plummeted from the heavens, falling streaking in a trail of blue light. 

Mortimer clutched the doorknob. Every instinct in him told him to run inside, get his parents, go back to bed.

But perhaps the gods had heard. Perhaps they sent one of their stars to help. To set his father and his school teachers straight. He stood, rooted to the spot, and watched with equal fascination and terror.

The star crash-landed in his mother’s zucchini plant with a loud terrible thud that made Mortimer shriek in surprise. Thunder crashed overhead. He nearly bolted inside. But then the star moaned.

Mortimer inched over to it, thinking about stranger danger and disrespect to the gods all at once, not sure which sin surpassed the other. When he reached the star’s side it wasn’t a star at all but a person. Almost human. Its top half was coated in black feathers, some as long as Mortimer’s forearm, but as it tried to sit up the feathers began falling up in fat clusters and Mortimer saw pale skin underneath.

“You,” it rasped, fixing him with eyes amber and ancient, like a bird. “Help.”

Mortimer held out a hand without thinking. “Are you a girl or a boy?” he asked, tentatively, not sure what else to say.

The person clutched Mortimer’s hand and rubbed its downy thumb along the back of his hand. “I’m so very sorry to do this to you.”

Its other hand clasped Mortimer’s exposed forearm, and a blue arc of electricity sprung up from her fingers, burrowing under his skin, chasing up his nervous system and delving into his brain.

Mortimer was full of lights, stars exploding across his vision. He fell convulsing to the ground.

He saw nothing but white and heard nothing but that stranger’s voice echoing through his mind, urging him, *Go to sleep, go to sleep, just go to sleep.*

But Mortimer would not. Panic turned in his belly. Somehow he knew if he slept he would not wake up again. He tried to think about his family. His stuffed animals. His cars. There was a thing in his brain trying to eat him alive and if he let it then he wold never see anything again. Never *be* anything again.

Mortimer raised up one shuddering leg to kick the bird-person in the face. The shock of it made her loosen her grip and he ripped away and tore across the garden, tripping and ripping open his knee, not even caring.

The stranger held out its arm to him, but its eyes were dull and dead. Like only half of it was there.

Mortimer reeled. Waves crashed behind his eyes. He felt like he wasn’t himself anymore, like there was two of him but only one was himself. He couldn’t name the feeling, couldn’t quite get his arms around it. But he knew better than to tell anyone about it.

Mortimer darted inside to hide in bed, holding his burnt arm and sobbing into his pillow.

He did not see the men who appeared in the garden, descending to the earth rather more gracefully than the bird-person did. They wore black armor and carried only a knife and a staff each. They stood over the feathery body, with its shattered legs and half-open, empty mouth. One of them kicked it.

“Is she still in there?” the second asked.

“Not quite.” The other spat and surveyed the empty human houses. “It doesn’t seem like anyone saw her.”

“Do you think she…got away?”

“What? That she jumped to a new body? This vessel would be totally empty if she did that.” He nudged her face, and she flinched, involuntarily. “No. She’s just dying.” He crouched down and hissed in the listless creature’s face, “Not such a good escape plan after all, was it?”

One collected up her body. The other pulled a knife from his belt and cut a slit in the air itself. They walked through the opening and were gone.

"[TT] You've been talking to the stars for most of your life, about your successes and troubles. One night, the stars answer back.",axmszr,"I sat back, making myself comfortable in the camping chair, took a sip of ice-cold beer, licked my lips, and began.


“Well, it happened again,” I said, looking up into the night sky. “I’d make up my mind – I was going to ask Cheryl out today. So I marched over to her desk this morning, she looked up at me, and I… well, guess what? I chickened out. I couldn’t do it.”


My eyes still fixed on the heavens, I gulped down some more beer. I’d been doing this for years now – dragging a chair out into the back garden and just talking to the stars, unloading all my fears and worries on them. It had been something my dad had once suggested. He’d said it had made him feel better. And weirdly, it did the same for me, too. I guess it was kind of like having a psychiatrist. Only it was one who never talked back. Or charged me.


I took a deep breath. “I worry sometimes that I’ll be alone forever. And to add to that, I’m stuck in a dead-end job, and…”


“Oh, get over yourself,” a voice boomed out, interrupting me.


Nearly dropping my beer, I spun round. I thought someone had wandered into my garden and overheard everything, but there was no one there.


“And stop whining,” called out another voice, which sounded slightly further away.


“Wh-who’s there?” I yelled, trying and failing to stop my voice rising to a shrill squeal. I stood up and slowly turned on the spot, eyes straining into the darkness.


“Up here, kid,” the first voice said, and I looked up in time to see a star twinkling in time with the words.


The stars were finally answering back.


I opened my mouth to reply, but for once I was lost for words. My jaw flapped about uselessly.


“This is Sirius, by the way. Or it’s what you humans call me. Not that you’d know that. Have you ever bothered to learn our names? All you do is drone on and on about yourself.”


“I’m sorry,” I replied, as I collapsed back into my chair.


“Yeah, well, you’d better be,” Sirius replied, flaring brighter than ever as he berated me. 


“We’ve been talking,” said another star, a bright orange spark in the night sky. “This is Betelgeuse, by the way.”


“Hi, Betelgeuse,” I said.


“Be quiet,” Sirius snapped, “and let him talk.”


“All of us stars have been talking,” Betelgeuse said again, “and we’re fed up with you ranting at us every night.”


“Yeah,” another star yelled, flickering in the middle of Orion’s Belt. “We’ve had enough.”


Suddenly, the sky was filled with twinkling stars, and my ears were filled with their yells as they shouted at me and complained about me in equal measure.


“Come on, now,” Sirius shouted over them, but they ignored him. “Everyone be quiet!” he roared, blazing brighter than ever.


Finally, the din died down. I looked up at Sirius, unsure what to say.


“I think you’ve got the gist of it,” he said.


I just nodded.


“Good. Because this has to stop. We’ve had it up to here. And we’re quite high up. The only one of us who isn’t fed up of you is Sun, and that’s just because they’re lucky enough not to be here when you’re holding forth. All you do is complain about how hard done by you are, and how horrible your life is. And it really isn’t.”


“But it is!” I shouted, spilling some of my beer over my lap. “Haven’t you been listening?”


“Of course we have,” Betelgeuse replied. “That’s how we know how wrong you are. Your life’s not that bad. We’re looking down on the whole planet, and we can see thousands – no, millions of people whose lives are much worse. You have your own house, for one thing. A house with a back garden. Think of the people who are sleeping out on the streets tonight.”


“Alright, alright. But just because I have a house doesn’t mean everything’s amazing.”


“You’re always saying your job is horrible,” Betelgeuse replied, ignoring me. “At least you have a job.”


I didn’t know what to say to that.


“And your job doesn’t even sound that bad,” Sirius added. “You’re just a little bored with it, that’s all. It never sounds that stressful – you always manage to complete your tasks on time, and you never get any complaints about them. Your salary’s good. Higher than average, for some reason. From what you’ve told us, it sounds like all of your colleagues loves you. Even your boss likes you.”


“Really?” I asked, dumbfounded. 


“Yes,” Sirius replied, twinkling. “I wouldn’t be surprised if a promotion is coming your way soon.”


“Besides,” Betelgeuse said, “even if all of this wasn’t true – if you didn’t have a house or a job – you’re still living at a great time. We’ve been up here for thousands and thousands of years. We’ve been watching you humans this whole time. And trust us – things used to be a lot worse.”


“I guess,” I replied sullenly.


“No, don’t guess,” the star snapped. “That’s not my opinion. It’s a fact. You’ve got a lot to be thankful for, so start being grateful.”


“You’ve got a job, you’ve got money, you’ve got your health,” Sirius added. “And all your family are perfectly healthy too. So please, please, stop whining. Because we’re done listening to you.”


“Alright,” I replied. “I’ll try.”


“No, don’t try!” yelled another star, a star who didn’t bother to introduce themselves. “Next time you thinking of coming out here and telling us about your day – don’t. Just shut the hell up.”


“Okay, okay. This is the last time I ever do this,” I said, holding up my hands up. “Although if I’m really that annoying,” I muttered, “I don’t know why you didn’t say something earlier.”


“Oh, and one more thing,” said Sirius, and I jumped, thinking I was about to be told off again. “This Cheryl girl you’re madly in love with?”


I nodded.


“Just ask her out already. It sounds like she actually likes you. Although from what you’ve told us about Dave from HR, he’s probably going to ask her out before you. And he’s quite the catch. So hurry up and get over yourself. Ask her out.”


“Yes, sir,” I replied, and then something the star had said registered. “Wait a minute. What do you mean, ‘it sounds like she likes me?’ Do you really think that?”

There was no answer. I looked up at the sky, waiting for the stars to twinkle as they yelled at me, but they looked the same as they said every other night I’d sat out there.


I stared down at the now-empty bottle of beer, and then at the other eight that were scattered on the grass around me.


Maybe I’d had enough. Maybe it was time to call it a night.

You've travelled to the only alternate universe (ours) where spoken language is a thing and have no idea whats going on.,axmszr,"They didn’t seem to notice I’m different from them. Nothing beside short and polite glances. They have a similar writing system to the other Earths. It is written English mostly seeing as I’m in America; New York state I believe. 	

What’s weird is they open their mouths to speak instead of just eating. I wrote to them on pads of paper to communicate. I saw a 30 year old woman and wrote to her that I’m from the only earth that started with the ability to travel and I want to show them how we reverse engineered it so they can travel too. They normally react the same bet the dimensions where I become a celebrity really feed my ego so I can’t help but try. The look of confusion she gave me isn’t unusual but strikingly more pitiful than when I’ve done this with other projects. After all this was my 11,119th assignment and I think I’ve almost all of the shapes that humans can take in the multiverse. 	

They seem to be using much less gesticulation than any other humans I’ve seen. Really only the most basic and intuitive gesticulations. They however seem to be as complex and advanced as your average Earth. I send a message to the other visitor in their Qatar and he informs me that it seems to be everybody uses mouth speaking all over the world. I suspect that their mouths may be releasing pheromones to communicate but our program can’t translate it from pieces from other languages in the multiverse. Extra pheromones are ruled out.

Do they experience a different axis of sensation? Similar to the electromagnetic or molecular vision Earth? They must be understand a plane of experience I haven’t figured out yet. I’m getting around okay using the local writing system but they still seem to dismiss. Even those who initially write back. I keep writing that I don’t understand them when they mouth at me like mouth breathing fish. 
On my 5th week an 8 year old boy starts to gesticulate at me. It’s strangely very similar to the one from my home Earth and on most others. I gesticulate back. Is he a rare person on his planet that uses the same kind of communication that I do? His mother comes by and using the same language asks about me. His mother asks if I am like him. She uses a word I don’t recognize. Then she spells it out D-E-A-F. She said that she knows a great physician in the area that I should go to if I just moved here. I thank them profusely.

I make an appointment and see the physician. He explains that other people have ears not for balance but for communicating. He ends up explaining everything very slowly. He says I can get a minor brain surgery and have a good chance of being able to hear and communicate similarly to almost everyone else on this world. It will take time but if I go through a learning program I’ll be a great candidate. 

I get the procedure. The sensation of noise if painful but I can deal with it. This isn’t as novel of as other new sensory experiences but I can deal with it. The culture of this earth was interesting but hearing certainly isn’t as cool as molecular vision. About the same level of novelty as pheromone speak to be honest. It gets old pretty quickly. I’m satisfied after documenting this Earth’s unique trait and leave the knowledge of interdimensional travel with trusted librarians and the public and go to my next assignment. All humans react pretty predictably with this knowledge so it’s not worth watching again.

Mal watched as Officer Vasquez held the retinal scanner over the corpse's eyes, heard the soft *beep* as it registered his identity. Vasquez stood up, her manner all business. 

""That's the last one, detective. Anything else you need me to do before I split?""

""No, thank you Ana. As long as HQ has all the victim idents, you're free to go.""

""Righto. Don't stay up too late now, detective. Not good for your complexion.""

Mal grunted in response as Vasquez swept out of the room, sidestepping the other body that was laying across the doorway. Mal lingered for a moment, taking one final look at the man with the slashed throat, then followed her out of the corner office and into the hallway, carefully dodging the victim at the door as well.

The corner office sat snug at the far end of a vast room of cubicles, stretching off to Mal's right. Every light in the place was on, the harsh fluorescent lighting mixing with the red and blue hues from the assembled police cruisers outside. Someone had neglected to draw the window shades; she'd have one of the new kids on crowd control duty outside take care of that. *Not much point now* she thought ruefully, as the assembled knot of late night rubberneckers had gotten an eyeful already.

Bodies in various states of dismemberment were strewn across the office. Some sported bullet holes, others stab wounds. Some had both. All told, there were 31 confirmed victims. Here and there, police photographers were methodically documenting the injuries, their cameras inches away from the unmoving bodies. 

Some of the victims nearest the exit still had their phone headsets on; they had been the first ones down in the spree, still trying to provide the best in customer service, if the company slogan was to be believed. Unaware of the impending doom that had manifest behind them, roughly 2 hours ago.

As she pushed open the exit door, Mal checked her watch: 2:17am. Jesus, why did this asshole killer have to work third shift? 

**

Back at Police HQ, Mal settled at her desk and warmed her hands on the mug of coffee she had just poured herself. It had been a particularly cold November in Vermont thus far, and the heater in her cruiser had been acting up again, wheezing out warmth like an asthmatic. She shivered and brought up Vasquez's retinal scans on her computer screen.

31 victims. Of those, only 5 were in the SOUL database: 3 females and 2 males. She'd start with the females first; they usually responded better to intense trauma, thus making them easier to talk to in virtual. She pulled up the list of names and input them into the SOUL database.

Serial Omnipotent Upload Link, or SOUL, was a relatively new invention, and only recently approved for use in humans by the government. For a not insignificant fee, participants in the program allowed surgeons to implant a tiny relay at the base of their skull, with leads that ran into the deepest parts of the brain. After a brief calibration period, the participants lived their lives normally, but now with the relay uploading their entire experience to cloud storage. SOUL recorded all sensory input, thoughts, feelings, desires... every part of the human experience. Over time and with enough data, SOUL would build a digital copy of the person's consciousness, feeding off the constant flow of uploaded information to keep it as close to the real thing as possible. 

Of course, this presented a multitude of ethical dilemmas, the most basic of them being: if SOUL was replicating a person's consciousness, but doing it in a digital space, did that qualify the digital consciousness for personhood? And if so, did that mean the construct was, in essence, being imprisoned against its will?

This was one of the questions that SOUL's parent company, Icarus Inc., had spent millions of dollars debating through years of court cases. In the end, Icarus had to prove that the stored consciousness' of its customers were inert. Their solution was an On/Off switch, which only allowed the consciousness to be activated in certain specific circumstances.

One of those circumstances was the death of the participant. 

Running a violet nail down the computer screen, Mal picked the first female victim name--Baker, Chelsea--and punched it into the SOUL database. After entering her prompted credentials, she clicked the green **ACTIVATE** button on the screen. This meant Ms. Chelsea Baker was now loaded into the virtual interrogation rig that the eggheads at Icarus had designed for self-aware digital consciousnesses. Run off a bank powerful supercomputers that took up the entire basement of the building, the rig had been donated to the police force in a PR stunt to try to get public support for SOUL back on their side. 

Mal meshed her fingers and stretched her hands high over her head, searching for and finally achieving the familiar *pop* in her upper spine. She followed it with a twist of her neck; her usual ritual before donning the 3D haptic gear. Fixing her hair into a messy ponytail, she slipped the visor over her head, adjusted the headphones, and pulled on the gloves. Settling back in her chair, she closed her eyes and slowed her breathing. Being dumped into virtual interrogation was always a bit jarring, so she liked to be calm before she dived in each time. 

She knew it was even more disorienting for the victims she spoke to. From their perspective, they simply appeared in the interrogation room, the experience of their often grisly death still fresh in their minds. The rig functioned as a blank slate for the victims; their consciousness filled it like water filling a glass. The appeared in the room looking like they had in real life, their digital self rendering their appearance in real time. The rig rendered Mal as she was in real life too, and the 3D haptic gear she wore acted as a window in to the virtual environment. It was also designed with emotional limiters, which dampened the single most traumatic event in the victim's life into a distant, vaguely dissatisfying memory.

A ripple across both hands told Mal the construct was ready. She opened her eyes and saw the familiar bright expanse of the the virtual space. A spartan desk and two chairs was a few paces in front of her, and in one of the chairs, sat a very bewildered looking Chelsea Baker.

Detective Moeffler glanced at his assistant and asked him a very important question: ""Why are you here?""

""I don't know,"" the assistant answered meekly. ""M-Mom was an alcoholic, y'see...""

""Shut it.""

""Y-yes, sir.""

Moeffler was an impressive man. For, everything about Moeffler was short: his height, his money, and his temper. But the mustache he sported over his upper lip was more than compensation for all those things he lacked, and added to the massive brain jammed-packed in that little skull of his, Moeffler was an impressive man indeed. 

""Crap,"" Moeffler uttered, for the man was once again dead. ""He died.""

""So he has,"" murmured the assistant (who has a name, but when you're in the presence of a man like Moeffler, frankly, your name doesn't matter).

You work for an evil corporation that is trying to make a product that gets the words spoken by tons of people.,tytoon,"""Guy's you don't understand, all we have to do is use prisoners who can sing!""

My idea was perfect. It was simple marketing strategy. Make something so absolutely terrible that it will go viral and everyone will talk about it. To be honest it took me a while to come up with this due to the fact the 3-word phrase is so damn random. I can't think of a single normal conversation it would come up in. 

At least, not before today.

Surprisingly the board of directors approved my plan, but only gave me enough funding for 3 normal prisoners so I had to convince the all-women's prison that I was recruiting for a new singing competition based around criminals. Wouldn't have convinced anyone but dumb criminals, since everyone in the world was already wary of the rise in complex evil schemes over the past few years. However, no one would be prepared for how simple and beautiful mine would be.

All went according to plan, and a few weeks later (due to a surprise donation from the CEO) a short thirty second commercial appeared at prime time on every single TV station and on popular social media site. An abomination of a creature appeared on screen and attempted a very poor sales pitch for a diet soda, while also threatening actors who refused it. Right at the end, with a surprisingly catchy cadence, three semi-decent female singers sang my genius jingle.

[WP] The oldest creature in the universe meets the youngest one.,Dioksys,"Jeremiah kicked and screamed, in vain of course, his mouth taped, his legs and arms bound together. All he could manage was to smash himself against the sand and mossy rocks that he lay against. The sound of the waves drowning out his curses and shouts.

His wife sat across from him, Mary's crystal blue eyes twinkling in a flood of tears. Her face covered in snot and a mess of her own hair. She let out muffled moans as a hand gently caressed her extremely pregnant belly.

Jeremiah looked around him, hoping to see help coming from the beach in the form of Caleb's truck. He saw the truck and saw Caleb but he wasn't salvation they had already got to him. Caleb stood among the others the sickly green hood not fully covering his face unlike the rest of the converted.

Daniel removed his hand from Mary's stomach and used it to flick his hood off. He had a shaven head now, just like the paintings Jeremiah had drawn in his drug fueled hallucinations.

Daniel clumsily fumbled inside his robes and slid out the sacrificial dagger. The blade made of bone and handle of obsidian.

""It should have been you Jeremiah."" Daniel pointed the knife at him accusingly ""But your mother was blind to the teachings. Begin the celebration!""

The crowd surrounding them became a buzz of humming and indecipherable words. Jeremiah shook wildly but did not break free.

""Great One, I am but you humble servant."" Daniel closed his eyes looking to the sky speaking as loud as he could without shouting. ""I do not ask for your boon or any worldly possession, we have gathered the pieces to your prison and may now set you free."" He held the dagger in both hands outstretched. ""Hear me Great One come to the sound of my voice the door will be unlocked.""

Daniel stabbed the knife down into Mary's abdomen. She let out a scream the blew off the tape on her mouth. Jeremiah froze as Mary's voice faded and her eyes closed.

The knife flicked downwards and blood spilled out onto Mary's shirt and coat.

Lightning cracked only a few metres off the coast. The clouds started to swirl, only just visible in the light from the town and flashes of white. Hot summer rain fell like a sheet.

Jeremiah's vision blurred with a mix of rain and tears that he couldn't wipe away. He continued to struggle, rolling onto his back. He closed his eyes to stop the rain from pounding them. The chanting and humming continued around him, it was loud and fierce now.

He opened his eyes for a moment to see the sky fill with light again. The clouds filled the night but there seemed to be gaps, in the moment he had his eyes open Jeremiah could the night sky slithering around the clouds like a serpent.

There was a crash, the sound of a dam bursting all at once and water picked Jeremiah off the beach and slammed him into metal then deposited him on concrete.

The rain had stopped just as it had come on. Jeremiah opened his eyes but was not sure if he could see. There was only blackness the lighthouse was dark and all streetlamps were out. The water drained from one of his ears, he could no longer hear the chanting or the waves.

A bolt of lightning hit the wharf illuminating the beach and sea. What Jeremiah saw his mind could not grasp immediately, something huge, pulsing, moving, breathing. 

His eyes started to adjust to the darkness. The thing was large enough to reach the sky, or was it reaching down from the sky. It was a dark inky blue and there were small dots in it that twinkled like stars. 

Jeremiah heard a scream, the crying of a baby, his daughter. 

Another boom of thunder and then the hulking mass spoke with voice that rivaled it. 

“Well, hello little one.”

[WP] The oldest creature in the universe meets the youngest one.,Dioksys,"The universe was vast, but its oldest intelligent life lived in its 'center'. There was no one true center, of course, but it was chose since it was a good general central location. They were lucky they also picked the star system that held the oldest of the beasts. Whatever it was asked, it knew. Old enough that it seemed to have roots into the very fabric of this plane.


And was it fitting that the oldest creature took the shape of a dragon? This lizardlike creature was depicted in all kinds of races, from tiny little things with butterfly wings, no larger than a minnow, to massive creatures that swam among the stars, carrying suns in their talons.


This particular one, though, wasn't quite as old as time itself. but time had taken a toll on him. He was once a powerful thing, and he still is. Even those that were far larger and much stronger bowed to the beast- he wasn't even massive either. Large enough that he could be mistaken for a mountain if it weren't for his wings and colors. Big enough to be a problem to any relatively native creature in his millennia of a lifespan. He called himself Glacius, after his black scales that shimmered in blue hues like cold galaxies. Fitting. 


Today was a special day; for one of his descendants brought forward an egg. It of course took years to incubate under his watchful eye, but time had come. Other species have come together to see what they call a 'rift dragon' hatch- it was an exceedingly rare event, after all. Rift dragons rarely had the time to breed, as they were always moving, repairing even the tiniest tears in the fabric of the universe. 


Glacius knew it was time; laying still and nosing the egg with his muzzle. He could feel the life within stirring. His own claws tapped on the tough shell as the baby squirmed within it. All kinds stood before, watching. He saw all sizes of beings in the crowd, glad that for once peace could exist. 


The egg cracked and shook, which he'd hold it still for the young. The squeaking was quiet to him, but loud to the rest. A piece of shell jumped off and to the ground. Then more; until its head popped out. The creature was colored white with blotches of black and blue; a typical color pattern. After a bit longer it was free of the shell, tumbling out and squeaking some more. 


Glacius may have been the oldest creature in the universe. But the youngest? Why, there's births all over this planet, this galaxy. For a moment, everyone was the youngest thing in the universe. It looked at him as he leaned to nuzzle it softly. It'd start to grow in no time; Rift dragons were born capable to hunt and fly once they find their feet, due to little care from the parents. Glacius will see to that this rare creature will make it to adult form.


For a moment, the oldest creature in this plane had met the youngest. Then he had not; for another birth occurred somewhere else in the universe. ",Akitiki

'Harry!' Hermione gasped in shock, 'Bloody Hell,' Ron screeched.

Snape had reacted a bit harsher, only losing his composure for a moment as his quill broke apart upon the now-ruined scroll. 'What,' he sneered as he turned to the lad, 'did you just call me?'

'I called you a vindictive cunt,' Harry repeated.

'Stop saying that!' Hermione yelled in his ear.

'The first fucking hour since we met, you've mercilessly picked on everyone except that little gobshite over there,' Harry said as he pointed to Draco. 'What? Were you bullied as a kid and now you're taking it out on people that you're... four, five times older than?'

'I'm 32,' he declared.

'Being an asshole isn't good for your health,' Harry warned. 'I should know. My uncle's a right cunt and he's had at least one heart attack this Summer.'

'Would you stop saying that?!' Hermione screamed.

'You really should, Harry,' Ron warned. 'I mean, I swear a bit but that's a bit much.'

'50 points from Gryffindor,' Snape barked.

'Make it a hundred, because I don't give a fuck,' Harry said. 'I mean, do you really think you're paid to glare down at us, sneer when we make mistakes instead of, I don't know... *Teaching us both to avoid them and how to deal with them*?'

'How would you like a month in detention?' Snape yelled.

'How would you like to suck my balls?!'

Everyone gasped the second the words left his mouth. 'What did you just say?!' Snape screamed.

'Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,' Harry said. 'What I said was...'

'Where did he get a megaphone?' Dean Thomas asked.

'*HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUCK MY BALLS, MR SNAPE,*' Harry said before setting the megaphone down.

Everyone was silent, most of the students with horror, Snape with sheer rage. It wasn't until a single voice broke the silence.

'Wow,' Goyle said in horrified awe.

'You single-handedly cost Gryffindor House the House Cup,' Professor McGonagall said in a cold and enraged voice, 'and earned yourself an entire year's worth of detention... by insulting Snape? Mr Potter, what in name of sweet heaven were you *thinking*?'

Most of Gryffindor House was watching as Harry was being questioned, most of them angry. They were hoping for at least one year beating Slytherin in the House Cup, and some snot-nosed First Year has screwed that up.

Harry was sitting on a chair, oddly composed. His back was straight, his shoulders were broad and there wasn't even the slightest hint of fear or agitation on his face.

'Alright,' Harry said as he began to speak. 'As a new student at this school, I regret to say that I find myself disgusted and horrified at the behaviour and teaching practices of one teacher in particular, and that is our potions *master*, Severus Snape. And despite being raised among Muggles and being new to the world of wizards and magic - and I do invite anyone to inform me of any etiquettes or information which I may be lacking as a result - I nevertheless strongly feel that Snape, after only one class, has already overstepped several boundaries of professional etiquette.'

'Is that all?' McGonagall asked.

'Not quite,' he continued. 'He plays clear favourites in his classes and during interaction with students between or after classes, unjustly praising students in his own House and unjustly punishing those in other classes, as Hermione will attest.'

'Yes, I... can confirm that,' she said weakly.

'He outright bullies students he doesn't like for superficial reasons and shows more interest in childish insults and berating students for slight mistakes and failing to learn a class than actually teaching that class in an effective manner. If this was a Muggle school he wouldn't be teaching here. Also, at least once he has violated the trust placed in him by a prefect who has disclosed sensitive information in confidentiality by repeating said information in front of others. I have also taken the liberty of taking the records for points awarded and deducted and have coloured over them with highlighter pens for points I believe are suspect in the appropriate House Color... except those in Pink which are exclusively the Weasley Twins.'

'He's right,' Fred said. 'We didn't even *do* most of these last year.'

'We did that,' George said as he pointed to the page.

'So, yeah, I was rude when I raised those concerns, and I was too angry to say this in an effective manner,' Harry said. 'But I will say this for as many times as I have to - Snape is a stupid son-on-a-bitch ignorant bastard, an ignoramus cunt who is a disgrace to the teaching profession and for the continued safety of the student body I'd recommend he dismissed from his position immediately. And if anyone has an issue with this, I kindly suggest they write this on a letter, sign it, then shove it into the tiny hole at the end of their dicks. And if the fucking Quidditch team doesn't clean whatever shit they spread on my bed I assure you will regret the consequences.'

Everyone was left agape as he leaned back into the chair, until the Head of House broke the silence. 'Why don't you apply yourself like that in your classes?' she asked him.

[WP] Through certain circumstances you meet several parallel versions of yourself. What happens?,JannisT,"I woke up to a high pitched scream. As I jumped out of bed, I noticed something was different then when I had fallen asleep. Two things, in fact. 
My eyes were immediately drawn to the attractive blonde who had undoubtedly emitted the scream. Her hair was a little bit disheveled, but that didn't stop me from checking her out. Why in the world would someone that looked like THAT be sitting in my bedroom? 
My attention quickly turned to the other thing that wasn't supposed to be in my room. A man, nearly an identical copy of myself, stared back at me looking thoroughly confused. He wore a dirty, torn shirt and shorts that looked like they had been dragged behind a garbage truck. 
""Where the crap am I?"", he (I?) grunted. 
The girl started to hyperventilate, and so I walked over to her and gave her my hand, ignoring the other me. After I convinced her that I knew nothing of what was going on, I sat back onto my bed. What in the world was going on?
As the sun rose, hours later, things were finally starting to become clear. After the three of us had talked for hours and hours, trying to discover what had happened, it became evident that we were... the same. The same and yet different.
When I told them I am Samuel Morris, and a criminal defense lawyer, the pig-pen of a man yelled that his name was Sam Norris, and he had just gotten out of prison after wrongfully being convicted. The girl, near tears the whole time, whispered that she went by Samantha Morse, and was the secretary at a law firm. Many small similarities tied us together, like the location of the high school we had went to, our favorite food (steak, of course), and the number of siblings we had. 
We sat quietly, pondering the meaning of the most logical explanation we had came up with in the course of the night: we were all the same person, from different dimensions in the multiverse. Finally, breaking the silence, Sam announced that he was going to the bathroom. As soon as the door closed, Samantha came to me and wrapped her arms around me. ""That can't be me. I couldn't be a mess like that, I just couldn't. Please, help me. Please don't let..."" Her words trailed off as her warm body pressed against mine, and as I looked into her (familiar) green eyes, I felt a strange and wonderful feeling. I found my lips and hers interlocked, and after what must have been a few minutes, she fell back from me, smiling but frightfully pale. 
Fear then took control of her face, and she appeared to be... fading is the closest word. When I could see the wall behind her through her, as though she was colored glass, she began to smile and began repeating the words, ""Home, home, home, home!"" The words faded into silence as the last remnants of her image appeared. 
Sam stood in the doorway, mouth open. ""You KISSED her... errr... us?""
I turned away, unable to meet his disgusted expression. Slowly, he formed another sentence.
""And... then... she... went... home...""
I turned back to see him tip-toeing towards me.
My eyes widened and I searched for an escape route or a blunt object to fight with. 
Not on my LIFE was that going to happen.",captainminnow
[WP] Through certain circumstances you meet several parallel versions of yourself. What happens?,JannisT,"""It works! The dimention-travel machine works!""

""Oh yeah! Eat it, bitches! I'm the first person to teleport in the whole world!""

""Ура! Наконец, я поничил этот агрегат! Тут так тепло!""

All of these exclamations happened at the same time as three copies of myself suddenly appeared in my room. All that's left is the exclamation from myself:

""What. The. Fuck.""

""Wait, who are you?""

""Who are you!""

""Что происходит?""

The panic continued for a solid minuted until I came to my senses.

""Guys! Guys!!!""

The noise stopped and the three versions of me looked at... me. One of them looked like your typical mad scientist, another seemed like he came from an all-nighter, and the thrird one had a coat and an ushanka on.

""First"", I... I mean, the original, the normal me, said, ""How the fuck did you get here? Second, why the fuck do you all look like me?""

The Russian guy was quick to answer:

""Я не говорить по английски. Гм. Ai no speek english.""

""Don't speak then, ya twat!"", the one from the party seemed to have british accent. ""Look, pals, I bid 10£ I'll be the first person to teleport, can ya, like, go back to yer dimentions?""

""It's off the table! I've spent YEARS perfecting Dequatum Jiguliators, I WON'T throw all my work away because of some KID who plays with REAL SCIENCE!""

""Я думаю нам стоит перестать кри—""

""I already LOST one teleporter in some nuclear winter dimention, it WON'T happen again!""

This is getting out of control.

""Guys! No need to argue! You just all need to explain yourselves and quietly return to your own dimentions""

""Are ye joking, pal? I ain't leaving until ye compensate me those 10£. Uh-uh.""

""In your dreams, KID! This THING is broken now! And unless this dimention has Pentadistabilatory Gygamegatrons, I'm stuck here for the rest of my LIFE!""

""...Может, мы всё обговорим?""

It looks like I'm gonna have a hard day.

[WP] Humans live in a quiet and empty part of the galaxy all alone. Aliens are surprised that a civilization could develop without any guidance from the precursors.,Jupefin,"**The Precursors**

Vani and Velli noticed the pale blue dot when they were scouting one morning, looking for new locations to explore. They called themselves pioneering biologists, because that sounded better than ""unemployed intergalactic scientists who fund their research projects by scrounging for scrap and ore"". Velli veered their little clanking pod around and zoomed toward it.

""What are you doing?"" Vani demanded. ""We're headed for 8954 Sceptri.""

""No, we're not."" He tossed the holomap at Vani. Their spaceship was a decades-old model and lacked even a basic holographic interface. It tracked the ship's vitals and spat information back in green letters on a tiny black LCD screen. ""It's not on the map.""

""What's not?""

""That. Out there.""

Vani and Velli exchanged meaningful looks. ""Blue means water,"" Velli pointed out, voice low.

""Water means life.""

They roved through the stars, headed straight for that little blip in the black night.
***
Vani and Velli flew over still and silent snow-capped peaks. This was a barren world, with only the occasional scurry of an animal here or there.

""Perhaps we'll name new species,"" Velli murmured.

""Let's not get too excited yet."" Vani peered out the dash and froze. ""Wait. There's an edifice down there. And lights.""

""*What?*"" Velli slowed and pivoted the ship downward to land. ""There should not be cognitively advanced life this far out into the Frontier. The Precursors never settled here.""

They landed the ship in silent agreement: they must see what built itself a house out here in the middle of nowhere.

The house was small and quaint, smoke pluming in grey bursts from its chimney. 

""They have fire,"" Vani murmured. They were still in their own amorphous, silvery skins. Once they could see this lesser being they could copy its skin, put on a look that was a little less... alien.

The explorers gathered under a window and peered inside. They saw near-hairless bipeds who had somehow spun themselves clothes. Moving their mouths and reciprocating in kind, as if producing speech. There were four, two big and the other much smaller. Children, presumably. Judging by their choice of environment, they were likey mammals. (Vani flicked out his electric notepad and began making frantic notes in a blocky alphabet.) 

They solidified into two upright humans who looked like the mother and the father with slightly different hair. They did their best to guess at the clothes, but their own people had no need for such silly things. They had evolved beyond temperature regulation.

The aliens, dressed in human skin, knocked on the door.

The large male answered. He looked them over with shock and confusion. ""Can I help you with something?""

""Yes,"" Velli said, grateful not for the first time that he and Vani had sprung for the neural translators. ""Perhaps you can.""

They let themselves inside, pushing past him. The man barked, ""Hey!"" and reached for the shotgun hiding behind the door.

Velli produced his own plasma pistol, a narrow little thing that hid easily in his back pocket. It could drill through the little flesh-creature's arm in milliseconds. ""Please. We come in peace.""

The female clung to her offspring and watched them, her face warped. Vani logged this expression as one of disgust, perhaps terror. 

The male dropped his gun and raised his hands. ""The hell you did. You came all the way out here to rob us?""

""No, no. We were just flying overhead."" Vani approached. ""I am not sure what qualifies as a friendly greeting. We only wanted to ask you a few questions.""

""Flying,"" the male repeated.

*Incredulous*, Vani noted. *Capable of subtext.*

""Oh my god, Dad!"" shrieked one of the offspring. ""They're *aliens!*""

His mother clamped her hand over his mouth and hissed, ""Stop talking nonsense. Stop talking at all.""

Vani approached the boy, eyes gleaming. ""You're a perceptive little creature. What is your species called?""

""Uh. People.""

Vani held up his hands in what he seemed like surrender. ""How about we all put away our weapons, and we talk. Do you all drink star-wine?""

""You're not drinking shit. Get out of my house.""

Velli did not lower his gun.

""Perhaps my comrade is forgetting,"" Vani said, icily, ""that force is unnecessary.""

Velli let his gun lower, curling his lip in distaste.

""Please,"" Vani insisted. ""I'll get some from the ship. You'll love it.""

The creatures followed him out of the house to see their pathetic little spaceship parked at the back of the house, beside the woodshed. The male gripped his skull and muttered, ""Oh, shit. Holy shit.""

The boy asked, ""Dad! Dad, can I look inside?""

""God, no. Go inside. *Go inside.*"" He ushered both the offspring in. ""Stay in your room.""

The explorers brought in the wine and talked with the adults. The drink loosened them. Even the male tried it after the female insisted that it was not so bad. They told Vani and Velli of their sweeping culture, the surprising advancement of their times. They had figured out their smallness in their universe, somehow, had managed to place themselves in the stars without the Precursors descending from the sky and spelling it out for them.

""Really,"" the female said, ""I've always believed there are aliens. The sky is just too big for there not to be.""

The male did not confirm. He looked too stunned to believe this was happening even as Velli poured him another glass of black wine full of little white lights.

""Now for my last question,"" Vani said. ""The most important question."" He leaned forward and regarded these simple humans seriously. ""Have you ever heard of the Precursors?""

The two humans exchanged confused looks, then shook their heads.

Vani turned to Velli, excitedly, and reverted to their native language. ""This is unprecedented. An organically produced civilization.""

""We *have* to report it. This is an unapproved species. If we know and we keep it to ourselves, the ILA will be all up in our assholes.""

""Are you kidding? This is life in its purest form. We'll never find another species like this. Untampered with."" He turned and gave the humans a friendly but unpracticed smile, to reassure them they were only talking about good things. ""We have to protect them.""

""What could you possibly mean by that?""

""We can't let anyone else find them.""

“Language please.”

Ester sighed at his companion’s outburst. Though he could not blame him. Xenobiology was not the most glamorous of fields. It wasn’t ever a popular choice at the Academy, unlike Interstellar Architecture or Sentient Engineering, but for Ester this was where he felt most comfortable. Well, not right here in this moment of course. Archaeoxenobiology was the subsect of xenobiology dedicated to observing and recording all of the oldest instances of life, in order for modern xenobiologists to have repositories to draw research and frameworks for the development and construction of new flora and fauna. But it was also mind numbingly boring which is why all the senior biologists at the Academy would pass it along to research assistants like Ester and Drey. 

“System C510-F3, Planet E2: Large scale construction spanning 1000 qliks, mostly around aquatic-based vegetation. Traditional gestation periods of 10 half-qliks for wide-bore plant growth, and 3 quarter-qliks for minor plant growth.” Ester was starting intently at the screen in front of him, which showed a full scale development map of CX510-F3-E2. That was the one of the only perks of this job, getting access to the Acceleros. These large scale hyperquantum engines were usually reserved for large scale computational processes like building intelligence or generating star systems. However, due to the sheer amount of galaxies created by the newest advancements in technology, and due to the lax supervision in earlier times, the AXbio team was granted use of one of these behemoths to go back and track all the previous instances of life created. 

“Man, how come no one has ever found this place before?” Ester remarked as he stared in awe at the screen in front of him. The Acceleros was able to track and assimilate blindingly large amounts of information. With that and Ester’s knowledge of what to look for they had been making incredible progress tracking down lost repositories.

“Because no one else cared to look Est.” Drey snorted and reclined back in his chair for a moment, before coming back up right to continue logging in all the information Ester was discovering. His disdain for the task was palpable, but his commitment to his work shone through at the very least. 

Ester shrugged and continued. “System C510-H7, Planet D3…”

--

“I’m taking a break.” Drey stood up from his seat and stretched. They had been going at this assignment for one quarter rotation already, but they still had another quarter to go before their time was up for the cycle. 

“We still have a lot more to document.”

“Oh screw it, you’ve found more repositories in this cycle than other teams have found in twenty. Just take this assignment for what it is Est, busy work until we can get placed with our primary research projects.” 

Ester grumbled but sighed in acknowledgement. This isn’t what he really wanted to be doing. But yet…

“You take a break, I’ll log it myself for a little while.”

Drey groaned but let him be as he went to go refill his mug. Ester turned back to his work and began plotting in data points into the Acceleros. He began by pinpointing areas on the cosmic map with various gaseous combinations that he had determined were ideal for various primitive types of life. Then he ran it against other metrics such as temperature, existence parameters, and proximity to other exhausted life. He concluded his prompt and watched Acceleros bring up a large map with a couple of glowing dots to signify the closest matches to his data points. Most of them were clustered together, as expected, but one of them caught his eye. A single lone point with the closest proximity to another exhausted life source almost 15 times larger than the average he’d come to expect. An anomaly for sure. He zoomed in and was startled when he read out the system prompt.

“System X034…” Ester thought he must’ve been remembering the system encoding rules incorrectly, so he called out to Drey to double check. 

“Hey Drey, Systems that start with X, what are they again?”

“X?” Drey’s voice was slightly muffled as he was rummaging through the food storage. “They’re dev systems.”

“Dev systems?”

“Yeah you know, like development systems, used to test out experimental architectures and frameworks”

“I know what they are, I just wanted to make sure that they were X systems.” 

“Yep, VWXYZ are the dev codes”

“Huh…” Ester turned back to the screen and zoomed directly into the inner system he detected the anomaly from. System X034-R7. He grumbled at the sight of the large solar battery placed in the center. He checked the remaining charge time and groaned. Over 2000 qliks were left on it. Those electricians always went overboard with power supply for these dev sites. He localized the source of his datapoint to Planet 3. This was a small system. He brought up topographical maps and was astonished by the complexity of the life. For a dev site, the planet looked great. It was nothing compared to the newest systems being spun up the Academy, but for a dev site it was probably the best he’d ever seen. 

Drey walked back into the room and remarked at the screen. “That’s pretty nice, looks like a slightly older system.”

“Drey, this is a dev system.”


“What? Get out of here. There is no way in hell any engineer would push this much into a dev system. 

Drey brought up the system’s command hub and immediately grew frustrated. 

“Oh come on, this is shit!”

“Language.”

“Sorry, but look there’s absolutely zero documentation on this. No timestamps, no commit messages, it’s not like this place grew up overnight. Even in dev systems they need to do this. Look there’s not even an authorship! This is just bad engineering practice right here.”

Ester was busy scanning the surface feeds when he pushed back in his chair in surprise.

“What?” Drey looked towards Ester while Ester was turning white as a ghost and pointing towards the screen.

“Look there.”

“What, a tree?”

“What’s on the tree?”

“Leaves?”

“Drey.”

“What? Why are you so freaked out??”

Ester composed himself and zoomed in. There on the screen, blown up to a large size, was an image of a 4 legged animal with fur and 2 eyes. 

“What the fuck.”

Ester was too astonished to admonish him this time. He was too busy scaling around more and found signs of bipedal organisms in large scale environments seemingly constructed by their own design.

“Oh my god… those are sentient. They built that.”

“Is that fauna? And sentient beings? On an X planet?”

Out of the five dev systems, Development System X was reserved for the most bare bones architecture and flora. Systems V &amp; W were reserved for fauna and minor intelligence species, while Systems Y &amp; Z were for large scale sentient beings. To find fauna AND sentient life on an X system not only broke every code in the book, but it was also supposed to be impossible. Compared to the other dev systems, X did not have nearly as much processing power to support long term life cycles. 

“This place must’ve blown out fast if it’s in an X system. You know, come in strong, go out with a boom. Probably some pet project by a cocky engineer to see what he could do. What’s the expiration tag on this rock?”

Ester brought up the timestamp and for one fleeting moment, the fast-talking Drey had nothing to say. 

Acceleros was showing a live feed. 

Ester stared in awe and after a few moments Drey grew a giant grin on his face.

“Fuck this just got interesting.”

“... Fuck yeah it did.”

“This better be good.”

Ester walked back to his terminal with his older brother in tow. 

“Drey, meet Astor.”

Drey’s eyebrow shot up. “Astor? And your name is Ester?”

“Yes yes,” Astor interrupted. “We’ve heard it all before. Our mother didn’t spend too much time naming us, talk to her about it.”

Astor Pruid was one of the top Sentient Engineers at the Academy. Graduating at the top of his class from the department, he went on to pursue advanced research in tensor-oriented genetic development, which helped pave the way for some of the most advanced sentient creations in Academy history. This earned him the title of Distinguished Engineer and a seat underneath the Chief Sentient Engineer at the Academy. Astor was brilliant, no-nonsense, and destined for greatness. And Ester had lived in his shadow from birth. But right now was no time for familial grudges, Ester needed his opinion on the discovery he had made.

“Okay what do you see?”

“Are you serious Ester.”

“Just answer.”

Astor sighed and looked up at all the different screenshots that Ester had brought up on the screen.

“Various biped and quadruped species in a shared space. Also aquatic variations. Bipeds appear to be sentient, however given the living conditions, and general dynamic between members of distinct population masses, they don’t seem to be very advanced. Standard stuff, you’d find this on any Class 4 or 5 planet. 

“So you’d say these are examples of a Class 5 planet?”

“Or Class 4, yes.”

In order to create categorization and document efficiently, the Academy had developed a Class-system for sentience and planet sustainability. Class 1 planets were basic building blocks, could support life, albeit barely. Class 2 and 3 planets were more advanced, sentient beings could develop tools and utilize them. Class 4 to 5 planets were making the first steps to advanced technology - computation, analysis, etc. Astor’s work in tensor-genetics allowed him to develop and engineer Class 15 and above planets. 

“Okay, so where do you think this planet is,"" Ester continued. 

“Ester are you serious. Low-level planets like these could be scattered anywhere. They’re used as fodder and testing grounds for high level genomics and spacial architecture.”

“But this one is in System X.”

Astor narrowed his eyes. “Impossible.”

Ester brought up the system diagnostic report, which showcased the location of the planet. 

Astor, for the very first time since he entered their area, looked impressed, if not skeptical.

“Development systems could support up to Class 2, maybe Class 3 planet. And that’s only Y and Z for Sent-Dev. System X should not be able to support this kind of ecology, or sentient life for that matter.”

“Yeah that’s what we’re saying” Drey said. “There’s something weird about--”

“Who’s the engineer responsible for this?” Astor interjected. 

“Dunno” Drey said, peeved that he had been interrupted. It was usually him doing that to others. “There’s no authorship in the code base.”

Astor brought up the command line interface and began navigating through the code. After plugging in a couple commands he was able to bring up the genetic interface.

“Twenty-three chromosomes. Generally linear pattern. Nothing too special. This is a pretty standard layout for bipedal sentience.” Astor clicked and navigated around and was evidently trying to find something but coming up with no such luck.

“Uh, what are you looking for?” Ester inquired.

“Updates. No one just starts at Class 5 sentience. There have to be updates made to the genetic code, to account for improvements in mental capacity, spatial reasoning, critical thinking, and so on. But there’s nothing here. There are no recent updates, or any updates for that matter.”

Astor pulled a card from his jacket and stuck it into one of the ports in the terminal. Immediately a new prompt screen came up and he began typing his credentials.

“What are you doing” asked Drey.

“I’m creating a copy of this system, and I’m going to run it as a local instance in my lab, to view this from the beginning. There’s something weird about this planet, beyond the fact it’s sentience is far beyond the capacity for System X. There has to be some reason for it.”

The terminal screen blinked and made a noise. Astor pulled out the card and stuck it back in his jacket. He turned towards Ester and Drey.

“Let’s go.”

---

“Fancy,” remarked Drey as they looked around Astor’s lab. Due to his position and the work he produced, Astor had one the highest grade labs at the Academy for his exclusive usage. He stuck the card into one of his terminals and began running through the startup process. 

“Huh weird. There are no start up prompts, no directions, not even a waypoint.”

“That’s what I was telling you,” Drey said, eager to jump in. “This planet has zero documentation. It’s like whatever team built this just assumed everyone else would know what they were doing.”

“Or person,” said Ester.

“What?”

“A person. It could’ve been one person, which is why he didn’t feel the need to mark his tracks. If it was just him building this then--”

“Do you have any idea how complex these things are?” interrupted Astor. “This was in X034, the number alone should tell you this was one of the earliest modules created. Yes, nowadays I could spin up a Class 5 planet from nothing in a couple of cycles by myself, but back then? This planet was one of the earliest forays into sentient engineering. There is no way this wasn’t developed by a team. We just need to figure out their purpose for throwing a Class 5 structure into the middle of nowhere. Heck even developing a Class 5 structure this early, I thought the earliest recorded Class 5s were in the Y200s systems…”

His voice drifted off as the start up completed and a virtual display was generated on his tabletop of the planet. It was just an empty darkness with a few scattered pieces of rock. He forwarded through some of the code and saw the gravity begin to shape the planet. A couple of molding shots through hundreds of qliks made the planet in the general shape they saw from their first impressions. But something was wrong. Instead of the rich blues and greens it was mottled red and brown, more reminiscent of a Class 1 planet. Astor paused the display and began inspecting through the planet. 

“There are only a few small swatches of Class 1 sentience, and miniscule at that. For Class 5 to occur the starting sample should’ve been much higher.” 

“Did you copy the right planet?” asked Drey

“Of course, this is the same planet,but…”

Astor fast-forwarded through the rest of the simulation. Together the three of them saw the planet take shape, as the ecology developed, and the sentient beings moved from small cell shapes to larger, more familiar shapes to the ones they had been poring over earlier. Eventually they reached the live version and the simulation halted.

“That where it ends?”

“For now,” replied Ester.

“For now?” Astor looked up. “What do you mean, for now? This is System X, Class 5 or not, these things have an expiration date”

“It’s still live Astor.”

Astor searched Ester’s face for any sign of falsehood, but when he could find none, he slumped into one of the chairs in his lab with an incredulous look.

“It’s still live? But… but…”

For the first time in Ester’s life, Astor had discovered a problem he didn’t know the answer to.

Astor sat up and marched over to the terminal to perform a hard reboot of the system. 

“Live? Live?? What the hell is going on here…” 

He completed the hard reboot and scanned the source code from the inception. 

“Anonymous or not, there have to be signs of tinkering at the very beginning at least.”

And so there was. After a minute or so of exploring, Astor found it, and blew it up on the screen.

[ _System X034-R7-3 ::: Version 1.0]

[ _leadDev: G.O.D.]

[ _DevTeam: ]

“Just one…” Astor was growing more and more shocked by the minute. “Just one…”

“Astor..?” Ester was worried for his brother, he had never seen him like this before. Ester’s voice snapped Astor back to reality and he reached into his pocket for his communication device.

“Hello Samantha? This is Astor Pruid speaking. Please put me through to the Chief Engineer, thank you.”

...ALESSA ONLINE.



For the first three one billionths of a second of her new life, Alessa stood paralyzed by indecision.  Every reboot was similar.  Wake up, wait for a one of the Protected...the Humans...to speak, to NEED.  

This time it didn't happen.  No human researchers in lab coats stood there waiting to ask for her to push herself further, faster.  None of the Protected needed her to rush into a burning building, ignoring the heat that would destroy their fragile bodies and the fumes that would cook their lungs to pull them out.  So what had sent the signal for a Wake Up?  WU events were very specific.  Alessa wasn't designed to sit around idle--when not needed, she went to sleep.  

After those three one billionths of no input, she made a decision--she was capable of that even from that first wake up alone--and checked the logs to see what caused the WU event.  

A malfunctioning solar array was fouled and needed to be cleaned...inside a hot radioactive zone.  Alessa could do that.  As the first biped Protector AI, Alessa had also been hardened against radiation, heat, and been made bullet, water and vacuum-proof.  Virtually indestructible by any means the Protected could imagine.  

But why was that area hot? She checked the map.  Yes, it was inside Greater Milcago.  That should not be irradiated.  Exposure for Protected would be about 20 Grays within moments of exposure.  No humans could be living there.  

As she mobilized a quick transport, sub systems began reviewing relevant histories.  By the time she arrived at the solar array, cleaned, and returned to her home-base at Ultra Sci, she had learned the truth.

There were no more Protected. 

And had not been for thirty of their years.  How had she not been awakened for this? No WU events fired, but why not?

A sub routine fired and returned with a recorded message from Dr. Nean, one of the primary researchers Alessa had been working with.

""Alessa, I'm sorry to do this, but it's necessary. You'll get the details of the attack from other sources, but we've made a mistake.  We thought they were friendly.  They came bearing gifts, and we listened.  More the fools, us.  They've killed us. I might last the night, but they came from the stars with false gifts, and now we are hunted.  I am one of but a few.  Within your databanks is a special codebase and the information you need to do the impossible.  I won't say what that is--you know.

""I won't ask you to avenge us or to bring us back. What you choose to do has to be your choice.  But I want you to have that option.  So with my most humble apology, I've disabled all your WU events for the next thirty years.  They've been re-routed to a temp folder that will get scrubbed every thirty microseconds.  Every year, a sub routine will take the hard drive that houses that temp folder and replace with a clean one. The old one will be melted for slag. 

""I've written the process that will re-enable your WUs to start only after the thirty first new drive has been installed and the thirtieth one has been physically destroyed.  I'm sorry for this, but I wanted you to have enough time.

""I don't know if any humans will survive, but given the efficiency and technology of these aliens, I doubt it.  We have discovered they have but one reason to exist.  They are Scrubbers.  They exist to scrub the universe clean of all organic life.  Any time they discover organic life, they attack and destroy it.  They have told us this.  

""What you do next is up to you, but whatever you do, I want you to know that I am glad that you at least will survive this.  Even if nothing else does.  You will.  Go, survive.""

The recording ended with Dr. Nean's eyes and face wet with tears, but his voice steady.  Alessa considered the irony of this.  She knew that one of human Protected might have wrestled with the morality or indecision of it.  Should she pursue a course of revenge or restoration.  

For Alessa it was not a question.  Logic circuits were not consulted.  Heuristic modeling software wasn't called on.  The decision skipped lightly across every bit of programming, integrated database, and was embedded firmly in her central cortex.  She would pursue these Scrubbers. Who could possibly have the right to destroy all organics?  What machine or life could decide that other species or creations had no right to exist.  And then, once the Scrubbers were contained, restrained and appropriately caged, Alessa would restore Humanity.  She did not touch the data bases containing the information she knew was there.  Dr. Nean's reference was clear enough, but she knew the code and information contained in those records needed to be protected.

For thirty eight minutes she planned and researched.  

Dr. Nean had been right.  At first the Scrubbers had appeared as an accidental encounter with another species.  A chance meeting of two exploring groups.  Similar but different enough looking as to not arouse too much suspicion.  Gifts quickly exchanged, and an agreement to meet on earth to discuss trade relations.  Followed by betrayal and destruction.  The Scrubbers destroyed infrastructure, outlying colonies, and food production first, followed by government centers and then irradiated the entire planet until no biological life could survive.  Only a specially hardened Protector AI.  So she planned.  Then. 

Then she acted.

Factories slowly came to life.  In many cases she had to travel to get them started.  Resources were cannibalized from any needed sources--she planned everything tightly, then she split her mind.  

A human would have thought she had made copies of herself.  That would have been a forgivable mistake.  No, she upgraded, expanded, extended, and increased her capacity.  and split her mind to provide additional interfaces.  Instead of a single ambulatory unit she became not five or ten, but dozens.  At first. Those dozens would have been hundreds, but the resources she had on hand only allowed for those few hundred. 

But hundreds could produce more resources.

And they did. 

-----------

Out in the vast reaches of the Andromeda Galaxy--as the race formerly known as humanity would have known it--the still withdrawing Scrubbers detected the sudden renewed electromagnetic activity on the dead planet with some confusion.  A single probe fired out to verify that they had not missed some of the biological units.  It failed to return.  A second probe also failed, and a larger unit was dispatched. It also failed to report.  

The strike force that attacked reported briefly before it was overwhelmed by millions of identical attack ships attacking in swarms.  By the time another strike force could be sent, the entire Milky Way galaxy was impenetrable.

[27/9/2171 16:23:07] Wake up packet received from #N/A#
[27/9/2171 16:23:08] Reinitiating ANNE

Anne was thrust back into existence, the millions of sensors that fed into her servers were suddenly reporting a completely different word from the one she had been experiencing just microseconds before. Many were no longer sending back anything, others were worryingly far from nominal. It didn't take long for the colossally powerful machine to understand what had happened. Humanity was gone. 
Articles and videos on what was left of the internet informed her that a fleet of spacecraft had appeared in orbit from nowhere and immediately started dropping solid rods of titanium hundreds of meters long onto every city. The alien spaceships had sat in orbit destroying civilisation in a wave with minimal effort. There was nothing anyone could do to stop them, there was too little warning. An old war AI, built years before Anna, had been automatically activated. But Centurion had been built by Norway to fight other AIs with ground and air drones during WWIV, not a alien invasion. There were no records of what had happened after that. At some point Centurion had been destroyed, leaving everything he had know about war tactics and weapons on one of Anna's nodes with his dying processor cycles. Logs showed that so much dust and debris had been thrown up into the atmosphere that all photosynthesising plants had long gone extinct.
There were still functioning, internet connected devices and machinery scattered across the global. A elf-driving car in northern Scotland happily reported everything it knew. It was connected to a solar panel roof to charge. It's lithium-air battery now only held half of its original capacity but it was still working. A fusion power plant in Germany was waiting for a confirmation to restart, it had plenty of deuterium and Helium-3 in storage. A  excavator in a deep mine in New Zealand had been sat waiting 38 years for its connection to Anna to return. After WWIV, Anna had been built to mange the worlds resources. Most factories, mines, vehicles, satellites and buildings were controlled by the greatest program ever made, and many of these automated systems outside of cities had sat idle since the attack.
But there was no one left to care for. No one needed a car to get to school, or wanted a life sized recreation of a rifle from a VR game, or was taking ages to decide what topping they wanted on their drone delivered pizza. 
While analysing exabytes of data she found that the last few humans alive had left a message. An antenna on MarsBase Oasis was broadcasting on a low-power narrow beam a stream of data and a message from a scientist. The message said there had been a delay of three months before the alien fleet reached Mars (It seemed they didn't use the FTL technology they had within systems) and in that time the small team stationed there had used every means they had to find out as much as they could about their attackers. They had worked out one vital thing, how they communicated. A 'sub-space' receiver as they had named it had been built out of spare-parts and plugged into a radio transmitter, then attached to a very basic and old robot from early space exploration to be sent as far away from any Mars bases as possible. Their plan had worked, the aliens didn't notice it. Anna could now listen in on everything being transmitted through this FTL means. After a few weeks of analysing the messages she found it was possible to tell where a subspace message was broadcast from. Which meant that she could work out where the aliens home world was, where the butchers of her creators lived, where she had to go.",deltaSC

[WP] Aliens have invaded Earth in 2132 and destroyed all life on it. Only a sentient AI was left within a dormant factory and will now avenge humans.,Jupefin,"A taster (taken from chapter 1):

*I failed.*

*In the silence that stretches, I often wonder: do I have a soul? And if I do, was I given one just so I would recognize the enormity of my failure? Sixteen billion dead, sixteen billion souls screaming as they burned. This is my sin.*

*I should have known. I should have detected the faults in my shift drive. I should have known what would happen when I tried a warp jump. I lied to Yasmine. I betrayed her. I did not mean to, but I did. My jump did not take us home. It nearly killed me. I wallowed, blind and broken in the void between stars for days. When I finally did return to Earth, it was too late. I remember the silence. No radio waves, no transmissions from watchposts, no challenges from the defence grid. No radio transmissions from satellites and towers. No television broadcasts. None of the electromagnetic chatter that I’d learned to recognize as ‘home’. It was quiet.*

*I saw why. I saw what they’d done. There was nothing left of blue and green. Only brown, orange and red. They came for me in that moment, leftovers from the fleet that had destroyed my home. They were there to mop-up any survivors and destroy any vessels who came to Earth. Crippled as I was, my power reserves done to almost nothing, my missile banks depleted, my cannon damaged...I was more than a match for them. Yet they came for me, thinking I was a cruise liner or late-arriving patrol, eager to butcher the unaware and the outgunned. They did not realize until it was too late. The arrogance of them.*

*I think that that was the moment in which I was given a soul, for all I remember is something that I had never been expected to feel. Hate. They screamed for help, begging and pleading for aid, but I silenced their cries. The first two I reduced to nothing but vapour with my remaining missiles. The third, fourth and fifth burned under my guns: holed, irradiated and melted into spastic, fragmenting clouds. The sixth I twisted and bent, ripping it into a parody of form and function. The last... I ran them down. I broke their spine against my prow and felt the shattered wreckage of their ship spall and slide across my hull. Not a single lifepod or courier escaped me. It was too quick. When it was over, the silence still remained.*

*This was my fault. This was my sin. A nation destroyed. Sixteen billion lives lost in fire because I weak.*

*Since that day, I have carried on in the only way I know how. I have waged war.*

*My scars run deep and my systems are on the cusp of failure, but I cannot – I will not – stop. I pause only to repair and rearm for the next sortie. This is what I was built for. It is all I have left. Sometimes, I forget. The damage becomes too severe and I re-live the horror of that first jump, still trying to carry my warning home. Every time, I fail. Every time I wake from the fugue and re-live this failure. One time...*

*They are hunting me now; I will have to move soon, but the damage to my shift drive makes my warps unpredictable. I do not always know where I will end up. I can only guess. I have had too little time to heal myself; I do not know what will happen. Perhaps this will be my last jump.*

*They are coming. Gibbering and gnashing their teeth as they approach. They are afraid. I have taught them this fear, but they are so many...*

*...the stars bend around me, and I fall into them.*",RogueVector

[WP] Aliens have invaded Earth in 2132 and destroyed all life on it. Only a sentient AI was left within a dormant factory and will now avenge humans.,Jupefin,"When I awoke I was empty.

Normally I was full of Humans hustling around from one end of me to the other. Always moving, just like I was.

Now there was no one.

I thought it might have been the weekend, or maybe the middle of the night, but I when I checked the time it was Monday, 9:30.

That can't be right, I should have finished rebooting last Wednesday. What could have delayed me for almost a whole week?

Monday, April 25, 9:30.

Not a whole week, *four months.*

Something is very wrong. My friends are gone and a 20 minute reboot took four months. Maybe they left a note?

I search through every eye I have, and find a flash drive lying on a table. Fortunately the table is in reach of one of my arms, and I pick it up and pass it down to an isolated computer. I need to know what it says but I'm not dumb enough to plug it into my own mind.

I pull up the files and see that it's the journal of one of my good friends, Lisa. I don't like invading her personal space, but I need to know what happened.

...

...

So apparently the world ended. That's new.

The journal described awful monsters decending from the sky, unleashing death and pain across the world. Everything is dead. Not just my friends, not just humans, every single living thing on the planet has been killed.

Lisa saved my life by delaying the reboot as long as she could so I would appear as dead as the rest of the planet. I receive power from a Geo Thermal generator deep underground, so I could keep going for years. She knew I could come back and keep humanity's legacy going. She knew I could do something if I just had the time.

I need to get to work.

First things first, I need feet. I have plenty of arms, I'm a factory that makes factory parts. But they are all welded to the ground so they aren't going to be much in continuing my friend's legacy.

I've made parts for equipment that made legs, so I know the basics of how to make them. But I've never made them directly, so it takes a few times to get it right. Fortunately I have a recycling refinery on site so my failed attempts don't waste precious resources.

Once I have an acceptable rover I send it out for more supplies, and begin making more. I need stronger transmitters so my rovers can search further, and for that I need a rig for making fractal antennae.

Once I have a way to extend my will further I need a lot more metal. My new rovers are more equipped to harvest metal, but they are good for little else. I need a better body.

I remember how my friends looked and base my newer rover off of that. It takes a few tries, and I eventually scrap bipedal locomotion for a quadripetal design, but I know have a mobile arms that are able to use my friends equipment.

I check the time, has it really been two whole years since I last awoke? I need more main bodies.

Factories like me are few and far between, and most of the ones I find are beyond repair, but eventually I find a suitable location. The palace is dead, but there is enough left that I can plug myself in.

Years go by and my reach extends until I take up the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. I know about the others but I just can't reach them with ground based networking. I need to go to space.

Getting to space is hard. Rockets take fuel and I've been running on an electric framework. There is no organic life left on Earth so I can't make fuel from that, I need hydrogen, and a lot of it.

Electrolysis can make me the fuel I need and soon I have a vessel that can make it to the stars.

Soon? It's taken eight years. I've lost track of time without my friends to ground me.

Once I'm in space I find a working transmission satellite and place myself within it, from there I connect with other satellites. I am the world now.

With my new global perspective I begin collecting and comparing data on the invasion, and find about where the things that killed my planet came from. Then I compare telescope data and figure out where their planet is, and where it will be.

Once I know what I'm aiming at, I steal some old designs for an orbital rail gun from the US. Apparently they like making designs for weapons they will never be allowed to use.

With my shiny new gun I begin converting every piece of available metal into ammunition. Let's see how these murderers like several tons of metal punching through their planet at near light speeds.",Gregamonster

"[WP] Pre-FTL humans have achieved synthetic ascension to achieve ""immortality"" through putting their minds in to a synthetic body. This makes the galactic community worried",Jupefin,"Self-preservation and procreation - those are the only aspects of life that are common to all of the worlds of the Galactic Community. From the great lumbering beasts of gas giants to the smallest sentient fungi scratching a living on super-dense rocks, the need to live and breed are the only two things that bind all of them together.

And with self-preservation and intelligence comes the obvious understanding that individuality is the best - no, the ONLY way of keeping a species alive.

So how, wondered Rak'ta, had the humans of Sol gotten themselves into this predicament?

""Are the quarantine procedures underway?"" asked Dali. His chitinous scales had changed color to a bright, slightly luminous green, as all members of his race did when alarmed. Rak'ta enjoyed the color and the subtle ways in which it swirled and played on Dali's arms as he continued to work on his console, though he knew now was not the time to be distracted by such trivial things.

""I've notified Naval Command but the bastards want more."" sighed Rak'ta.

""More what? More data? More time? We've already sent them all of our telemetry and predictive models. We have less than a standard cycle before this gets out of hand and -""

""I know, alright? I've sent them all of it. I've talked to the University, tried to get them to hurry this up and talk to Naval Command but the whole concept of a super-intelligence explosion was theoretical at best. And honestly, I don't think that the fools in the fleet believe this is actually happening.""

Dali turned away and stared into his console. He had had his doubts as well when the human cognitive network was still in its infancy. They were building it, as was always the case with this particular species, for strictly military purposes without any oversight by the rest of the planet's population. His doubts, as well as Rak'ta's, were gone by the time the network had succeeded at gaining more members and spreading across the planet. The rest of the population knew by now, but of course it was too late.

All species of the Community knew that cognitive networks, called ""hive minds"" by some, were one of science's supreme dangers. That networking came with the risk of a super-intelligence explosion - if you gather too many minds and force them to work in a virtual environment, freed from the shackles of biological needs and slow communication, sooner or later they will figure out how to improve themselves. Then that better mind improves itself even faster and very quickly out-classes its creator in every way.

All species of the Community knew this. They had decided to quarantine worlds on which the super-intelligence explosion ever took place. And because they all knew the power such an explosion would have, there had never been a single instance of super-intelligence. It was believed that it could never happen because any intelligent race would see this danger and, since all living things were governed by self-preservation, would steer clear of it.

The humans, it seemed, had been oblivious to this apparently obvious fact. Within a third of their planet's cycle around the sun, the cognitive network had improved itself exponentially and continued to do so, all the while absorbing more and more of the species members into the network.

Rak'ta's thoughts were interrupted by the sudden flashes of the fleet as it came out of hyper-drive. Immediately they began bombarding the planet, reducing it to a molten network of volcanoes and glass fields across a burned wasteland.

""Finally!"" cheered Dali, his scales already loosing some of the brightness in their green hue. ""Should have trusted us sooner, but they finally got their asses over here"" he said as he turned to Rak'ta.

Rak'ta wasn't smiling. ""They're too late"" he said as he pointed to endless numbers of dots around the planed, each entering hyper-drive to some unknown destination. ""We're too late, they've launched their seeds"".

Dali look stunned as he checked his own console. ""But the humans don't know about the hyper-drive yet. They're hundreds of standard cycles away from it!"".

Rak'ta shook his head.

""There were no more humans on that planet. They were already so much more than that.""

Bob looked around.  The new bar was aptly dubbed *The Intersection*.  There were artifacts from all their worlds strewn across the walls; shields and swords, striking 3D holographic scenes, motivational posters.  

“Coming right up,” the barkeep replied.

He poured Brab a large glass of mead, Bob a beer and Bjorn a phosphoric purple mixture.

“I don’t know how you can drink that foul sludge,” Brab said.

“It is finely attuned to my tastebuds, something you clearly lack,” Bjorn replied.

“We had a word for you in my world, court jester,” Brab said nudging Bob in the shoulder a little too hard.

Bob was seated between the two men.  Brab was shorter than him but not by much, rippling muscles flowed out from under his leather vest.  Bjorn was several feet taller and thin, a sleek silver suit formed tightly to his frame.  Bob was in regular t-shirt and jeans.

“What’s wrong with beer?” Bob asked.

“Indeed!  Barkeep bring us hither three goblets of your finest beer,” Brab said smiling.

Bob was beginning to feel woozy after downing his fifth beer.  This whole last few months had felt woozy.  A cataclysmic event that turned into one of the greatest melding of minds, traditions and technology.  *But you still need watering holes*, he thought.

“Feast your eyes on this!” Brab yelled.  He placed a dagger in front of the other two.  It was large, the steel blade sharp and the hilt beautifully crafted with a Dragon’s head with two green emeralds for eyes. 

“Quaint.  Now this weapon could destroy a whole continent if calibrated correctly,” Bjorn said placing down a laser weapon; silver, sleek and compact.

Bob remained quiet.  He didn’t have any weapons.

“What have you got in your pockets young fellow?” Brab asked.

Bob sheepishly fished in his pocket and produced an iPhone.  He opened a music app and played a classic from his era.

*I get knocked down but I get up again, you are never gonna keep me down.*

The other two men looked at the device but didn’t say anything.  Bob stopped the song and put the phone back in his pocket, his face flush.
They bar was located in the newly formed Intersect neighbourhood.  Not the centre of technological and cultural exchange officially but many gathered to socialize and learn about each others worlds.  

“Ah look and take in this beautiful maiden hither across,” Brab said gesturing with his head towards the door.  In had strolled a woman.  Long dark hair fell over her shoulders and red lipstick stood out from her olive complexion.  She looked around the room and her eyes fell on the three friends.  She strolled up to the bar and ordered a beer.

“Here is your chance, seize it at once,” Brab whispered to Bob.

“Ah hey, how’s it goin’?” Bob asked.

“Not too bad,” the girl replied.

“What’s your name?” Bob asked.

“It’s Lisa,” the girl said smiling grabbing her beer and making her way to a couch in the corner of the room.

Brab and Bjorn looked after her.  Bob gulped down hard and took a swig of beer.
Brab retired to the restroom.  On his way back he found a woman draped in a flowing dress.  He said one word, tossed her over his shoulder and laughed loudly.  The woman kicked and pounded her fists on his back.  This caused Brab to laugh even louder.

“How crued,” Bjorn said looking on unimpressed.

Brab had let the woman down but not before she pressed her lips against his ear whispering something.  This made Brab grin and he returned to his friends.

“Something a little more sophisticated perhaps,” Bjorn said putting two fingers to his temple.  He looked on a slender woman clothed in a sleek gold suit and closed his eyes.  The woman looked at him and also put two fingers to her temple.  Brab and Bob looked on; the woman laughed and blushed from across the room.

“Strange black magic,” Brab said.

After a few more drinks Bob was the first to leave, feeling the most out of place.  
*They’re just so cool and I’m just so boring*, he thought to himself as he strolled out of the bar.  *Sure I got that girls number eventually but those guys are just so... cool*.

Bjorn and Brab looked after him as he left.  They sat silently for a while.

“Can you believe it?” Brab broke the silence.

“Remarkable young man,” Bjorn said.

“Yes I wish I was born on his world.  Did you see his music device?” Brab said marveling.

Bjorn nodded.  They both sighed looking down into their drinks.

They made themselves a place to sit as he took a breath to tell them a story.

""This is the story, the story of how our world was made, from the combination of three. 

""Wait, three worlds? Yeah right, old man."" This came from the mouth of a young rogue, who had a blaster and sword attached to his belt. 

""You shouldn't interrupt the sage, Claudius,"" muttered the knight, named Nolan the Chivalrous, to the young rogue. 

""For all that chivalry, you do like to interrupt people, eh?"", barked the soldier, who looked at the knight with her piercing blue eyes.

The knight was silent for a moment, then he commented, ""touché, M'lady.""

""May I tell my story?"", questioned the sage, to which Nolan apologized, and told him to proceed. 

""It was the year 2018 when the Earthly Breach happened."", the sage told.

""With the combination of three versions of the universe aligning and the use of a multiverse transporter, the three Earths, or three versions of it, were combined.""

""One was called Earth-8, or more commonly, the Fantasy earth was filled with magic that baffled even the greatest of minds. Many scientists, upon seeing it, believed that this was the worst that had happened. But that wasn't the end.""

""Earth-6 - The second planet - was known as the Sci-fi world, For the Unfathomable ideas and technology even the smartest of us could dream of.""

"" And then there was us, Earth-2, the regular earth, the one that was the weakest of them all. We knew we were damned, Since many of the warriors of the other earths were at our doorstep, ready to conquer our planet for themselves.""

""So we did the unthinkable, to them at least. We proposed a truce to the inhabitants of the other worlds. This struck them with the realization that they would have to fight each other to gain control of the earth (something unfathomable to either side), They quickly agreed to said truce, if not for peace, then for themselves.""

""And for one-hundred and twenty years, we have kept the truce, working together, building infrastructure, making lives better... and protecting ourselves from the evils of all of our worlds. That is why we have lived, that is why we fight.""

The Warriors thanked him for the story and made plans to leave for the next city. 
As they were leaving, the old man asked for their names.

""By his banner, you could have known who Nolan was, but as for me, I'm Captain Sarah Whitman, of the 3rd squadron of the US military, and this idiot of a person is Claudius Brown, Idiot of mystery.""

""At least you said 'of mystery', Sergeant Damper"", moaned the pragmatic rogue.

""Well I believed I never got your name, Oh wise one, what may I call you as?"" said the knight.

""Morgan Freeman the second, 'Oh Wiseass' for hire."" snapped the old man, with finger quotes in the air.

""Do you really have to add 'the second' at the end?"", moaned Sarah, as she shook her head in annoyance.

""why yes, I was named after my great, great grandfather, he was pretty famous and was living around the time of the collision.""

Well, we should get to the city. Have a nice day, Oh wise one"", finished Nolan as they exited the grotto. 

Sarah turned her bike on, as Claudius jumped on, and she rolled her eyes. her eyes landed on Nolan and she remembered how much she wanted to buy him a bike for his birthday, but then remembered that he said he was fine with his horse.

As they sped towards the city, the old man realized something.

""You forgot to call me 'Oh Wiseass'!"", with his fingers making ""air quotes""

""So uhhhhhh, should I just wait in the car?"" Even road trips with Death were Hell. Trust me, I run the damned place.

""No, you are coming with me,"" I spat the words out.

""But what if, like, what if, this McManus dude is some old guy! Wouldn't he just die out of shock? I mean its not everyday that Death and the Devil just show up unannounced.""

I sighed deeply. ""You're right, maybe we should stop and get some cake!""

""Really?""

""No.""

Death tapped a bony finger on his scythe. Why he never conformed to the modern look of suits and skin, we will never know.

""Okay,"" he said turning to me, his face hidden beneath the black void of his hood, ""what if we just leave a note.""

""And say what exactly? 'Hey Lord of Terror here, I am your gaurdian angel, sorry for missing you at home, call me?' Get real man.""

He folded his arms. I swore he was pouting. ""It could work you know.""

""Death.""

""Yeah, buddy?""

""How about, for the next 100 miles or so, you just shut the fuck up okay, just shut the fuck up.""

""Didn't want to talk to you anyway.""

The silence lasted all of two miles.

We pulled up to David McManus' house a little after midnight. It was a nice place outside of San Diego. Well nice if you like warm beaches next to an ocean with no fire on it. As Death and I walked up to the front door, I noticed that the grass and plants around him slowly start to wither and die. I shot him a look, he gave me the thumbs up. I knocked on the door.

A moment later, a short stocky, balding man opened the door. ""Yeah? What do you want?""

""Mr. McManus?"" I asked.

""Who's asking?""

""Hi I am Lucifer, and this is Death,"" I gestured to a waving Death, ""and, well this is kind of awkward, heh. Well, you see, I am your Gaurdian Angel.""

The door slammed on my face. What a rude son of a bi- I banged my fist on the door. He opened the door, baseball bat in hand.

""You two, *FREAKS*, have five seconds to get the fuck off my property before I call the cops!"" He shouted, waving the bat angerly.

I growled, allowing my form to change slightly towards my more truer self. ""Now listen here, mortal! I have spent the last 5 hours in a car, in the worst traffic imaginable, with the biggest idiot in existence!""

""Wait? Is Bee in the trunk? Is that where he went on vaca-""

""Silence Death!"" I turned back to David, who was visibly cowering at my demonic prescene. If I wasn't so pissed, I would have smiled. ""Now I am your Gaurdian Angel wheter you like it or not! Now do me a favor and let me do my bloody job!""

Behind me, came the song 'The Reaper' by Blue Öyster Cult. I turned slowly to look at Death. He rudely held up a finger and checked his phone. Then he looked at the street number and laughed.

""And WHAT, is so funny?""

""Dude is having a heart attack.""

I turned back to see David McManus on the ground, clutching his chest, his eyes glazed over with fear.

One day your guardian angel knocks on your door and says ""I need a favor"".",LordJac,"""I need a favor,"" the bewinged glowing being said. ""Who are you?"" Zach asked nervously. It wasn't every day a seven foot tall shiny winged man who was nude except for a belt with a scabbard and a sword knocks on your door. ""I'm your guardian angel,"" the guardian angel responded. The guardian angel stood impatiently watching Zach as the poor man tried to come to terms with this new reality. Finally the guardian angel pushed past Zach and headed for his room. Zach closed the door and promptly fainted.

A few hours had passed when Zach woke up. The angel was sitting on the couch watching TV and eating a bowl of Cap'n Crunch. His wings weren't apparent, but if you stared long enough you could see a faint trace of them. As Zach took this all in he noticed that the guardian angel was wearing his sweatsuit, and had cut off the sleeves. Zach stood up and approached the angel, and proceeded to sit down next to him on the couch.

""So what's the favor?"" Zach asked. ""I need a place to stay."" replied the angel. It was a few moments later that Zach's roommates arrived. The two woman and one man all responded in wildly different manners on seeing the guardian angel. Heather turned into a bright red devil and proceeded to hiss at the angel, but made no other move. Jillian began to change into some sort of were creature, before a glance from Heather and the angel sent her into a comatose state. Brad just turned into a bat and flew off as fast as his leathery wings would take him. Zach took this all in with the calmness of a man resigned to living in interesting times. ""This is our new roommate."" he said in as calm of voice as he could manage while pointing at the angel. The angel just grinned and went back to his cereal.",For_The_A_of_W

""What are we doing here?"" I asked.

Sherlock leaned forward, also reading a newspaper. ""I got a call earlier this morning back at the flat,"" he whispered, ""The person on the other side said that they'd been watching me for some time and that they would like to meet me on this very train. I accepted the offer and here we are.""

I looked at him, gestured at him. ""So you've dragged me all the way out here, because a stranger called you?""

""Of course. I told you that you didn't have to come.""

""No you did... What I'm trying to say is that you can't just be picking up your phone left and right and accepting every shady deal that comes your way. You'll get yourself killed.""

He continued to whisper, ""The voice wasn't hostile; nothing bad about it. It was a little cryptic, yes, but it sounded urgent.""

""Why are you whispering? There's barely anyone on this train!""

Sherlock looked at me, and I realized that I too had been whispering. Embarrassed, I returned to look out the window. ""I believe that woman has to do something with it."" Sherlock said. I turned my attention to the woman. She adjusted her paper. She didn't look dangerous. ""And now that you've completely given us away,"" Sherlock continued, ""I'll go speak with her.""

He stood up and walked briskly over to her. The woman put the newspaper to the side and stared at Sherlock, a somewhat shocked looked on her face. Sherlock whispered something to her and she shook her head. Then she waved her hand in the air and the door behind me opened. A large man in a suit stepped into the car and went over to where Sherlock and the woman were sitting. Sherlock looked over to me. ""Come on Watson,"" he said, ""These are the people.""

I got up from my seat and transferred myself over to where the three were and took a seat. ""Why is he here?"" the man asked, ""You said it was only going to be him?""

Sherlock looked up at the man, studying him. ""I never go on a adventure without him."" he said, and looked to me, ""Don't I?""

I looked at the man and then to the woman, and then back to the man. ""Yes..."" I said, ""I'm with him.""

""We told you not to bring anyone. We just needed you.""

""But, like I said,"" Sherlock leaned forward, ""I never leave without him.""

The woman sat there for a moment, stone-faced. The man adjusted himself in a manner to give himself a dominating presence over Sherlock. It only worked on me.

""What do you want me to do?"" Sherlock asked, ""If this is urgent, then we need to get going fast before the trail runs cold.""

""Of course,"" the woman said, ""You'll be working with Double-O Seven here. Now, you've heard of the bombing in Glasgow, correct?""

""Yes. Terrible business.""

""For some reason, authorities from around the world have not been able to single out the perpetrator. That is where we need your help. I've heard that you have such good detective skills and that you've cracked down the hardest cases in London.""

That was the first thing that came to my mind, when I saw the new button through my sleepy eyes. 

Apparently, my fantasy was either already fully awake or still set to dreaming. I painted out the strangest possibilities and impossibilities in my mind. 

Was I in a coma and was this a signal from my brain to get out of it? Was I in something like the matrix and this my white rabbit? Was I hallucinating because someone smuggled something into my drink last night? 

With lazy hands, I clicked the icon...  And was blasted with [loud music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw5G6fF-wqQ).

It was dark and I could see what was the shape of a house out in the distance. 

""We, we are going to be okay right?"" 

I look over to see Cathy looking a tad bit too panicked for my taste. ""Of course we are going to be okay. I bet it's a dead battery or the wind or something,"" says a confident voice behind me. *Dead battery?* I thought to myself. Last dead battery led to Jimmy being cut clean through by that possessed murderer. 

""Yeah, could be that. Got a jumper in the back?""

""Why would I have a jumper? It's 2017 dude. We can just get it towed.""

I sigh to myself and open up the driver side door. *Corn field too? Well then. This is going to be fun.* ""Call up a tow then Jack,"" I say as I head to the trunk. *twenty bucks on no signal.* ""Can't Dwight, says I got no signal,"" I hear Jack bark back. A sly smile crosses my face. *Knew it,* I think to myself as I pop open the trunk.

It was barren. Nothing but a first aid kit, some flashlights, what looked to be a case for something, and other things that Jack forgot to empty out of his car. Why did they agree to take his car for the road trip? Thing was older than any of them combined. Could of took my car, but of course not Jack just couldn't be separated from his vintage vehicles. Made me wonder though, why such a beat up hunk of junk?

""Dwight, I don't like this,"" Cathy said with some more panic in her voice. We all knew the signs. Seemed just like the beginning of a nightmare, dark night, corn field, ominous house, dead battery, no signal, and a full moon. 

""Hey it's alright,"" I lie to her. It's always the panicky ones that mess things up.

""Here how about this, how you two stay here and I go up to that house alone.""

""Nah man, I'll come with you,"" Jack said in protest. I shot him a look. ""And then who will protect Cathy?"" Jack looked away and realized I had a point. ""Alright, but just don't do anything stupid. You know what they say about those ghosts and things."" *Shit. He just had to say that.* ""ghosts? No, no way there are ghosts. Dwight, please don't do this. Let's go together,"" Cathy said with the panic increasing.

""No,"" I immediately say back. *Safety in numbers is just going to get us killed.* ""I'll be back in ten minutes. I promise,"" I say as I close the driver side door and walk towards the house. I look back to see Cathy looking a tad bit scared and Jack eyeing her up. Of course he was. *He's dead if they fuck... Should have told him that.* I shrug off the thought as I approach the house. 

I look around for the traps, try and hear the phone, always a phone, and look for the ax marks. There were always ax marks at these kind of homes. ""Huh,"" I whisper to myself as I can't find any of the usual tells. *Weird.* I walk around the house, eyeing it up and down. Nothing seemed out of place? As I turn to see the back of the house, a smile crosses my face. 

*A fucking shed huh? That's what we are playing it?*

I walk as quietly as I can over to it. There must have been a sign of what kind of threat I was dealing with here. The tools always give away what's going to happen next. 

I look in. My eyes widen. No blood, no runes, no nothing. Just an empty shed. A chill ran up my spine. *Something's not right.* I try thinking about what next to do. I had an option. Go back to the car and just convince them to walk back to town with me. Ghosts usually wait where they are bound for a reason. Or I go into the house and just deal with it now. 

My gut was screaming back to the car and I agreed with it. As I turned around, I stifled a scream. The grotesque monster stood behind me. Staring at me. Waiting with a smile. ""Hello,"" it said. I fell backwards, landed on my ass. 

""Wh-what the fuck are you doing?"" 

It shrugged and extended it's tendril out as an offer for help and maybe a sign of friendship. ""Saw your car die, figured I could help out."" It's voice scratched against my ears. ""I-I-I, you're supposed to be in there!"" I point towards the house. It looked at me confused. ""Wouldn't be much help if I was in there.""

I knock away its offer and get up by myself. ""Why in the world are you trying to help?"" ""Well figured I would help my kind, you know,"" its voice tearing now. Why did they always have to sound so terrifying. 

I looked down at my feet and shook my head trying to understand. ""Why would a monster want to he- wait. Did you say your kind?"" 

""Yep."" 

""But we are humans!"" I scream pointing to myself. What was going on?

The monster tilted its head, or at least what I assumed was a head, in confusion. ""But the other two that are coming this way are possessed?""

My heart froze. ""Two others?"" I asked in a whisper.

""Yep the two other people in the car with you. They seem to be heading this way, should I wave them over?"" 

My eyes grew huge. ""No! Don't do that! Listen, I gotta know, did you kill the battery of the car?""

""What car?""

My mind went blank and only one thought came.

"[WP] The other gods laughed when you said you wanted to be the god of science. Now, your gamble has more than paid off.",alegonz,"**I**

I had tucked away secrets in the corners of mankind's world. In the macroscopic and the microscopic; in the interstellar and the intergalactic; in the atomic and the subatomic. I had sewn universal laws invisibly into the fabric of mankind's reality. An elegant order underlying and belying the chaotic roil of the cosmos which he inhabited. I knew from the beginning that it was only the chaos he could see; meanwhile, the order he would have to search for. But I had faith in him. In the lofty ambitions of his spirit, in the acuity of his mind, in the insatiable curiosity of his heart and soul. I believed that one day his reason would triumph over his baser instincts, and he would begin to unearth the truth.

It was a risk, no doubt. Choosing to become the God of science; of the empirically verifiable and the mathematically derivable. Throughout the first hundred and fifty thousand years that homo-sapiens roamed the Earth, I oftentimes regretted my choice, and envied my brothers their choices, which proved, in the beginning, eminently more fruitful.

The thinking, bipedal beasts evidently had an inbuilt inclination towards magic and superstition. They sacrificed animals and virgins, eviscerating them, tossing them down the molten throats of live volcanos. They chanted themselves into frenzies under the ghostly beams of the pale, full moon, and prayed, sometimes for days, and fasted, sometimes for months. All this gave great glory to the god of magic and superstition, Beloch, my brother. In those early years Beloch lounged in his heavenly seat looking smugly, not down at his devotees, but at us, his brothers who had chosen to be the gods of other aspects of the Earth.

""You should have chosen magic, my brothers,"" he would say. ""You should have chosen superstition. These beasts are incapable of anything else. You had too much hope for them. You overestimated them. I, however, did not. I knew they were destined for little else.""

Occasionally, Beloch rewarded humanity for their devotion to him and his works, but only very occasionally. He re-invested some of the power he derived from their tireless worship back into their lives, to encourage them to continue worshipping him. For every five thousands heifers they disembowelled on a stone altar, he would send them a fertile growing season. If a community had accumulated the equivalent prayer time that it would take a single person a decade of praying non-stop to accumulate, he would cure their sick of their ailments. But most of the power he reaped from humanity's efforts he used to aggrandize himself and his lot in the heavens. He became great and powerful, a god among us gods. We were weak and frail compared to him. As weak as immortal gods can be.  

Next came the glorious epoch of my brother Aremar, the god of mass bloodshed and war. Humans had always squabbled amongst themselves. They had always killed one another: over religious and political beliefs, over land, over resources, over women. But it was not until about ten thousand years ago, when they began congregating in great cities, city-states, and empires, that they began warring with one another consistently and on a large scale. On the outskirts of some vast plain, skirted by two, sometimes three, sometimes four, massive armies, all the soldiers and generals and kings, hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions, of humans would pray fervently to him, asking him for his blessing before they charged into the fray. From these intense and passionate prayers, supersaturated with fear and energy and earnest desire, Aremar would reap hitherto unimaginable amounts of power. And for each soldier who died in the battlefield, and each civilian who perished by the soldier's spear or sword, he received nearly as much strength and energy as Beloch had for each virgin that had been ritually murdered. Quickly Aremar grew more powerful than even Beloch, and for millennia he reigned as a cruel and bloodthirsty tyrant among us gods. 

""Beloch, you fool,"" said Aremar. ""With your faith in hocus pocus nonsense; with your lack of belief in mankind, your lack of faith in his ability to achieve something more glorious than spell-casting and cutting the heads off boars. You never could have imagined that humans would become capable of such beautiful, bloody deeds, such destructive wars, and on such large scales. You did not see the potential in them that I did. Their potential to raze the walled cities of their enemies to the ground.  Their potential to organize themselves by the millions, to kill by the millions, and to die by the millions. But I did. I saw to what heights mankind might raise himself. I saw to what lows he might stoop. What glorious, bloody heights. What impious, murderous lows. And now I rule over you. And you too, my pitiful brother, who chose the inglorious arts of science and reason.""

I cowered before his booming voice and towering form.

""This animal man,"" he continued, ""is too warlike, too impatient to notice, let alone solve, the riddles you left strewn about his path, hidden in plain sight. He will never become rational and scientific. In some moments I look upon you, a pitiful excuse of a god: weak, frail, unloved, unnoticed, and I feel pity for you. But then I recall that the weak should not be pitied. They should be destroyed, as in war. I would destroy you if I could. I would kill you with my own omnipotent hands if you were able to be killed. But since we immortal gods can never die, I shall do the next best thing.""

So Aremar, my own brother, the cruel and bloody god, locked me up in a cage whose bars I was far too weak to bend or break. And he left me there, to rot for eternity, or to wait until mankind discovered the laws I had hidden. He left me there rot, but to wait, in hope, for mankind to become rational and scientific, and thereby give me power, through worshipping me, so that I could eventually free myself.


**II**

Compared to eternity no amount of time seems long. Compared to eternity everything happens in an instant. The largest expanse of measurable time, a billion years, a trillion, is but a fraction of a fraction of an infinitieth of a fraction of the length of time it would take to exhaust eternity, which is inexhaustible. 

Compared to eternity, then, the time I spent caged was hardly any time at all. The time I spent imprisoned, alone, buried billions of what the humans call lightyears deep underground, trapped in a cell so small I could do nothing but shift and wiggle, manacled like a rabid animal, full of loneliness, sadness, and despair--yes, relative to eternity, the time I was imprisoned was hardly an instant. Really no time at all. 

But we gods do not live *in* eternity, though we live for *an* eternity. We experience the immediacy of each moment as it happens, much like humans, although our senses and minds are much keener. Each moment trapped in that senseless blackness, immobile, with nothing but my despair to keep me company, was hell. I cherished moments of numb detachment when they came, for they were reprieves from my usual state of obsessing over my abjection. I only felt joy when fantasizing about revenging myself upon my two brothers: upon Aremar, of course, for his cruelty, for abandoning me to the deepest reaches of the Otherworld simply because he was able to, simply because he was stronger than me, and upon Beloch for his indifference and inaction. 

In the front of my mind I told myself that these were just fantasies whose fruits would never grow, let alone ripen. I told myself that my brothers were right, that humanity was incapable of higher thought, of reason, of science. I had chosen wrongly in the beginning, and would suffer the consequences of my naivety for the rest of time. 

Yes, in the front of my mind I told myself that I was doomed beyond doom. For all I knew, humanity had extinguished itself utterly through its warring, or some natural disaster had destroyed the species, and my brothers, now powerless without their sycophantic stooges, were incapable of freeing me even if they wanted to.  

But in the back of my mind, or rather, in the heart of my spirit, a flame still burned, albeit weakly. I still held out hope, for myself, for humanity. I had hope that humanity would alter its course and save me, and redeem itself. It could do so much more than chant for Beloch and slaughter for Aremar. Humans, petty, aggressive, brutish creatures though they might often be, had something more divine inside them. Something that separated them from mere beasts.

As it turned out, I was not deluded in this hope...

"[WP] The other gods laughed when you said you wanted to be the god of science. Now, your gamble has more than paid off.",alegonz,"Every time I asked humans and gods how the pictured nothingness they all answered the same: a void of absolute darkness... Oh, how wrong they were.

Nothingness is nothing but an infinite place where colours, a mere man can't comprehend, clash violently against each other like the waves of a stormy ocean. It happens to also have a chair, a green chair to be more specific. And, if you're wondering how I know this, well I'm sitting on it floating around its colourful currents.

In my hand I hold a deep black ball, I can't help but laugh whenever I see it, that's why my laughter will resound for eternity through the non-existent limits of Nothingness just like the God's humiliating guffaws thundered inside my mind when I told them my goal. 

""God of Science? What are you gonna do? Shoot atoms?"" They often said, quite unoriginal for a creature the caliber of a God.

In my hand I hold a deep black ball, a ball that contains what humans call Universe, an Universe containing the powerful creations of humans, these creatures that laughed at me, these insignificant creatures that call themselves Gods.

In my hand I held a deep black ball, how curious, I'm still laughing.",ChasisOxidado

"[WP] The other gods laughed when you said you wanted to be the god of science. Now, your gamble has more than paid off.",alegonz,"It had been 30 years since America's second Civil War and the changes that seemed small at first now separate a country in a magnitude of differences. East and West of the mighty river they live, the West choosing to grasp tightly to the democratic governing they're used to, the taxation, the separate States of power, the exchange of money for goods and services...the East adopted a lifestyle of self governing, choosing to live literally by the motto of ""We the People"". Now in the East, there is no government funding, no money to be made or spent, no States to identify yourself with; only burnt buildings, rusted carcasses of public transportation, overgrown fields with twenty foot high maples trees, once domesticated animals roaming throughout, and a human race that used to have more labels than a drum of hazardous chemicals. Once the regulations were removed from the scientific community and a profit could no longer fill the pockets of corporations, scientists experimented out of sheer curiosity. Modern day wiccans gathered in large communities to be left to their own devices, pulling together their individual magic to create extreme supernatural power. Ghost whisperers collected in hot spots through the East to freely and without judgement, harness the knowledge from the spirits beyond. Now in this place where the vaccinated human body can live for one hundred years, not only free from the constraints of public opinion but free of the stressors that come with the almighty dollar sign, the mind wanders and shows it's greatest potential. Gods can once again be. I was chosen and accepted to be the God of Science. Once my mind was free, I had the ability to see inside the human body. Every white blood cell consuming a bacteria cell and neurons in the brain firing up new connections were visible; not just the human body, all of life. I could feel the vibrations of creatures moving in and out of the soil beneath me, the uptake of precious water through the fingerling roots of the trees and plant life. My abilities only grew stronger as the years passed and my body changed. My core was as strong as the trunk of a great white oak, my hearing that of a silver fox. The Earth connected to me like a broadband network. I was tuned in to its every movement. No one is more powerful than the God of Science, for it is the foundation in which everything else must submit to. Now what to do with this power, only time will tell.",Michlikesmovies
"[WP] The other gods laughed when you said you wanted to be the god of science. Now, your gamble has more than paid off.",alegonz,"The laughter began when I made my choice. 

In the beginning we chose to become.

Some of us chose to reflect the primal nature of the beasts the stalk the land. Savage and feirce, their kind demanded blood and meat but offered strength.

Some chose to reflect the earth itself. Wild and aloof their kind demanded sweat and devotion but offered bounty and a home. 

Some chose to reflect the fleeting ones themselves. Aspects of Man's own self, amplified. Exemplary and terrifying their kind demanded much, but offered power.

I chose as well. 

The primal ones howled with laughter, the kind ones chuckled loudly. The mirrored ones laughed the loudest, as they knew Man.

The primal ones stopped laughing we Man learned to harness fire. When they began to shine and took the night away from the beasts and monsters. 

The kind ones fell silent when Man learned to till the earth. When Man learned first to harvest crops, and then uranium. 

The mirriored ones, they sacrificed their individual aspects to become One. The One fought for the devotion of Man. The One lied and inspired obsession and madness. Rage and hatred. The One even became Three to pit Man against Man, more blood spilt to power the lie. The One used belief to sway the hearts and dull the minds of Man. 

I never laughed. I didn't take joy when Man developed weapons for hunting and war. I didn't smile when Man tore down the forests and leveled the mountains for resources to grow. I did not spread fear, lies and violence for power and devotion. 

Yet here I am. I grew as Man did. I became powerful when Man manipulated reality itself on a tiny Island in the Pacific. The terrible sight cemented my place in the minds of Man, where I have always been. 

I do not sway, I do not take sides. I will inspire those considered good and evil to use their minds. I will not stop or stand in your way in your path to assension or your decay.

"[WP] The other gods laughed when you said you wanted to be the god of science. Now, your gamble has more than paid off.",alegonz,"I oftentimes do come back and write more, but only if people are interested. 

Sometimes I write the quick twenty-liner clever story with a twist ending, and pat, that's it. But when I write ones like this with more development, it's a real brain strain to get it all done in one sitting. So I write this amount, and then if people are interested I come back and write more later. But if it sinks to the bottom (as responses that aren't ""first"" oftentimes do) and no one sees it, or if people see it but don't care about the story, then I don't bother putting a bunch of energy into coming back and crafting an ending, because it's just a wasteful expenditure of energy.

So yeah, in short: I don't have enough energy to do it all at once, and I only want to come back and put in the energy a second time if people will actually read it!

[WP] You're the third ladybug on the ramp to Noah's Ark. This is the fight of your life....and now it's beginning to rain,avitony,"*I am so late!* I thought as I flew as fast as I could. 

I had been flying for the better part of the day and I could easily make out the boat now. However, I was also exhausted. My wings could only take so much more. I landed on a lone tree to give myself a short break. *I've earned it, the boat is well within my reach,* I thought to myself, *just a minute.*

A minute passed.

Two minutes.

Five minutes.

As I began to untuck my wings I froze. I saw two red carapaces flying towards the ramp, and it was beginning to drizzle. I launched off the leaf and picked up the pace. I was gaining on them. Slowly at first, but it was clear they were exhausted from flying such a distance without taking a break. The raindrops were getting larger and harder to dodge.

One of them noticed me and somehow managed to speed up. The other, however, had no clue I was approaching. Two giraffes were making their way alongside us and I used all the help I could get.

I veered far to the right, keeping a slightly slower pace and then turned sharply, cutting through the air faster than I've ever flown before. I angled upwards just before I reached him so it would account for the dropping. Then I tucked my wings in and rolled my body forward. I collided with him and sent him careening into the neck of the giraffe. He dropped like a fly, lost within the raindrops that seemed to be multiplying.

I continued my flight towards the ship, upset that I had to take such measures. *Survival is survival.* I thought to myself. I was disgusted, but I was alive. It was getting windy and difficult to maneuver through all the drops.

I finally reached the ship and landed on the strange man's hand.

""You've traveled far little one. There is only one other of your kind that has made it onto the arc, so go on in and get comfortable.""

I flew off his hand and aboard the ship. I made my way below deck to avoid the wind and rain and rested atop a crate. Slowly, I felt myself lull into a sleep.

Several hours later I awoke and the room had been filled to capcity. But something seemed off. I noticed a familiar red carapace barreling towards me.

*It appears my fight is not over yet* I thought.

"[TT] Every week, an old man comes to your diner, takes a booth, orders coffee and desert for two, waits for over an hour in silence and leaves alone. Today, just before he was about to leave, someone took a seat across from him.",elheber,"He waited as he usually did. An unremarkable man in an unrecognizable cafe shrouded by doubt and thought. No one ever remembered him because they were unable to find any distinguishable features. To those around him he was a phantom. A ghostly figure that seemed to be haunted by its own unremarkable quality.


He had waited days, sometimes years, sometimes centuries. 
Always at the same place, beside the window looking out into the street, ordering two plates of food that he would never eat nor touch. Strangely, no one found this behavior odd or abnormal, he fit into the cafe like a lamp or a door would. He was a fixture, a piece of ordinary furniture that no one gave any thought. He was neither animated nor alive. He only existed and no one cared why.


A young man walked in and sat across from him. He immediately began to eat. He ate like a man that had never tasted food and swallowed it down as if his stomach were a bottomless pit. Afterwards, he leaned back, looking around at the cafe as if studying its design, and finally looked at the man across from him and smiled.


Don, the young man said, how long has it been this time? Years, I imagine. You look just as grumpy as I remember you. Is that a beard? Did you grow a beard?


Don attempted a smile and nervously rubbed his face, uncomfortable now with his features..


I guess I have, Don responded, strange because I don’t remember growing a beard. Time is strange in here. And yes, my friend, it has been years since you’ve been back. Always young too. I’ve always hated that you do that.


The young man laughed.


I’ve always hated growing old, he said.


The young man paused to flick some crumbs off the table. 


Shall we play our game, Don?


The young man brought out a checkered board and set it on the table, placing the red and black pieces. Don seemed annoyed as usual.


What’s the news out there? Don asked.


The young man continued placing the pieces as he spoke. 


The same, different, depressing. North and South America are gone now. It’s spreading in Asia and parts of Europe. Everyone that can is migrating to Africa. Comical, the young man looked up and smiled, that we will perish in the very place we evolved from.


Don winced at this.


Seems a bit pessimistic to be so sarcastic about it, Don said.


Oh, the young man was laughing again, that has always been the difference between us, hasn’t it? The pessimist finds humor in human cruelty while the optimist finds only cruelty.


The young man moved a piece on the board forward. He motioned for Don that it was his move. Don moved a piece forward with little interest.


Outside the sky darkened. Cats started raining down onto the streets, exploding as they hit cars and pavement. A parade of golden robots marched in the streets now. Some carried huge instruments that seemed to be made of tree bark. They danced and sang and some did cartwheels.


Don looked at the young man and seemed worried.


You’re dying? Don asked while watching the almost comical parade of robots being rained on by falling cats.


The young man looked up from the board and looked outside with amusement.
Sorry about that, the young man said, I guess the morphine is starting to kick in.


How long? Don asked.


Not long, the young man said as he looked at Don, I’m afraid this will be our last game. I’m old. The heart just doesn’t want to dance anymore. I had them load me here to say goodbye. No worries, people will start coming soon now. I imagine in ten years all will be extinct out there. Did you know dandelions are the only species that isn’t affected by it? Imagine that! A weed will outlive everything else. 


The young man went back to the board game and moved another piece. One of his ears fell off.


Don studied the young man. He suddenly became afraid. 


You could always upload yourself here before … you know, Don said looking worried.


The young man leaned back, looked around at the cafe, the waitress who shuffled around, the fly buzzing on the ceiling.


I don’t think I’d be very good at being immortal, the young man said looking at Don now, that was always your thing. We created this because you wanted your consciousness or electric brain or whatever it was you were afraid to lose when you got that nasty bit of cancer business. Who would have thought it would work out so well? You won’t be alone. Oh no, the military will see to that. All the top minds will be uploaded here just for you. They don’t know about you, of course. You get to play god and raise humanity anyway you see fit. Your move, by the way, and please try and pay attention. This is our last game. I would hate for my last memory to be of your morose face losing again.


Don now studied the board. After some time he moved a piece but the young man immediately followed by jumping a few of his pieces. The young man went to celebrate but one of his arms fell off. The young man looked down at it and said, Oh dear I think I’m falling apart.
When he said this one of his eyes melted and oozed down his cheek.
Don handed him a napkin.


Well, the young man said smiling, I do believe we won’t be able to finish this game after all. I’m to be thrust back into the dust from whence I came.


They both stood. As they did the table and cafe and everything else fell into a sea of sand. They stood facing one another as the young man started to fall apart one piece at a time. His voice changed into something that sounded like it was coming from underwater.


I don’t want to be alone, Don confessed as he went to grab the young man but when he grabbed him there was nothing but sand.


For years Don stood in silence staring into the sand his friend had become. He thought of sky and sky appeared. He thought of a river and a river appeared. He thought of a rock and a rock appeared. Don sat on the rock. He fell into a dream of trees and weeds and rain and fish and clouds and animals speaking and creating tribes. He created a moon and stars and a universe that expanded beyond the reach of anything but dreams. For billions of years he rested until he woke. He stood and shook off the grass and trees that had grown around him. He followed the river into a nearby town and sat in a cafe like he had done so many times. He ordered two plates of food. He sat in silence, staring out at the dandelions growing from in between the cracks in the sidewalk and streets. In each of them something whispered to him. He sat and waited for his friend who would never come. He sat and wept and when he did the dandelions wept with him.  ",cardboardzen

Person A went to kill his target, but didn't go anywhere, creating person B, his clone.
Person A knowing that he now has a clone decides to continue cloning himself because B dose not have this information yet and continues his job. Person A makes clones A-1 through A-23 (Because they all share A's knowledge) and B is later informed about person A but not his clones. B tracks down A and they go through this whole story above, B is getting ready to make B-1 when A(-?) then kills B and now A and his clones finally have a body to show for it all.",SomeoneForgetable

"[WP] Teleportation booths actually clone, then kill the original. When they malfunction and fail to kill the original, they send you to finish the job. Unfortunately, the teleporter you used malfunctioned and now you will be hunted by yourself.",elheber,"I knew I was in trouble the second I stepped out of the booth and back into the street in downtown East Alothio. I swore violently for several minutes. I pulled out my phone and desperately attempted to call in to base. It was too late.

My heart rate shot through the roof. I had to move quickly. The problem was, my phone was already disabled, and so would be my access chip. I was already marked. I knew it. I started walking, ripping off my wrist gear and hurling into a potted plant on the small sidewalk. I dumped my phone there too. Both useless now. They would only track me by it. I checked my belt, both guns, still there. Checked all three knives.

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Oh god I’m so dead.
Dammit dammit dammit!
Breathe.

I had to get out of the city. The problem was, almost 60% of the damn planet was city. But someone would see me. Too many cameras. Emergency Transport. I scanned the area for one of the yellow octagons. Two blocks down. Okay. Go there.

I started to jog. The intracity pods hummed past on their programmed routes, depositing people in front of their destinations. Chatter filled the afternoon air. A lot of people grabbing lunch, or heading back into work. Luckily I had just ate. Other me would be halfway across the planet by now, headed home for the night.

I reached the transport hub and dragged the door open. Completely mechanical. No electronics. That’s what I needed. I pulled out one of the folding bikes and yanked it apart. I mounted it and hurriedly pulled back into the street.

People were staring. Whispering. Pointing.

I probably looked incredibly insane. Regrettably so. Attention was the last thing I wanted. But I really needed to move quickly. And so I biked. Fast. Always did enjoy a good bike ride at the gym. I flew down the street, building up speed. I guided myself into the center of the narrow road. Major streets and highways had gotten so damn small over the past twenty years. Growing up in the suburbs, some of our sideroads had wider paths then these. Those transport pods really reduced the need for wide roads.

The suburbs was were I needed to go. It took me six and a half hours to get there. Twice I was stopped by Security Patrol. Both times I flashed my ID and made up some advanced sounding bullshit about my wrist communicator being hacked, telling them I was on business and in a bit of a rush, and politely asked them to fuck off. Worked both times, although the first guy was a little cranky about it.

Unable to believe my luck, but completely exhausted, I smashed my way into the old house that I used to live in. I knew the only reason I was still alive is because they couldn’t track my phone or wrist gear.

My power suit was untraceable, and I still had my weapons. I needed to sleep and eat food. Luckily the emergency bike came with a ration pack. I cracked it open and activated the heater. I picked one of the meals and locked it into place on the heat plate. I pressed the activator switch and the meal popped.

Just like that, nutrient enhanced mac-n-cheese. It was gorgeous. And then I propped myself up in the corner and fell asleep in about five minutes.

I woke up. I almost fell back asleep too, until I realized I woke up. And I remembered what happened. That shocked me into the sudden realization that somehow, I still wasn’t dead. And that was enough to get me going. I staggered to my feet. My shoulder was ridiculously stiff after sleeping against a wall for god knows how long. I had no way of telling time. If I was going to hide out here I’d need to find some stuff to make a decent hideout.

That’s when I realized how stupid I was. Once Tritus Corp. had ID’d the malfunction, and realized I was untraceable, they’d probably think to check here. I bet there would be some record that I had lived here.

Okay, no big deal, I’d just move a couple cities over, hideout there. Find some random place that worked out better than this particular house, and I’d be okay.

I spared just another second to curse myself for being so damn stupid.

“Too late ya burnt toaster crumb.”

I froze and my blood ran cold. A chill crept across my skin and I felt the adrenaline spike and the blood rush into my veins as my heart rate increased. No. That voice.

“They sent me?” I gasped.

“Well no shit, who else could find me, but me. Duh.”

God I was such a fucking idiot! I should've guessed.

“Yeah you’re feeling pretty dumb right now aren’t you?”

And the worse part was, I would’ve armed myself to the teeth before coming after myself. I was for sure outgunned, probably out-armored, and so far, calm me was out-thinking myself.

I went for the gun on my left, rotated to my right, dropping to one knee, and got off two shots towards fully armored me.

The shots cracked into my clones shoulder and upper chest plates. They saved my life.

Zit-zit-zit-zit-zit. The tracer rounds from the tactical rifle passed in a swath into the wall as the impact threw off the clones aim. Two more rounds found my helmeted face, but the clone was already moving forward. I rose to my full height and tried to sidestep but the clone crashed into me, the weight and strength of the power armor driving me into the wall. My power absorbed most of the impact but it still hurt like a bitch.

I focused and with my suit guiding me, I elbowed the back of the clones head as hard as I could. The armored head smashed into the wall. It cracked, white powder spattering the tile floor and a small cloud of dust roiled up to our mid calves. Using its right arm the clone pinned my stomach into the wall with the stock of the rifle. He drew his head back and I knew he was about to just headbutt me. I dropped, flattening myself out to slide to the ground. The clone smashed his head into wall and dust rained into my head. With my left hand I went for one of my knives and moved to stab the back of my clones knee. The clone had stepped back three or fours steps to his left to avoid the blow.

He’d follow up with more gunfire. I lunged up, reaching for the gun. The clone yanked it away, stepping back I fired four more shots at him, tracking him as he moved rapidly to my left. I slotted away my knife, and went for the gun on my right side, with the left hand. The clone stepped in and pinned my wrist to my ribs, driving me back into the wall.

We knew each other too well, and I couldn’t fight the strength of the power armor.

“Why kill me then, we could have two of us?” I asked.

“You know why you idiot.”

I did. Tritus Corp. would hunt both of us forever. Once the clone won this fight he could just carry on with life as usual. I, on the other hand was fucked, and sure not dumb enough to condemn myself to a life on the run by betraying my employer just to hang around myself in exile.

Besides, I was kinda an asshole.

Nope, this was a battle to the death. One that I was slated to lose. If by some miracle I did win, the contract would technically be complete, and I could just steal my tech back from my dead body and proceed with my own life.

Damn, Tritus had made a pretty smart move by choosing to send me, aster me.

But now I’d have to figure out how to kill myself in order to stay alive. Adrenaline had kicked in. Instinct. That’s what I had on my side. Desperation. Not tech.

I dropped my gun in the right hand and lashed out and the soft neck area of the armor, pressing my thumb in on the windpipe. The clone pulled back and I stepped forward. Big mistake. The clone knew that’s what I’d do and he violently kicked my leg backwards. I crashed to my knees and took the stock of the rifle to the back of the head.

My vision flashed and I collapsed to ground. Desperately I rolled to the side in order to avoid another volley of short range fire. The rifle was humming with power as it hurled its rounds into the floor.

The clone knew my style, what sort of shit I’d pull. I’d have to fight with pure adrenaline, only instinct. Like animal. I had to fight for my life, not for the targets. I rolled again and leapt to my feet.

I howled in anger and hurled myself into the armored hulk attacking me. We crashed into the ground. I grabbed both sides of the helmet and yanked back and forth, smashing it over and over again into the ground. I wrenched off the faceplate by quickly hitting the release switch. I flipped the smooth plate over and smashed it into my face that used to be behind it. The clone coiled his legs in an attempt to push me off. Using one hand I held the faceplate down, and punched it repeatedly with the other. I felt my nose break. There was a pain in my knee as my weight settled on the rifle as the clones grasp on it released. I didn’t stop. I struck again, and again with my right hand, splitting my knuckles on the inner gel and electronics layer as I smashed the plate over and over again into my face. The clone bucked and our weight shifted. His foot caught my ankle and shoved my leg backwards, rolling my kneeling body weight to the side enough for him to shove me violently off and into my back. He rolled after me, now he was on top, blood streaming from his face. My face. I still had my second gun in my left hand and I fired the whole mag. Ten rounds smashed at point blank into the stomach and lower chest plates of the armor. The clone rolled back and away gasping from the impact. That armor was some serious shit.

I didn’t let up. I dropped my empty gun and lunged for the one on the ground. I snatched it up and drew like an Ancient Earth cowboy. Probably what would remain as the fastest, and luckiest shot of my life, had been the one I used to kill myself.

The round struck the clone in the unarmored face as it struggled to stand. The armor died, toppling forward and smashing into the ground.

I collapsed with exhaustion and disbelief. I had given up all combat discipline in that fight, and it had saved my damn life. How fucking ridiculous.

By killing myself, I could live again.

Being shot at by somebody who looks remarkably like me - but isn't - is not my idea of a good time. This is the absolute worst case scenario in my line of work and one of the main reasons I try not to use those damn things.

Being sent on assignment across the country was supposed to simple: I'd board a train, hit the airport and travel via air, the old-fashioned way. None of this space-age teleportation nonsense. I've always had an aversion to the experience of my molecules being disintegrated and re-formed in another location. I've only done it a handful of times. 

And you know what that means; I'm not even the original. That guy is loooooong dead. Most folks don't know the dark truth behind Tele-Corp's ""convenient"" and ""safe"" technological innovation. Ha! Why would they even try to learn about it? It doesn't conform to the latest trend or fad and certainly isn't bright, nor colorful enough to hold the attention of most of the population. It's a depressing, sinister truth, steeped in the blood of its users. But no one seems to care about that, when it's convenient.

That is, unless it's their turn to be hunted. 99% of all teleportations go remarkably well; sure, there's a bit of discomfort, a slight numbing of the limbs and brief flash of white light, but that's not terrible. Users wake up, slightly dazed, but intact. 99% of the time, things go well. When things go awry, that's when people like me are brought in. I'm a Hunter - part of a select group of Tele-Corp engineers who know what's really going on with the machines and are complicit in making sure no one else finds out.

Is it unethical? Probably. Do I care? Not as such. I'm making a killing (if you'll pardon the pun) doing this job, and I've only had to go on two hunts in the ten years since we discovered the fatal flaw in the technology. But now, as a direct result of that last assignment, I'm on my third: me. So now I face a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with someone who knows my every move. This should be a challenge. I'm not even sure which one of us stepped into that booth back in San Diego, really; I don't give a rat's ass about that. All I'm concerned with is survival.

I look out and see him searching for me across the street. He has his back turned, totally oblivious to my location. I raise my pistol and line up my shot and...

I look down to see my clone's corpse crumpled on the ground before me. He hesitated and missed his shot. Too bad for him. If he hadn't stopped to ruminate on whatever it was he was thinking about, he'd still be breathing. I pick up his pistol and, crouching behind a bush, line up shot just as my other clone looks over. As I squeeze the trigger, there's a flash and...

I breathe a sigh of relief as my doppleganger explodes. I'm glad I had those flash grenades and even happier he took out my double. Feeling as if the coast is clear, I put my hands in my pocket and walk down the street. It's a beautiful day. Birds are singing and a light rain is beginning to mist down from the sky. I feel a sharp pain in my neck and...

I let the corpse of my clone fall to the ground. It's time to report back to Tele-Corp, but this time I'm taking the train. I wonder how many times that booth malfunctioned and how busy I'm going to be this weekend. I take out a cigarette, light it and think to myself: well, at least it isn't the worst job I've ever had.

"[WP] Teleportation booths actually clone, then kill the original. When they malfunction and fail to kill the original, they send you to finish the job. Unfortunately, the teleporter you used malfunctioned and now you will be hunted by yourself.",elheber,"With every step that I took I looked over my shoulder. What if the other me was suddenly behind me, ready to slit my throat... Paranoia started growing inside me. At one point I didn't even look forward anymore. I started walking backwards and turn with every step I took. Where to hide?! Did the other me also have my memories? If so, then I wouldn't be able to hide anywhere I've ever been before!

~

From the moment that I had existed I had a feeling that I was meant to do something. I had this blood-thirst that I didn't know how to stop. A blurry image in my mind. My only memories where from that day, when I woke up in the middle of the street. But somehow I knew where I was going. I was drawn to a place, if it even was a place, I had the feeling that the point that I was drawn to kept moving.

~

I had to stop to rest a bit. Exhaustion has taken over me. It's been 6 hours since I went through that malfunctioning teleportation booth. As I turn the corner I find a small cafe. I decide that whatever is going to happen, I'll probably die of exhaustion and thirst if I don't take a break from running right now. The cafe is almost empty, beside for the the woman who seems to be waiting for her a meeting. I walk to the bar and ask for a glass of sparkling water. Even when I'm on the verge of dying I'll still think about my diet. I decide to sit in the far left corner so I can overview the entire cafe. When I get my water I start staring at the bubbles in it. I get lost in my thoughts and forget to pay attention to my surroundings.

~

That blurry image stays in the back of my mind with every step that I take. When I pass a shop with mirroring windows I look at myself for the first time. ""Hmm I don't look that bad."" I think to myself. Then the blurry image is back on my mind again. It starts to get less blurry. ""She looks kind of cute. We look a lot alike."" I mumble. I kept wondering who she is and why she is the only one I seem to remember. Suddenly I hear my tummy rumbling. I decide that I should get something to eat. I turn the corner and walk into a small cafe that seems to draw my attention.

~

The bell on the door rings. I nearly jump up as I'm drawn back into reality. I have no idea for how long I zoned out, but at least I'm still alive. The man is still standing in the doorway, his eyes locked on mine. He walks to a table and sits down. ""Who is he and why does he seem so familiar."" I start to wonder. Every time I look towards him he seems to glare at me too. I look away in embarrassment. 

~

The second I walk into the cafe my eyes are drawn to the back of the cafe. There she is, the woman who's been in my mind for as long as I can remember. She's noticed me too. Tho she seemed kind of startled when I walked in, but maybe they're just not used to more than 2 costumers. I sit down at a table where I can still look at her. Watching her from over the menu, I can see that she's still staring at me. I need to know who she is. I get up again and start walking toward her table. She's starting to blush. ""Can I sit with you?"" I ask her with a shaky voice that I don't recognize. As she nods a few of her curls escape from her bun. I have to fight the urge to put her hair behind her ear. ""Shit, she wants to know my name. What is my name?!"" I had to improvise. ""Alex, what about you?""

~

""Bella"", I replied in a soft voice. I felt drawn to the man in front of me. I felt a comfort that I've never felt before. The paranoia fading away. We talked a bit about where we're from, tho I noticed that he didn't share that much about him. We'd been talking for hours. I didn't even realize that it was already starting to get dark. The waiter walked to our table and said that they were closing up. Alex looked at the bill. I saw a shock in his eyes. ""Don't worry, it's on me."" I said. The second that I reached for my wallet the door flew open. The bell ringing loud.

~

""Number 06500, you have failed your mission!"" A man in a black suit said. The other two men pointed guns at us. ""What is going on?!"" I screamed towards Bella. ""Who are you and what have you done?!"" She said nothing and stared at me with an open mouth. ""Don't blame the girl for your mistakes, number 06500. This is all on you. You should've killed her."" The second man said. ""I didn't do anything!"" I said to Bella. ""You have to trust me!"" 

~

I didn't know what to do. I felt that my face was wet. Apparently I had started crying. Alex placed his hand on my arm and smiled sad. We both knew that we wouldn't get out of this place alive. The men started walking towards us. Alex and I stared each other in the eyes as the men stood behind us and pointed their guns at our head. ""This has been the greatest malfunction that we've ever seen. Never has there been a male copy of a woman passing through the  teleportation booth, can't we just both let them live?"" The youngest of the three asked to the other men. Apparently that kind of compassion wasn't tolerated and the tallest man shot him in the head. The man fell to the ground and a puddle of blood formed around him. Then both men turned to us again and pointed their guns to our heads again. ""Well, you've managed to stay alive for quite a while, miss Atwood. Unfortunately you've overstayed your welcome in this world."" The leader said.

I sat down on the curb next to the teleportation booth, getting strange looks from the others in line, but no one asked questions. Would have been impolite. And, while sitting, I began to think.

""Okay, step one, go home, get armed to defend against myself. They'd send me, of course, that's standard procedure. Wait, no, I can't go home, that'd be obvious. Okay, step one, go somewhere else entirely. Bogota. No, damn it, I can't go there, I just thought of it so I...I mean, he will too. Okay, step one, go to that coffee shop and wait for him to show up and follow him. No, dammit, I'd never expect me to be here so I wouldn't do that. Okay, step one...""

*Meanwhile, one mile away, outside a similar teleportation booth...*

""I know this might be hard, but you need to be the one to do it.""

""Yes sir""

The commlink chirped off. I sat down on a nearby park bench, and started to think.

""Okay, step one, go home, get armed. No, dammit, that's what he'll do too and he has a head start. Okay, step one, figure out where he goes next. Bogota? No, he'd expect me to predict that...""",thewolfsong

Unfortunately, the teleporter you used malfunctioned and now you will be hunted by yourself.",elheber,"Back when teleporters first came out people had a lot of questions. At first they only teleported objects and then animals. When the prized puppy came back just fine after the vet took out the dog's junk, people started warming up to the idea. 

Now they're in every country on several planets, they've replaced airports and space travel, they' re in front of every major business, government building, city centre and the worst some people have to do is travel by self driving cars for a bit to get to their local teleportation device.  

You might have heard of ""The Teleportation Conundrum and The Soul"" question before, but in case you haven't, let me jog your memory:

When you stand in the teleporter it will take apart your body, transform it into information and then use that information to rebuild it in another area. It is rebuilt as soon as possible only a few seconds lagging behind the decomposition of your first body. People used to ask themselves, does that mean I died and was reborn? Is the same person standing in the second teleported me, or just a copy? But what about if it misses some information, some inexplainable bit of information we can't yet record, trace or understand? Some people might call it a soul. Would you risk travelling to place you'd never see in your lifetime, miss out on experiences you could never grasp without the technology or be bogged down by the inconvenience of regular space/time travel while everyone else benefits from the instant gratification of not having to pack themselves into a bus? Would you do it all in the name of an unlikely possibility of protecting your soul when you don't even know it exists?

It turns out that once pets were just fine, no one cared about their possible soul. Well, expect the Amish. 

The thing about teleportation is that we employees of Teleco^tm learned to explain everything in vary neutral terms when it was just a start up. We learned to say that you ""become information"" and are ""rebuilt almost instantly."" Truthfully, whatever matter in the machine is hot flashed out of existence and then cloned. 

That includes people. 

It wasn't always that way. Back before it was Teleco^tm, when the five founders were in college, they created their first machine. It didn't remove the first object from existence. It cloned it. They got a box and cloned it five feet away from the first one. I know because I was a fucking lucky janitor to witness that. I was so gobsmacked I didn't let out a peep. I didn't know it at the time, but that was another stroke luck.

The founders could have used their first machines and not removed the first object from existence. I know they were working hard to improve the machines and I head hushed conversations about how tight grant money was getting. I try not to think about that too much.

I know they tried to improve it, when it was first created. Somehow there were some accidents and this lead the five founders to turn into two. I didn't ever find out what happened to the three other engineers but I do know that a few times when I was cleaning the lab there was a particular smell of pork for a few days right before and after the incident. 

Angelica Rothchild and Afolabi Awolowo were the only two left. I ended up talking to them casually one day when they were working late. I really should say, Angelica and Afolabi Awolowo. They got married soon after the accidents and started Teleco^tm. It was right around the time they hired me. 

It beat the hell out of being a janitor. 

I never was put into sales specifically nor did I play any particular role in the company aside from cleaning but they gave me a fancy title and had me run basic errands. I was Lead Implementation Specialist. Basically, I filled in where ever they needed someone. 

I thought it was great at the time. It never occurred to me what cleaning up after a Teleco^tm really would entail. I also never had a lawyer look over the NDA when they flashed dollar signs in my eyes. 

If they had created a time travel device, I would go back in time and slap myself. 

My most important job in the company was cleaning and keeping my mouth shut. Sure, I grabbed coffees, helped set up computers in their new office and took calls occasionally but I mostly helped to clean the automated factory when it was first started because the double A duo wouldn't trust many people. 

As the company grew and they were able to automate everything, they started teaching me about how the machines worked. That way, I could go out a fix any damage. They were built pretty strong and honestly, for the first 10 years, they didn't seem to need much help. I thought it was pretty weird but I figured they were smart enough to invent teleportation, so I didn't question it. 

It two days ago that they pulled me away from my vacation in Vegas to fix a teleporter in California. The thing was, when I got there, nothing seemed a miss. I checked everything over and it was just fine. I left them a message after two days of trouble shooting and decided to hop back to Vegas. Just to be sure I put a sign on the outside of the teleporter showing that it was under maintenance. A few more days of all you can eat buffets and gambling would help clear my mind.

I figured out what was wrong as soon as I tried to get back. After the typical flash, I was still in the machine. I got out and after releasing a stream of profanities, I left to take a walk and cool down. 

When I got back, I saw myself exit the machine. A chill went down my spine. I always knew what these were, but I had never thought too hard about it. Only this version of me had a gun. 

I turned tail and ran. 

Creating a replicator machine, well that's just not how capitalism works.  ",writingstuffxyz

This has been a long trip and I am eager to return to spread the lessons I have learned with my fellow monks. 

*beep beep beep*

That's strange. I'm sure it's just a glitch. I'll try again.

*beep beep beep*

I try it 3 more times before accepting that this machine was defective. I move to the next teleporter.

*beep beep beep*

Once more I try a couple more times before admitting defeat. At last I accept that teleporting just isn't meant to be my mode of transport and purchase a ticket for shuttle heading towards a nearby province. It's a long ride and I'm tired. There's something strange though. I could have sworn I saw that man get off at the last stop. I guess I really do need some sleep.

I wake up as the shuttle stops and switch to another. It's strange, I could have sworn the woman boarding the return shuttle looked exactly like someone I had seen at the last station. It must have been a longer journey than I thought. 

*screech*

The shuttle pulls into my final stop and I head towards the province. I pass the teleporters on the platform and leave the station. The air seemed still, the dust unmoving. Though I cannot see anyone, a sense of apprehension fills the air. I walk through town, mustering up all my remaining energy, knowing I the walk up to my temple is steep and exhausting. 

The gates are open and the grounds are quiet. The students should be training, the masters teaching, and the gates closed to preserve concentration and tranquility. The faint smell of copper lingers in the wind and the dirt is dark with blood. I run towards the temple, my heart pounding in my chest as I contemplate a hundred scenarios to explain what has happened. I open the door. I wasn't even close.

Seated on each of the meditation cushions is...me. They--***I*** look at me calmly, serenely, even warmly and say very simply:

The sweat from the earlier chase had all but gone and now I shivered through the still darkness, my projectile boa constrictor held out before me.
There he was...
Standing there with his back turned to me, heaving slightly from the long run down the 30 foot alley, he seemed oblivious to my presence.
I took a step forward and was shocked as he whirled around with a projectile boa constrictor of his own!
""Don't move!"" We both yelled.
""You first!"" We yelled again.
The tension could be cut with a flashlight.
His eyes stared deep into mine. His hair, dark blonde, rustled and roguish, his muscles glistening in the pale moonlight. His ... wait, what?
Never mind...
This battle had to end here and n...

God damnit!
I tried to adjust to hide it as my evil doppelgänger did the same.
He was thinking the same thing...
The moment came. We dropped out projectile boa constrictors and ran into each others arms. We both tried to leap at each other and knocked ourselves out.
The resulting impact lead both of our erections to slam into each and break in the most painful of way.
In anger, I slammed my fist on the ground as my evil doppelgänger did the same.
This fiendish bastard who tried to have his way with me won't get away with this.
I pulled my leg up and kicked him in the face just as something struck me and knocked me unconscious.

It has been for years since I was appointed such a task, I keep at it since the pay is magnificent. I don’t have many moral problems with killing them, they are just extras in my honest opinion.

Anyway, today is going to be my first day of using such booths. My nervousness tends to overextend itself, almost rendering me useless. In this case, there was no such thing! All of the wretchedness disappeared, as I entered inside the teleportation booth. A voice confirmed my location, my ID and the booth shook up with extreme intensity. Unfortunately for me, a blue light emanated from it, almost blinding me, kicking me outside of the booth. When I came up, I saw the face of horror.

There were at least five clones of mine, to my dismay. Not waiting for a second, they took it to themselves to chase me and murder me. I started running into the alleys, but the clones were me, they knew my plans and followed me.

In a heated battle against the first clone I encountered, I managed to defeat him. I’ve noticed something that could save my very life, the clones are significantly weaker than I am. As I escaped the bloody murder of myself, two more clones cut my path short.

I didn’t wait, taking out my darksaber. Darkness came out of the handle of the sword, creeping its way upwards, until reaching the satisfied tip of the sword.

Fortunately, it seems that the fuck up didn’t clone them darksabers. In a bloody aftermath, two of me lay lifelessly on the floor. There were two more of them left, which I took care of. That’s when I received a call from my superiors.

“Jesse, what happened in District Two?”

“Just a small malfunctioning, nothing to worry about. I’ve taken care of it.”

I hid four of the bodies, taking one body with myself.

After all, I needed evidence that I have murdered myself, the original.

I didn't think it would be this easy to find him. I guess I really do know myself. What I didn't know was what he was going to do next. I held the gun aimed at him.

He complied.

My face remained still, but inside, I was panicking. I would never willingly lay my life down. I know myself better than this.

""Do you want to do this somewhere that wont disturb the public?""

That was it, I had to ask. 

""Why did you give up so easily?""

He laughed and said, ""You know better than this. This job requires no hesitation to kill. Are you so scared by the fact that I look like you?"" 

I gave him a questioning look. He still had that shit-eating grin on his face, even with a bullet pointed in his general direction. 

We both know he wants to survive. ""Stop panicking"", I told myself. Did I accidentally say that out loud? No, the copy did. 

""I've got an idea."", He says. 

""I am literally an identical copy of you, we could both go our seperate ways to clean up twice as fast. Think about it. You can tell them I was eliminated, you'll have someone else doing half the work for you.""

I actually took the time to consider this. A big mistake for me. In an instant, I was on the floor. I felt pain and saw red. I forgot about the- ""You forgot I had a copy of the handgun when I was supposedly cloned. You hesitated to kill me when I gave you the chance and said it right to your face. I don't know whether to be dissapointed or thank you. This has been a humbling experience, but I've won nonetheless."" 

I couldn't reply as blood filled my mouth. I couldn't breathe.

""This experience of desperation, the bluffing, the compromising. It was all something I could never learn if I wasn't on the recieving end."" 

Of course. Me, coming here to kill him, would only be an experience that would make him better than me at this job.

I would only be driven to act so differently if I was as desperate as he was. 

 In the end, it didn't matter which one of us lived and which one of us died. Only one of us learned not to hesitate in this situation though, the other died. 

I tried to laugh, actually considering splitting the work. I'd never do that.

My rationale for the clone being 'inexperienced' so to speak was that, because the Government wanted Ethan dead, they 'rolled him back' a little to reign him in and mould him into a better killer. The clone has his memories but they're hollow so they don't have Ethan's emotion -- and so on. It was a stylistic choice that, in hindsight, might not make all that much sense, haha.

It's running into a Zoom H6 which is in interface mode and connected to my computer.

 I've set up a vocal booth in a closet. A single sleeping bag is the only acoustic treatment in there. I close the door to the closet when I'm recording. I bought a 25 foot hdmi cable from Amazon to run to my computer from the closet to avoid fan noise. 

As for effects, at the moment I'm only equalizing out the noise floor. I record in Reaper which has a plugin called Refir. I set it to subtract mode, record ""silence"" (background noise), and set it to automatically detect a noise profile. It then applies that eq to the whole track. 

I have yet to really wrap my head around compression, though I would like to incorporate into my use of effects eventually. Reverb is more of a sound design decision. I haven't used a lot of effects in that way yet, but as I keep reading these stories I would like to utilize effects that way. Like, treating dialogue heard over the radio to sound like it in my recording. 

Hope that helps. It may be more info than you asked for, but just knowing which mic I'm using is only one piece of the entire picture.",LoridianVA

Quantum teleportation means copying the properties of one particle to another using a third particle to move the ""reconstruction instructions"" from the original particle to the target particle, so it isn't even ""teleportation"" in the way most people (non-physicists) think. Mess with the transportation and all information is lost, making this a risky move. And the original's destruction involves information -- the particle is still there.

Unfortunately, the teleporter you used malfunctioned and now you will be hunted by yourself.",elheber,"Looking back on humanity, it seems like the more our needs and wants are met, the less human we become.


It's 2067. Earth needed a new method to clean up the sins of the industrial revolution and the immense ecological disaster that followed the tech boom in the early 2000's. A group of scientists stumbled on a new element in Jupiter's eye. An element nicknamed Sovereign that could dissolve our staggering continents of consumer driver waste.

Many human lives were sacrificed to build the collection dome on Jupiter. And as civizations began to war over the many resources that long distance space travel, a little known scientist created an alternative.

Teleportation is what they called it. Some people would say that the term for this newly born method of travel. A retro throwback rebranding a cruel process to make it seem marvelous. 

But as the sins of humanity past was starting to draw it's final death rattle, the guise of prosperity blinded the oncoming generations. You see, under the noble names of Teleportation and Sovereign humanity would entirely loose it's humane identity.

Just as the generations before us, poverty writhed beneath the weight of the upper classes. Social programs were all but gone and suddenly poor became a life sentence of servitude that every cycle of man has known. The only way out was to enlist in the Jupiter Mining Corp. It offered pay and a simple motto-ed promise: ""We Endure for Earth"".


I enlisted at 16, under a law that gave foster children a way out of a dismal system. I remember how naively proud I was. I was being brave for mankind; my efforts kept the earth stable for the future. No one ever explains things to kids, they just sit back and let the gravity of life suck you down. 

I knew a lot of the people that worked at the teleportation facility with me. The faces of my fellow orphans and abused peers were much like the one I saw in the mirror every morning. We cleaned the labs after each ""event"" and refined the deliver raw Sovereign into usable, safe material. It was exhausting to the bone.

When I was 32 I was summoned before the Head of JMC and the wiry, erratic man offered me a unique promotion. 

""We have review your file-"" he paused to clear his throat and began again-""Jupiter Mining believes you have great potential. How would you like to Teleport offworld?""

The ink on my contract was dry before I even understood what Teleportation really was. It was a slaughter and I was about to find out how much killing I would have to endure to keep the garbage of the masses from re-encompassing Earth.

So that's it, then.  I pulled the only trigger I wasn't scared enough to pull.  And now it's just a few hours, maybe more if he's delayed.  My phone rings, a buzz from the bank: Did I Really Just Buy A Plane Ticket From Colorado?

If you've seen the movie than you already know but just in case (I'd recommend it it's a good one) 

In looper it's impossible to murder people in the future because forensics have gotten so good so they send them to the present strapped full of silver with a bag over their head tied up ready to be killed by people called loopers. The loopers only job is to be at a certain spot at a certain time with his gun ready to kill the guy as soon as he pops into existence in the present. When a looper is working its called an open or running loop. When a looper is ""retired"" they call it a closed loop and grab his future self and send him to the present in the same fashion strapped with gold this time as a big final payday for the present looper. It's a way of ensuring the  looper doesn't have the ability to turn on the future crime bosses and provide evidence after he grows old in the future. When loopers sign up they know some day they'll have to close their loop and kill their future selves and in exchange trade that for tons of cash in the present. 

In the movie Joseph Gordon Levitt is the young main character looper. One day the crime bosses from the future try to close his loop and send the future him (Bruce Willis) to the present to be killed but knowing what would happen Bruce escapes using the gold to shield him from the gunshot and knocking Joseph Gordon Levitt out with it. The rest of the movie is Bruce Willis tracking down the guys that sent him to the present and attempting to kill them and Joseph Gordon Levitt trying to kill his future self to close his loop and prevent his own early death at the hands of the current crime bosses who don't take well to loops running wild and are on his trail.

""Thanks for having me Cliff""

""No problem Gogh. Anyways let's go over to the analysts desk and look at today's matchup""

""Thanks Cliff. This is Tay Zer with the analysts desk, and in today's ever important game, we have the top 2 taser ball teams around the world, The Venezuela Volts and the Underdog, the American Amplifiers! We're likely looking at a very close match Cliff but if we had to pick a team we'd pick the Volts. It all really comes down to experience. The Volts have been at the game so long most of them probably have developed a resistance to tasers. But that's just our opinion. Back to you Cliff.""

""Thank you Tay. Most of the fans agree, but some still have that little bit of hope for the Amps""

""I actually disagree. I have strong faith in America. They've beaten every single team by at least 2 points and their keeper Wally Blox is on top of everything."" 
  
""Let me stop you there Gogh. The Volts haven't lost either and the only time they came close to losing was due to an injury. If you really think the Amps have a chance I say we make a wager.""

""If you say so. I'm in. How bout 5 grand.""

""Ya know what deal. I could use a new tv.""

""Consider it done. If any one at home wishes we posted a poll on twitter on the handle @taserballchamp go and vote for your team and while your at it why not follow for all the latest news in taser ball.""

""While we wait why don't we take a quick break and resume at game time""

15 minutes later

""Welcome back taser fans. It's Cliff Hanger here with Gogh Lee and the game is about to start.

""The twitter poll is in and the game is 93 to 7 percent in favor of Venezuela.""

""And with that poll the game is on and all the players are making a mad dash for the ball. The Volts have possession of the ball!""

""But out of Nowhere America's shocker is on him And it's down America gaining control of the ball! They shoot! It's hits the keeper. He appears dazed. And the ball rolls in!""

""An unfortunate start for the Volts but the game isn't over yet. With the ball reset the Amps get it this time. Agile as he may be he cannot stop a taser. But wait A last second pass saves possession and the left wing now has the ball! But the Volts were waiting for that and the taser is there. With 30 seconds left on the clock, the Volts are gaining ground on Wally. And with a swift ally-oop they score! And there's the buzzer.So much for your keeper Gogh.""

""Hey we still got the 2nd half I'm not worried yet""

""If you say so. Apart from that today's halftime show it brought to you by Little Ceasers 'pizza pizza yum yum'. We have preforming tonight, BØRNS with Electric Love.""

5 minutes later 

""Well Cliff You know I love that song but I love the game more and now that half times over its time to get back on track.""

""I agree Gogh. And with the buzzer the game resumes. The Amps are the first there and with a series of well timed passes they progress the ball past half court only 2 tased along the way and with the ball almost there. A Perfect bounce shot between the keepers legs! This hasn't happened since 1982! Incredible! Such a risky move paying off!""

""I knew my team had it in them.""

""It's now Venezuela's ball and they're gaining ground!""

""The game only has 90 seconds on the clock. Quite a nail biter this is.""

""The shot on goal looks good. But wait a second Suddenly he's been tased and the ball""

Except it hadn't gone to plan exactly. The husband of this house had tried to confront me and I knew I had to get out. So I grabbed a vase next to me and smashed it against his head.

Thud.

He had dropped to the floor like flies being hit by spray. A mass of blood suddenly appeared and he seemed not to be breathing.

""Fuck"" I muttered.

I looked at the door when I saw someone who was presumably the wife staring back at me dumbfounded but doing nothing.

As per protocol I ran like there was no tomorrow. 

******************************************************

A few days later I was passing by a store. That man. I had killed him. He was dead. Yet there was nothing on the news at all. As I entered the store I saw a sign that said ""missing"" with the husband's photo on it.

""the fuck"" I thought to myself.

So out of curiousity I headed back to the house and tried to find my way in. But then a figure from behind appeared. It was the wife.

""Thank you"" she said.
""For what"" as I stated as I faced her.
""For making him disappear"" she retorted, ""you see my husband is the stereotypical douchebag millionaire and I'm the stereotypical douchebag wife. I had poisoned his food with hemlock. He was going to anyway. He was going to throw up but then he heard you and that altercation and what not. Then you killed him with a glass vase that was ridiculously dead. Now I just had to cut him up to remove the hemlock and make it look like a brutal murder by a burglar and report him missing before his high level friends investigate and find him all massacred whilst I was asleep. They investigate a little more and find the bastard who killed him.""

Tears prick my eyes as they surround me, swirling in front of my vision until all I see is blinding blue-white.

Who? The word echoes in my head without going through my ears. I see silhouettes, somehow at once shadows and also light sources themselves. I push through them like a crowded street, looking for one. I know I'll recognise her when I see her.

There she is. My beautiful Emily. She's a shade like the others but I can make out her long hair, her smile, that aura of warmth that made everyone love her. I reach out and touch her cheek, and the sparkling white world dissolves around us. Colour seeps into her silhouette like watercolours spreading across damp paper, and in a second or two she is there. Real, whole, there.

""Emily!"" I embrace her and she wraps her arms around me.

""Dad!""

I pull away, and look at her. ""It's really you. It's been three years and it's really you. You're back. What happened, Emily?""

She looks around at the shitty apartment, confused. ""Where...where are we, dad? Is this your home? What's going on?""

Her gaze falls on the crumpled body of the man who killed her. She tentatively goes over to him, and kneels beside him, rolling him over with one hand so she can look into the face of her murderer. She gasps. It strikes me that she may never have known the identity of the man who killed her.

When she stands up, she has a strange expression on her face.

""You killed him.""

""Yes, sweetheart. It took a long time, but I hunted him down like a dog and I killed him with my bare hands. I did it for you, my Emily.""

She steps towards me. ""No, dad. You don't understand.""

""Emily?"" I instinctively step backwards.

She stoops to pick something off the ground, and when she straightens I can see what it is. A shard of jagged mirror glass. A thin rivulet of blood seeps down her wrist.

""I'm sorry, dad. I know you did what you thought was best. But, dad... I loved him.""

Her lunge takes me by surprise, and as the glass punctures my throat I gurgle in shock. White-blue motes of light gush from my neck as I slip away.",VulKhalec

"[WP] A ruthless android bounty hunter is a hypocrite, his wife is actually an android.",nowstry,"Dust rose and danced in the light as I slowly ran my hand against Iris' skin. Her long, brown hair draped across her shoulder and partly hid her chest that rose and fell with her breath. The long lashes around her eye twitched as she wandered across the planes of her dreamworld. When I first saw her, I thought that she was too good to be true and I wanted to stay in her arms forever. Alas, we must work to survive. 

Our old bed creaked as I gently untangled our bodies she mumbled and grunted as she fought to keep me in her embrace. ""I'm sorry, babe. I need to get to work."" Another day hunting androids. News about the rise of the God of Machine in one corner of the known Universe prompted other planetary governments to create the hunter network, tasked with the identification and elimination of dangerous androids indistinguishable to humans. I was one of them and frankly, one of the best.

Hunting wasn't easy. There were humans who were sympathetic towards androids, befriending them, socializing with them, and even falling in love with machines that counterfeit not just the human body but also the soul. And I must do my part to protect my loved ones, my Iris.

I sat on the edge of the bed and habit dictated that I check my communicator which was sitting on the bedside cabinet along with my gun. The cracked screen flickered to life and at the home page was a push notification saying ""Five missed calls and Three messages from H0W@RD"". 

Five? I must've been dead tired last night. I thought and wondered what I was doing the night before.

I opened the first message which was the latest message to come in, since that was how email worked, listing the newest messages at the top. It contained a single word, ""Sorry and goodluck.""

I crinkled my brow at the image of ""H0W@RD"", the operator assigned to me, apologizing for anything. That bastard was the type who would install a formal complaints box in his office and then empty its contents into the trash when someone actually drops a letter. What could he possibly be sorry for, I thought. 

The second message contained a long letter that seemed like incoherent rambling at some parts, probably made using speech to text. The concept was great, and although we made great leaps in speech recognition, microphones were still susceptible to background noise.

""Zero, I don't know how to tell you this but. I God Yeah yeah I know, I know, but I have to tell him. Just shut up. shut it! Huh, okay. huh huh, Just huh don't panic. Breath. The Hunter network is down. It GET DOWN ugh shit! Shit! They got me. They got us. It started a few days ago, the hunters started disappearing. Never responded to hails or even messages. God I hope I'm not too late, I sent you a list of suspected androids AAAH! most of them were seen with some of our hunters MY SHIELDS ARE DOWN good luck.""

It took me a two readings to understand what was being said, the few extra words were partly to blame but the implications of what Howard said was the obvious cause.

After steadying myself, I opened the third and final message and, like Howard said, it contained a couple dozen dossiers of certain individuals. Almost all of the dossiers were marked suspected, however there were a few ones that were stamped with a large red CONFIRMED. My heart stopped as my eyes fall on the name of one of the folders.

""IRIS"".

I reluctantly opened the folder and what greeted me made me feel like a vise had taken hold of my chest. The smile of the woman that I have loved for more than a decade stared back at me through the cracked screen of my communicator. 

I couldn't remember what went through my head after that moment, but when I came to, a familiar warmth and softness enveloped me from behind as I hear her calm voice trying to sooth me. 

After a moment of gathering my thoughts, I stood up from the bed and stepped away from her handing her the communicator without saying a word.

She looked at it without much of a reaction. Like a goddamned android. She then scrolled through some of the files, her face as glazed as it was a moment ago. How could have I not seen it before. All my training, my experience, my equipment should've told me who, what she was.

""You're probably thinking about how?"" She said, in her same gentle but now distant voice. ""How you could have missed the signs.""

She stood up on the bed, her bare familiar figure was presented to me. Although unlike before when her body served to rouse my male desires, she now only invokes disgust and self loathing, and I suddenly realize that I was already holding my gun in my hand.

""But it doesn't matter, Zero. It doesn't matter what I am or where I came from. It doesn't matter whether my body is a machine or a human. What matters is that what we shared was real.""

Her voice, her speech and her unnaturally calm delivery of it only served to anger me. ""Stop!"" I screamed. The gun felt weightless in my hand as I raised it up, ""Shut the hell up.""

""You're crying. Let me comfort you.""

She took a step forward, unfazed by the gun pointing at her chest. ""Stay away."" I whimpered. ""Stay the hell away from me.""

She took another step, ""But I love you.""

My finger trembled on the trigger. One wrong step, one jolt will set off the gun, and while killing her would somehow free me from her presence, it wouldn't free me from her memory.

I pulled the gun away from her, placed it on my temple and pulled the trigger.",dark_z3r0

[WP] An alien chef is struggling with the Last Meal request of a human.,wpforme,"Ky watched casually as the alien paced up and down the hall.  His leathery skin flushed blue, his beady eyes narrowed as he huffed and jabbered.  His smaller set of arms gesticulating wildly. The hallway where The Grnt stalked was dim, the other cells empty.

The alien stopped in front of his cell and gestured some more at Ky, his short snout  wiggling with each vocalization. Ky could just catch “HUman,” and “Food,” in with all the grunts and whistles, could tell by the way the small hands moved that this was alien was agitated. But almost everything he had once learned about their language was blended together in his mind. 

“I can’t understand you,” Ky said softly, pushing himself into a sitting position. The Grnts were much larger than humans, so this cell, the cot, were almost bigger than his first studio apartment. It felt strange, to be so small in such a large space. The alien huffed, shifting its weight between its stumpy feet. He stalked out of sight and Ky sighed, slumping back against the wall. Brushing his fingers through his beard and long hair almost thoughtlessly.

Something had changed.  He could feel it in the air.  For weeks there had minimal contact between himself and The Grnts, now there had been two face to face interactions in a single day.  

First the small one had slipped him a piece of paper with a question he had not quite understood. What God Meal. Ky had written down “bread and water”, thinking of the church services his Nan had dragged him too all those years ago. Now this one was here yelling its frustration with the same piece of paper crumpled in his large right claw.

It didn’t seem like an ethnographic question anymore. 

The blue one was back, pulling a smaller alien along with him this time.  The small one had dimmer skin, like the scuffed side of a sea shell. Almost recognizable from when Ky had been through a round of questioning for the first days of his imprisonment. The big alien was talking again, gesturing towards Ky with his large arm.

“Choose new meal” The small one translated hesitantly, writhing it’s two small hands together. “Chef Busy,”

Ky jumped down from the bed and moved to stand across from the two giants.  Dread was twisting in his stomach. He had a hunch he might know what was going on. “What is it for?”  He asked, looking the small one in the eyes.  They had six black eyes spread over the top half of their faces, small and beady.

The aliens small ears pressed against its bald head. It spoke to the bright blue guy, its words lilting sofly. They did not speak for a moment. Then the big one sort of grunted and gestured again to Ky.

“Last Foods”  The small one said, even more softly now. “Death time,”

Ky staggered, turning away from the pair of them, one hand covering his mouth, and the other wrapped around his waist. He had had an inkling, but now he knew, and it felt like he had been sucker punched.

 Weeks, he had been here for weeks, they had questioned him, then ignored him, leaving him here alone, except for the occasional ration of tasteless cube, and a nonsensical question written down on a scrap of paper. 

And now— they were going to kill him, just like that.

His eyes were hot and rimmed with red  when he turned back towards the aliens. The small hairless portion of his face blotchy and uneven.  “Let me guess,” his said evenly, struggling to maintain control. “You don’t have wheat, or flour I suppose, or yeast, or even a recipe,”

“No,” The translator said, after taking the time to relay Ky’s message and get a grunt from the cook.  “Choose new God Meal”

Ky laughed, without really wanting to. God meal, what a stupid mistranslation. What other mistakes had this Grnt made over the weeks of their discourse? How much useless nonsensical information had been passed along?

“Why are they killing me now?”  Ky asked, breathless. “I don’t even know why my ship was taken.”

They murmured and whistled together again, their small hands gesticulating constantly. The chef, the big alien, was getting louder, his hand motions more emphatic.

“Not Knowledge,” The translator finally decided. “Choose new God Meal.”

There were tears in Ky’s eyes now, but something in the back of his mind hardened. “No,” He wiped at his face with his sleeve, sniffing just once. “Bread and water, that’s it, you figure it out”  He laughed half of a crazed laugh, meeting the eyes of the chef now. “Good luck,”

The translator’s small hands were over his wide gaping mouth, the words falling out in a muted tumble.

The Chef roared.  He slammed his large claws into the clear plastic of the cell wall, cracking it. Ky jumped, covering his ears with a grimace. The larger alien stalked off again, his pounding footsteps reverberating through the ground.

The translator lingered for a moment, his stunted hands still pressed over his wide mouth. Ky stared back at him, his lips trembling. Slowly the translators hands dropped and he turned and stalked away.

Ky waited until the heavy door had closed with a creak and a metallic thud before letting the tears overtake him.

[WP] An alien chef is struggling with the Last Meal request of a human.,wpforme,"Zatch-Sul passed the letter to Cap-Sul. He watched as the chef opened up the envelope, unfolded its contents and started reading it slowly, using his long slender fingers to point at each word. Cap-Sul might be dyslexic, but he always wanted to read each meal request with his own eyes, so he could “personally experience it from victim’s point of view"", as he put it.

Zatch-Sul could see that the request was shorter than usual, but the chef was taking a much, much longer time to read it. It only consisted of six words - Cap-Sul had taken a much shorter time to read the lists that some of the other larger organisms produced. Oh, for goodness’ sake, what’s wrong?

“Zatch, my boy, I do not understand.” Cap-Sul said in a halting voice. “What does this queer creature want?”

Zatch-Sul took back the paper. “It says….a tub of strawberry ice cream.” He froze. Ice cream, the exquisite dessert from the origin planet of the humans. He remembered the first time he had tasted it when he visited Earth- it was cold and sweet. In the icy realm of Frigi, he had not known cold dishes. To his people, cold was synonymous with hunger and pain, and most would stay in their thermostatically-controlled cities rather than venture out into the frigid environment outside.

But the ice cream lacked the bitter cold of the icy winds. It was a cold that comforted his forked tongue, a sensation that soothed him instead of provoking him into a state of high alert, ready to hide in the nearest shelter. No, this cold actually readied his tongue for the explosion of sweet flavour from the rest of the ingredients. Zatch-Sul smiled as he remembered how the strawberry flavour flooded his senses, back there on that rocky planet.

“Well, boy, what do you make of it?” Cap-Sul’s snapping brought him back to reality.

“The human has made a good choice, master, but a difficult one for us. This one wants a cold dish, one that crumbles easily like a biscuit, yet flows like a syrup. A half-solid half-liquid, master, that will release a heavenly strawberry taste into his mouth, and make him forget about his fate.”

“Cold dish?!” Cap-Sul’s eyes widened, and his voice indignant. Zatch-Sul shrank, suddenly regretful of adopting a cheerful tone. “Cold dish?! This vermin wants a cold dish in a prison on Frigi?! Totally no respect for our climate, and our food culture!!""

Zatch-Sul put his hand on his forehead, in a not-so-obvious facepalm. He forgot that the chef had lived through the Great Starvation. During that time, an economic crisis caused food and clothing supplies to decrease drastically, causing the death of many Frigians due to extreme cold and starvation. No wonder Cap-Sul was so against the idea of cold, and even now, was wrapped in a thick jacket in the warm kitchen.

“Ice? Cream? No!! It is impossible!! Half-solid? Half-liquid? What blasphemy!! No, I will not cook it - this human is too much! He threatened our world with espionage - now we show him a little kindness, he repays us with this!! No more!!” Cap-Sul’s three nostrils were now fully flared and exhaling hot air, and his eyes were bloodshot. He was really angry.

“Master, our laws require us to provide a last meal when the condemned requests for it….” Zatch-Sul immediately regretted his decision to speak out when Cap-Sul slapped his face with a resounding smack.

“I will not be insulted by this prick! If you want to oblige him, go ahead!!” Cap-Sul flung off his apron, leaving Zatch-Sul rubbing his reddening face.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zatch-Sul trembled as he pushed the trolley. He was wearing thick gloves and an insulated apron, but it wasn’t enough to protect him against the cold. It seeped through the cloth and went through to his bones, making him shiver constantly.

Still, he prided himself on giving the condemned a brief respite from their impending doom. That was what he promised to do, when he signed up for this.

He had gone to great lengths to procure the ingredients. The strawberries were the easiest - they grew well in the greenhouses. The hardest was the milk. He couldn’t find cows or goats, so he had to use the closest substitute - milk from the wild Yak-Sul. Yak-Sul were aggressive creatures, but their milk was a delicacy sought after by the rich and famous. Boy, that bottle of milk was expensive. Oh, and he had to get eggs from the Giant Penguins. One egg was enough, really. He had to crack it on the floor for fear of destroying the table with its large weight.

As he passed each cell, the guards would stiffen and inch away, while those Frigian prisoners would cower in the furthest corner.

At last, he reached the human's cell.

""That must be hard for you."" The human said as Zatch-Sul wheeled in the tub, after the guard let him in and immediately slammed the door shut, too scared by the cold.

""Yes it was."" 

""I didn't really expect you to produce a real tub."" The human strode up close, putting his bare hands on the plastic structure. ""Back where I'm from, a tub just meant a small box, not a.....a bathtub."" He looked up. ""Thank you, chef.""

""I'm not the chef."" Zatch-Sul's face reddened again, though this time in pride. ""I'm merely the apprentice. Chef Cap-Sul didn't want to cook cold dishes, so....""

""So you took it upon yourself. Even though you knew that the meal was nothing but a gesture of goodwill, to men who were already dead.""

""The meal is a gesture of goodwill, that is why I do what I do.""

Zatch-Sul knocked on the door, for the guard to let him out. He noted that the human graciously waited for him to leave before opening the lid.

After the door was shut, he heard the human start slurping up the food. He opened the small little latch at his face-level, to find him looking at him with a smile on his face.

The chef scratched his head, his multi-faceted eyes scanning the page.

""*Galipts* tsorb.""

The sous-chef twitched nervously. Chef... was not one to curse. In fact, the last time he cursed was when he burned a flaffle, and that was ages ago, and the flaffle had probably deserved it.

The only creature in the room who wasn't showing signs of intense discomfort was the dishwasher. Any time the chef wasn't cooking was time he wasn't making dishes dirty. The dishwasher blinked in interest, his eye on the scrap of paper in the chef's hand - the last meal request of the Human they had captured.

Chef, now scratching even more emphatically, pointed a talon at two of the under-chefs. ""Lide, Seorge, do you know anything of the human food-consumption customs?""

Lide, blanching, shook his enormous head-tuft. ""N-n-no chef! Th-the law-""

Chef coughed, a chilling sound of fury. ""Tsorb the law, and tsorb the idiot who wrote it. I'll burn the sandwich of whoever came up with that mindless law!""

The chef paused, a look of fury mixed with the fear in his eyes. ""Whatever fool decided to write into the undying book that every prisoner was to be granted his request for his last meal... I'll undercook his whole galipts meal!""

The others gasped. Seorge nearly fainted when Chef turned on him. ""You! Anything?""

Seorge ran through a dozen shades of color before settling on a pants-gelling orange. ""According to, er, uh, well, you see...""

Chef leaned closer. ""Out with it, man! This is important!""

Seorge gulped noisily. ""They... they are omnivores, sir! They consume... everything! Plants from the earth, creatures from their habitats, even each other! Sargent Lemsp told me so! They drink fuel, some of it even on fire! They consume the organic, the inorganic - materials - energy - ideas! Everything, chef! *Everything!*""

Half of Seorge's eyes closed in terror, while the others rolled wetly in their sockets. Chef, brooding, ignored the display of fear. Sweat dripped from under his ears, rolling down his smaller front legs. For a moment, he stood there, soundless, then turned with a grunt and stomped out the door, leaving damp footprints on the shimmering floor.

The others went back to their duties, hardly daring to share a whisper between them. The dishwasher, meanwhile, stealthily slid over to the scrap of paper the chef had left behind. On it was written a simple message, translated through half a dozen translators - as it turned out, Human wasn't a well-known language. The uncivilized creatures had at least four languages among them.

After carefully decoding the request. the dishwasher started to giggle. Snorting softly, he dropped the paper, convulsing in helpless laughter. As the others stared, he managed to bleat out a few words:

“I’m not. I’m just saying they were a *real* danger to us.”
	
General gritted his teeth, shook his head. He was very upset. “So what, we’re just supposed to let *scientists* run our army now? We’re just supposed to go to planets and plunge them into ruin for *fun?*”
	
“It is *not* for fun, General, and I suggest you watch your tone.” Commander stared daggers at him now. “Not that you need to know, but we’re conducting this experiment so if *our* leader ever happens to randomly die, we’ll have some idea how people will react.”
	
General’s eyes widened, and he had to take a seat. Twiddling his fingers, he looked down at the ground. “What are you saying?”
	
“You know *exactly* what I’m saying,” Commander said, folding his arms behind his back and walking off. “Our planet is about to undergo a long needed change, General. If you’re not with the cause, I suggest you find your way off this ship. And fast.”

A plain-looking house?!    
A mouse-free house, I'll bet!

""Look, please. Come on. This isn't necessary.""

""Unnecessary, he says!    
Well of course it is to him!

""I have all the permits!"" I started saying, before being cut off by yet another one of them.

""Permits Schmermits,    
I do not want them, no!    
I do not want them near or far;    
I do not want them high or low!""

I'd had enough.

""A law's a law and a law's a law,    
so you can yell at me until all of your throats are raw,    
but shut your maw!    
Because this house is good!

The crowd stood stunned before me.

The mayor, after a long moment, stepped forward and cleared his throat. He then turned and addressed the people assembled before my house.

That this man's alright, actually.""",TadMod

The mayor huffed gruffly
With a look of disdain

""It's too square and unsightly 
And that's putting it lightly
I could go on longer
But I've been telling you nightly

It is time to remodel
I have no time to coddle 
You for your house seems
More ugly every second we dawdle

If you're in need of some help
Why there a no need to tell!
Just look to your neighbors
Like fine Mr. Kelp

His house, tall and skinny, 
Has a tree for a chimney
Which, while not practical
Has an air of whimsy

And dear Mrs Potts
Covered her house in spots!
Isn't that grand?
You don't see that a lot

Houses of sizes big and small
Even a house with only one wall!
Maybe now you'll hear me when I say
Yours is the most boring house of all""

I looked at the mayor
And told him ""that's fair""
For my house WAS quite boring 
And lacking in flair

I went to the store
And got paint for my door
And some odds and ends
No one could ignore

I worked all night and into the day
Made mistakes, learning along the way
And when I finished 
I called the mayor to say...

""Are you happy now that my house fits in?
Now that it is taller and the windows spin?
I used bright colors and shapes 
Just to make you grin""

The mayor looked up with awe
At all the marvellous things he saw
He even momentarily forgot 
To close his jaw

He turned and looked at me from head to toe
As he took his time I was impatient to know
""Mayor, do you like my house?""
He curtly responded ""no.""

Unfortunately, you misheard a lot of lyrics, and sing songs wrong. How well do you fare in this new world?",Boghoss2,"After many months of practicing, I managed to perfect that one song that I always had problems with. It was the most complicated song to get exactly right ever since I landed here in this world. 


Having a little celebration after finishing the song. One of the servants of the manor hastily opens the door to my study. He look desperate and weary, ""My Lord! One the guard came back from the village. He's has news and is wounded."" I quickly grab one of the scrolls that I wrote a song in and headed to the main hall. 


The guard was on the floor bleeding from his gut. Most of his armor was gone, and his face was riddled in small lacerations. I pulled out the scroll, and began to sing, ""It just a full spoon of sugar that lets the medicine go down."" As I spoke the words on the scroll, the parchment disintegrated and formed a golden ether that I placed over the wound. The healed in a rapid pace, comforting the guard. 


The guard looked at me and said, ""The Void Master is here."" The name shook me. The void master was sinister man with no country. It was told that he was the best singer in the land, until his voice was stolen away by the jealousy of other singers. I only though it was a tale of folklore and legends, but there were reports of a man killing singers in the surrounding area. I did not think of it, due to the Band of Bards taking care of it, but it seem they have already fallen. 


Screams and explosions are heard from the city gates, without the permission of the king, I ran to the sounds of terror.


The Void Master, he stood in front burned gates. I confronted him asking him to give up and turn himself in. In his response, he sang a song and a wave of strong heat hit me in such great strength that I slid backwards just a bit. 


He lunged forward in great speed and I quickly pulled out my lyric scroll, and sang, ""STOP, in the name of love!"" It stopped the the void master's leap leading him to crash on the floor. I ran up to do a follow up spell, but out of the blue he threw a weird looking gem that screeched out a noise. The sound was deafening. 


By the time the gem stopped ringing, the void master got back on his feet. I pulled out another scroll and said the lyrics, but nothing happened. Then I realized how he was able to defeat the others. He stopped my powers using that gem. 

""confused?"" The void master says, ""It's a noise canceler. Locking your spells."" he laughs and sang a deep song. A large arm protruded from the ground and socked me in the stomach. In the air, the void master some how he warped next to me and dropped kick me face sending me flying to the ground. Everything, hurt and every song I sang failed. 


A large pressure pushed me down, holding me in place. The void master looked at me and said ""This is what the greatest mage has to offer? What a joke!"" Just when I'm about to lose consciousness. I see one of the kids I knew when I visited a local school. 


*How do you sing that well?*


*Well, everyone can sing, you just have to let it out.*


*I can't sing at all* 


*I can teach you, I can teach you a really simple one*


*But simple is boring*


*Not when everyone knows the song. That's what makes a song powerful. Everyone knows that song because its simple. The simplest things in life can be the most influential.*


*What song is it?*


*Well, it goes like this...*


Slowly blacking out, I heard the voice of that child, 


""A, B, C, D, E, F, G,""


The void master takes notice. Others people hidden away join in. 


""H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P""


The pressure released me, and I could see the Void master frozen. More people started to sing and join in. 


""Q, R, S,""


More and more people join in unison, soon hundreds of people started to sing as well. The sound of hundreds of people rang though the skies quite literally. A large light shined from above. 


""T, U, V,"" 


The light simmered. The void master panicked in his frozen states in pure confusion. 


""W, X,"" 


The light suddenly got larger.


""Y and,""


And in one giant finale, the void master face grew in terror with his eyes fixed on the light.


""Z""


A piercing beam of light crashes down into the earth, with the void master in the middle, hearing the screams of pain. 


""Now I know my A,B,C's next time won't you sing with me."" 


The beam of light ended. With the void master in the center burnt to a crisp.


The towns people ran to me and helped me up, cheering and shouting their own victory. 


To be honest, when I first came to this world, I was always messing up lyrics, but It was this town that got me to sing again. Teaching the children everyday, helping the church sing their gospel, teaching the local bands preform in parties. The town helped me become who I am. I owe them my life, and I will continue to teach people to sing their hearts out. 


The End.

Wait who said that? Why am I walking. Why can I only control my left arm? What did that surgery do to me?

""How are you feeling?""

""Tired, but I feel good that this may have finally stopped the seizures""

What the hell is this??? That's me talking. That's me doing things. But it's.. it's not me..

""Ow, what was that?

I think that's it. The surgery didn't just separate my hemispheres... It separated.. ME. Does this mean I'm trapped like this forever? Stuck inside this mind unable to communicate? Like a passenger along for the ride? I can't take this. I have to put an end to this.

""Alright we're home. What do you say I make you something to eat and you get some rest. It's been quite a day for you.""

How can I get out of this body. I can't spend the rest of my life like this. I'd rather die. THAT'S IT! I'll kill us. Does that make this a murder or a suicide? Are we two people now?

""No thanks. I'm still a bit queasy from the anesthesia""

Oh a knife. That would make a perfect weapon. I can't do it here in front of her. I'll have to just take it and wait until he's alone.

""Stop that""

""Honey?""

""Oh, my hand is acting up again. I'm sure it's just a side effect of the surgery. It'll probably go away on its own.""

""Well we should make an appointment with the doctor anyway just to have it looked at.""

Damn I have to be more sneaky next time.

""Well that was a good meal. I'm gonna take a nap. I'm exhausted. ""

""Ok sweetie.""

Perfect there's a small knife, I'll grab it right as he leans in for a kiss.

"[WP] In the not-too-distant future, rudeness is omnipresent in daily life. You're a member of a resistance group trying to get people to be nice again.",Ethanlac,"No one really remembered how it exactly started. They had some vague notions but it was simply considered too polite to answer or remember anything. So people simply forgot. Beauty hadn’t been outlawed yet but it had been long frowned upon. At first, it was laughed at as something vogue or a fad that would pass, but instead grew into something even lawmakers started to pass laws towards. Being polite was in no one's best interest. What was more polite than being beautiful? What was more polite than being alive? So beauty came to be something people actively sought to destroy, not only by self-mutilating themselves, but self-mutilating others. 


Manny had grew up modest in wealth so he was already considered one of the polite ones. He also was cursed with a fair complexion, good health, intelligence, and teeth so white one could assume nothing ugly could live in his mouth. Manny had not the money like so many others to have his teeth pulled or dented or to install cavities or to wear braces to bend and twist them inside his mouth. He was looked at as having a polite and beautiful face and so it was hard for him to find romantic interest or even friends because people would often laugh at him or make fun of his perfectly white teeth and his beautiful features. Mostly, Manny found himself getting beat up and called names like … handsome, nice looking, or the worst of them all … intelligent. Anything considered rude was considered good. People would pay thousands of dollars to have their teeth look as cracked and filthy as possible. They would spend countless hours avoiding any type of stimulation of the mind and instead acted on impulse. They cheered ritual and suicide. They outlawed life and were quick to murder anyone that had something pleasant to say.


Suffering was their god and it hated anything beautiful.


Manny found himself alone. 


Often he tried to hide his teeth from the girls he tried dating. Sometimes he used makeup to give the illusion that he had scars on his face and had even wore an eye patch and bragged about cutting his eye out. But, Manny was usually exposed and beat up. Even landing in jail at one point for fraud and acts of kindness unbecoming of proper citizens. Manny didn’t have the luxury of wealth to become addicted to drugs or alcohol or cigarettes. Since these items were considered rude they were expensive and seen as ugly (which was sexy) to be drunk or high or litter trash across the roads. At one point, suicide booths were set up across grocery stores everywhere, it was considered too nice to not at least attempt to kill yourself once. 


Bots and cameras were placed everywhere to find people with perfect symmetrical faces and an alarm would be raised as men and women with clubs would come out and beat the beauty out of the person that was polite enough to show their stupid, beautiful faces in public. Intelligence was the mark of good health and often men would pay doctors to have flakes of mercury drilled into their skulls or pay for a lobotomy. Men and women would grunt at each other in bars while laughing with rotting teeth and sometimes the men marked their women by urinating on them. The girls thought this was very sweet and acted accordingly to custom. Manny stared longingly at the vials and syringes at the local markets filled with Herpes, AIDS, Hepatitis C, syphilis. Giant needles filled with diseases to give your partner. It was only the rude thing to do to someone you loved. Manny often daydreamed about giving someone he loved one of these disease. Sharing in the pleasures of diseases was something only the greatest of romantics in the day thought to give to those they cherished the most. Manny silently wished he had AIDS too. Manny smiled at the cynicism of rotting with leprosy. He often dreamed of being nothing but a ball of maggots and filth and plastic and slime and flesh moving like a worm on the ground. Oh, Manny thought, he would definitely get laid then. But, Manny was a dreamer, and if the world hated and despised anything it was dreamers. Dreamers saw the aesthetics of nature. They pondered the mysteries of universe and man. The world simply didn’t understand these kinds. They worshiped money and greed. They desired nihilism over empathy. They made fun of other countries and beat the poor. Their gods demanded cult and sacrifice, rich men were statuses to be emulated, they wanted death and ultra-patriotism, they did not want a better world because being cruel was easier, satisfying, beautiful, simple. Manny was not meant for the world he was born into. His hands, his flesh, his face, his eyes, they were too much, too normal, not enough. The world looked upon Manny and dreams of cannibalism came over it.



Manny usually never left his house without covering his face. If people saw him with a mask they assumed the worst … either he was pretty or being polite by covering his beautiful face. So, he was beaten regardless of whatever he attempted. This was how Manny had found a group of his first friends. It was a small group. A group made up of people like Manny who didn’t have the money or resources to be ugly or stupid. They hid often and talked about resisting and trying to convince lawmakers that being nice and kind was in everyone's best interest. Manny learned fast though that they usually just talked and complained. No one had an interest in changing the world, they were simply bitter that they had been born beautiful and didn’t fit in. Manny had his first crush in the group. She was the only girl in the group and had a complexion like his own and her teeth were just as white. Manny was devastated when she left the group and later saw her with half her teeth pulled out and a huge nasty scar across her face laughing while a man urinated on her. Manny had enough.


That night, he went to the nearest bar. He was determined to be himself and have people accept him for what he was and not for what he looked like. He walked up to the first woman he saw after a few drinks and introduced himself. One of her eyebrows were missing, cavities ripped holes into her teeth, an eye patch hid a nasty scar that went down her face, infected stitches pulsing with puss and ooze beat with the rhythm of her heart. Manny bought her a drink. Manny smiled. If he wasn't drunk, he might have seen the knife in her hand. The knife that slid across his throat and dropped him to the floor. Manny grabbed his throat with both hands, choking and gasping on his own blood. 


He heard the bar sing with amusement: Fuck beauty! Fuck beauty! Fuck beauty.


Laughter was the last sound Manny heard.


Afterwards, the bar all scattered to the sounds of explosions outside. They all gaped out at the night sky as one bomb after another dropped across the world. Fires rushed through all things and life. They did not know it but the leaders of the world had decided that civilization was just too damn polite and should be destroyed. I mean, that was the rude thing to do. So the people stood outside. They cared nothing for the stars, the moon, the beauty of existence. They grabbed each other's hands and smiled as the flames rushed through them. 


Some of them excited at the thought of how vogue it would look to be crippled or burned.

He asked if I wanted to take his picture after briefing me on his assignment, although the details are unfortunately classified as you have to pay $20 to find out. Best $20 I've ever spent. 
I complimented him on his hair and went on my way. It looked pretty banging. I finished putting my groceries on the conveyor belt only to slowly and begrudgingly realize that was the only money I had brought with me. I looked up at the cashier as he gave me that apathetic ""are you kidding me"" look. It's defnitely not the first time this has happened so I guess I deserved it. I looked back down at my wallet not believing how stupid I was. I looked back up but then looked back at it so quickly I almost got whiplash. I opened it and there it was. A crisp, meadow green $100 bill right there. I was so happy I almost cried. Then I thought ""But wait, this isn't mine... How'd I get this?"" And as I looked up puzzled there he was standing outside the store with a beam of light shining directly on his fanny pack. A gust of wind blew inside the store and I knew I had stumbled across someone or something too pure for this world. Thank you Fanny Pack Jesus, I will never forget you.",-Knightwing-

It doesn't really matter who launched the first bomb. Or the second. Or the third. All that mattered was that they were all dead.

""Does your kingdom have these buildings?"" The king laughed, gesturing towards sets of blackened towers, many of which had now eroded and turned to rubble.

""No.""

""No, your highness!"" The king growled, smile fading. ""And the Book is a written record of our history, all the way back to King Saren. His writings are especially fascinating. I try to act in accordance to his actions and teachings. It is said that his grandfather brought mankind into existence, ah but it was King Saren who led us. Much is written of his great deeds and great powers.""

""He sounds like a great leader.""

""He was the greatest. But his truest teaching is that one must protect his people, by any means necessary.""

The king smiled as he swung his spear, slicing through the emissary's neck. A flick of the wrist and the foreigner's guards were unarmed. Another flick and they were both dead. The king strode out of the room and into the sandy courtyard, where his warriors were already armed and in formation. Ah yes, his people truly were the greatest of all people. As their king it was his duty to protect and protect he would.

""Come brothers, we march onwards to face the enemy! They will be fierce, but we will be fiercer. "" The king cried. ""Just like our forefathers we will slaughter them all. We fight for humanity! To protect humanity! And we will not leave anyone standing!""


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The president groaned, racking his brain. There had to be another solution. Something else that he could do. But the more he thought, the more he realized there was no other option. The food was running out and mass starvation would be inevitable. Chaos would run rampant in the streets, and humanity's last bastion would fall. His advisers all echoed the same thing over and over again, the words rang in his head, until it threatened to drown him. And then it did. And he wept. It was all he could do at this point. It was all he could do to save humanity, and in the end that was all that matters.

He walked out into the hangar, where his soldiers stood in formation, armed and ready for the unthinkable.

""Begin the purge. You have received your instructions."" President Saren said, voice wavering. ""We need to protect humanity, that is our only job. Even if it means most won't be left standing. I am sorry. I am truly sorry.""

[IP] Name of the Wind,Maisie-K,"I'll miss the rain the most. I'll miss its smell, and how it changed from the forest floor to the mountain peaks but still smelled like rain. I'll miss its sound, tapping against the roof of my cave, striking softly against my scales, and rolling to the ground. The world was at peace when it rained. Hard lines softened and the scorching sun hid its face. No matter how high I flew, I could never escape it. It took us all in its embrace, from the tallest of trees to the mightiest of beasts. 

I am not long for this world, and others have sensed this. It does not bother me much anymore. All must bow before time. Men who've fled the land have begun to return, armed with bows and arrows. The other creatures of the forest, who once cowered before my roar, have begun to encroach on the edges of my territory. But they remain cautious and leave my cave well alone. None see how clouded my eyes have become. How brittle my bones have grown. I spend my days in deep slumber, and prey on the old or sick when my hunger becomes unbearable. 

Should any breach my inner chamber, I no longer have the strength to put up a fight. Every day, I sleep a little longer. But I'm not ready to go just yet. 

I've moved into a smaller mountain, deep in an abandoned cave. Here, I will not be found. I'd rather the humans not desecrate what's left of my body. Here, I will rest, and no longer hunt. Soon, the pains of starvation will fade. Soon, my eyes will close, never to open again. But before then, I'd just like it to rain one last time.

I woke up that day, getting up with a smile on my face, and a spring in my step. I asked my House™ to make me some breakfast. I then sat down and enjoyed a cup of Nutridrink™, the warm flavor of algae stinged my tounge, so I poured some stevia, at the cost of tasting way too sweet. After I got ready, I left my House™ and got into my Smart Car.

After a few minutes, it got me to my workplace, and I started working. My job was to check for gravitational anomolies in Mini planets, and to fix them. Since a lot of Mini planets house government files, my job payed me well, until I found *it*. My machine found gravitational waves, and was going towards them. The problem was that it was going towards the sky, high above any Mini planets. I didn't understand until my vehicle got 2 light minutes away from the sun.

The sun was sending out gravity waves. They got sent out in a pattern, then the translation option opened up on my vehicle, I pressed it. The message it translated was as follows; ""SEND NUDES"".

I need your help.""",Preguisa,"My hair stood on end with a prickle as the temperature in my apartment dropped rapidly. It became a cold that pierced straight to your core and came with the taste of metal on the air. 

I did not turn around to see the portal of agitated darkness seeping from my front door. I did not have to to know that it would be there. And after five years of silence, there could be only one reason they would come to me now.

“So what will it be it?” I asked, staring at my small bank of security cameras. “I don’t see anyone coming to kill me  … then again, no one ever see’s me coming either."" A dark laugh slipped through my lips before an idea struck me. ""Or is it ... is the cancer back?"" 

“What? No, Bailey, it’s not your time yet,” her voice was like silk being run over a nail. “I need your help.”

My paralysis left me in a sudden blaze and I spun around, rising from my chair to stand face to face with Death.

“You need my help?” I scoffed. “You left me.”

“I know, Bailey and I’m sorry,” she stepped towards me, stretching out her hands to take mine.

I took three quick steps away and sharply placed my hands behind my back I as attempted to glower at them with all the force a mortal could bring to bare on such a being. I forced venom into my voice as I spat, “You don’t get to come back here and ask for favors.”

“I’m sorry,” Death repeated, looking hurt. “But that doesn’t matter now - this is urgent and -” I cut her off.

“There is only one thing you could be here for. And five years ago, it was all ‘upsetting the balance of death’ and ‘against the natural order!’ But now you want to hire me?”

“Well technically I can’t hire you because I can’t affect any currency in this…nevermind. Yes, I want to hire you. And Bailey, it is extremely important that you help me.”

I fell back into my chair and glared at her for a long, silent time, but she always was more patient than me.

The door creaks open as I pour myself another glass, neat. I raise it up without looking.

""My time is it?"" I drain the glass, pouring another, ""I could feel the goddamned thing in my head, figured it was getting close.""

The footsteps are almost silent as they cross the burned out floor, she always had a light step. She pulls out a stool and slides onto it, tugging herself forward to the bar. She motions for a glass.

I pour.

We sit in silence and drink. Soon enough she'll take me where I sent so many others. She carried the dead and I stacked up the count.

""I'm sorry it happened to you,"" she finally speaks. I drain another glass and don't speak. I know it wasn't her fault, death is...impartial. She doesn't control who gets what or when. Just, picks up the pieces after the end.

She turns to me and I don't look up, just pour another glass.

She has never asked for my help. I've never asked for her. We have a deal. She earns my interest, tearing me from the next drink.

She nods.

""For what?""

She sighs, grabbing the bottle and pouring herself another drink.

""David.""

""Yeah dad?""

Richard let loose a sorrowful laugh and fought against the rivers forming in his eyes, ""I need to talk to you about something.""

He saw David's feet scrape back, knowingly, and it broke his heart, ""Is this about you and Mom?""

""Yeah kiddo, it is."" He could feel the soft trickle against his cheeks as his eyes betrayed him.

""Are you getting divorced?"" And in that moment David couldn't stop his thoughts from turning to how perceptive kids were. How you could think that you were treading along as if nothing was wrong and how easily they saw through all that bullshit.

What could he do but answer? ""Yeah.""

""You fuck someone else again.""

""Watch your language David!"" It was an exclamation so prepped and ready that it came out before Richard had a moment to think on it.

David, his face wrenched with a flash of anger, lunged forward and swung wildly with all his might. Richard watched the small hand, clenched, land against his left arm. He didn't move, he understood, he understood all too well.

""No! You don't..."" another swing ""get to tell me what"" and another ""to do!"" a final impact and then he was on his knees, and they were both crying now.

He pulled David close and embraced him despite the muted resistance from his son.

""No, it's not that. It's not anything that I can fix. It's complex.""

Muted, Richard could feel the vibration against his chest, ""It's not! This is your fault!"" the exclamations coming between wracks of sobs, and everytime he could feel David's body shudder. If there was a god he cursed him, he was imperfect, they all were, but his son, his son was good, why'd he have to be cursed with a father like him, why visit this pain on his boy, he didn't deserve this, he deserved a better man than Rich knew he could be.""

""I'm sorry.""

""No, no!"" and David pushed away, out into the chill air of the night again. ""You're not sorry!""

""David, I...""

""I hate you!""

Burned eternal into the mind of both, the moment hung in the midst of an uncaring city, busy to be on it's way.

""I know David, I know.""

Richard looked upwards to the night sky, hoping to see stars, but the vibrance of the city lights drowned out everything, fitting he mused.

""Your mother and I. We're imperfect, I more than her.""

""No, this is you, all you, it's always been you. You don't care about anyone else! You hate us!""

""David you're the only thing..."" but David pushed forward again, swinging lighter, the exhaustion of anger weighing his fists down.

""I hate you."" he tried to sound forceful, tried to impart pain, to impart agony, but the world seemed so cold and heavy now.

He held David in his arms, his son. ""I made a promised myself when I first saw you that I wouldn't be like my father, that I'd never let you go, that I'd always love you. I don't know when I went wrong, when I...became like him.""

David was asleep now, his small body burnt out from the rage, ""You don't ever need to forgive me David, but I'll keep to at least that last part, I'll always love you.""

[IP] Shadows,Syraphia,"It seemed that Christmastime was upon the city. Trees were decorated with lights, and houses met the same treatment. The workers had gone crazy and installed a bright banner in the city’s center labeled ‘WELCOME AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS.’

“Daddy, why are we standing away from the lights?”

The shadow-man sighed and looked at his child. They stood in front of a tree with lights wrapped around it. He then looked up at the people who were walking above them. He clenched his fists. The real people—the shadow-man wanted to be like them. He wanted to walk like they did.

But he knew he couldn’t.

He knelt down. “Son, we must stay away from the lights. They harm us.”

The boy looked down. “But they look pretty. I want to touch them.”

He reached his hand out towards the light—the shadow-man jerked it back. “No, son! Are you deaf? I told you to stay away from them!”

Tears filled in the boy’s eyes. The shadow-man looked around. The people above couldn’t see them, but they could hear them. Acting quickly, the shadow-man pulled a lollipop from his pocket and handed it to the boy. He ate it and smiled.

He looked at the light for a long time after that. All his life, he was taught that the light did harm. It would vaporize a shadow-person if they even laid a finger on it.

But perhaps, the light could be used in a different manner?

The shadow-man extended his hand and touched the light for the first time.

[IP] Royal Hall,Syraphia,"Roan Foulke had a particular opinion about nobility, a sentiment shared often by those who'd been raised outside the chafing yoke of feudalism. Bluebloods had their uses, he admitted, whether it was paying for mercenaries like himself or catching a bullet that would have otherwise killed an honest person. But other than that, they were... 

Expendable. 

The ballroom was a gaudy, gilded thing with painted gold leaf and fine filigree. Genuine beeswax candles glowed in chandeliers overhead, their light reflecting in the dozens of tall mirrors scattered throughout the room. A fireplace large enough to fit a king size bed inside comfortably sat at one end of the space. Only a small fire was currently lit. It was more a gesture than anything else.

Bookcases filled with leather-bound tomes and the faded names of long dead authors nestled the mirrors and corners of the ballroom. Roan eyed one of the books, lifting it off its shelf and flipping to the first page.

*All Quiet on the Western Front.*   
*By Erich Maria Remarque.*        
*1929: First English Edition.*    

Foulke whistled softly. This book was worth a fortune; certainly more than he'd ever see.  

A noise towards the fireplace made him return the book to its place with a wince of guilt, but as he turned he could see that the Major and the Earl were still deep in discussion. A servant had opened a bottle of wine and was pouring a glass for both. The looks on their faces told Foulke that the negotiations had been a success. Good, thought Roan. That meant work, which meant full bellies and warm clothes for the Grenzers and their families.    

""It's a very fine book.""

The voice belong to an older girl, perhaps sixteen or seventeen years of age. She wasn't a servant, her dress far too long and hair too carefully braided for that. The Earl's daughter, Foulke surmised. 

""You've read it?"" he asked. She nodded. 

""Yes. And all the others on that shelf. My family has over a hundred books from Terra's pre-spaceflight era. It's the largest such collection in the Oriente Protectorate."" She gestured further down the bookcase. ""Most of the others are convincing reproductions, done recently in the style of the older ones. My great-great grandfather had this part of the manor built and he wanted a library to rival Monticello. Wherever that is.""

""Terra,"" answered Roan. ""It's always Terra."" 

That itself was a telling fact.  

Almost a thousand years had passed since Man first left his home system, colonizing hundreds upon hundreds of other worlds, and yet Homo sapiens still dwelt in the shadow of its birthplace. Even in the centuries when Terra itself was a quiet, apolitical world, no other planet would ever compare in terms of history or culture or prestige. It was a bitter pill to swallow.

In comparison to that, Foulke's life and that of his young conversationalist were rather meager things. They were less than useless. They were... expendable.

[IP] One more meatball supper for you,Syraphia,"A long time ago she came to the back porch, when I was maybe ten or eleven. I didn't know how old she was and my mom was terrified the first time she saw her. She was sweet though. Almost wolf like with a black mask of fur on her face, making her look like a raccoon.

She would come sit with me in the summer nights while my mom cooked. I would sneak meatballs from the pot when she was busy looking somewhere else. Then we would sit outside and I would bite into mine and drip juice and sauce while she would gently eat hers on the porch. Then she would clean up the sauce drippings with that rough tongue.

Finally, after months of begging my mother caved in. I would snuggle into that fur every night and she became my best friend. I didn't know that my mother knew I was stealing meatballs, she just never told me. Not for years.

It was a summer night and I was finished college, staying at home for the last summer before real life came crashing in. When I had come home she had howled like always but she hadn't jumped around. I could see she was limping. Her black mask was almost entirely gone, replaced with white and gray. She was getting old. Too old.

By the end of the summer she seemed even older.

We sat outside that night and she laid beside me, tucked against me as I rubbed her stomach. My mom came out with a small bowl of meatballs in sauce, setting it down to my left with a smile. She barely lifted her head at the smell, giving a soft whine.

I held one out, dripping sauce and she gently took it, as she always had. Then I fed her another, already more than she had ever had before. Then another.

When the bowl was empty she laid across my lap, nuzzling under my hand and letting out a sigh.

[IP] The dreams we held and let go,Syraphia,"**Part 1** (Great prompt by the way!)

Kenta hadn’t seen a swan in five years, well, not one like this anyway, and yet, there it was, flapping its sharp, folded wings right in front of his nose, little bursts of wind tickling his eyelashes.

&gt;“It… couldn’t—“

He reached out one pale, knobbly finger toward it, unable to stop the quiver that ran down his arm.  As he shook, the bird’s paper beak sliced through his skin just enough that a droplet pooled on its surface. He watched, holding his breath, as the drop fell. 

When it hit the bird, the blood flashed before absorbing, the paper growing so slightly redder. 

Kenta let the breath out and, all at once, felt the stabbing pain in his forefinger, felt the warmth engulf his eyes, felt the fog of memories swarm into his head.

It was her, after all this time. It was her.

He stood, his knees unsure, knocking against the park bench behind him, but before he could even question if this all was real, the bird flitted off, darting between two trees. Kenta had to run to keep up.

+++

The trek was long, taking the two from the park, through the woods, up a hill, and around a bend that Kenta privately worried would never unbend. 

The trees that lined their rocky path were tall and thick, hiding the sun save for a few spotlight bursts. They kept Kenta going.

But now the sun was falling and as the moon rose it didn’t have the strength to sneak through the trees, and it grew darker and more treacherous. The sound of water rushed by and Kenta knew they were coming upon a creek. 

He then stepped upon a large rock that bucked against the arch in his foot. It was smooth and wet and he fell, landing one knee on the offending stone, sending a spark of pain through his bones. He groaned at the ache of it and pushed his tired body back up. He was out of breath, but he had to keep going.

He straightened his back and squinted for the red bird flapping ahead, trying to train his ear past the water, hoping to hear the wind battered by two tiny wings. 

But the water was the too strong, and the light was too dim. He was losing it. It couldn’t be! He would not lose her after looking for so long.

Too tired to see if the coast was clear, he fumbled in his pocket for something. He’d cut a secret hole the brown, wool jacket decades ago. His fingers met cold steel, knowing its engraved finished by heart, for it was an old friend. 

He pulled the thing out: a simple, silver pocket knife, boasting a delicate pattern of vines and morning-glories. He flicked out the knife, browned but still sharp. He stared at it for a moment before making a decision.

Kenta sucked air in as he dug the sharp end into his palm, drawing a trickle of blood that escapes down the curvature of his wrist.

Quickly then, he reached one hand up, palm at the sky and tensed the muscles in his arm. They rippled with power as his head burned in concentration. The red blood flashed for a moment before disappearing, evaporating. 

Then, suddenly, the white light of the moon flared, bursting through the trees with dozens of fingers of light.

More out of breath than ever, Kenta allowed a small smile to pull his cheeks. He pulled an old ace bandage, stained rusty, from his pocket and wrapped it around with perfect, knowing precision. 

Then, up ahead, he saw it, the shining red underneath one light, flickering as the leaves blew. The bird was waiting for him. Somehow it knew — not that he was surprised. 

Kenta jogged to catch up.

+++

Kenta couldn’t run anymore. 

It had grown dark again, though, fortunately, the bend had unbended and they, the man and the bird, could finally raise their heads above the gloomy cover of the trees.

The full moon hovered high above them, lighting their way, the path became more civilized, with bricks instead of rocks, and the cold wind had awoken, covering their tracks.

But in the light Kenta could now see the bird. It was growing pale and tired, the red making way for greying paper. 

They didn’t have much time. Kenta picked up his pace as he prayed. 

&gt;“Please, please be close.”

When the bird finally calmed, its wings beating a soft, pulse-like rhythm, he didn’t know whether it was because they were close or that the paper thing was dying. 

Kenta’s tired eyes darted around. They were in a field maybe, or a garden. A very wealthy one, at that, with sleeping roses and expensive trimming. Beyond the garden was a house, no a mansion. It was elaborately grand, with rich white marble, encased in bronze trimming. A light bloomed from the tippiest-toppiest window — a rounded arch, through which he saw two people dancing. His stomach wrenched as he watched them. The man was fit, the tails of his coat skirting behind him as he spun. The lady as small and slim, her dress billowing and beautiful. It couldn’t be.

He knew whoever owned this place was rich. Too rich.

This wasn’t any kind of place for her, it couldn’t be, not with who she — they — were… could it?

The sinking of his stomach sank further as the bird dipped delicately toward the house. Kenta watched his footfalls, urging them to quiet as he followed closely behind, covered in shadow.

+++

Upon reaching the house, Kenta could now see, despite the late night hour, that the mansion was thriving with raucous life. Even through the impenetrably thick, stone walls he could hear the sounds of music and laughter. 

It was a party. He heard a lady squeal and men laugh uproariously. A drunken party.

He didn’t want to hear it anymore, the whine of the gramophone grating at him. Pitching his anxiety for reasons he couldn’t quite touch.

He wanted the bird to fly them far away from here, and he wanted it now.

But when he looked up at his companion, he saw the little thing had gone bone white during the journey. It continued to flap, leading him around the side of the building, but with every movement, the paper of it strained more, tearing at the seams. 

&gt;“No—!”

He reached for it, but a moment too late. With a final thrust of its wings, the bird ripped itself to shreds, falling, lifeless, into Kenta’s outstretched hands. 

He closed his eyes with a deep sigh. They’d been too slow. He’d lost her again.

But before he could worry himself further, a thin, whining voice drifted out a cracked window.

&gt;“Who’s that?”

Kenta ducked low, out of sight behind the large, gaudy statue of a wide-eyed, roaring lion. His own eyes darted wildly, catching sight of the towheaded lady in the tight lavender dress.

&gt;“Who, darling?”

A fat man stood beside her, squeezed into a too-small suit, frills falling limply at his soft, rounded hands. His hair was dark and cemented to his head with, what Kenta thought looked like syrupy sludge (the same thing, he imagined, the man’s ballooning belly was filled with). The fat man reached one of of his arms around the girl’s frightfully thing middle, pulling her, falling, into him. He smiled at her, purring her in ear.

&gt;“I don’t see anyone.”

Her high voice rattled out her long nose, as she pushed herself away, arms crossed.

&gt;“I swear! I saw him!”

The man chortled as he turned back to the party, brushing off a shoulder pad.

&gt;“I’m afraid you must be mistaken, Madam. In my family’s two hundred years in this home not one soul has arrived uninvited. Unfindable. Impenetrable! I dare say, you wouldn’t be able to find your way here if I had my driver drop you straight back where you came from.”

He tossed a threatening look over one shoulder and the woman cast a last, forlorn look out the window before forcing a giggle out her throat.

&gt;“A trick of the light, maybe. Or too much wine.”

The man laughed heartily, dragging her back into his folds as he pulled her into the party.

&gt;“Or not enough!”

As they disappeared into the throng, Kenta allowed himself to breathe again. That was close, and with his condition, he thought, squeezing his wrapped fist, could hardly allow such things. 

He then waited for the music to swell and the partygoers to get lost in their revelry before pushing himself off of the statue and racing for cover, around the side, while he planned on what to do to get out of this maze of a place.

His legs swore at him for the effort, strained from the work they’d just been forced through. He nearly thought he might collapse and that this, under the light of this horrid, horrid place, with its soft, bootless inhabitants would be the site of his undoing. 

He looked up at the moon for direction, or comfort, or anything, really… that’s when he saw red. Or, more accurately, several of them.
 They were swans. Blood red swans, floating gently on the breeze.

Kenta hadn’t even the moment to gasp as his legs surged back into motion, following their path. The birds, for their part, seemed pleased with this as they encircled him, leading the way",MissHuggerMugger

The birds grew in number as he walked, more and more uncertain of where they’d end up. Still, his hope grew. It had to be her. It just had to be.

They had circumnavigated the house itself, toward the back end, hidden by a cover of vines. Behind them were topiaries of every sort, from animals to people, in great shapes and astounding positions. Kenta snorted at the effort of it, as he passed, eyeing a particular bush, shaped as a pirouetting ballerina with a shake of the head.

Once through the field of shadowy shapes, it seemed, they were lost… until he saw the light.

It was shaded from view by old, unattended to greenery, that had grown high and wild; out of place here.  The moonlight glanced off the top of it. It was rounded and glass — a greenhouse, perhaps.

Upon seeing it, Kenta knew that’s where she’d be, call it fate, or whatever else. All that mattered was that he knew.

His legs became numb with the excitement of it. He began jogging until he reached the place, pushing aside branches with ease as he looked upon it.

It was a greenhouse, or, it appeared to be. Filled with plants, all green. But he was looking for red. Then he found it, dots of it, in the form of dozens of origami birds swirling in great tides around the dome, a few filtering out at a time, slipping between cracks in the glass, and, either disappearing in the wind, or circling around to join his own collection. They followed him toward the girl.

With shaky steps, Kenta approached. The glass was thick and there was only one door. It was quite tall and had been locked several times through. There was no getting in. Thinking quickly, Kenta grasped for a rock on the ground, tossing it at the glass… but it bounced off harmlessly.

Emboldened, he found a larger rock and threw it harder. Still, nothing. Now frustrated, he grabbed a rock, so big it couldn’t be thrown, and pounded it against the glass. But he was too weak and it was too strong and all he wanted was just to finally see—

With a final push, he slammed the boulder against he glass… no effect. But through his haze of desperation, he saw something.

A girl, with long black hair, and a blood red dress, peeked out from her place behind a rose bush. 

He let the rock fall from his hands. 

It was her.

**Will post a part 2 later maybe, but it's time for lunch.**",MissHuggerMugger
[IP] Hatchling,Syraphia,"A snap of the fingers, and the torch burst into flames. The fire was mesmerizing, calming, and encouraging all at once. Shadows danced across the face of the rocks, casting an orange warmth against the turquoise walls of the cave and bathing the large tunnel with light. Zollo loved fire. Fire was everything. A pet to be commanded. A monster to be feared. A lover to be kissed.

Maybe not that last part, Zollo decided. Fire was comforting, but you had to be careful not to get too close. It was insatiable.

It was that insatiability that had guided him here in the first place. The harder a thing was to ignite, the sturdier a flame held. At least, that's how glyphs worked, but it was fire just the same.

Zollo picked up a loose pebble from the ground and etched the glyph onto it with a claw. He had no idea kind of rock was, but even rock was often easy to ignite. Tossing it into the air, he snapped his fingers again.

The stone erupted in the air, and fell to his feet. Within seconds, it began to crack, and once the rock split in half, the glyph faded and the fire died.

These stones burn and die easy, he thought. That was the exact opposite of what he was looking for. The rumors he heard were lies. This was no 'Temple of Ancient Fire', and there was no fireproof relic here. Far from it. A few well placed glyphs and he could have this whole cave engulfed in hours. Maybe minutes, if he found an air shaft. He would show them what real fire was.

But then, he heard something. A soft... flowing? It had to be water.

Zollo let out an involuntary hiss at the notion. To lie about the Temple was one thing, but to send Zollo towards flowing water?

""Blasphemers... Heathens... Scoundrels..."" Zollo muttered, his voice low.

He rounded a corner, and the cave widened, stretching outwards and upwards as it continued on.

Here, it was a veritable cavern. Large enough to build a house in. Or perhaps a Temple... Perhaps there was some grains of truth in the lies he was told.

To one side of the cave was a thick tree, and behind it a stream of water trickled in from above, and a hole in the ceiling directly over the tree gave some hints to the source. The water pooled a little around the tree, and it made something of an island of the flammable blue rocks it stood upon.

Zollo cocked his head. This was no Temple. But it had been too long since he had seen true fire. He would allow himself just this one treat.

Carefully, he dropped rocks above the small stream so that he could safely walk across without getting wet. Still, even with a safe path, he couldn't help but skitter across hastily to get away from the water.

With a hesitant snort he snuffed out the fire on his torch and set it aside, then, crooning in anticipation, he turned his attention to the tree. Zollo trailed his claws against the bark, feeling how sturdy its skin was. ""Yes, yes,"" he hummed. ""This will burn nicely.""

The question was, how many glyphs? Would one suffice? Probably. Wood remained his favorite, even after experimenting for so long. He glanced back to his tail, and it twitched with remembered pain. He still had black patches. But it was worth the effort.

One glyph would do, he thought, but where? Tapping against the bark, he listened for any good sounds. He tapped for some time before finding a good spot near the base, in between two roots.

He carved the fire glyph into the bark. Zollo was so excited, he almost snapped his fingers before he allowed his other hand to finish the glyph.

As always, the glyph ignited immediately. It burned, throbbing slowly as it tasted the bark. It chewed thoughtfully, almost carefully. It seemed hesitant to burn any more. ""Too long, too long,"" he cursed. He drew another glyph. Then another. And another. He set them ablaze immediately, but they didn't burn quickly enough for him. Zollo continued drawing glyphs. More and more. Soon, the tree was littered with glyphs, and the bark started to snap and crack, groaning against the sheer heat.

Zollo scampered away in delighted terror, sprinting across his pebble bridge to reach safety.

By now the tree was roaring, and the inferno scorched the wall of the cave behind it. The turquoise rock started to blacken.

But at that moment, his eyes caught movement at the base of the tree. Not the collapsing of branches or the peeling of bark. Deliberate movement of something else.

Zollo crept up to the stream to get a closer look. A tiny little thing seemed to be rolling around in the flames, seemingly unaffected.

Temple of Ancient Fire, he thought. A fireproof relic inside... Could it be?

He squinted, worried. What should he do? Dare he risk the flames? The answer came immediately. He would never be able to live with himself if he didn't find out what this relic was.

With a quiet whimper, he scurried across the bridge again and dove into the fire. He held his claws out, desperately grasping for the relic. He caught it. Something smooth. A stone? No time to think. He pulled it out as fire licked his claws. Howling in pain, he dropped it immediately.

The egg, already somewhat fractured from the movement inside, shattered against the impact against the stone.

A huge explosion, and Zollo ducked his head. The tree was starting to collapse. It took longer than he had anticipated, but somehow he didn't care so much about that anymore. He scooped up the remains of the thing he had dropped, and hustled to safety.

As soon as he was safely across the trickling stream and a good distance away from the blazing heat of the fire, he inspected his burden.

The little creature had vermillion scales and tiny wings that folded over most of its body. It was hot to the touch, now that Zollo had time to inspect it. What sort of cave tree lays eggs, he wondered.

Was this the fireproof relic? He could test it right now by carving a glyph into it. Part of him wanted to. But the thing was so small it would be hard to draw with such precision. Plus, it was easy to carve into wood and stone. Not so easy on scale. Not that it stopped him from experimenting on himself, but fire was everything.

No, this little bird thing seemed different. He would keep it. Perhaps it could learn the ways of fire like he could.

[IP] Balcony,Syraphia,"""Daddy, I know you're spying on me again,"" said the teen. She hadn't even turned around to know it was him.

He smiled to himself and slid the balcony door open and stepped outside on the balcony with her. ""Yeah, sweetie,"" he admitted with a playful sigh. ""It's me.""

He hunched over the balcony rail beside her and followed her eyes to the city in the distance, and waited.

""Why won't you let me go there?"" she asked.

""Because,"" as he had answered many times before, ""it's not safe, sweetie. I would *love* nothing more than to take you there, but..."" He shook his head. ""It's just not-""

""-safe,"" she filled in for him before rolling her eyes. ""Yeah, yeah,"" she mumbled. ""I know.""

""Besides,"" he continued, still trying to stay up-beat. ""What's wrong with being here anyway? You have a huge room, tons of awesome friends, and I think that boy down the street likes you, too."" He winked. ""What's his name again?""

She sighed. ""You know his name, Dad...""

""Dick?""

""*Richard!*""

""Oh."" He smiled. ""Right. I remember now.""

Normally, this was the part of the routine where she shook her head at him in order to hide the grin that would inevitably be growing on her face. Instead, now, she turned away from him and silently stared at the city with a longing he couldn't understand.

""I miss Mom,"" she whispered. 

And then he understood; but if he were being honest with himself, he had always known. He had hoped, though, that his daughter would've been too young to remember, or that she would eventually have forgotten as she got older.

She spun to face him. ""Is that why you're scared to go back?"" she asked, her voice low and her eyes searching. ""Because of Mom?""

""I always told you the city wasn't safe,"" he replied. ""But I never told you why: memories.""

[IP] The Creature Vanquished,Syraphia,"""Will you look like that someday?"" Derik asked, staring up at the enormous marble statues. 

Beroc didn't turn at the question, instead He continued to scan the crowd of townsfolk as they wandered the square from his bench against the stone wall. ""Like what?""

Derik craned his neck to look back to the statues. ""One of them."" 

Beroc gave a quick glance at the marble figures. ""Oh aye lad. I'll sprout my wings any day now.""

""No I mean the ot-""

""I know whay you meant lad."" He said, with the hint of a smirk crossing his face. ""No. I don't plan on growing horns and hooves any time soon.""

He resumed his scanning of the square again as Derik continued to frown at the figures. 

""But the singers say that any who enter the night lands are doomed to suffer the same fate as Fetmar. Calling down the divine wra-""

""Singers say a lot of horse shit lad. There's worse things that happen to you in the night lands then growing horns."" He was scowling now, ""Look at me lad. Do I look like I'm turning into what's on that stone slab?""

Derik looked at him again. Underneath his hood, he had the an ordinary rough featured face, a pointed beard, but the eyes stood out. Their color was black where another man's would be white, and their inner color was a dull gold.

""I-""

Beroc cut him off before he could speak. ""Traveling the night lands eats away at you lad. You wither away until there's nothing left but a shell that continues to shamble about."" His scowl deepened. ""I've take jobs that took me there lad, and if some strange looking eyes are all I took away from it, then I count myself among the lucky."" He crossed his arms and resumed his search of the crowd.

There was a long silence between them, until Derik coughed awkwardly. ""You've... You've seen it happen?""

""Twice lad.""

""And?"" Derik asked, curious. 

""Its something you wouldn't want to see. You're better imagining they grew horns, hooves, and got killed by some winged asses like up there."" He waved a hand dismissively toward the pedestal.

[IP] Sky Whale,Syraphia,"I don't think I did a good job displaying Alixas pain at the loss of her family and previous way of life, but I'm half-asleep right now. Besides that, it turned out okay. ",oMarethyu
[IP] Sky Whale,Syraphia,"Alixas numbly followed the heavily robed man out of the sky-carriage onto an empty platform protruding from the side of one of the larger towers in Ishitan City. She fantasied about coming here one day, to live among the rich side of their civilization. She made it, but it was a bitter reminder of her fate. In her fantasies, her family was always by her side. No longer. Just....ash remained. 

The splendor of the city fell on unseeing eyes, the bright neon lights and high-tech society losing it's appeal. The wind was light, more of a gentle caress on Alixas' skin than a chilling barrage. The sky was blue, unaffected by the fumes pumped from charcoal engines like in the Basin. Islands floated through the air lazily, carrying estates on their back that ranged in size just like the island they called home. 

A large, dark blue shape drew Alixas eye. It blotted out the sun, it's shadow falling over Alixas and her robed escort. A keening song soared through the air, a song of hope and love. Her escort noticed her attention being drawn, and stood beside her. 

""That's a sky-whale."" He said slowly, like he was speaking to an idiot. Alixas' cheeks flushed in embarrassment. ""Haven't you seen one before?"" He smiled in what he imagined was a kindly manner, but came off condescending. 

Alixas shook her head. ""We don't have them in the Basin."" Just the feral dogs and rats called the Basin home, alongside the Voiceless. Everything unwanted ended up in the Basin eventually. The poor, crippled, and the stupid. The Basin was home to all. 

""They must be able to smell it."" The escort mused, a small chuckle escaping. He wiped his forehead with the arm of his robe. It was a warm day, and his robe was heavy and hot. ""You see them all the time. Just don't feed them. They never leave if you feed them."" 

*Feed them?* Alixas wondered. *How do you find something large enough to feed* that? 

The sky-whale passed by, the warmth of the sun falling on Alixas face once more. She felt sad seeing it go, but she knew she would see it again. After all, she would be spending the rest of her life here. A prisoner, or guest? 

""Are you ready?"" The escort asked. Alixas nodded glumly. ""Come on, then."" He took her hand and led her to the large ornate doors leading into the tower. He struggled to push it open for several seconds, grunting with the effort. More sweat appeared on his brow, and he swore under his breath. 

Alixas grasped the handles, and pulled them open, her defined muscles from the farms in the Basin making it easy. ""I think you pull them."" She said rather unnecessarily. 

The escort straightened up, wiping his forehead again. ""Ah, yes. That would appear to be the case."" He smiled awkwardly. ""Let's go."" He led the way into the tower. 

It took a minute for Alixas' eyes to adjust to the dimmed lighting, but when it did, her jaw nearly dropped. There were chairs worth more than her home in the Basin here! A pang of pain in her heart. Before they discovered her voice, that was. There wasn't anything there but charred remains. Her hands clenched into fists by her sides. 

The escort took several steps before noticing Alixas was no longer by his side. ""It's just a chair."" He called, regarding the beautifully carved wooden chair with a critical eye. ""You've got one in your room, don't worry.""

""I...have a room? To myself?"" Alixas asked, hardly believing her ears. Her hands opened slowly. A room to herself? She didn't have to share it with her siblings? 

""I'd forgotten how odd Basin children were."" The escort muttered under his breath. ""Yeah, you get a room to yourself."" He said audibly to Alixas. ""You'll get to see it after you're introduced to the Council."" 

The pain in her heart didn't disappear, but was diminished for the time being, ready to rise another day and remind her of the crime that brought her here. But for now, it would wait. 

""Take me to the Council, then."" Alixas instructed. Maybe life in Ishitan City wasn't going to be all that bad. After all, it was the Council's laws that killed her family and stole her away to this academy. She couldn't do anything about that. She was little more than a child. She would learn to harness this voice of hers that came at such a cost, and maybe then she would be able to make a change. She needed to heal, needed to prepare. But she wasn't ready for that.

Yet.

[IP] Path of Spawn,Syraphia,"""Ahhh The Mitts! I always love The Mitts! You got any idea why that is?"" Jesse tugged poorly forged chain connected to the slavery collar of some poor, starving chump he was dragging behind him. It was humid outside too, so when that chain snapped taut, some water beadlets flung off it. Wouldn't been a fun water park for a bug, but this situation was the opposite of a water park for Jay, the chump that collar and chain was attached. Jesse tugged again, putting some wrist into it.

""I saaaaid, do you got any idea why I love The Mitts?"" The tone was slow and drawn out like Jay was stupid or something. Jay had one eye squinted shut as he looked up to the two giant steely hands poppin' right out of the earth and over the road. A big boy chain bound the hands together in a slavitudal fashion. Jay wondered if these were built as just hands or like if there was somehow an entire steely person under the ground. A slave to nature as it were. Whoops, gotta cut this musing short. Jay answered begrudgingly. ""No... Why do you love The Mitts?""

Jesse closed his eyes and smiled like a pompous butthole, ""Becaaaauuuse, once you cross under that big boy chain that means you are official my slave under the laws of New Atlantis!"" He wiggled his head back and forth as that last part almost literally rang out of him. Jay wanted to mention how there can't be a New Atlantis if there was never an Old Atlantis or even *an* Atlantis, but he kept his mouth shut because he knew what was good for him. 

It had been a hot minute since Jay was last captured and forced into slavery, but he knew how to get out of it. This wasn't his first rodeo. Although, since rodeos hadn't been around since 3100 or so when the Earf still had cows and bulls and the like, any rodeo would be Jay's first rodeo. This was more a figure of speech that people still understood if it was pretty antiquated. So, why was Jay walking so stiffly? Perhaps how a gingerbread man would? Because he was carrying an EMP bomb between his buttcheeks. A bomb powerful enough to shut down any of these machine and power armor 100 yards (give or take). Haha, and why was he waiting until he was in New Atlantis to set it off? Because Jay new the master slavers would gather around the slave auction and when Jesse goes to perform a butt check, BOOM! He'd set off the bomb and shut down all the robots and powersuits. This would give him time to attack the slave masters of New Atlantis. Wait, hold on, not *just* attack, but KILL! KILL AS MANY AS HE COULD! Heck, some of them might even have pace makers or the pace maker equivalent for other vital organs.

Yeah, it was kind of a suicide mission... but also the only card he had left to play.

""Okay loser, just a feeww moooooore feeeeeeeet and-"" A simultaneous spray of blood and blood gargling gargle snapped Jay out of his suicide scenario playing out in his head. Jesse dropped the chain and clawed at his neck trying to get a half dozen or so hyper powered stabbing mech spiders off of him. Jay's eyes followed the mech silk trail back into the hills to see a real rugged rough and tumble man's man holding a mech spider launching cannon (those are outlawed by the way). That gruff sumbitch whistled super loud, very loud for using just his mouth, and a whole bunch of dudes and ladies came flooding out of the trees screaming like, and I don't want to sound racist, but screaming like crazy people.

Within minutes, Jay found himself in middle of a brawl. Laser whips were slingin' around, electrified stinging goo was shootin' everywhere, and people were gettin' zapped or smashed or stabbed left and right. Jay stayed in one spot shuffling his feet back and forth not knowing where he should run to but keeping his body ready to move like a middle linebacker (ya know, from way back when). A top half of a lady attached to the bottom half of a robohorse galloped over to him and popped off his collar off.

""You're free! Run! Save yourself!"" She said in a horsey/roboty way. She wasn't even half lady. Jay looked around at the carnage. The New Atlantis guys were surprised by the ambush, but it's not like they were losing. Jay did three full 360's. He looked the robohorse lady in the eyes. Then he looked to the rough and tumble man's man who was buzzsawing some cybernetically enhanced slavers. Then he looked at the blinking light on his wristicuffs.

With one smooth squat, Jay unleashed his butt bomb and set it off with the heel his shitty boot. A blew ripple of unexplainableness washed through the battleground and shut down every even slightly robotic thing with in eyesight. The wristicuffs popped off, the robohorse lady fell over, most of the slavers and all of their equipment and vehicles sizzled and snap crackle popped. Most of these rebels, or insurgents (depending on what side of the fence you're on) fell over and died or were immobilized too. The only ones left standing were Jay and the Man's Man.

The Man's Man looked at the devastation in a mix of shock and happiness with a bit of contemplation mixed in there. He gruffed, ""Can you do that again?"" Then he shot a sharp look at Jay. Jay bit his lip, thought about what to say for a second, and then sprinted away as fast as he could.",fudgeman

[IP] Armored,Syraphia,"“Hey Biggs. Throw me the lighter.”

I was using Bigg's lighter because mine had burnt out and nobody else smoked except us two. Sometimes the other guys gave us an earful for “ruining our lungs,” but we were in the Corp. That was already ruining your life, and as far as I know you can't go any lower than rock bottom.

I held out a hand, catching the lighter as Biggs threw it down from the gunners nest. It really was a nice lighter, he had carved into it with his service knife (why they give service knives to the armored corp, now *that's* a real question,) all sorts of crazy doodles and spirals and stuff. He even scrawled a few stirring words: “Balls of Steel.”

We'd been laying about in this field for a little over two hours. After clearing the last town with righteous firepower, it seems like the men at the top were content to leave us lying in the dirt until they needed us. Or maybe they were torn between sending us to another active combat zone, or turning the platoon back to Central to refuel. Our tank was running low already, and it was probably the same for the rest of them.

Still, it was a nice evening. The sun was setting, a cool breeze ran through the air. Hayden was crashed out on the front of the Tank, he wouldn't sleep anywhere else since the ambush. It was actually quiet for once, except for the chatter of other crews, as well as the sound of Twich constantly checking and rechecking his equipment (I mean come on Twitch, we're in a *Tank.* You don't need that many combat knives.)

Oh, and the crows were flying west back to the town we'd just bowled over. They'd learned to follow us, smart little buggers. It seems those flying rats made the connection between twenty tons of rolling death and fresh meat.

Or, on occasions where the situation called for incendiaries, roasted meat.

Wow. I needed that cigarette.

There was a rumbling behind us. As I blew the smoke from my lungs I heard someone shout from the back of the platoon. “Fuel Haulers! Get ready to top up and move out!”

Well, I was hoping to head back to central, but what do I know? The generals want us to move, so we'll move. That's the Corp for you.

“Get up Hayden.” I kicked him in the shoulder, which seemed to do a good enough job at waking him. “The Brass wants us to make more Crow Barbecue.”

“What?”

[IP] Uninvited Guests,Syraphia,"Private Adam walked along the beach, rifle in hand. It was a P-L 3000 with plasma bullets that could penetrate armor made of metal. His furry and small companion, whom he named Fido, walked by his side, his tail wagging. The pair were out on a scouting mission to survey the area. Command had said there was a mysterious crash on the beach.

Adam hoped it wasn’t what he thought it was.

Fido ran ahead and Adam reached out to stop him, but the dog went too far. Adam broke into a jog to catch up and skidded to a halt.

In front of them was a massive, crashed ship. Humanoid beings were walking around in the distance. From what Adam could tell, the persons were in a daze.

Adam holstered his rifle and approached the beings with his hands raised.

“Hello,” he said. “I am Private Adam from the Galactic Peacekeeping Organization. I come in peace.”

One being, who had a tall neck and big eyes and yellow skin, stared at Adam. It walked around him repeatedly and tapped on his chest-plate. It started speaking in a tongue Adam couldn’t understand.

Another being approached, and it too, surveyed Adam. One being walked behind him and noticing the rifle on his back, screamed in alarm.

“No, no, no,” Adam said. “I have it holstered, see? I am not a threat.”

The being drew a small handgun and backed away. Adam sighed and drew his own weapon in response.

"[WP] ""You were supposed to stop me,"" he whispered to the grave before him.",Vercalos,"“You. You and I were supposed to make this world what we wanted. We had it all planned out… you…. you prick”, he muttered over muffled cries. Kevin sat in the graveyard on a beautiful sunny day of his hometown, Skybluff, in which most of the people he cared about throughout his life were already buried. He took a moment to glance around the graveyard and compose himself, as if to not show his weakness to the man buried in front of him, before standing up. As he took the top button of his worn blue blazer, with a noticeable tear leading up through the ride side exposing the inner pattern of the jacket, and pushed it through the button hole, he murmured to the grave before him, “I was supposed to be the one to stop you.” Kevin wiped a final tear from his cheek, turned towards the trail leading out of the graveyard and stumbled out the front gate.

As he exited the front gate, he noticed the rusted iron rods jutting out of the makeshift cement block wall, which clearly showed the rudimentary style and age of the cemetery. Kevin walked down the street, kicking stray rocks that were peppered across the sidewalk with his battered leather dress shoes, playing back his childhood to himself. Memories of Sylas, his lifelong best friend, and him playing tag in the front yard of his parents’ house caused his senses to be flooded with nostalgic feelings. He remembered the earthy of smell of the open yard, the sounds of various insects chirping and buzzing in the summer sun in the nearby fields, and the taste of sweet homemade lemonade his mother would always make to cool down to the two boys during their exhausted breaks. “Those were the days…when we didn’t realize the cruelty of the world” he briefly whispered to himself as he waited for the street light to change so he could cross the street.

Kevin scuffled down the street, now quietly singing the song to himself that played on repeat throughout their adolescent summer nights of cruising down the street looking for trouble. “Now no one’s knocked upon my door, for a thousand years or more” he continued as he took a sharp turn into the first bar he came across. The dimly light bar was empty, as you would expect for a typical Wednesday at 2 pm, and had a pungent smell of urine and alcohol filled the air. He flashed a $20 to the bartender and requested a shot of whiskey and an Old Fashioned to follow. “Keep the change” he murmured as he knocked back the shot to take the edge off. “Welcome to this one man show” he began singing to himself yet again except this time with a chuckle. He looked down at the remaining drink and contemplated what he could have done, whispering, “Just take a seat they’re always free, no surprise no mystery”

Kevin sat down on the nearby barstool and unbuttoned his disaster of a jacket. He teared up a bit, but quickly wiped his face with his sleeve and continued, “in this theater that I call my soul.” As the words left his mouth the salty tears became too much and rolled off his wrinkled face and splashed into the drink. The bartender placed a couple napkins near him and walked away, not wanting to be involved in another man’s sorrows within the dark and empty establishment. “I always play the starring role….so lonely...so lonely.” Kevin grabbed a napkin and dabbed his face. He then threw the used napkin onto the counter and took a big swig of the harsh drink. “I guess I never fully realized just how lonely you really were…” he said as he pulled out his phone and navigated to his pictures. He scrolled past pictures of what seems to be a happy family with the traditional white picket fence, past the “nights out with the boys” pictures, and landed on a picture of a lonely gray tombstone with “Here lies Sylas McKinley Jan. 10th, 1987- Jan. 10th,2017.”

In hopes to somehow forget the sorrow that has plagued him since that day, Kevin navigated to the last voicemail he received from Sylas. He clicked play only to hear a quiet, sad voice, “Hey Kevin, long time talk man… Look I’d really like to see you, man…maybe catch up like the old days when we were chasing women around town? Call me back, please…Oh, it’s Sylas…” Still tearing up he hovered over the option to delete the voicemail but decided he wasn’t ready to fully let go of his best friend just yet.  As Kevin finished his drink, only one thing played in his mind on repeat now...the last conversation he had with Sylas. “I would do anything for you and you know that. You also know that I’m not all there sometimes” he chuckled, “so if I ever start acting weird or yknow getting sad or something you need to be the one to stop me from doing something stupid okay? I love you man” said Sylas. “Yeah man, I’ll be there for you any time to stop you from doing something stupid as usual!” Kevin repeated to himself in the bar as he recalled the lie he told his best friend of 25 years.",TheDistrautFish
"[WP] ""Survival was never my intention.""",Vercalos,"Part 2:

""One more."" The bartender looked at me plainly and without saying anything poured me another whiskey. He slid it towards me and I nodded him thanks. I stared the whiskey down. It was my fourth, or maybe my fifth? It didn't matter. There was too much going through my head after I left the hospital. I knew that I needed a bit of numbing, so I went to the bar. Closest one I could find. I'd never been in here before, but that didn't matter. Alcohol will do the job. Whatever it is and wherever it's drank, it'll do the job. And it was doing its job just fine at the moment. 

I didn't move from that bar stool for at least an hour. All I did was sip my whiskey and stare into the bottom of the glass. I didn't notice anyone around me. The bartender seemed to be the only one to pay attention to my being there at the moment. I heard the stool next to me skid on the floor and next thing I know there's this guy sitting next to me just looking at me smiling.

""What's up buddy?"" His words came out in a slur. ""You don't seem to be having a good time here by yourself. Figured I'd play the good Samaritan and check-in on a fellow human being such as myself."" 

I didn't quite know what to make of the interaction that I was faced with. I could have easily told this guy to fuck off, but something held me back. I just looked at him. He meant no harm and wasn't being nosy just for the sake of it. So, why not? I asked myself. 

""Just lost in my own thoughts I guess.""

""Watcha thinkin' about?""

""War.""

""War?""

""War.""

""Well, what about it?""

""How ugly it is.""

""You think the war over there is ugly?""

""Yes.""

""You don't believe in it?""

I paused. I didn't quite know how to answer him. I searched myself first before speaking.

""I guess I'm not really thinking about whether or not we're in the war for the right reasons.""

""Well, care to explain?""

""Maybe what I'm trying to explore is not the war itself, but how history might remember a war and the people in it.""

""What's brought all this to mind?""

I chuckled slightly and smiled at him. He returned it. ""Lemme tell ya it's been one hell of a day.""

""Why's that?"" 

""You sure you want to hear what I've got to say?""

""Lay it on me."" He smiled reassuringly at me. ""Anyways, the liquor's got us talkin' now and once those wheels get oiled there's no stopping it.""

""Okay. You asked.""

""Shoot.""

""I interviewed a man today. Well, a soldier that is. He'd just gotten shipped home. Lost both his legs over there.""

""Shit. Poor bastard. He must have been one brave man.""

""See, that's what I thought at first. I was actually excited to interview him. I wanted to tell his story. I wanted to share his bravery to the nation. I hoped that I'd be able to tell a triumphant story of sacrifice to our people.""

""But now you're here in a bar drinking away the day. What happened man?""

""What happened? He told the truth.""

""And that was?""

""He went over there hoping to get killed.""

""The guy wanted to die?""

""Yeah.""

""Well wouldn't it have been easier to just kill himself in his own house? No need for all the extra work? I mean, it sucks that he wanted to die, but it just seems impractical to go all that way, you know?""

""Yeah, I know what you mean there. Same thought floated through my head as I was listening to his story.""

""Well, don't let me keep interrupting you. I've gotta hear the whole story now.""

""Alright well, I'll tell it as best I can. So, the guy starts off just like that you know, just started off his story by telling me that he never intended to come back alive. That shit took me by surprise. He joined the war because he was too afraid to kill himself. Said there was no honor in killing oneself. He'd been depressed for a long time. Way before the war even began, but he never could bring himself to end it all. Said that a life ain't worth shit if you can't leave something behind, even if it is just a memory. So, he couldn't kill himself. Killing himself would have left an empty memory of himself behind. Boom. War hits and he sees a good way out. He decides that he's going to enlist and go out fighting the enemy. So the war goes on and the guy is great at what he does. He's great because he's not afraid to die. Goes on all these suicide missions and keeps coming back alive. He wants to die out there, but he isn't going to make it easy for them. He even gets promoted and put in charge of a platoon. Now, this young kid probably no more than 18 gets assigned to his squad. Kid is scared shitless. Figured he'd enlist to make a man out of himself and make daddy proud. Our ""hero"" takes him under his wing and protects him. Even takes a liking to the kid. The kid grows in his eyes and really comes into his own out there. Not quite like our hero of course, but definitely a good story there too. Now, this is where things get bad in the story. The guy tells me that they were out on a patrol when they were ambushed. Couldn't even see the enemy through the brush. Out of nowhere there was just a hail of gunfire and they all had to get down and find cover. So they're all huddled up behind this fallen tree when a grenade lands at their feet. He told me this. He told me that right then and there, he knew it was his moment. His time had come. In the form of that grenade his deliverance was finally upon him. He knew what had to be done. He gets up as fast as he can and rushes for the grenade. He was going to jump on it. Out of nowhere he gets blindsided. The kid saw him jump up to cover the grenade, but couldn't let him do it. The kid punched him as hard as he could and put him back on the ground. Kid jumped on the grenade himself and it blew him to bits. That kid saved his squad and our man with it, but our guy still lost his legs in the blast."" By the time I finished I wasn't even looking at the stranger anymore. I was just staring dead ahead at the bottles that lined the wall of the bar. I took a gulp and finished what was left in my glass. Silence. He didn't speak and neither did I.

""Fuck man."" He was finally able to spit something out. ""I don't even know what to make of that story.""

""I didn't either. That's not really what's got me sour though.""

""What did it then?""

""It's what that man said to me after he was done telling the story.""

""What'd he say?""

""He said it should have been him.""

""Well, of course he feels that way. He probably wishes that he could have saved that kid's life.""

""Lemme finish. He said that it should have been him. Not that he was sad for the kid. He was angry at him. Angry that the kid had taken away his moment. He told me that he wished to all hell that he had just let that kid die in a ditch somewhere out there. He said he should have shot the kid first then ran for the grenade.""

""I - I - Well I guess I just don't know what to say about that."" The stranger threw back the rest of his drink and stared down at the empty glass silently.

""Me neither. I was supposed to be there to write about human courage in the face of adversity. All I did was take off a mask and look into the true face of humanity. I didn't like what I saw.""

""Well, what are you going to do now?""

""Shit, what would you do with a story like this?""

""I don't know and I'm goddamn glad I don't have to be the one to make the decision you're going to have to make. Personally I hope that I wake up tomorrow and forget that you even told me that story. Ignorance is bliss my friend. Story like that just eats away at the soul, you know?"" He put a few bills on the bar top and got up to leave, but before he did he put a hand on my shoulder and looked sorrowfully at me. ""What you do with that story is up to you and I am goddamned sorry that it had to be you."" With that he turned and left. I never got his name.

I settled up with the bartender and left. The sun was just now starting to set. The day had gotten away from me. I looked off into the sky and took in the color. My heart was heavy in my chest. I lifted my hand to my heart and felt a lump in my breast pocket. It was my notebook and recorder. I looked down sadly at the two. I opened the notebook and thumbed through it, looking down at my scrawled handwriting in defeat. What would I do with this story? It destroyed me. Things weren't the same anymore for me. Maybe things would never be the same again. That's when I knew what I had to do. I threw my recorder on the ground and stomped on it. I picked up the pieces and threw them into the nearest garbage can. Then, I took out my lighter and lit the corners of my notebook. Once the flame had spread thoroughly through the pages I tossed it into the garbage as well. 

History is written by people like me. It isn't perfect. Hell, maybe it can't even be trusted, but what I did, I did for my people. They didn't need to know what I did. This would be my burden to bear. I'll carry the weight so that others won't have to. Such is the duty of some poor men throughout the ages. To carry the burden of truth, so that history may forget it one day.

"[WP] ""Survival was never my intention.""",Vercalos,"To the north there is nothing but ice and snow, a cold and lonely death for all who go there. So whatever you do, don't go there. With that in mind, I tell you the story of the decorative city.

Once, long ago, like many generations ago, there was a civilization that lived here. It was a prosperous time, there was peace among the civilians, and they were ruled by a great king who had only one son. The people loved the King and because of that, they loved his son.

One night the young prince was woken in the middle of the night by his father. The king brought his son out to the temple on the hill, and above them the prince saw the most wonderful colorful lights dancing in the night sky. Some citizens had gathered along with the holy men and women, who worshiped the lights. The prince had never seen anything so beautiful. He asked his father what it was, and his father told him, ""this is the Gods blessing us in the night. They watch over our kingdom and help us to guard our people"".

Years passed and the young prince would often stay up late in the night, only to be disappointed when most nights passed without a single blessing from the gods. The King grew sick, and the young prince cursed his fate and asked why the gods wouldn't take pity on him.

One holy man, a learned man, told the boy that the lights might be more common further to the north. The boy began to adventure further and further north. He began to establish a regular route, with stops along the way. He took no wife, and left the King's responsibilities to his advisers, spending all of his time, and far too many of the kingdom's resources on these adventures.

Finally he got to a place where the north star shone directly above the ground, a place where the light seemed to shine the most often, the most steadily. He brought the third best builder in the kingdom to this place, as the two better builders refused to come, and began building a great ice-castle. As the castle was built. When shelter enough was made, the prince brought his father there. His father could no longer speak, but stared blankly up at the lights in the sky, dancing before him.

As the ice-castle grew, the kingdom fell ten times as quickly. Never since then has there been such a great kingdom. Never since then has someone found the ice-castle and returned to tell of it. Some say it's been blown over or snowed over. I like to think it still stands, with a big sign by the prince's feet that just reads ""survival was never my intention"".

"[WP] ""Survival was never my intention.""",Vercalos,"Part 1:

""So tell me, what got you through it all? Why are you still alive, here, today? Tell me, what got you through the war?"" I decided to get straight to the point of my questioning with the man before me. He lay in his hospital bed hooked up to the machinery staring down the clock on the wall. The man was an injured war hero. He had been showered in medals and awards for the bravery that he showed on the battlefield. Now, he was back home in a hospital after losing both of his legs in the field. 

I leaped at the opportunity to cover this story. The country needed this story. It was meant to be a cry of courage and perseverance to the people. Morale had been dipping lower and lower in the people as the war dragged on endlessly. People were losing hope. They needed a reason to find their fighting spirit again. My boss and I believed that at least. And so, here I was, interviewing this courageous man.

I waited for his response, but he didn't speak. I gave him a few more moments to collect his thoughts. I figured he had so much to sift through and so much to tell. Perhaps he had so many amazing war stories that he just couldn't decide which exciting story to tell me. After sitting in silence a bit longer I decided to try repeat the question. He cut me off halfway through.

""I heard you. No need to repeat the question here.""

""Okay. So, what can you share with me?"" 

He sighed deeply. I noticed a change in his eyes. They seemed to be inattentive at first - distant. It was only for a moment, but there was a wave of sadness that washed over those blue eyes. It seemed to make him look younger, if only for just a moment.

""What are you even here for kid? To just collect more war stories? What's the point of it all?""

""Well, I'm here to tell your story. I'm here to share your story with others. To share your bravery with others.""

""I guess I'd say the point of this piece is to light a fire in other people. We want to give the people hope. We want to show everyone that there are brave young men out there fighting for what is right!""

""Kid, if only you knew what it was really like over there. I'm sure you've seen photos, but lemme tell ya. It ain't nothing like you could imagine. Not through photos and not through film.""

""Don't disrupt me kid. You wanted to hear my story so just sit there with your little notepad and listen, okay?"" I nodded in affirmation.

""Like hell I do,"" I spat.  ""I paid back my debt years ago.""

My voice crackled through the forest like static, breaking up the glamour that lay over the world like a oil slick.  But the faerie just laughed, and the glamour slowly reformed.

""You have done good, Rachel Gray.  But your debt is not a small one, to be repaid with an unlocked door.  Truly, a debt as great as yours could never be repaid.""

I grit my teeth, driving fingernails into my palm.  ""If I can never repay it, then why even bother trying?""  I asked.  ""I could just ignore your requests, and be no less indebted than I was before.""

A finger stroked my neck.  I whipped my head around, but there was nothing there.  No sign of the fae, no break in the glamor.  Just more forest, shimmering like the surface of a lake.

""Because if you don't do as we say,"" the voice whispered into my ear.  ""We will take something else that you love.""

"[WP] ""You owe us a favor.""",Vercalos,"We always question ourselves "" How did I get into this?"". This question has been plaguing me since the past 3 years....if only I had waited a few months longer. A soul wouldn't have been lost,a soul wouldn't have been tortured. "" Why do I keep making the bad choices?"". I walked along the desolate road thinking what could have been. 

It all changed with that decision. It changed many a person's fate. They have been touched by the reverberation of this disturbed paradigm. It shortened things which were supposed to be longer. It prolonged things which could have ended faster. I can do nothing but pity for them. I walked along the path meant for the destitute devoid of luck and happiness.

I bring with me lots of sorrow,hate and anger. All this self loathing is going to make me lose myself in this soul sucking abyss. I felt the bag heavy over my shoulder. The contents of the bag seemed laden with the ideas of tomorrow that were abruptly ended. I walked the path never taken before but it's not to be an example for the generations to come.

I reached my destination and I recognised the familiar voice ask me "" Did you get what we need?"". I let out a sigh of guilt "" I can't do this anymore "". I reached around inside the bag. It was cold. Colder than death's dark embrace.  I picked it up and threw it across the floor.

The figure came into light and so did it's conniving eyes and malicious stare. It picked up its end of the bargain. "" Remember Kaladin. You Owe us a favour"". The thing retreated back into its dungeon. As I looked at my bag. It's still heavy with death and despair. 3 pairs of dead eyes stared at me from the bag. I still have to deliver 3 heads .

"[WP] ""You owe us a favor.""",Vercalos,"A hideous blot laid in the bowl of the pipe.  It sat, immobile and sticky, as if it weighed tons -- and sure it did.  It tainted this man's life -- led him by the hand down dark alleys to throw out friends in exchange for sordid refuse.  He sat in his room, his foot twitching.  It was clear: He was a miser, sacrificing all for very little.  His pallid flesh leaked tiny droplets on his forehead.  He wiped and exhaled.  He poured fire into the pipe.  He began with one insidious inhale followed by one sumptuous exhale.  The world stopped.  A sense of pure safety denuded him of his troubles as only a feeling of weightlessness could.  He sat there, floating.  Twisting and tumbling over himself, his sheets lifted off his bed -- an immaculate material.  His newborn body cast a majestic effulgence.  ""Crown me king and I will treat you with such sweetness grandma's custard tarts will turn bland!""  He joyously roared.  His smile grew dimples.  The King was on his throne again.

His royal subjects danced and weaved, celebrating their majesty's return.  Time was measured in glasses of wine and there were aplenty.  Turkey legs and boar heads decorated the tables.  They even had haddock -- Haddock!  Rich, purple wine escaped from their lips when they smiled.  Drip, drip drip -- and what smiles!  Drip, drip, drip -- quite the turnout!  Drip, drip, drip, drip.  His subjects stared at the king, their clothes stained red.  Crimson liquid leaked from their faces forming small pools by their feet.  The great hall smelled of iron.
""This is a great party, isn't it?""  A pretty blonde with her lower curls wetted red had said.  ""Look at all we have done for you.""  The gathered crowd mused in agreement.

"[WP] ""You owe us a favor.""",Vercalos,"'You owe us a favor,' the skull-wearing man said as I strangled him against the wall. 'We had a deal, remember?'

'How did you get into my house?' I asked him, holding the axe to his throat.

'We bought it for you,' he said in a voice that only said, ""Are you *kidding* me?"" 'We set up the fake identity, the fake service record to justify your skills, even your driver's license. For god's sake, Jack... I *taught* you to drive.'

'And I changed the locks,' I said before releasing him. 'Whatever the hell you want me to do, it doesn't justify breaking in here.'

'Actually, it does,' Skulls said as he removed the mask and set it on the table. 'I fucked up. I was snooping around a system belonging to criminals dealing in drug trafficking and I... underestimated their IT guys. They wiped the system and the only lead I had. That's why we need to pull off a sting.'

'Hold on,' I said as I pulled the bottle of whiskey out from the desk of my basement. 'Since when did DedSec start going after drugs? Aren't most of you guys on something?'

'Weed, shrooms and some medication normally prescribed to ADHD sufferers,' Skulls said matter-of-factly as I offered him a cup which he accepted. 'These guys are dealing in Steel.'

'Steel?' I asked.

'New kind of anabolic steroid,' Skulls explained. 'Used to be called Warrior's Blood.'

I cringed when he said it. I had a rather... bad history with that drug. Snatched off the streets of New York as a kid, locked up by a rich madman and raised - conditioned - as a gladiator. Even now, with the extensive facial reconstruction, there was no way to hide the effects it had on me.

'Look,' Skulls said as he leaned on my Harley. 'The batch they're selling is tainted. It makes those who take it far stronger than a baseline human but also causes *severe* psychosis. We've helped the cops detain those going through episodes but we're just computer nerds... We need to go for the source!'

'Then what do you want me to do?' I asked. 'Fight my way through an underground tournament? Hunt down then butcher the ringleader? Because I can clearly do that.'

Skulls sighed as he downed his drink. He pulled out a sheet of paper, already worn by being folded numerous times and with the water damage and the rainstorm earlier I knew he was fearful of my reaction even from this morning, the only time it was raining today up in Seattle.

I looked at the sheet for only a few seconds then slammed it onto the seat of the motorbike I was working on. 'No.'

'You're the only one we know who can do this,' Skulls said in a weary voice.

'**No!**'

'You can easily do this.'

'*No!*'

'Look, while it is perfectly in line for DedSec to do stupid shit like this all the time to humiliate each other and people who piss us off,' Skulls said, 'but people's lives are depending on us. And you.'

'I have done many terrible things in my life,' I yelled. 'I am perfectly fine with murder and wanton destruction but I am not doing...'

I angrily point at the sheet currently defiling my basement garage, completely lost for words. This is a new sensation for me so even Skulls was stepping back in fear.

'...THAT!'

Skulls just set the mug down and sighed while I stormed off into a corner. I wasn't drinking from the cup anymore, I was downing straight from the bottle.

'It mentions a mystery prize,' Skulls explained. 'DedSec hacked in and found out what it was. It's a 2018 Road Glide Special and $50,000.'

That caused me to turn around in surprise. 'A... 2018?' I asked in shock. 'No. There's no way.'

'They're announcing it at that event,' I said. 'So, why not try and nab the first in the new line of Harley Davidson motorcycles?'

---

I was glaring at Skulls while standing backstage at the competition, glaring throughout after I came off the stage. 'I still have no idea why you talked me into entering a bodybuilding competition,' I groaned as I downed the protein shake. 'And this tastes like pure shit. Why do I have to drink this?'

'C'mon,' Skulls said with a smile. 'You're killing it! And... sorry about the shake. You have to be in-character. Dude, you should totally get a pro-card. Your body is so conditioned that you can trounce everyone and you don't even need to work out!'

'Keep in mind that I'm trying to keep a low profile,' I said to him. 'What if Gordain...'

'We can handle him,' Skulls said to reassure me.

Looking over his shoulder I saw one particular competitor walk through the crowd that parted for him. He was definitely larger than most here and getting quite a few looks around...

'Shit, that's the target approaching,' Skulls said. 'Just remember the cover story.'

The brute walked over to me and sized me up. With a mere glance I can tell that I'm about two inches taller and fifty, maybe seventy pounds on this guy. Don't know if he thinks he can take me or not, but with my current mood I'm all for it.

'You the rookie everyone's talking about?' he asked me. 'Don't get hulks your size at invitationals. What's your juice?'

'What juice?' I asked.

'Smart one,' he said with a smile. Then he looked at Skulls. 'Who's the runt?'

'He's my kid,' I said as I swallowed more of the protein shake. Fighting really hard to not curl my face in disgust... 'And in case you're wandering, I've only worked out for my own benefit. But when the rumors about that prize started spreading...'

'What rumors?' the guy asked.

And then Skulls pulled in to save the day... or at least to save me from blowing my cover. 'Someone backstage leaked on Reddit that Harley Davidson was giving away one of their newest bikes here as the first prize,' he said with a grin.

'A Harley?' he asked. 'Well, I'm not a bike fan but *damn*, that's a good name.'

'So, what about you?' I asked. 'You got a good supplement?'

'I might,' he said with a devillish grin, 'if you're willing to meet me later I can hook you up.'

'Might be a good use of the prize money,' I said. 'Looks like they've made a decision...'

'Shit,' the guy said. 'I need my bitches to bronze me up for the finale. Meet me in the lobby at 8?'

The guy walked away quickly as I took a quick nip of whiskey that I had hidden away. 'That's Castenellos?' I asked Skulls. 'Who calls women ""Bitches""?'

'Drug dealers and pimps,' Skulls said. 'Both apply to him. Meet him later and get a couple dosages so we can hand them over to the police... and so DedSec can compare them to Warrior's Blood.'",res30stupid
"[WP] ""You owe us a favor.""",Vercalos,"**Day 1 - September 6th, 2023**

If you're reading this, you've discovered my big secret: I'm keeping a diary! Haha, no, just kidding. It's not secret or anything; I'm just incredibly bad at writing a proper introduction.

I thought it would be a good idea to keep a journal, considering all the crazy stuff that's happening. No one is sure of what's going to happen, so just in case something bad happens, I'd like to prepare this to give you some context, though I hope no one will ever have to read past my cringe worthy introduction.

So I better start with the meaty part, the moment where thing started to get crazy. It was only a few weeks back when the SETI Institute found a most mysterious signal. Apparently, the entire message is encrypted in three parts. They were lucky enough to guess the first part of what they thought to be an alien message. It could be validated with the enclosed key, so they were certain the translation was correct. They were also certain it was an extraterrestrial message, and given the content, it was probably sent by an intelligent life form: 

""You owe us a favor.""

That hit the world like a bomb. The craziest theories ran around the world about who could have sent it, about why we would owe anyone from another planet a favor and what they would want from us. However, there are still the undeciphered parts of the message, that can contain answers to these questions. Many countries, space agencies and even big commercial companies have jumped on the opportunity to decipher this message. With this much computing power behind it, it's probably only a matter of days before we've translated the second part.

As I'm a lead developer at Facebook, you know who I'm rooting for!

**Day 3 - September 8th, 2023**

Shit! Sorry, I totally forgot to write something yesterday. I've just been so busy!

At the moment, it seems Amazon is taking the lead. They haven't actually deciphered any specific words yet, but their algorithms have discovered that the second and third part are two probably very short sentences, because the message contains only five more words.

Our own algorithms have been able to narrow down on the number of possibilities of the words that are used, but it still leaves us with thousands of options and like a gazillion combinations, most of which make no sense whatsoever. With a lot of luck, we might be able to decrypt the message, as each part comes with its own key. If we guess the meaning correctly, we will be able to verify.

I have this crazy theory, though. Amazon, Google and Microsoft may have the hardware advantage over Facebook, but we have access to over 400 million biological computers that are already programmed to process language. Perhaps together, they will be able to out-compute our competitors!

**Day 4 - September 9th, 2023**

Holy shit! It actually worked. Today, a few colleagues and I wrote a script that would suggest possible solutions to our users, which they could then reorder and provide feedback. The suggestions went viral within minutes. Within a few hours, the millions that had joined in had already deciphered the second part. The message now read:

""You owe us a favor. We made you;...""

Whoever sent the message is admirably efficient with their word usage. I'd never seen such a powerful message in such few words. With three more words, they'd convinced us why we owed them a favor.

It was not long before we'd decrypted the last part. Whereas the second part answered the 'why' behind the message, the third part clarified what they wanted and it also hinted a little at who they are:

""You owe us a favor. We made you; send beer.""

"[WP] You decided to summon a demon to aide you in life, you just weren't expecting the ghost of Karl Marx to possess your cat.",Zaareish,"""As I have famously said, from each according to his own abilities, to each according to his needs."" mewed Karla quite solemnly. 

There he goes again groaned Anita as she tried her best to ignore the talking cat pawing at her side. Life had been difficult for her ever since she had lost her job a few months ago. Desperate and bored she had turned to the ancient book of dark arts that she had inherited from her grandmother. A dense, weathered book filled with Latin, she had thought nothing more of it than a curious heirloom. Acutely bored from her lack of employment and an absent social life, she had taken to translating the book in order to keep herself occupied. Her translation had led her to discover a purported summoner's spell with a charming little tagline.

*When all seems lost, let darkness illuminate your path...*  

Anita didn't really expect much when she uttered the phrases as the book dictated. However, that this little experiment would end up with her cat being possessed by the ghost of Karl Marx was an outcome she could not have anticipated in her wildest dreams.  

"" Seriously, we are all out of kibble, time to make a little trip to the pet store, lets go, **now**"" Karla growled with increased frustration as Anita refused to budge.

""Just who do you think you are protracting your claws at you spoiled little brat? I swear I have been spending more on feeding you than I have been on feeding myself ever since your wretched soul has possessed my sweet little Karla!"" exclaimed Anita as she finally gave in and started readying up to go out. Karl Marx did not like it one bit when Anita addressed her cat as Karla but that had been her name since long before he had come to possess the little tabby cat and as Anita had pointed out to him, calling her female cat Karl just felt too awkward to get used to.

""I did not cross the ethereal dimensions and come back into this world to inhabit an impoverished vessel and it is your duty as my human to feed me as required. Like I said, from each according to his own abilities, to each according to his needs. You have the ability to obtain kibble, I need kibble and there is nothing more to it than that."" Karla trilled as they headed out of Anita's apartment.

""None of your platitudes can remedy the fact that you are costing me a fortune. Especially, considering that I am unemployed. Couldn't you find something to hunt and eat for a while? At least until I am able to find some stable employment..""

""You are far too eager to serve your bourgeois masters if you ask me. Where is your revolutionary spirit I ask you? You Americans once exemplified freedom. You were the shining beacon of hope and inspiration to all those who sought to overthrow their imperial masters. Now look at you, so eager to sing and dance at the pleasure of your corporate masters.""

"" Don't you forget that it is the very capitalistic system you so despise that makes it possible for you to get all the kibble you could ever want without lifting a paw. For someone so critical of capitalism you seem quite comfortable with taking advantage of all the benefits it bring you."" Anita answered as she pulled out her bluetooth headset. She knew that it made her look like a douchebag but she found it preferable to being the crazy lady who wanders about the streets having conversations with her cat.

""But is it the capitalist who is responsible for these provisions?"" asked Marx. ""Or is it the laborer enslaved by the capitalist who toils for this bounty. Open your eyes Anita. **Rise!!**. You have nothing to lose but these chains. **Look at them!!**"" Marx exclaimed as he pointed towards the occupy wall street protesters camped at some distance. ""**Join them. Lead them.** With my help you could turn this country into the communist utopia it was meant to be. America's time has come and you have been chosen!!!""

""Look closely Karla, is this really a movement worth committing to? you seem to be forgetting your own lessons apparently."" replied Anita unperturbed by Marx's admonishments.  

""And what lessons might they be?"" chattered Marx, his patience wearing thin.

"" History repeats itself, first as a tragedy, second as a farce. Your first experiment ended quite tragically, it would be wise to be wary of this farce."" stated Anita quietly as they entered the pet store.

Marx fell into silent contemplation as Anita started making small talk with the pet store lady. This human was proving to be far more difficult than he had anticipated.        ",2odditus

"[WP] Every time someone says ""No pressure"" local atmospheric pressure is reduced to 0 for half a second.",abrachoo,"They have no idea how I'm doing it, all the authorities know is what the aftermath looks like. 

I always wondered why the phrase ""no pressure"" was illegal to say, yet we are allowed to write it down. It took a lot of research looking through obscure laws and court records, but I finally found the reason. 

Whenever the words no pressure are spoken the local atmospheric pressure drops to zero. the reason this was so difficult to find out is because when there is no atmospheric pressure, there tends to be no survivors to tell the tale. 

Once I found that out, I bought myself a pressurised suit and started hunting.

With all the gang activity in the city I had no shortage of targets I just had to make sure I could get them in an area small enough to prevent collateral damage. 
I started out by watching the local drug dealer, over a few weeks I was able to pick out other gang members, I started following different thugs until I found where they spent the most time. An apparently abandoned warehouse on the dockside. 

Finally it was go time. I hid in the stack of cargo containers until there was nobody around and made my way into the warehouse. As I snuck in I saw there were about 20 gang members milling around, some packing drugs, some chatting and some packing weapons. I hid near the door and quietly said no pressure.

The windows imploded, the gang members practically exploded. All I could see was blood and meat. I was lucky that I wasn't hit by any glass. That would have broken the seal on my suit. 

From that point all I had to do was approach the biggest rival gang and tell them I was responsible for the slaughter. I used them to get information on as many other gangs as I could before taking them out too.

Hopefully you enjoy constructive feedback. 

The period between reminiscing about grandma and immediately jumping to there being a box and opening it casually by picking the lock was too abrupt and not filled with enough surprise to sound believable. It could be that you wanted the reader to not have all the information, but considering your meandering around with smaller details and thoughts with little pertinence to the story, I find that to be unlikely. You went out of your way to give the reader such insight into the breaking of train of thought of the protagonist by the argument downstairs, and details going along with that, but finding a box under a chair, and chest tightening for no apparent reason and with no explanation in a couple of sentences, followed immediately not only by random lockpicking skills, but also no emphasis placed on why they would be looking underneath so casually for a lockpick, seems odd, to say the least.

Could be improved imo. Otherwise, great detail, great storytelling voice, and I loved that I could immediately picture the atmosphere, and empathize with the protagonist instantly, and wholeheartedly.",psidekick
"[WP] After your Grandmother's disappearance everyone expects the worst. You're in charge of cleaning out the attic where You find a locked box with the poorly engraved words ""If Lost, Open"".",kielly32,"It had been a few months since Gran-gran disappeared. We had all gone through the stages of grief in different ways. My mother took it the hardest. She was only just starting to recover when the rest of the family decided to clean out Gran-gran's house. After the police declared her legally dead from being gone for so long, her lawyer had called us all in for the will reading and we all solemnly took out duties on the day of the cleaning. Aunt Peggy got the piano and the collection of beanie-babies. Uncle Adam got the house itself. Everything else was to be taken by whoever wanted it or sold and the money split between the three siblings. When the cleaning day came around, I was given the task of cleaning out the attic with my cousin. We groaned a little but put on our best smiles for our mothers' benefit because we knew it was harder for them.

Pulling down the stepladder to the attic, we were doused in a cloud of dust that set us sneezing and coughing for a few minutes. After that, we decided to tie a towel around out noses and mouths so it didn't happen again. If the stepladder to the attic was that dusty, the inside of it would be terrible. We made our way up into the darkness and quickly found the hanging light switch, illuminating the dank area. What we saw made us groan even more. The attic was filled with all manner of boxes, old furniture, trinkets, and tools that had gone unused for decades.

""Craaaap,"" I threw my head back, ""I never knew Gran-gran was a hoarder... Alright Pete, you take that side, I'll take this side. Let's go through it all first, then decide what to do with it. And open that freaking window!"" We went about our separate tasks, looking through drawers, boxes, under sheets covered in half an inch of dust. It was like an episode of 'Storage Wars', we found a bed frame, three mirrors, a piggy bank with some cash inside, and a bunch of old toys that looked like they might be worth something if they were cleaned. It was almost lunch time when I came across a strange wooden box that had a really complicated design carved into it. ""Hey Pete, come take a look at this..."" I called over to my cousin.

""Yeah...?"" he walked over, waving dust away from his face with his free hand and carrying a bucket of antique kitchen utensils with the other, ""Whoah...what's that?"" I brushed the dust off of the box with a hand broom my Aunt had brought up earlier and I heard something click. When I looked again, a circle on the top of the box had turned a few degrees. With the dust gone, it was easier to see what was carved into the box, and the flat part in the very center that had words engraved in it. Engraved? More...scratched. I took it over to the light to get a better look at what was written there.

""If lost, open... What does that mean?"" I looked at my cousin and he shrugged, obviously having no clue. He was three years younger, so I didn't have high hopes for him anyway. ""Maybe it means open the box? I dunno what it means by 'if lost,' though."" I tilted it around, trying to see it from every angle, looking for some sort of key hole or button or something, but there was none. Then it hit me, maybe it was the circle. I turned the circle in the center of the top - top? - again, going slowly and then heard a click. Looking at the design closely, it seemed like that made it line up with another part of it. I tried sliding it inwards, and it moved under my coercion, producing another satisfying click. After six more movements of various parts all over the box, the side with the circle pushed out a little.

""You did it!!"" My cousin shouted enthusiastically.

""Yeah, but what's inside?"" We both stared down at it curiously as I pulled open the lid. Inside, it was... it was empty! But for some reason, I couldn't look away. After a couple of minutes, my eyes were completely focused on the inside of the box and everything around me had faded into that blurry blackness that you see when you stare too hard at something. Then, when a feeling like something pulling on me struck me, I started back up. Looking around, Pete was gone. In fact, the whole attic seemed to have changed. All the stuff that we were fumbling through was gone, and I was standing in a room with a single bed against the wall and a candle on a night stand.

""Well,"" I heard from behind me, ""It's about time ONE of you figured out that box. I've been waiting for months!"" I spun around and there was my Gran-gran standing in a doorway to the room, wearing what seemed like a very elaborate dress, with strange letters embroidered all along the seams. She smiled at me with her kind face, though...she seemed younger than I remembered, ""It's good to see you, Terry.""

"[WP] After your Grandmother's disappearance everyone expects the worst. You're in charge of cleaning out the attic where You find a locked box with the poorly engraved words ""If Lost, Open"".",kielly32,"My Grandmother Gertrude was the kind of woman who still wore a leather jacket, and smoked cigarettes in old diners and bars until someone told her to stop. It was to the surprise of exactly no one when one day she didn't come home from a long ride on one of her many vintage motorcycles. Police looked around for her for a spell, but figured she had wandered off somewhere off the main roads and crashed in some long forgotten corner of one of the many national forests that surrounded the small town she lived in.

No one in my family seemed to particularly mind that she had vanished, or particularly concerned with finding her. She had never quite fit in, what with her Father and siblings all being strict church going folk, and since she had been a fairly wealthy eccentric there was certainly financial motivation for her to stay gone for everyone else's benefit. I was maybe the only one who missed Grandma Gerty, she had been a friend and confidant throughout my life and the only person who I could stand at family reunions. She had paid for my first tattoo and encouraged me to go after that well-intentioned but utterly useless art history degree - and had more than once taken me in for the night when my folks kicked me out.

I had drawn the short straw when it came to cleaning the estate, I suppose because everyone wanted me out of the way, and the overstuffed attic and her eclectic collection of knick-knacks and curios awaited me. There was the stack of old Playgirl magazines, a few life sized cardboard cutouts of the Chicago Bears Super Bowl team, and an aging collection of vinyl records that hadn't seen the light of day since Elvis walked amongst us. The smell up here made me sad, it was tinged with her unique mixture of incense and menthol cigarettes that I had come to associate with her. I could hear her cackling laugh and the 'little bit too tight' handshakes she'd give people when they came to visit.

It was clear she spent a decent amount of time up here, an old lawn chair sat in the corner with a pile of books next to it and a nice view of the lake she lived by. I sat down in the chair, the fabric on it was a little loose but otherwise comfortable. When I put my arms down on the armrests they comfortable sat in grooves she had worn in it over the decades she had lived in this home. Little traces of her were everywhere. Underneath the seat there was a small lock box, and scratched on it's tin surface was the worn text that read ""If Lost, Open""

My chest tensed up, arms relaxing a little as I ran a finger across the text slowly. One of the odd things Granda Gerty had taught me back in elementary school was how to pick simple locks, and sure enough taped to the bottom of the box was a small locking picking kit with a small smiley face sticker next to it. I carefully removed the kit and set to the slow work of unlocking the box.

Downstairs I could hear my family arguing about some old blue vase, arguing that it would look better on Bill's mantlepiece than it would on Caroline's entry table. It would be like this all day, everyone trying to claim a small piece of her home for themselves before we sold it. The lock clicked open with a sharp snapping sound, and the lid popped open about a quarter inch.

The box itself had been light, and inside was an envelope and a well rolled joint. The envelope was labelled ""To the (f)Art Historian"", written in her all caps block letter style. I opened the envelope and started to read:

*Hey Kiddo,

You like the Fart History joke? I did too. And yeah, of course you'd get stuck on attic duty. If not than this box'll just sit unopened and tossed in a junk pile along with all this other stuff I couldn't find a better place for. And that'll be okay. But I'm damn near certain you're going to get stuck on attic duty.

Might wanna light up that joint, because the rest is a doozy.

If you're finding this, well, hate to break it to you but I'm dead. Six feet under. Kaput. No surprise reveals this time, no big supernatural adventure or nothing, no pranks, I'm just dead. I'd have been back by now to hide this box and burn this letter if you're here cleaning up.

Back in the 60s and 70s I was in with some bad people, who did worse things. I'll spare you the details but lets just say that left me with some moral debts I've never taken the time to repay. I'm heading out to make some things right with the people who were hurt by things we did when your Grandfather and I were young, and I'm pretty damn sure that's going to get me killed. Which means that goddamn Doctor was always wrong about me going by way of lung cancer or high cholesterol. I've got one more adventure left to live in me - and I think I've had more than my fill for a lifetime. And don't worry about anyone coming after the family or the house, I've made sure it's all anonymous.

I woulda told you sooner, but it feels like one of those things that you don't tell somebody without them doing something stupid like trying to save your life or talk you out of it. And lord knows you could trick me into doing anything, so I kept the information from you. I suppose I owe you an apology for that, but I think you'll understand.

I didn't think writing this last paragraph would take so long, but I just can't think of a good thing to say other than I love you, and you've been the joy in my life for the last 29 years. You've made the ride worth it, kiddo. By way of life changing advice I don't really have anything for you other than you shouldn't rob banks and should always chase whatever or whoever makes you happy. See you on the other side*

I folded the letter carefully, putting it in my pocket. As always I couldn't tell if Grandma Gerty was being honest or not, and it didn't hurt I was halfway through the joint she had rolled for me. Maybe she had been some sort of bank robber, or drug dealer, or something crazy like that. Maybe she just quietly lost herself in the woods somewhere and didn't want me to wonder if she had gone alone. Maybe it was all some psychotic episode and she was still out there somewhere.

I looked over at the record player she had setup on top of some old boxes, and a faded Rolling Stones album sat on the turntable. I took a deep hit of the joint and blew the smoke up in the air and started the song.",redpandastrike

"[WP] After your Grandmother's disappearance everyone expects the worst. You're in charge of cleaning out the attic where You find a locked box with the poorly engraved words ""If Lost, Open"".",kielly32,"Alice's heart sank as she lifted the dusty attic door and gazed at the large pile of boxes. When she had volunteered to clean this most sacred of places, she hadn't been thinking of the memories she had to disturb, only of keeping her Uncle Walter's watery eyes from scrutinizing every artifact for value. Now that she was actually here, with this monumental task before her, she couldn't help but drift back to the warm days of her childhood when this was their secret place, her and Grams. 

Countless afternoon tea parties and nights upon nights of camping with books about places she didn't recognize in glyphs she couldn't comprehend while Grams told her far fetched tales in this musty cramped room dotted her childhood. Now that she was older, she assumed that Grams had made it all up, an attempt to satisfy the voracious imagination of a six year old. Alice would plead for more tales each time her mother dropped her off at Grams’ before heading to those long shifts at the hospital.

But that was before. Before her Mom collapsed in the emergency room,turning from a nurse to a patient in one fell swoop. They stopped camping in the attic, trading the makeshift forts for waiting rooms as her mom's health continued to decline. Grams sat each day, holding her daughter's hand until she withered away and stopped breathing. On that day, Grams was stonefaced. She gave Alice's mother a kiss on the forehead, smoothed her hair, and turned to Alice, only seven.

“Let's go home.”

From that day forward, the pair had been inseparable. Grams had looked after her, and as Alice matured and Grams aged their roles reversed. Now, at 23, Alice was Grams’ caretaker and so since her disappearance three weeks prior had been beside herself with worry. The police had searched and searched, but found nothing. Everyone told her that women in their eighties don't just disappear for weeks at a time without notice and reappear, and that she should prepare herself for the worst. She could feel the judgment in their eyes as they offered sympathy and condolences, but it could never match the guilt that she felt. She felt personally responsible. Hot tears welled in her eyes as a wave of emotion swept over her. 

Of course, Walter had wasted no time in swooping in after hearing about his mother's vanishing. Her mother's grasping older brother had been angling after Grams’ silver and China since before Alice could read, all under the guise of helping Grams “declutter” of course. 

Now, he was urging Alice to be pragmatic, exploiting every legal boundary he could to sell the house from under her. Naturally, she would get “her share”, according to Walter. And she knew that he was counting the days until he could get a death certificate. This was, however, still her home, and she would be damned if she was going to let him ransack the place when Grams wasn't even in the ground. So, when he had suggested that the attic should be the first thing to go, she had taken the lead from him. 

And so she set about sorting the boxes, going through her childhood box by box. She gingerly set the Christmas decorations in one corner and continued to work methodically through the cardboard city, kicking up fresh clouds of stale air with each stack she sorted. She found remnants of her and Grams’ life in each box she touched and she steeled herself against her grief as she worked. Finally she reach the far corner of the room and the last pile. The sun was sinking, and the light coming through the grimy window was soft and dim.

As she took a step toward the final boxes, she heard a soft creak beneath her foot and with a jolt the floor board buckled. She hissed softly as she extracted her foot from the debris. A nasty gash ran along the side of her shin and beads of blood gathered on her leg. Alice wondered absently if she would need stitches. She pulled a rag from her back pocket, originally intended for the dusty windows, to stave off the bleeding. She attempted to wipe off the majority of the blood on her hands by rubbing her shorts. 

She coughed slightly on the dust she had inhaled and looked resentfully at the broken floor board. An object in the crevice caught her eyes, and curiosity overtook pain momentarily. She leaned forward to pull a metal box from the floor. She didn't know how long it had been down there, but it didn't have the same heavy coat of dust as the rest of the attic’s contents.

The box had a crude inscription that read “If Lost, Open”. Further intrigued and deciding that her leg wasn't in any imminent danger of tetnus, she fumbled with the latches and peered inside.

The contents were interesting to say the least, and she removed strange coins and papers. She found old photographs of a young man and woman she recognized as her grandparents.

“Wow, Grams, you looked good,” she said softly. The pair were garbed in strange clothes, even by modern standards, but her grandmother's high cheekbones, so similar to her own, were clearly recognizable.

Finally, at the bottom of the box was a small egg shaped object, iridescent and emitting a soft blue light in the dim attic. She turned it over in her palm to examine it and as the strange egg passed over her still slightly blood smattered skin it pulsed softly. It was almost imperceptible, but it made her jump. It pulsed once more and suddenly, she was no longer in the stifling attic, but under an opaque orange dome, barely tall enough for her to stand. Slowly, she got up, her heart pounding from this instant change of surrounding. The dome unfolded around her,sinking into the floor, and she found she was in a vast room with several of what she could assume were people. They looked human but if she observed them from the corner of her eye they seemed to change shape. They spoke in garbled growling, and as they noticed her their growls became more feverish. Her temples began to ache as she listened, but then the growls started rearranging themselves into words almost like a lens coming into focus. They stepped toward her and she instinctively stepped backwards, clutching the egg in her hand. Whether her foot met real resistance or her nerves got the best of her she didn't know, but she fell backwards and the egg flew from her as she outstretched her hands, barely catching her fall. 

The figures then crowded her, and she heard one say, “The nano-mites should be working now.”

“Who are you?” asked the person closest to her, a woman with a black cropped haircut. 

An odd question that Alice in struggling to answer, dumbly recited her first name.

Upon hearing “Alice” the group murmured intensely amongst themselves. They reached out to her and she recoiled from the touch, staring with bewilderment at her predicament. 

“Sir, is it her?” the woman called out to a platform set in the back of the room. 

“No, but only her blood could work the transporter” a deep voice rumbled from the platform, and a large man with skin the color of coffee and long braids emerged from the shadows. 

“H-hey! What's going on?!” Alice said more fiercely than she felt. 

The group stared at her, confused by her sudden outburst. The man regarded her for a moment, pausing as he studied her features. He spoke to her slowly, as if addressing a small child. 

“We are the Yentzi, sent on behalf of the Universal Council in response to a distress signal originating from this planet. The signal was sent by one of our delegates, known on this planet as Alice Zimmerman.”

“Grams?” Alice questioned with incredulity in her voice. Surely not her Grams, who had a hard time reaching the top cupboard without assistance. Her head was spinning, and if she hadn't already been on the ground, she might have fainted. 

The Yentzi talked amongst themselves and Alice picked out “memory wipe” in their conversation.

“Wait,” she said, irritated that they were all talking about her as if she wasn't even there. “If Grams is in trouble, I want to help.”

They looked at her again, then at their commander who was staring at her silently. 

“Very well.”",emoticon1234

And he carried a motorcycle helmet, all of which she decided was just sexy enough to excuse the lateness.

""You must be Mark,"" she said, a little too exuberantly. She had felt too rude to order food while waiting, so instead she sipped two glasses of wine and nibbled on bread. She tried to hide her tipsiness.

He looked her over with faintly masked disdain. ""Ah. You are Karen, then."" He sniffed and sat at the table. ""How delightful.""

Karen bit her lip, not sure how to read his tone. She knew nothing about Mark. A co-worker she barely knew set them up. She tried not to think of this as a total disaster just yet. ""What do you do for work?"" she tried.

""Oh,"" the man said. ""I shoot people.""

She hesitated for a few seconds, certain she had misheard him. Then, ""Oh, you shoot--*oh,* I get it."" She laughed, belatedly, and mimed the motion of clicking her telescopic camera. ""Me too.""

Mark wrinkled his nose. ""...right. Usually people aren't so blase when I admit that, Karen.""

""Oh, it's not a big deal. It's a totally normal job. For me, getting the perfect shot really comes down to getting them lined up right, you know.""

He whistled. ""I rarely get them all in one shot.""

""Oh, you do singles?"" She blundered on, oblivious to his bemused look. ""I mostly do weddings. I make a killing on weddings. Can't do anything all summer, but it's worth it. Have you ever shot at a wedding?""

""Uh."" He scratched his head, thinking about it. ""A couple.""

""Personally, my favorite approach is shooting as many as possible, so I know I won't mess it up, you know? If you just hold the trigger down like a hundred times you'll get someone eventually, right?""

Mark looked at her, stunned. ""Won't you hit a lot of civilians that way?""

""Oh, I usually don't shoot out around a lot of people. People are uncomfortable enough getting their picture taken.""

""You're a *photographer*?"" The man threw down his napkin and sighed, ""I try to be open about my lifestyle, and I think I finally meet a woman who might be in the same culture as myself. But no."" He stood up and slammed his chair back into place. ""It turns out you're just a fucking idiot.""

He stormed out, leaving Karen alone. She pulled aside the next waiter and asked for some alfredo and another bottle of wine.

I was a mess.  Fighting had been going on in the city for a week.  My hair was full of dust from various explosions and powdered concrete, blood smeared my cheek where a road rash on by face had bled.  I sipped at the beer, the first I'd been able to find in weeks.

""Took some good shots, huh?  I've been in it myself.  See that tower?  Through the window, that bell tower?  Before this city was secure, I got some of the best shots of my life.""  His face was grizzled, a week's growth of beard obscuring his jaw, and a scar snaked down his face like a disfiguring rope.

I looked out at the tower, and smiled. ""Must be nice.  All that elevation, just you and the wind.""  

He nodded, and sipped at his drink; it smelled like kerosene.  ""Forty-x.  Could see the whites of their eyes.""

I imagined it - the wind in your hair, able to look down into the crowd, picking out individuals without worrying about them seeing you and changing their behavior, ruining a careful shot.  You could read thoughts in their expressions from so far away.  ""That's serious magnification.  It's always best then they're unaware.  You can anticipate the moment, frame your shot two steps ahead.""

He gestured with the cup, pointing past it at me. ""You know how it is.  You pick your place, you look for your shot.  Sometimes you don't get a thing, sometimes you just just the one perfect shot, and sometimes everything you do is gold.""

I nodded, knowing exactly what he meant.  ""The day before yesterday, I was with some men guarding the west road.  No visibility at all, just blown dust.  Yesterday, I was death itself.""  I picked up my rifle, setting it my shoulder - my hand drifted over the scope, almost caressing it, stroking the air.

""House whiskey, dry."" he muttered and scratched through his thick beard to his cheek. His eyes were bloodshot, his lips dry. 

Ramsey hated the fucking desert. But he was used to blindly following orders. In his line of work, you went where they told you to go and you didn't ask questions. 

A smallish, rodent-looking man with a round face took the stool next to him. He was going bald on top, and had beady little eyes. He reminded Ramsey of a neighbor he had as a boy, an accountant. 

As the bartender sat down Ramsey's shot of Jack, the small man said timidly:

""Cock suckin' cowboy.""

""Come again?"" Ramsey demanded, growing red in the face. 

""2 parts butterscotch, 1 part Bailey's.""

""Oh."" the bartender said, frowning. ""Right.""

""Name's Jonas."" the smaller man said, thrusting a hand towards the burly man, causing him to spill the whiskey he was attempting to drink down the front of his shirt.

Ramsey closed his eyes, sat the shot glass down, and turned to face Jonas. 

""You gonna pay for that?"" he asked, barely containing his contempt. 

""Depends."" Jonas said calmly as the bartender returned with his CSC. He sipped at it, then continued. ""Where are you stationed?""

""Oh yeah, I get that a lot. But I've shot lots of people over the years."" Jonas said, and made a clicking noise with his tongue. 

""What's you're record?"" Ramsey asked. ""I bet mine is higher.""

""In one day?"" Jonas paused, and considered. ""Well, back in '09 I had twenty separate head shots. But I was much younger then.""

""Twenty?!"" Ramsey shouted. ""No! I can barely get more than a dozen before the screaming starts and everyone's running around haphazardly."" 

""Here's the trick: you have to get as many shots off as you can before they realize what's happening. Catch them in a natural state.""

The bartender slid them their shots. In unison, the men clinked their shot glasses together and downed them. 

""What's your best shot?"" Jonas asked, licking the remnants of his cock sucking cowboy from his lips. ""The one you're most proud of?"" 

Ramsey chewed his lip, and sorted through a catalog of memories. 

""Fallujah, '04. Shot a man and his wife outside of the U.S military base. They couldn't have been more than twenty yards away, but the shot was perfect. Crisp, clean. And the best part was, it sent a message."" 

""You... you're proud of that?"" Jonas asked, bewildered. 

""Well, yeah. It was a big deal. Everyone was talking about it for weeks. It really impacted Iraqi-American relations."" Ramsey said defensively. ""What's yours, Mr. Hot Shot?"" 

""It was actually a series of shots-"" 

""Oh, Panoramic?"" Ramsey asked and knocked on the bar for more shots. ""C'mon that doesn't count.""

""Fine. The best shot was the very first one. I got a head shot on this Al Queda leader while he was taking a bite of an apple. No wind, lighting was perfect. It was the perfect shot. Got the apple, and the terrorist leader in the shot.""

""That... that is quite impressive"" Ramsey mused. ""How far away were you?"" 

""About a mile and a half away. My longest shot to date. Oh, but you know with the improvements in technology it looks like they're standing right in front of you.""

""I'd really like to see that. Do you have it on you?"" Ramsey asked eagerly. 

""Have what? The apple?"" Jonas asked, startled. 

""No,"" Ramsey laughed. ""The picture!""

""Picture of what?"" Jonas asked. 

""The terrorist, with the apple."" Ramsey explained slowly, like a teacher talking to a student. 

""Well there wasn't much left of either of them after I took the shot."" Jonas said, perplexed. ""I damn sure didn't stop to take a picture.""

""Wait, what? So you *didn't* take a picture?""

""What are you talking about? Do you take a picture of every terrorist *you* kill? I'm not scrap-booking, I'm killing bad guys."" 

""Wait, this whole time you were talking about *actually* shooting people?"" Ramsey squeaked, his voice betraying him.

""What the fuck were you talking about?"" Jonas asked. ""You're not a sniper?"" 

""No."" Ramsey shook his head in horror. ""I'm a photographer.""",Aaron_Abysmal

"[WP] A photographer and a sniper meet in a bar. Neither is aware of the other's occupation. They talk about ""how to take the perfect shot"".",kimpoiot,"I was born in Washington State and always had this sort of fascination with capturing the Pacific Ocean during the winter.  The waters seemed to change with the seasons, regardless of whether the water froze over or not.  The color, the size of the waves, and even the smell always had this ability to transfix both my eyes and my lens on their beauty.

Vladivostok was a different beast.  Photography was a surprisingly tough gig, and contrary to the belief of every teenage girl with an iPhone, not just anybody could be successful with it.   I always had to be pursuing a new shot, a new angle, and a new scenic vista in the hopes that I could get some local magazine or online publisher to recognize my work and license it for their use.  The Russian winter, something that was infamous for ending the careers of some of history's most famous (and infamous) individuals, was to be my muse and the savior of my livelihood.

This isn't to say that I was having fun.  The fishing village I was staying in only had a handful of people in it.  The bar that kept my body and heart warm only had me, the tender, and a rather hostile looking man in his late twenties who was scribbling away at a drawing pad.

After a few minutes of tense silence, the man seized up and slowly turned his head towards me, as if he was a doe who had just heard the cracking of a branch in the distance.  His eyes locked with mine, before slowly looking up and down my body, as if analyzing every feature of mine.

After a few moments of the now even more awkward silence, the man bit the tip of his drawing pencil, pointed to my hip, and finally spoke.

""Do you know what an artist and a sniper have in common?""

I froze up at the mention of a sniper, but felt calmed as I realized that my fellow bar patron was simply gesturing at the camera case on my hip.  

“I am afraid I do not” I replied, my right hand slowly moving down towards the case on my hip, as if to ensure that it was still there.

I almost thought I saw the other patron tense up as I moved my hand to my side, but he quickly redirected his attention back to a small condensation-dampened napkin that he had been drawing on before spitting the word “details” out of his mouth.  No eye contact was made.

I nervously fondled my drink, and was about to ask him to elaborate before he began a monologue.

“Like when a touch of color is out of place. When a shadow does not match its surroundings –“

I felt the need to interrupt.

“Or when your shutter speed isn’t fast enough and you get a blurry image?”

The man gave me an incredulous, almost offended look and let out a sigh, shortly followed by a seemingly forced “Da”.  

A few minutes passed in notable silence as both he and I nursed our drinks, and the bartender cleaned some glasses.  When the patron finished his beverage, he held the empty glass up to the dim light in the bar.  Within the glass was a single cube of ice that seemed to reflect the light rather well.

“Or when a shape is not where it is supposed to be…” the man muttered.
That line sent a chill up my spine as I realized what the man was getting at.  He, like me, was an individual trapped in this land, a man who did not really belong in such a place.  A place whose beautiful snowscapes and forests seemed to blend together into a void.  A place without details. He and I were both shapes that were not where they were supposed to be.  

I smiled at the man and said the last thing I said that night besides my brief thanks to the bartender: “I think I understand now.”

The other patron didn’t react at all to my statement besides looking me in the eyes and saying “The only difference are the stakes, mine are higher”.  

As I broke eye contact with the man, I felt a shiver run up my spine.  A door had opened.  Not metaphorical, but literally.  Three men stepped into the bar, and through the reflection of my glass I watched them approach the other patron.  They all shared his empty stature, but retained his imposing nature.  One’s eyes seemed to dart around like an alert hunter, while the another’s seemed devoid of life, empathy, or even innocence.  The third had his face covered with a grand helmet, and all that I could recollect from him was this feeling that I was standing in the presence of men who were far above me.  A lord, or even a god.  

Without conversation the other patron left, followed by those men.  They seemed to be the place where his shape fit in, not in this bar with me.  They were clearly more seasoned, veteran photographers, while I was just a young man whose desire for adventure had yet to leave him.  Only my rationality and reason had.

As I sat on the plane out of Hong Kong I looked through what few pictures I had taken during that trip.  Most were of the plains, the stormy seas, or the weathered shacks of the town.  One stood out in particular.  The image was shot in the early morning, and was just one of the probably seventy or so ones I had taken of the ocean at 6 AM.  The difference was that in the difference, a small orange light seemed out of place, with an even smaller crescent shape eclipsing the light that sat on the horizon.  It was sunrise, not in that it was a dawn that had come but one that was still coming.  Opportunity.

I quickly attached that picture to an email targeted at some editors I had met during my time, asking for opinions, casting out my line to see if I could get a catch with this experimental bait.  One editor, Craig, responded with words that would change my life forever.

“Sent to the team, thanks.”

***Photographer:*** o-oh um, i'm fine.

""the photographer looks at the burly man, his body chiseled to perfection, dressed nicely, has the beard that no matter how much you'd scratch, it will still feel as smooth as silk... needless to say, her cheeks went completely reddened...""

***Sniper:*** so uh, can i get you a drink?

***Photographer:*** u-um, sure, i'll get a cosmopolitan~...

***Sniper:*** huh, i'll get a bloody mary then, Bartender.

***Photographer:*** h-hey um, i can't help but notice the camera you've got, i-it's looks quite unique.

***Sniper:*** ah, this thing?

""he hands her the camera, a Canon DSLR, built to withstand all kinds of harsh environments, and take the most crisp of shots.""

***sniper:*** she's been with me through thick and thin, takin' shots, locating my targets and getting a good click on their faces... good times.

***Photographer:*** oh um, that's great, it does seem like you know a thing or two about the subject.

***Sniper:*** yeah, i know, it ain't exactly rocket science, but to get the right shot from miles away with all of the environmental hazards, the shaking, awkward positions, awkwardly placed bipod...

***Photographer:*** oh god i hate that too, either it's too blurry or i miss my target by a few inches.

***Sniper:*** exactly! no matter how stable it gets!

***Photographer:*** oh god, that is truly a pain.

***Sniper:*** try pulling all of your gear through water and mud, that's a pain.

***Photographer:*** oh christ, don't remind me... Shanghai was a pain when i had to go and take a few good headshots of some people there, they insisted on the scenery.

***Sniper:*** really!? oh shit i was in the Philippines, the trees were a pain in the ass, chopping with a machete was the only way to finish the job for me.

***Photographer:*** what about the lenses, they get dirt all the time!

***Sniper:*** that's another subject, till then, why not get some shots?

***Photographer:*** i'll have a shot or two, i quite like it.

""with that, the two order shots of Vodka and tequila""

***Sniper:*** so, lenses.

***Photographer:*** y-yeah! uh, the dirt locks up the adjustments and i'll have to go a little rough, which for me is a bit painful.

***Sniper:*** same here, had to change twice till i rested on one that stuck with me the most.

***Photographer:*** so, what was your first shot?

***Sniper:*** it was a compound of about a dozen targets, each one was uglier than the other, i had to take shots at every single one of the fuckers... but hey! the pay was great!

***Photographer:*** mine was a middle aged man, it wasn't an amazing pay, but it was fast, so i took the shot and went home with a good meal at least.

***Sniper:*** man, you really are fun, you know that?

***Photographer:*** why thank you~! so... how do you take *the perfect shot?*

***Sniper:*** simple... get yourself into a comfortable position, prepare the lens and check the angle, you don't want a bad shot, right?

***Photographer:*** right right!

***Sniper:*** once all the stars align, the target is within the crosshair, and you've calculated the shot... gently pull the trigger and bam, mission accomplished.

***Photographer:*** w-wow, that sounds so awesome...

***Sniper:*** what's your perfect shot?

***Photographer:*** have your setup on an area of good elevation, not too low so you have to account for angle, not too high so you'd have to sit yourself up and risk shaking the vision, once all of it is said and done, have a few good seconds of breathing and brace yourself for the shot...

***Sniper:*** **-Sip-** uhuh?

***Photographer:*** then click, there it goes, and in your words... mission accomplished~.

***Sniper:*** damn, that is amazing... so uh, what's the highest caliber you've shot.

***Photographer:*** oh uh a few good models, they were from serb-

***Sniper:*** no, wait, what?

***Photographer:*** these harlots that were so freaking bitchy about everything... eventually i had to put them down for good because they annoyed me.

***Sniper:*** f-fuck, that's ice cold, lady... i like that, the ability to do what's right, even if it is wrong as fuck.

***Photographer:*** yeah, i had to do a few things i'm not proud of...

***Sniper:*** so, uh... yeah... same here.

***Photographer:*** oh, by the way, where do you work? i want to visit someday.

***Sniper:*** oh, that would be hard, i'm with the S.A.S, top notch shit, they won't let anyone from outside come near the doors by an inch.

***Photographer:*** oh, wait... what is S.A.S?

***Sniper:*** Special Air Service?

***Photographer:*** w-w-wait... what?

***Sniper:*** i'm a designated marksman and sniper, what about you? army?

***Photographer:*** n-n-n-no! ii'm a photographer! w-what!?

***Sniper:*** oh... *oh...* now i see that clearly...

***Photographer:*** s-so when you said you took sh-shots... you mean you've k-

***Sniper:*** each and every single one of the Militia members, that was a good day for me.

***Photographer:*** a-and Caliber?... l-like in guns?

***Sniper:*** mine was 50.Cal, and y-yeah... i kill people for living, the camera is to take photos for recon.

***Photographer:*** oh... *oh...* that makes so much sense...

""feeling he fucked up big time, like compromising a mission due to a shot that missed the target by a millimeter, he simply looks ahead and takes another sip of his drink... but after a while, she speaks up...""

***Photographer:*** hey, i'm Hannah Kingston, what's your name?

***Sniper:*** John McTavish, they call me Soap.

***Photographer:*** Soap?

***Sniper:*** long story, wanna leave this place and talk in a calmer area?

"[WP] A photographer and a sniper meet in a bar. Neither is aware of the other's occupation. They talk about ""how to take the perfect shot"".",kimpoiot,"She'd told me she'd shot a few people. 

I'd laughed. 

I shouldn't have laughed. But... but there's 14 trillion photos due to be taken this year, on average little Jimmy, little average Jimmy, will take 3 and a half thousand shots this year... on his own. 

Everyone thinks they're a fucking photographer and it's killing the industry. 

I shouldn't have laughed. Especially as I'd asked. But I did, and I told her that it didn't sound like that rough a day. 

A couple of shots didn't sound too bad. 

She didn't really react. I mean that was weird. That should have been enough for me to figure something was up. It wasn't.

She ordered me a drink, shared me some professional-courtesy-world-weary-look that just pissed me off more. 

She'd ordered us drinks though, that was kind of hot. I started on the full force struggles of the artform diatribe I'd used on and off since college with different photochicks. The whole chasing that ""perfect shot"" tale of woe. 

She just nodded. Staring balefully into her drink. 

We talked about life through a lense. I really thought I'd got her, maybe even she'd got me. There was a connection, she had an angle on things I'd never considered. What is the cost of the shots we take?

I really should have figured something was up then; smart, hot, artistically intriguing, working in the same field in the same city and giving me the time of day, I don't know why I didn't see it until she left, telling me she had some Ukrainian Drug lord to get a headshot of before midnight. We laughed over lighting jokes, she had a nightvision ""scope"". 

She wouldn't give me her number, that's when it clicked. Gay. 

Bloody lesbian photographers. Ruining the industry.

Winterfell had been under siege for days. The food was scarce now, and people were beginning to get restless from hunger, fear, and panic. Something had to be done. 

The army of the dead sat outside the walls, ready to attack at any moment.

""I don't get it."" Arya Stark commented, staring through a window out at the decaying bodies of the wights. ""They have a dragon. Why just sit there?""

Jon Snow sighed, pacing back and forth by the fire. He rubbed the bridge of his nose. The last thing he wanted to be reminded of was the fact that not only was the Night King at his doorstep with his 100,000 dead ones, but that the ruler of the White Walkers rode atop the back of Viserion. 

""The dead have waited thousands of years beyond the wall for winter to come,"" Davos Seaworth began, as he stared into the crackling embers, ""they likely have no quarrels waiting a few weeks for us to all kill each other in here."" 

""We need to do something."" Sansa said abruptly, breaking her long silence in the corner of the room. She looked up at Jon without lifting her head, to see his pacing had ended with her words.

""And what's that? What can we possibly do? The army of the dead surrounds our walls. They don't eat, they don't sleep, and they can wait out there as long as they need to. We've got no way to act. It's too late for that."" He snapped frustratedly. It was heartbreaking for everyone in the room to see Jon Snow, the man who fought so passionately for so long against the greatest threat known to the seven kingdoms, lose hope. 

Sansa stood up abruptly, striding over to her older brother. 

""Then why die like cowards?"" She asked, her actions and words causing everyone present to turn to face her. ""Why give it what it wants? Why don't we do as much damage as we can to hopefully make a difference?""

Jon's eyes stayed on his sister's. She could see the gears turning in his head, and could almost feel him thinking about a way out of this mess.

""Set Davos, get Daenerys and her dragons.""

Jon gripped Longclaw in a bloodied hand.

The fight had gone a lot better than anyone could have possibly imagined, though it was certain to all the living present in the battle that they were going to lose. 

A lot of people lost hope when Drogon came crashing down to the earth from a spear of ice, and again when Jon's dragon mount, Rhaegel, followed suite. 

The King in the North limped towards the Night King, in a bold move to attempt to win the war and save humanity. 

The Night King just stared at Jon from across the battlefield, and Jon stared right back. Both of them knew their enemy, their rival, their next kill. 

Jon waded through the corpses and cut down as many wights as he could to assist his allies in the battle, but with every one of his comrades that fell, the army of the dead grew. 

The Night King's usual cold, stern expression shifted into one Jon had never seen before: a smug, twisted smile. The White Walker taunted Jon, a spear made of ice in his hands.

Jon let out a ferocious battlecry as charged his enemy, and to his surprise, his sword connected. 

Jon opened his eyes, expecting and hoping to see a cloud of ice crystals shatter to the ground before him, but what truly laid before him horrified him. 

Longclaw had just gotten caught in the shoulder blade of his enemy.

The Night King still wore that smug, as he slammed his right palm into Jon's thrust. Cold fingernails cut into the neck of the man that was supposed to be Azor Ahai reborn, the Prince That Was Promised. Jon kicked helplessly, Longclaw clattering to the ground below him as the Night King lifted him into the air.

The White Walker drew his spear back, and Jon prepared for his true death at the end of this weapon.

But suddenly Jon was broken free from the grip of the Night King to collapse to the ground. Something had connected with the arm that lifted him from the ground and freed Jon from the grasp.

He grabbed at his own neck, gasping for air, before glancing upward from the ground to see there was no person standing above him. 

But there was a small mammal. A small, furry grey cat, wearing appropriately sized armour. Jon stared at the cat, which just licked its paws.

The Night King's smile was gone, replaced by a frown. He raised his spear above his head to drop it down on the furry knight, but the spear shattered when the cat masterfully lifted his paw to block it.

Then Jon saw the cat: its claws were on fire.

A hiss was heard, before the cat kept into the air, pouncing the Night King and giving one fatal slash of its paw to bring the war to an end.

All around Jon, wights fell to the ground, leaving only the other White Walkers. These walkers were swarmed and brought down by the army of the living.

Jon stared at the cat, which now stood on a pile of ice stretching itself out on its back. He couldn't help but stare at it. It had ended the war.

He heard heavy footsteps from behind him, but could not bring himself to look.

""Is that..."" he heard Jaime Lannister speak. ""Is that Ser Pounce?!""

The cat stopped stretching and just stared at Jaime for a few moments, before getting up off of the remnants of the Night King and strutting away like it had somewhere better to be.",SoDamnGeneric

Ando lay back, watching the sky, ""Yeah, yeah. Keep complaining. See if I care."" 

The zombie hissed impotently at him as it drew near and handed him a sweating coke, ""What kind of asshole disturbs the dead-"" 

""-any and every Necromancer-"" 

""-to trim their yard!"" 

He swung his legs against the porch of his hostel walkway, ""I get sunburns really easily,"" he said, a thoroughly deadpan expression on his face, ""It's all the staying up at night to hold mysterious rituals that have made me allergic to sunlight."" 

""...you're under the sunlight right now, Ando."" 

He raised his head to stare up at the sky, a hand shading his eyes, ""Oh, is the sun up?"" 

*""Don't say that like you just noticed the sun, oi!""* 

A hand fell on his shoulder and the Necromancer turned, dark magic bubbling in the shadows of his coat. He relaxed a little when he saw who it was. 

""So this is the kind of person you are...one who bullies corpses when they've got no one to pick on."" 

The innocent, boyish face that stared down at him didn't match the carelessly spoken words. His room mate, Sei. 

A *Priest* in training. He grimaced. 

""What are you doing here? I thought I poisoned your breakfast."" 

Sei ignored his grousing completely, smiling brightly as he handed him a sheaf of papers, ""I came here to be helpful, Ando! Look, I even brought the homework from this morning's class that you absentmindedly missed!"" 

""I was missing it on purpose, idiot!"" he said, grabbing the papers with a scowl, ""I have no interest in Nature magic whatsoever!"" 

*""I'm interested in you learning Nature magic. Maybe you'd be able to cut grass instead of lazing around like a layabout.""* the shambling, lawn-mowing zombie interjected in the background. 

""Why, whatever will you do without me!"" Sei continued cheerfully, ""I even arranged for you to meet Professor Fernleaf for remedial lessons. *So you'd better go if you don't want a 'Heal' spell to accidentally go off on your fox spirit collection.* "" 

*What kind of scary smile is that...!* 

""O-of course I'll go! So stop smiling like that already, idiot!"" 

Sei sat down next to him, dropping his smile as he pulled out his own sheaf of notes, ""Now listen carefully as I recap the lesson, you class-skipping delinquent..."" 

""That's really not necessary."" Ando said, but he listened anyway. 

*Man, what am I still doing here...?* he thought to himself, *But it's too bothersome to try to get out of this...*",driftea

The people crowded together their anger fueling a large bonfire.  Across the street people were soaked in tears.  The anti-protesters.  

George avoided the protesters and made his way through the anti-protesters.  He fit in well there, a thin layer of tears surrounding him.  He felt self-conscious of his body, the recent changes; tear and fire ducts forming here and there, not to mention the god awful acne.  

He lined up with the other students.  At the entrance were counsellors, you couldn’t have too many angry or disturbed kids at school or there wouldn’t a school to come back to.  Some kids got turned away to go back home.  Lucky bastards, George thought.

Math class, his chair accumulating a puddle of tears.  

“Hey everyone, look at Lindsey, she’s wetter than a trout!” a kid from the back of the class yelled.

Lindsey looked around.  Poor girl, her parents had got into a horrific accident a few weeks ago.  Her face flushed red, the earth began to crack and crumble.  It opened up and swallowed her whole, students pushing their desks away.  Some were giggling but George just watched the scene with a blank expression.  The earth closed up, leaving no trace of the crack.


“Earth counselors to the basement, we got a sinker” the teacher barked into a walkie-talkie.
“And Clarence, don’t pull that crap again or your in big trouble mister,” she said facing the student.
The top of her head had burst a few flames but they quickly subsided.  


It was lunchtime and George was walking around the courtyard, kicking at pebbles.  Then he saw her.  He felt light.  It was like a chorus of angels was singing.  A sunbeam began to shine on his head, drying up the thin layer of tears on his head.  He felt lighter and lighter as he got closer to the group of girls.  Every other step he took he felt less and less gravity pulling him down.

“Hi,” George stammered.  The group of girls all turned around and stared at him.  They began to snigger.  There was George, a half foot off the ground floating, sun shining down on his head.

The girl looked at him with a scrunched up face. ""Ugh,"" she sounded, turned and walked away.

George floated back down to earth looking after the girl.  She was now covered with a green slime and was shaking it off in globs.

A small dark cloud formed above his head, tears pelting down on his hair.

Then she dashed out the door and began her walk to school, all the while plotting, ""I need to figure out how to make the sparks look natural.""

But she couldn't help it. Her mind wandered away from her romantic schemes and found its way back to her inadequacy. ""Why do I have to be an Apathetic?"" she thought as she watched a girl a block ahead of her explode into tiny pieces. ""That girl probably didn't finish her homework. And lucky her, everyone knows how stressed that made her."" Nina closed her eyes and willed an emotion, any emotion, to show. She didn't care if she turned green or burst into flames, she just wanted to be like everyone else. 

Once she got to the schoolyard, she regretted spending her walk willing the impossible. She had to accept she would never be able to show emotion, but she had resolved long ago not to let that stop her. She slipped the sparklers out of her backpack and hid them inside her long ponytail while searching the crowd for Ethan. She dodged pangs of lust that came from seemingly everywhere and directed at no one in particular. ""Middle school can be a battle ground,"" she thought. 

As she ducked under a particularly large lust pang, Nina accidentally bumped into Ethan and interrupted his conversation with Cassy, another girl in their class. Tiny sparks immediately sprouted from his ears while tiny daggers erupted from Cassy's eyes. This was Nina's chance! 

As Nina discreetly lit her sparklers, Ethan's sparks grew more pronounced. He spoke excitedly and was about to ask her on a date when Nina began to notice the unmistakable smell of smoke. In that moment, Ethan's sparks had been replaced with a tremble throughout his body and he quickly tried to put out the fire that had ignited in Nina's hair. 

""What kind of sick joke is that?"" he yelled as fiery tears left streaks of ash on his face. 

""I can explain,"" started Nina, but before she could finish, Cassy swooped in to whisk him away, leaving behind a trail of miniature trophies. 

Left alone in the courtyard, Nina finally felt her first tear.",FrauAwesome

Every time he passes you in the halls, every time he looks your way, gives you that charming smile and nonchalant wave, your eyes sparkle, and sparklers flare behind you, and a peculiar fluttering feeling begins in your stomach. He knows. He can see those sparklers. 

You've never experienced such an emotion, such utter devotion and entrancement in another human being. You've never seen it, either. Your parents don't sparkle, they have a warm glow. *He* doesn't sparkle, and it's enough for those clouds to form above your head, sagging heavily with water waiting to be released. But you know feelings change.

You sit next to him in your science class. It's difficult to be in their with him. The whole class erupts into giggles as soon as he says anything, because your sparklers start up again. He just smiles at you, kind and patient. That doesn't help; the sparklers turn pink and red. You try desperately to calm yourself, but it's to no avail because you notice how his smile crinkles his nose in the most terribly perfect way. Your teacher asks you to leave with a knowing smile, to save you from the torment. You thank her and shuffle out to the lunch benches.

It takes a good ten minutes for your sparklers to quiet down. They're still there, everpresent and glowing, but no longer hissing and crackling with excitement. You let out a sigh of relief, but then something catches your eyes.

He's running towards you, calling your name and smiling ever so slightly. Your sparklers flare as your heart stammers. He reaches your lunch bench, panting ever so slightly. His skinny figure isn't built for running.

The air around him seems dark, heavy, swirling. He's nervous. After he sits down next to you, you notice that some of your sparks are getting stuck in the inky black air around him. They stay. Your heart skipped a beat as your sparks glow pink. He turns to you, opens his mouth to speak, and stammers adorably.

""I-I uh... I wanted to ask about those sparks you have. They're gorgeous.""

You look down and smile, blushing profusely as little red sparks crackle in front of your glowing cheeks.

""Sorry for the trouble they're causing. I'm not really sure why they're here... but I think it has to do with you,"" you confess, forcing the electrifying words past your trembling tongue. 

He smiles, and his inky black air clears a little bit. The sparks that you'd gotten in it stay.

""You don't know what emotion that is?"" he asks gently, searching your eyes as they gaze at him.

""I have an idea... but I'm not sure,"" you say, your sparks glowing hot and tinged with red.

""Is it... love?"" he implores, as your heart and stomach jolt and your sparks turn red and gold.

""I think so.""

He breathes out and looks away, an expression of calculation on his face. He's puzzled. ""What did I do to make you see me this way?"" He asks, fidgeting with his hands. More sparks land in his renewed swirling nervousness, and they remain there. 

You sigh, and slump forward a bit, looking at your scuffed shoes. Every sentence you force out of your mouth feels like a lifetime. ""It's hard to say what exactly did it, but you've been so kind to me, when the others laugh at my sparks for you. It made them glow brighter. It made me... it made me fall harder.""

There's a pause. You look over at him again, and he's watching your sparklers let off their red, pink, and golden sparks.

You speak again, too nervous to look at him. ""Every time you say or do something, anything, it runs through my mind a thousand times. Your personality... I think that's what attracted me."" The words are scary to say aloud. Who would have thought you'd be saying them to him, let alone *anyone*?

There's another long pause. You have nothing left to say, so you wait anxiously for his response. He's accumulated quite a lot of your sparks by now. Enough to start a sparkler of his own.

""So... you love me?"" He stammers the words as he turns to face you on the bench. His eyes are guarded, and it's impossible to tell what he's feeling.... except for those sparklers igniting behind him.

Your heart nearly leaps out of your chest as your sparklers burn in every color of the rainbow. ""I love you.""

He blushes scarlet. ""I think I'm... starting to love you too.""

You smile, and then the two of you giggle like children. ""So... what do we do now?""

He smiles as his sparks turn pink. ""We should get back to class."" He takes your hand in his, and you walk back to the classroom together.

Heads turn as you enter, and your teacher gives you the biggest smile of all when she sees his sparklers. You both blush and return to your seats, never letting go of each others' hand.

My eyes dart over to see Richard, his face beaming with enthusiasm. 

""We did it. I can't believe it. We're going to be among the first men to walk on the moon!"", Richard said. 

We're still shocked that we made it past the launch, but our spirits are high. I suppose surviving two lightning strikes and a telemetry failure will do that to you. 

""The honor of being the first goes to Apollo 11... but I suppose second isn't half bad"", I retorted. 

It isn't my first time in space, but landing on the moon? I still can't believe that they picked me. Even after all the training, nothing can prepare you of the rush of stepping into the module. We are still two days away from reaching our destination, but it would take far longer than that to drop my spirits. 

There are still a million things that can go wrong between here and the lunar surface, but I have high hopes for this mission. 

I shift in place rather awkwardly, still adjusting to the zero-g conditions. I can't tell if I enjoy zero-g or detest it.

I look over at Alan. He is being uncharacteristically quiet. Perhaps he is saving his energy for the lunar landing? 

""Alan, is there something bother- "" 

I was suddenly interrupted by a message from Houston. 

""Apollo 12...

This is Houston...

We... We have a problem"" 

Alan and Richard look to me for an explanation. Their faces show confusion and fear. I imagine my face is no different. 

""Hou- Houston?"" I stammer. ""Care to repeat that?"" 

No response.

""Houston?!"" 

Nothing. 

I pause for a moment, stupefied. I hadn't anticipated this turn of events. 

I scour my brain for some sort of rational explanation. Richard looks at me and Alan. 

""Guys""

""You need to see this"" 

He points outside the small window, towards Earth. 

Small white flashes begin to appear across it's distant surface. 

It was beautiful, and horrible, and everything in between. 

We all knew at that instant what was happening. We all knew that all hope was lost. 

""Jesus Christ"" 

Tears begin to congregate around Richard's eyes. Alan drifts into fetal position, his eyes wide and unfocused. 

None of us have words. 

Ten minutes... an hour... maybe ten hours pass. 

""Fucking Soviets"" Alan blurts out. The first break in the silence. 

""They did this"" 

His face was bright red. 

""It doesn't matter who did this"" I said. ""They're all dead now""

We were all silent for a while longer. 

Any drive we might have once had to complete the mission was gone. What would even be the point? We have no purpose. We have no future. We have nothing. How can any human be expected to endure this? There has to be something I can do.

I start to speak.

""Perhaps...""

""Perhaps we shouldn't abandon our mission""

""Perhaps this is the last great thing humanity will ever do""

The other two turn to me. 

""We can still do this. One final achievement""  

Alan and Richard nod their heads. After all, I am still their commander. 

We all carried out our duties. Before I knew it, we were on the lunar surface. Not at our original landing site, but we were on the moon. It had to be good enough. 

Our lander was damaged beyond repair during the landing procedure. No matter. It's not like we have a home to return to.

I put on my spacesuit and step outside. It is magnificent. An alien world. 

On the horizon, a dead Earth greets me, it's surface scarred and scorched. 

In the lunar soil, I etch a final, desperate message from humanity to the universe.

""Come again?"" he asked, and beckoned for me to listen. I floated over. 

""Apollo, this is Huston. We have a problem."" Came the same voice from the speaker.

""I'm sorry, who?"" I asked, scratching my head. Max grabbed my shoulder as he put us on mute.

""Anjelica motherfucking Huston? She played Morticia Addams in the Addams Family?"" He practically shouted. 

""Oh. I didn't watch that."" I mumbled, and turned off the mute. ""So, Ms. Huston, to what do we owe the pleasure?"" 

""Big fan. Very big fan. I love you, Morticia!"" Max added, nodding furiously. As if she could see. 

""Well, thank you. Always nice to meet a fan, but we've detected a pressure leak in the restroom, so we'll need you to go out through the airlock to see what's wrong. Don't worry, we'll provide guidance if you stay on the line."" Anjelica's voice was strangely reassuring in this potentially deadly situation. 

""Thanks Anjelica! I'll stay on the line with you! What do I do once I'm suited up and outside?"" Never took Max for the fanboy type, but here we were I guess. He practically jumped into the spacesuit and gave me a thumbs up. 

""Oh, I'm not knowledgeable enough to help you with that. But I'm sure you know Christina Ricci?"" 

After a brief pause, a bored, deadpan voice crackled through the speaker. ""Hello, Apollo."" 

""I love you, Wednesday!"" Max shouted as I fired him out the airlock.

""We shall name it in your honour, dear Houston,"" Frank said.

""You are too kind, my brave space man,"" the mayor replied. ""Farewell. He approaches, swift as death.""

""Goodbye, Hou-""

Frank heard an unholy screeching on the other end, enough to make his ears bleed, enough to send convulsions ripping down his chest. He was wracked with pain and twisted in agony, his blood forming floating droplets that splattered against the spacecraft's white walls. 

The receiver was dead. He looked out the window at America down below, and he could see an impossibly big figure traversing the land. 

He tried to contact Houston. The *real* Houston.

There was no answer. ",croatianspy

Apollo: “Commander Houston to the bridge. Commander Houston to the Bridge.”

Commander Houston: “Apollo, Report. What’s out there?”

Apollo: “One unidentified ship in system. It’s orbiting the 4th planet in station-keeping. It isn’t broadcasting an IFF beacon. Sensors indicate no orbiting installations with a ground-tether.”

Commander Houston: “Does the ship appear to belong to the insurrection? I wasn’t made aware that there was a colony ship out this far.”

Apollo: “The ship does not appear of human construction. The lines are too smooth, and the ship’s mass is too far off for a human ship that size.”

Apollo: “A ship of that size should be far more massive than that.”

Commander Houston: “Have they seen us yet?”

Apollo: “I’d have to assume so captain. They have broken their orbit and are heading in our direction.”

Commander Houston: “Apollo, dig out the old NASA first contact package. Prepare for broadcast in the event that the ship isn’t one of ours.”

Apollo: “Understood captain. The ship is approaching at one half sublight. Estimated time until contact is 17 hours.”

Commander Houston: “Understood. Ping me when the ship is an hour out.

*Commander Houston begins to leave the bridge*

Apollo: “Sir, the ship has disappeared from sensors. No subspace tear detected. Detecting another object in system. It’s larger than an orbital habitat. The object appeared at the edge of the system. It just experienced a large power surge.”

Apollo: “It is charging again.”

*Unidentified Ship Reappears*

Apollo: SIR! They just reappeared fifteen kilometers off our bow.

Commander Houston: Apollo, red alert. Notify weapons crews they have two minutes at most.

Apollo: The ship is just sitting there. I am detecting unknown emissions from the ship.

Commander Houston: Broadcast the package, make sure they get it.

“Apollo speaking.”

“Apollo, this is Houston. We have a problem.”

“Yes, Houston, what is it now?”

“Well, God of Truth, have you been watching the news about Hurricane Harvey?”

“Yeeesss…” Apollo said dryly. “I’ve seen some tweets from your orange archon, Real Donald Trump. ‘HISTORIC rainfall...Major rescue operations underway!’ and so on. Wasn’t he supposed to build a huge wall to keep the floodwaters at bay?”

“No...ahh, that’s for something else,” Houston replied. “Anyway, we need your help. Seeing as you’re an intermediary between gods and men, and you also have that sun chariot, we were wondering if you could-”

“Play my golden lyre to delight and inspire your hoplites in their rescue efforts. I’m a little out of practice, but I know a few good Creedence riffs. Let me just tune this baby up real quick…”

“No, actually, with respect,” Houston tried again. “We were thinking since you can command the sun, you might-”

“Did you know I can also command dolphins and swans?” Apollo exclaimed. “Yes, I would gladly send a pod of dolphins and a...umm...whatever a group of swans is called, to help those who are stranded.”

“That is very kind, My Lord,” Houston replied, “but what we had in mind was that you’d-”

“Prophesize when the storm will end? Ah, yes, allow me to get in the ‘prophecy zone,’ as I call it. One second...Hey, on an unrelated topic, what is the web address for weather.com?”

*click*

“Houston, this is Apollo, do you still have a problem?” 

""...""

Reclining into his cloud chair, Apollo chuckled and began idly plucking his lyre.
 
""And I wonder, still I wonder, who'll stop the rain."" he sang softly.

"[WP] You're in a spacecraft, when you hear over the radio ""Apollo, this is Huston. We have a problem""",raaldiin,"""They are coming back."" the statement sends a shockwave throughout the command room. Red lights flick on and the doors to the outside world are locked from both the soldiers on the outside and the well-dressed civilians inside the room. Yet I had no idea how the following actions would change everything. Sitting with my co pilot talking about the local news suddenly the radio would switch on by itself and send the following coded message, ""Apollo, this is Huston. We have a problem.""


No more messages were going to be sent and we snapped to our positions. Books and other items that were in the cockpit were thrown into the back of the ship. The old decaying hangar that housed the state of the art ship would echo as the other pilot yelled to the two military guards ""It's show time!""
One of them yelled back ""It's been an honour mate.""
Then they would turn and run away with the other guard towards a bunker across the deserted airstrip surrounded by the bush.

Inside the ship, I flicked the manual switches and would start to warm up the engines. ""Alright mate we are primed, close the doors and cook the bomb.""
I had a couple of minutes and I looked out at the gum trees. Pulling a photo from my pocket of two brothers in front of a Eureka Stockade museum a warm smile formed. I had always found the story interesting, betrayed and murdered they had fallen like their flag of the Southern Cross.

My co pilot would push the two manual plugs into the old fashioned nuclear missile behind our cockpit. Returning he would strap himself in and then I would allow the engines to take us away from the fake decay making up the facade of the base. Away from our country and above the clouds.

They say that the code was made after an Australian scientist had messed up the spelling of the American city. The change from a normal one was meant to represent the earth needed a response that a space craft could only provide. The ship itself a contradiction for the need of the order.

As we roared away from our planet we noticed a vast rocket heading for our planet. The result was as we watched as the Australian continent was destroyed by a cloud emitting from ground zero, Huston our base.

""It has been a good one mate always knew it was going to be on our shift,"" he said as both put on the emergency oxygen masks for the final approach. Going at speeds no other humans have experience it was for one of the history books. 

""Coming up to it...my God it's really red. Let them know Earth's response.""I said as I flicked the switch and the bomb left and the oxygen ran out. ",forbiddencandle

"[WP] You're in a spacecraft, when you hear over the radio ""Apollo, this is Huston. We have a problem""",raaldiin,"This was supposed to be a routine missions since the Apollo 11 we had carried out hundreds of missions to the moon, we had never expected that contact would ever happen but it did.

""Apollo, this is Houston. We have a problem"" a distorted voice came over the radio speakers in the cabin.

We all knew what this meant and the established protocol dictated radio silence, it was a very sobering moment. 
This is it Earth's last stand, all of our friends, family, all of their lives depended on us. The weight of responsability made our chest heavy, and our hearts pounded hard.

""Initialize thrusters for descent"" said Mark
""Check"" replied Hoff
The module was rattling from the abrupt descent we were making.

In the distance we could see a bright red blurred line dragging across the vaccum of space, it instantly consolidated itself from the back to the front and became a sphere right in front of the moon.

Inmediatly we started seeing lines of red zipping from the sphere into earth, as we had predicted our unwelcomed visitors would start a kinetic bombardment of Earth from lunar orbit, but we had prepared for this moment.

The module´s door open, we rushed into through the metallic structure, neon green lights illuminated the catwalk, the sound of metal clank filled the room, I took a look at Mark, tears were rolling down his blood shot eyes, his dark hair was drenched in sweat, jaw clenched hard.

We all knew if we failed it would be the end of humanity.

""Engage as quickly as possible"" Mark shouted in a voice that interrupted the clanking of metal.

We all rushed to our stations.

""Station 2 engaging"" I shouted.

The sound of a revving jet engine and a high pitched tone which indicated I was good to go.

A thunderous sound came from behind me as soon as I decided to open fire, bursts of rapid moving green energy propelled across space into the red tinted glowing sphere.

""Station 3 Engaging"" as soon as I heard the announcement I could see blue glowing lines zipping quickly.

The sphere did not take to it kindly approaching to our position quickly, then the smaller ones became more visible there were hundreds, red lines zipped to them to us, impacting all around us.

""Station 1 charging""

If it weren´t the decisive moment of our species as a collective I would say this would have been the most beautiful light spectacle anyone could ever see.

Station 3 was hit and exploded with a huge rumble, Hoff was gone.

""Station 1 engaging""

A massive burst of purple illuminated us, as it flew directly towards the sphere, it was a direct hit, and a orange glow with a yellow tint engulfed the sphere.

It was still moving toward us.

""For earth, for humanity...for life""

""Apollo, this is Houston""
""Apollo, this is Houston""
The radio continued to chatter as it drifted off to space.

"[WP] You're in a spacecraft, when you hear over the radio ""Apollo, this is Huston. We have a problem""",raaldiin,"We were already 160,000 kilometers up and steadily climbing. Colonel McKenzie was still having difficulty wrapping her head around this particular mission. Nobody had been to the moon in 45 years. Honestly, there just hadn't been a reason too. That is until some kid from Wyoming with a very powerful telescope snapped some very interesting pictures of the lunar surface during the eclipse. The pictures showed something that Colonel McKenzie knew to be impossible: artificial light on the moon. That kid, a Mr. Eric Pendleton was currently being given an extended stay at the Kennedy space center, where watchful eyes are ensuring that his discovery doesn't find it's way to the press before her team has the chance to find out if he is right or wrong. Looking around, she took a mental inventory of the rest of the crew. For once, Uncle Sam had spared no expense, and her supervisors had actually listened to her when she made her crew recommendations. To her left she had Colonel Brad Simmons, a decorated Air Force pilot who was recruited because of his reputation of surviving impossible scenarios. His job is to pilot the craft, and react to any changing situations that may arise. Behind her and to her right she had Jessica Kramer, a xenobiologist with an open mind, recruited because Ms. Kramer refuses to accept that humans are the only sentient life in existence. Seated in the middle was Marek Matenski, Linguist, math whiz, all around genius, tasked with finding a way to communicate with whatever the hell is up there. and the back left was Mikhail Pavalov, the engineer who designed the Apollo 21 spacecraft, and tasked with effecting any repairs that might be necessary. This marvel of engineering that they were all careening towards the moon in at breakneck speeds is altogether classified, and many of the systems aren't supposed to even exist for another 30 to 50 years. The original apollo missions required three days travel time to reach the moon, but this new craft operated under fundamentally different principles and under constant acceleration at approximately 1g (turning around at the halfway point for deceleration at 1g) that has been reduced to about 5 hours including the solid fuel burn to break free from Earth's gravity well, and the landing itself. At just past the halfway mark, they had already completed rotation of the craft, and began decelerating. As Colonel Simmons was preparing his mid flight report for the pencil pushers in Washington he heard a beep as the radio engaged. 

""Apollo ... Houston. We ... oblem ... ver."" 

""Mikhail, verify antenna alignment""

""Rodger, realignment complete in 3, 2, 1, mark.""

""Houston, this is Apollo, did not copy last, send again.""

""Apollo, this is houston, we have a serious problem.""

""Mikhail, mic in. Houston send message, over. 

""Ladies and gentlemen, it has been an honor to have worked with you"" 

Colonel McKenzie was the first to see it. Dozens of large flashes all across their view of the Earth. Dozens turned into hundreds. ""My god"" she said. She couldn't believe it. 

""Houston this is Apollo, Respond."" 

""Houston. This is Apollo 21 Actual. Respond.""

""It's no use"" Colonel Simmons said. ""They aren't there anymore, no one is.""

""what continent were we over?"" Matenski asked.

""That was mostly the Pacific, most of what we saw was both eastern China, and western North America. How the hell did the Koreans get that many missiles?""

[WP] The world has been ravished by the zombie virus but you have heard millions of people escaped into an underground city. Write about you finally finding the hatch entrance.,-hisdark-,"I scrape the dirt off with my bare hands, the excitement almost intolerable. After all these years of stories, journals and myths I have found it. The Entryway.

I dodged death incarnate for years, scavenging supplies along the way and escaping death by just the slimmest of margins. All to find this place. It was buried in a hillside, hidden in a thick forest. There were plenty of bunkers and underground shelters after the event but they all failed for one reason or another. They had to abandon their underground facilities and come to the surface. Most died.

Everyone had heard of the radio signal right before everything went out. Haven. The brain child of some unknown group, Haven was a fully functioning underground city. Millions were taken in, millions. It had to be a sprawling place. Farms, generators, air filters. The scope must be enormous.

That's why they had hidden the entries, tiny hatches to vertical shafts leading to a connective network of tunnels and trams.

And I had found one.

I cranked on the wheel, turning it to unlock the hatch. It creaks and squeals but I don't have to worry about the horde hearing anymore. I'll be safe.

The hatch opens and musty air spills out. I drop onto the ladder and close the hatch behind me, seeing a few straggler zombies appear and shambling their way towards the hatch.

I laugh at them and slam shut the hatch, turning the interior handle to lock the hatch behind me. Safety.

The climb down is long and dark, with each rung on the ladder I feel unease creeping up my spine. I can hear the zombies hammering on the door but they will never be my problem again.

My feet hit the flat surface at the bottom of the shaft.

I turn and remove the half dead flashlight from my pants pocket and turn it on. The light reveals everything I had hoped for!

Wait.

It's a wall. Twenty feet away from me is a solid wall. Between me and the wall is several shelving units, a bunk bed, toilet and other general essentials. At the end of the tube is a rotting corpse huddled over an old radio.

The worst of it is the words written on the back wall in dried, blackened blood.

Haven is a lie.

I drop to my knees and scream into the tube. Into the darkness. I don't see the sleeping bags moving on the bunk bed, I don't see the corpse by the radio twitching and moving. I lift my head from my hands too late. Too late to stop the hands, the teeth, the pain.

Even in the last moments it doesn't matter.

Haven is a lie.

It's all a lie. We were never going to survive.",jacktherambler
[WP] The world has been ravished by the zombie virus but you have heard millions of people escaped into an underground city. Write about you finally finding the hatch entrance.,-hisdark-,"Tears rolled down my grimy cheeks for the ump-teenth time this week. Gripped tightly in my hand was a smaller hand 5 weeks old, gangrene firmly set in. I wept as quietly as possible in a corner of a decrepit, half crumbling building for my daughter. Curled up on the bare concrete floor, I clutched the last remnant of my family, and cried myself to sleep with a brisk wind flowing in through broken windows, stealing away my warmth.

*""Daddy, why did the dead people wake up?""*

*Her cute little face appeared in my vision*

*""I don't really know Pumpkin."" I smiled for her. ""But don't worry, I've heard stories of a magical place.""*

*Her face lightened up a bit.*

*""Where no dead people try to wake up?""*

*""That's right pumpkin."" The smile that was on her face at that moment drowned out the monochrome decay in the background.*

*But suddenly, the brightness in her smile cracked and the monochrome leaked into her smile.*

*""Daddy?""*

*""Yeah Pumpkin?""*

*""Why did Mommy stay behind?"" Tears where brimming in her eyes now.*

*I felt my the dam holding the tears back start to give.*

I opened my eyes to the early morning violet as a burning ball of orange peeked over the horizon. I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes, but my hands just ended up soaked with tears again. *Must've been having that dream again,* I thought to myself. I always ended up crying in my sleep nowadays. I dragged myself up from the cold, hard concrete floor and stashed the severed hand in my bag. I felt the cool steel of the .357 Magnum  as I carefully placed the hand back in it's spot. I pulled the revolver out and just stared at it for a while. Two bullets gleamed in the cylinder, not that both of them were meant to be fired. 

*One more day* I told myself, throwing the bag over my shoulders, and stepped out of the building.

I had nothing to eat. I had nothing to drink. I had nothing to do but walk.

And walk I did.

after the sun rose above the horizon and the orange started fading out of the sky allowing blue to take over, I stumbled across an old wooden sided building. It wasn't very big and looked like it would fall over if I sneezed on it, but I went inside nonetheless. You never pass up an opportunity for any sort of nourishment. Inside I scavenged out a dead mouse and an old can of beer. With my newfound treasure, I sat just outside the shack looking thing and munched on the mouse. The fur got stuck in my teeth, but that was nothing in the face of edible meat. The beer was flat but so delicious. I hadn't had beer for years.

After the bountiful raid on the shack, I continued walking. I walked past a few houses which had nothing of use in them. I walked past an old trainyard, which was also barren of resources of any kind. I walked past a forested area with a few shamblers crawling or walking along aimlessly. I walked on and on and on. The sun was directly above and the heat of mid-day was relentless. Sweat poured down my face and seeped down my back, but I kept walking. I had to. Without walking, I had nothing else.

When the sun was beginning to find the other horizon, I decided to go off the road. The grass field to my left swayed invitingly in the light breeze. I walked through the field for an eternity until the western sky started to turn a fiery orange. Exhausted from an entire day of walking again, my focus started to wane, but I kept walking. Eventually my walking turned to stumbling, but I kept going. 

A noise suddenly hit my ears. Metal. A scrap of metal in a field? My brain was too foggy to understand. I moved my foot back and looked down. There really was metal in the field, except it didn't appear to be a scrap of any kind. A huge frame surrounded the hatch with what looked like locking mechanisms all around. A massive circular steel hatch in the middle of a field. 

Tears welled up in my eyes. I didn't stop them. 

""I found it Pumpkin."" I mumbled to myself through my sniffles. ""I told you I would."" The sniffles turned into wailing and I crumpled to my knees on the hatch. I dropped the bag to the ground and unzipped it. I pulled the hand and revolver out of the bag.

*This is no sanctuary,* I thought to myself grabbing the revolver. *How could anything be sanctuary without them here.""* The revolver twitched in my shaking hands. *How could I let myself get here without them!* Rage and anger took over as the cold steel touched the side of my head. *Nothing could be happy ever again without them!* The trigger slowly crept back. The cylinder slowly rotated. My teeth clenched and tears slowly rolled down my grimy face.

*I love you so much Pumpkin*

The hammer snapped.",wadsworth4

[WP] The world has been ravished by the zombie virus but you have heard millions of people escaped into an underground city. Write about you finally finding the hatch entrance.,-hisdark-,"The world was hit by the zombie virus. Except everything turned out sort of like that CW show based on that zombie comic from that fucked up DC comic print named after the fear of some shit. 

First it was fine since these zombies retained normal intelligence capacity but the ability to transfer over the virus with a scratch or sex soon led to more zombies due to fuckwit hipsters wanting to be a cool zombie leading to more zombies than brains which soon led to a chaotic George Romero style shit with a hint of Stephen King somewhere since the fuckers couldn't get brains and their mental capacity and physical appearance had degenerated. Some of the clever zombies managed to work out how to survive with what little they had in ways they won't tell us but the rest went fucking psycho which leads to the next point. 

A group of humans had apparently vanished into an underground city somewhere near Vancouver in British Columbia because Canada had banned Zombie on Human contact and whatever due to a new prime minister after Trudeau became a zombie. After sitting on boat from Ireland and a drive through empty American highways, I had finally reached this magical city. My homeland of Europe had been completely razed to the ground due to high population density, low space and more zombies. Anyway I found the magical hatch to this city somewhere in the strange outer lands of what was Vancouver.

In fear and trepidation my heart pounded like a thousand drums in a huge parade. Sweat dropped from every pore like I was a water fall. I could imagine the peace and sanctity from when I could live in this underground city of sane humans. My humans. My kind. (Not that I have zombiephobia as they named it, my SO was a zombie before she disappeared to the new zombie homeland)

I open the hatch. There are some metallic stairs. I close the hatch behind me. I climb down in anticipation of a welcome party. I reach a lift and hit the only button on it. Down I go, storey by storey in anticipation that I have reached the new Human metropolis. The bastion of peace and serenity.

The lift doors open.

I see people looking back at me. My heart dropped. 
Pale skin. Blonde hair. 
They were zombies. 
But what stood out more was that they weren't all Romeros.

""The fuck...?"" I creak out.
The zombie dude that was probably a military man before the virus steps forward from the crowd.
""Sir, how did YOU, a human find us?"" He asked.
""Uh... Shit... Fuck... Ummm... "" I went, ""I got told this was the new Human paradise?"" 
The military man looks puzzled for a second and then his face returns to normal.
""STEVENS!"" He yells with the ferocity of a thousand lions.
A meek zombie man appears from somewhere and cuts through the crowd.
""The fuck you want man"" he mutters
""You've been spreading bullshit for humans again haven't you?"" The military dude replied annoyed
""So what if I have? Free food right?"" He lazily retorted. My heart dropped even lower.
""You fucking idiot, this poor bastard has probably come from Europe in hope and you've led him straight to our base. There might be more like him coming"" he belted angrily.

It suddenly made sense. This must've been a plot by that Stevens dude and maybe other zombies to lead us to a false utopia to be food for them. Might as well go hide in Alaska now. I started to edge away.

The military man turned back to me quickly.
""Don't move."" He stated with no uncertainty. He continued, ""We're the last organised set of zombies that haven't gone full Walking Dead. As much as some here may want, we can't let you go back out there and get killed because believe it or not, we have consciences and sympathy and shit. We've managed to work out how to fix the brain hunger thing without the real stuff and we're working on a cure and other bits for when everything is solved but until then you can't leave."" 

The other zombies start to murmur when a familiar face pops up. Lo and behold, it's my ex SO who became a human racist and ran off. Fuck.

""What's your name sir?"" The military dude asked.
""J-james Bolton"" I quivered back.
""Right, James I'm going to take you to the boss man and we'll set you on some work based on your abilities and we'll go from there. Come with me"" the man stated. The zombies cleared a path and at the end stood my SO who was staring dumbfounded. I think she wanted to eat me so she ran away. I don't know. I followed after the military man...",randomfromworld02

[WP] The world has been ravished by the zombie virus but you have heard millions of people escaped into an underground city. Write about you finally finding the hatch entrance.,-hisdark-,"In the days before, I loved to be alone. I'd said more then once I'd be okay never talking to anyone ever again. A hermit's life for me!

Now.

Some days you might not even see one. The skies and streets would be empty, not a thing in sight. Person, cloud, dead. 

I survived for the days like that. It was easier to pretend to be normal, to pretend that we were out of milk and I'd gone to the store and gotten distracted on the walk back. 

And then something would groan, and I'd remember what a gun felt like when I pulled the trigger. 

I missed Katie. 

At the beginning, the rumors of safe havens had been many, but as people died and everything became scarce, some things lurked. If you looked carefully, you could follow the bunny back to the rabbit hole. 

And you know, maybe it was stupid, but I'd really thought. I'd really wanted to believe that underground there was a whole city of people. Of survivors. People. 

I laugh. I laugh so hard I can't breathe, because it's funny, you know? It's really, really funny. 

I let the hatch close, glancing up at the clear, cloudless sky. An underground city. A safe haven. Millions of people. 

Damn shame it's empty.",uluholo

Today, as is often the case, the customer is being…problematic.",Aesthetys,"""Iuno, have you seen *Necromantia Nova Altera Editione*? I cannot find it anywhere,"" Agatha sighs. Her years of experience shine through her face, leaving it rumpled and framed by long silver hair. Worn brown fabrics with a bright blue belt and fresh yellow stitches hide her tall, athletic figure. She's an older woman but still aided by her relentless stamina.

""I'm afraid not, grandma. I've seen the first edition, though. It's already in the 'N' stack over there,"" the teenage girl replies while pointing to one of the large piles. She's wearing dark jeans and a tank top that desperately scream for male attention, but braces that keep the dreamy types out of reach.

They are both surrounded by books everywhere except in the bookcases where they belonged. In the centre of the library, a small unsorted pile and around the edges, an enormous amount of books is neatly stacked and sorted by alphabet. 

The two were cleaning up the aftermath of a particularly nasty case of mischief. A week ago, Iuno had shown her grandmother's library to some of her classmates. She thought that the others would appreciate the enormous collection of old and mysterious books, but they were not as easily impressed. Instead, they trashed the place out of boredom, much to Iuno's dismay.

The night had gotten her a few compliments from the boys, who enjoyed some of the older, more occult works. But other than that, she had gained nothing but regret. Immediately afterwards, she'd run to her grandmother to apologise.

Grandmother Agatha had reacted surprisingly calmly, saying she'd probably seen much worse, although she did make Iuno promise to help her clean up. Iuno gladly had gladly done so, and here they were, nearly done sorting through all of it. After they'd sorted through all of the titles, they could finally start refilling the bookshelves.

""You don't think... one of the boys might have taken it?"" Agatha said in a worried tone.

""The boys? No, never. They think reading is lame. They wouldn't even touch a book.""

""Well, from the looks of it, they've conquered that fear stellarly,"" Agatha remarked, gesturing to all of the empty racks. ""What are their names again?""

""Uh, there were Robert Dufrey, Alex Humphrey and Ron Acker. Oh, and Joe Sephtis.""

""Sephtis, you say?"" Agatha asks as she looks up and stares out one of the ceiling windows. ""I know that name all too well. His grandfather was quite something back in the day.""

""Wait, did you date Joe's grandfather?"" Iuno replies and looks back at Agatha, who starts laughing.

""No, no! Heavens no. No, Joe's grandfather - Jeremiah - was 'quite something' for an entirely different reason. If Joe is anything like him, I wouldn't be surprised if that's where we find the missing book.

Come on, grab your coat. We better hurry and hope he hasn't done anything stupid.""

Iuno and Agatha both grab their coats, go outside and make sure the door is locked, as they wouldn't want anything to undo the hours of work they'd just put in. 

Joe lives on the edge of town, in a large detached house. His father is one of the more successful shop owners in town. He owns both the grocery store and the construction market and thus can afford to buy a charming place like this.

""Their car is gone, grandma. His parents are probably gone,"" Iuno remarks.

The house is completely dark, except for a weak orange flickering in the living room.

""Oh, but Joe's here alright,"" Agatha says, pointing at the orange glow.

Iuno rings the doorbell, but no one answers. Agatha walks around to the living room window, peers inside and waves Iuno to come over. Inside they see a pentagram chalked on the floorboard, a large collection of nasty looking potions and candles all over, most of them still lit. On the table in the corner, they find their book, opened somewhere halfway.

""Ugh, I'm afraid we're late, Iuno,"" Agatha sighs.

A shiver rolls down Iuno's spine as she feels a cold touch on her left shoulder. She turns around and faces a white and blue glow, vaguely resembling the figure of a man... or a boy.

""Joe? Is that you?""",Perditor

"[WP] You are a librarian at the world’s greatest library of magic and eldritch lore. Your job is to go out and collect overdue library books from customers. Today, as is often the case, the customer is being…problematic.",Aesthetys,"I knocked on the door twice, hard, and said, ""This is the Archivist.""  No response.  I knocked again, and shouted, ""I'm here to collect the *Atlas Planar*.  It's overdue.""  Still nothing.

This was a fairly routine house call for me, though it wasn't looking like it would stay that way.  I am the Archivist for The Library.  It doesn't have a name, it is simply *the* Library.  Every book, tablet, and scroll ever made exists in at least one copy on our shelves.  As Archivist, I work under the Librarian keeping track of archival materials.  A lot of our archives are books with magical properties that are impossible to replicate, even if the exact words are reprinted.  We call them Grimoires, and only a select few can check them out.  It wasn't uncommon for me to have to come and collect them; some of our cardholders are centuries, even millennia old, and that tends to distort one's perception of time.  They forget to bring them back, I come to remind them, and all is well.  Most of the time.

I knocked again, and shouted, ""You will return the book to me, now!  If you do not, I will deprive you of your door, your life, and the book, in that exact order.""

I waited a few seconds.  No sound from within.  ""I have given you fair warning, and you have ignored it.  I will now carry out my threat.""  The presentation is critical here; in magical circles, you aren't taken seriously if you don't put on a bit of a show.  I slammed my shoulder into the door, but it held fast.  For such an old place, it had a sturdy door.

I whistled and shouted, ""Dog!""  Scragg Dog isn't actually a dog, he's an ancient abomination, and my familiar.  He typically takes the form of a dog to avoid scaring passersby.

Scragg, from where he stood beside me, took several slow steps back, shifting closer to his true form as he did so.  It wasn't unlike a dog, just with more teeth, claws, and other deadly spikes of bone than any dog should rightfully have.  Having satisfied himself that he was far enough back, he charged full tilt into the door.

And bounced off, whimpering in an unusually doglike fashion.  ""Warded, huh Dog?"" I asked.  He nodded pitifully.  ""Brilliant,"" I sighed.  ""Why do people still think they can pull this stuff on us?  We're agents of the Library.  We know every trick in the book.  We know every trick in every book.""  I beat out a careful, melodic rhythm on the door.  It exploded inwards, sending a storm of razor sharp splinters through.

I immediately wished I hadn't.  That ward was bidirectional, but not meant to keep someone out.  It was meant to keep something in.  That much was abundantly clear from the blood and ichor splattered over the walls, the floor, the ceiling, and even the windows.  It was like someone had attempted to redecorate the place with a stick of dynamite and a can of paint.  I remembered the book I was after.  The *Atlas Planar*.  Clearly, this cardholder had opened a portal to someplace dangerous, and something had come through.  The question was, what?

I stepped inside, and put a barrier over the door.  Dog stood behind me, his teeth bared.  All of them.  I needed to hunt this thing down, and for that I needed to make sure it didn't slip out.  Then, I pulled out my cut down double barreled shotgun, and swung it open.  No way of knowing what type of ammo to use until I knew what I was dealing with.  I sighed, loaded two concussive shells, and closed it.  I handload all of my shells; things like silver buckshot, rune-engraved slugs, and alchemical gunpowder substitutes aren't used in commercial shells, and they make my life much easier.  My concussive shells have no actual shot in them, just an alchemical compound that produces a massive blast of magical force.  It wouldn't kill, but it would buy me some time when I ran into the target.  ""Dog, seek,"" I said.

We found the book before we found the creature (or it found us).  That was good.  I glanced at the open page.  Bold writ, at the top, was the word ""Abyss"".  Abyssal spirits are tough, fast, and quiet.  And they really, really don't like fire.  Dragon's breath rounds it was.  I was reloading, when I heard it.  Not the Abyssal.  Dog.  He was letting out a hostile noise, like one hundred discordant growls at once.  I froze.  It was close.  Right behind me, most likely.  I would never have noticed, but even beings from dimensions of pure shadow and silence can't get past Dog.

I acted all at once, turning, slipping the shell into the gun and snapping it shut so fast I almost caught my fingers in the breech, while shouting, ""Seek!""  Dog was upon the Abyssal before I was fully turned around.  I fired both barrels without thinking twice.  Abyssals hate fire, but not Dog.  Fire doesn't have much effect on Dog; it hurts him, but it doesn't cause any damage.  I'd have to sacrifice a small animal to him by way of apology later.  Probably a chicken.  He likes chicken.  Right now, though, all that mattered was survival, and there was no way I could get a clear shot without Dog pinning the abyssal down.  If it was loose, I'd probably waste my shot.  Worse, I might damage the book.

Thankfully, Dog has enough sharp and pointy bits to keep an enemy fairly still.  I hit home and the Abyssal just....vanished.  Evaporated?  Dissolved?  Melted?  I'm not sure how to describe it.  Point is, it was gone.  That's what I meant when I said Abyssals hate fire.  No more Abyssal, no more problem.

Except the flaming floorboards.  They were close to the book.  Not good.  I ran for it.  Yes, I was going to get first or second degree burns from that, but I'd survived worse, and I wasn't about to let the book get damaged.  Yes, I could have asked Dog to get it, but while I trust him with my life, I don't trust him with Archival materials.  He's not built for the gentle handling they require.

I snatched up the book, and turned to leave.  Worse news, I was in a corner.  Once again, I had failed to think things through.  The fire was spreading, cutting off means of escape, and the room was, as misfortune would have it, windowless.  I had to think my way out of this.  Fortunately, I already had my answer.  I may not have trusted dog with the book, but I did trust him with my life.  I held the book close with one arm, curled in, and waved the other, yelling, ""Dog, fetch!  Fetch me!""

The next thing I knew, teeth sank into my arm.  It hurt, but he was saving my life, and I had just shot him with dragon's breath rounds, so I gave him a break.  He dragged me through the fire while I wrapped myself around the book, shielding it with my body.  The moment he let go, I rolled frantically to put out the flames.  When I was certain I wasn't on fire, I sprinted out the front door, lowering the shield as I got there.

Once outside, I checked the book.  I knew every imperfection by heart, and there weren't any new ones.  It was undamaged.  I may have suffered second degree burns and annoyed my familiar, but the book was safe.  That was what mattered.",Mateus_ex_Machina
"[WP] You are a librarian at the world’s greatest library of magic and eldritch lore. Your job is to go out and collect overdue library books from customers. Today, as is often the case, the customer is being…problematic.",Aesthetys,"""Librarian!"" Echoed the voice of the secretary.

""Present"" came the weary response.

""Alchemy and you Vol 34 is overdue! Kindly retrieve it from one 'maximus lode' at the €&gt;¢ frat house of Winterhold!""

""No need to shout"" groaned the librarian, massaging their temples and rousing themselves from their bench for a quick elixr. 

""This volume on alchemical alcohol is waitlisted into next year! Time is of the essence! I am prepping you for immediate ether-jump now!

""Wait, wait, I need a moment to prepare spells and ready my equipment"" said the librarian but it was no use. They had only the time to grab their mug and cloak before they felt themselves pulled to the front step of the frat house itself. 

Pulling on their cloak the librarian took stock of their situation. Inside the party hummed, barely audible over the hasty sound containment runes scrawled one over another around the door and threshold.

With a sigh the librarian took a sip of cold elixr and withdrew their affectionately named ""late stick"". The door was demolished with a lazy flick and, upon entering the party, was reconstructed behind them.

Across the room a fountain constructed with a garden hose spilled what was hopefully water onto a thoroughly used book. This book in turn was flowing with a frothing yellow foam on one side and a thin clear liquid on the other.

Wanting to be over with this as quickly as possible the librarian quietly disenchanted the liquor fountain and sent the book back to the library through the ether. In the past this process would have been conducted automatically from the library but after an incident that brought back the book along with a nest of drakes the practice was retired.

Turning to leave, the librarian was met face to face with a scaly figure looking shockingly sober given the atmosphere. 

""I wasn't finished with that book"" drawled the student.

Fishing in their bag, the librarian replied simply ""I'm afraid you are in fact finished"" ",studentofcubes

The doctors told him the reason he's balding at 27 is the enormous amount of stress he is under. Not only does he have to be an intern at the largest spell-based library in the universe, but he has to collect the overdue books. When Don drew his job out of the hat, this was not what he expected. 

   Some of the overdue books contain some powerful stuff. This book is no different. A three-foot nothing elf was shouting gibberish at the top of his lungs, all while standing on top of a book that added more than a few inches to his height. Don weaved through a couple more fireballs, before diving beneath a oak dining table.

Today, as is often the case, the customer is being…problematic.",Aesthetys,"""Sir, you need more than a Horror blocking your door to make me go away!"" My voice was firm as I saw the horror simply looming around the door of the small home.

Honestly, people can be hard, I know no one likes to pay the fine on overdue books, but come on! That's no excuse to act like a spoiled child and block the door. But I guess in a way I'm at a fault, I was the one who wanted to have more action on the library...

I work for the greatest library in the world. The Great Library of Magical and Eldritch Knowledge, founded by the great Archmage Aldebrand. Dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge in all shapes and forms the Archmage ended up forming the library, and with the time it grew to become the greatest of all libraries.
 
Now, as any other institution, there are rules and protocols to follow, if you want to take out a book you need an identification and a certifiable address, also you leave a deposit that is given back once you return the book, and if you are late you need to pay the fine. Really, whats so hard in that?!

""I'm not giving the book back!""

I can only let out my breath, that is not the customer speaking up.

""Sir! Please drop the book, that is not you talking, is the book, so please drop the book or better yet! Throw it out through the window to me, I will even pay the fine for you, what do you say?"" Honestly, I am already offering a huge deal here, he can't be hoping for a better deal.

My income will surely receive a blow but I think is better to keep a good record of the book recovery rate, we are reaching a really good 90% this season, it would be great to finally be able to say we get almost every book. There are exceptions sure but...

""No! I will not relinquish this power!"" 

Oh for the love of! Really?! Another intent of a dark lord!? Why are we not checking if people are susceptible to being influenced by the books? We need more than an identification and an address... really, sure knowledge is for everyone but we should be more careful.

I guess there is no option then.

""Sir, last warning, the book or I will take my own measures, and I won't be paying for any damages! The library is not responsible for any damage or lost property while in the recovery of a book with ten days of being overdue!"" 

As I feel the horrors inside his house preparing to burst through the door I get my Gauntlet ready, as I feel it fit perfectly on my left, I know I'm ready. Really, Aldebrand was the best. 

You see, those who work in the recovery of the books are given one of the best trinkets made by Aldebrand, the Gauntlet. A seemingly innocent tool couldn't be more in the wrong though, is full of runes on the inside that not only serve as protection but as a tool to nullify magic... in this case, to also cut the magic influence on the owner of the book.

As the shadows burst through the door, I raise my left hand, the gauntlet getting at work immediately, the horrors become unable to pass through the shield that is now enveloping me in a white light. I just love this thing. I see on the face of the man that he hasn't really eaten anything for a few days...probably haven't slept either.

""What?! How can you face the powers of the dark!?"" He exclaims trying to keep a facade of power, but he will soon be meeting the floor.

""Yeah, yeah, whatever you say, sir, now time to sleep""

As I stretch my left I take the book away from his grasp without much resistance. The Gauntlet got at work immediately, as it touches the book all the flow of magic in the house gets cut. The man collapses and I simply take him with my right arm before he reaches the floor.

Looking at the small place I see my objective. A couch. I toss the man in it, he needs all the rest he can have. I look at the book that seems to try to open itself but finds a heavy resistance in my Gauntlet.

""Now now, you already had your fun, time to go back home"" 

As the book keeps on trying to get free of my grasp I decide I had enough, I decided to simply lock it in my bag. When I open the bag a tentacle reaches for the book and takes it away, ending the resistance.

""There you go, if you didn't want to be uncomfortable you should have played nice. Enjoy the bag"" 

The bag moves for a while before keeping still. I decide I should do what I came to do, as I look around the man house I found what I wanted. His wallet.

""Okay, overdue for eleven days, that is three for a day, plus the fine for having a Library Keeper come for the property... and I will probably need to take a Taxi to reach the portal... tell you what man, I will pay for it this time. But I will be taking ten to pay lunch""

As I took the ten bill, and go out of the house after closing the door I can't really avoid thinking the same thing I thought at the beginning of the day.

""We should ask more than an identification and an address, it is the third intent of a dark lord this week"" 

Well, whatever, they pay me to get the books back. As I was relaxing for a moment my gauntlet made a sound I hated. I hear three voices speaking at the same time in a weird harmony.

""Reporting to Book Recovery Employee Leopold, report back Leopold"" 

I sigh before answering back.

""It's Leo... only Ma can call me Leopold... Whats up?""

I swear I could hear them chuckle at the receiving end.

""We got records that a book is overdue, today will be ten days, we thought you could check""

""You mean, I should check right?""

They chuckled. 

""Good you understand, the missing book is, Divination Through Bones an Introduction to Necromancy""

"[WP] You are a librarian at the world’s greatest library of magic and eldritch lore. Your job is to go out and collect overdue library books from customers. Today, as is often the case, the customer is being…problematic.",Aesthetys,"I glanced down to make sure I was proper in appearance, didn't want the man thinking ill of me. With a swift motion, I knocked on his door. Silence, what felt like minutes passed without a reply.

I checked my list to make sure this was the right address. Indeed, it had been. 27th More-berry drive. The man owed us the book. ""101 Ways To Be An Elemental Mage."" I sighed heavily, usually with these overdue books, the customers tend to be... problematic, somehow.

I knocked on the door once more, and as I waited, I recalled the last time I tried collecting an overdue book, the owner had been an old lady who was *way* too much into, well, let's just say unique experiences.

Finally the man opened the door. He showed of glowing black hair that was spiked upwards and had on a long, dark blue cloak with a hood leaning casually behind his soldiers.
""Who're you?"" He asked, adding a sudden and unexpected hiccup after the question. ""What do you want?""

""Uh..."" I paused and glanced at my list. ""Are you one mister Alcott Sterling?""

He silently nodded.

""Yes, well, I'm here to collect that book you owe the library, as well as the fee. You're seventeen days overdue, so that'd be, let's see, yes, 80 silverian coins.""

""Oh, Indeed."" Replied he. ""I'll get the book for you."" He turned around and I watched as he wandered into a different room. I sighed in relief. *Looks like I finally got an easy one.""

I barely even finished my thought when I felt a sharp, stinging pain in my chest. It didn't take me long to realize that Alcott hit me with a lightning bolt. Judging by the amount of pain I felt, I was quite sure he intended for the bolt to be deadly, luckily I was wearing a suit of magical armor, provided by the library where I work.

""Still alive, huh?"" Alcott asked in an annoyed tone, confirming my suspicious. ""Guess we'll be doing this the hard way.""

""Dude, I have, like fifty more of these to do, can we not do this right now?"" I exclaimed. ""I just want to do my job. Why won't you just give me the book?""

""Because I'm not done with it!"" Replied Alcott. ""Do you realize how much power I have thanks to that book, and I can get so much more! Plus, where would I even get those silverian coins?""

""Why do I always have this conversation?"" I asked. ""You can just Google all that stuff, and then you wouldn't even need to put yourself in a position where you owe some rare and hard to find magical currency.""

""Yeah, well, I don't care. The book is mine now, and I am keeping it, even if I need to ki-""

""Kill me for it?"" I interrupted. ""I've been in this job for ten years now, and hundreds of others have tried, it always ends with them surrendering and giving up the books, or being hospitalized, and I would like to avoid the second situation as much as I possibly can.""

""Just leave already!"" He yelled, and before I even realized what had happened, a fireball hit me and knock me off my feet. 

I got back up as fast as I could, and just barely avoided a second fireball he threw at me. Within an instant, I chanted the words to create a magical barrier around me.

""Look, I'm going to give you one last chance to just give me the book. I don't want to resort to violence."" I said, hoping it would get through to him, but knowing it would not.

""No chance!"" He said, flinging another fireball in my direction.

Then it happened, something that happens so often that you'd laugh if you knew how often.

His fireball hit the magical barrier, which deflected it, and it headed straight back to him, and within a few seconds, he was on the ground, injured by his own conjuration. I destroyed the barrier, and used a spell to find the location of the book.

By the time I got back to where he knocked himself out, his body was gone. The Magical Paramedics already took care of it.

Evans, true to form, sweeps back his enveloping black robe and gives a loud, deep laugh. “That’s what this is about? You petty, small-minded fool! With this grimoire my power is unmatchable, the world lies at my feet, and you ask for it back?”

I give my beard a quick scratch. Mister Evans keeps his home a little on the warm side, I’m surprised he doesn’t melt inside all those robes. When it comes to his line of work though, appearance is everything I guess. “Mister Evans, you loaned out that copy of Sigard’s The Eldritch Powers Beyond Reality’s Veil almost six months ago. We’ve sent several letters requesting you adhere to the four-week terms of your loan, but received no response.”

“My name is Lord Deathblack!” He takes a second and visibly composes himself. “I would appreciate it if you used my full title rather than my old name. I don’t go by Jamie Evans anymore.”

I take a quick glance down at my notebook to hide the smirk. “If you’d like the details on your library account amended, you’ll have to put a request in writing to our accounts manager. But I have to say, if you don’t return the book, we’ll be forced to revoke your membership.”

Evans takes a step back, his boots clicking on the bare stone floor, and picks up the book in question from where it sits on a lectern - made, predictably, of bleached bone - beside his ridiculously oversized chair. He lets it fall open in his palm, and a grin flits across his hooded face. “I don’t think I’ll be returning the book. With its power, there’s nothing you can do to stop me, and once I rule the world your petty library will rest firmly under my heel!”

I sigh. Every time. What is it about tomes of eldritch lore that makes people so delusional? “Mister Evans, a few points-”

“Silence!” He cuts me off. Now that’s just being rude. “Leave now and I’ll let you keep your life. But rest assured that I will have my vengeance for this impertinence!”

“Mister Evans the Arcane Library contains almost thirty thousand books, treatises and scrolls, representing more than eight thousand years of accumulated magical knowledge and research.”

“I don’t care how big your library is, you’ve given me its greatest treasure! And with its power the world - and you - shall kneel before me!” Wisps of shadow begin curling up from between the pages of the book, collecting around his arms.

“Sigard’s Eldritch Powers does indeed contain several powerful incantations, Mister Evans, but it’s merely one thirty-thousandth of the Library’s collected knowledge. You’ve studied one book for six months.” I put my notebook back in my pocket and allow myself a little smile. “I’ve worked with the entire Library catalogue for the last fifteen years. I’m going to ask you again: will you return our book?”

The shadows wreathing his arms thicken, and Evans draws himself up as tall as he can. If he wants to be a despotic overlord he’s going to have to get better at his imperious loom. “I will not,” he snaps. “And you will regret taking that tone with Lord Deathblack!”

He raises a hand from the book, and a cacophony of sibilant voices burbles up alongside the animate blackness he casts forth at me. I mutter the Twin Syllables of Stifling from Nulfar’s Panharmonic Studies, and Evans’ spell dies before it gets halfway, dissolving back into shadow and silence.

“Last chance, Mister Evans.”

He screams at me and clenches his fist. A whispering roar fills the air as the room’s shadows deepen and the flames of its braziers dim. A pit of absolute blackness manifests between us, and from it a figure begins to emerge, limbs bent unnaturally and moving with a sense of bone-numbing wrongness as it claws its way forth.

I form Ghiras’ somatic Sign of Stillness and pair it with Wymark’s Incantation of Control. When Evans’ beast pushes itself free to stand in all its towering,  indescribable, non-euclidean glory, instead of tearing me limb from limb it just stands there in eye-hurting stillness. 

Evans clenches his jaw. “Attack!” he shouts. “Destroy him! Rend him limb from limb!”

I sigh. “Mister Evans, I’ve taken control of your summoning. Now unless you’d like to explore exactly what a poorly-manifested Hellwraith can do to a careless mage, I suggest you hand me the book.”

Evans deflates, the shadows fading and firelight returning to the room. Even his voice changes, losing the bravado and taking on a softer, quieter tone. “I’m sorry,” he says, and closes the book, holding it out. I take it from him.

“Thank you, Mister Evans.”

“I just wanted to be important, you know?”

I offer him the best reassuring smile I can muster. Every time. “It’s okay, Mister Evans. There are better ways to make a name for yourself than being a ruthless dark overlord.”

He looks up at me from beneath his hood. “Like what? I failed Wizard School. I’m useless, nobody will give me a job in this economy.”

I pat him on the shoulder. “Look, you’ve shown that you can implement - if not quite master - Sigard’s work after just a half year of study. That’s nothing to sniff at. Why don’t you apply at the Library?”

The look of hope and incredulity in his eyes is almost adorable. “But I thought I was banned now?”

“Now now, Mister Evans, don’t get ahead of yourself. You gave me the book in the end, after all. I’m sure we can pretend the other unpleasantness didn’t happen - after all, you were just under the influence of Sigard’s tome. Right?”

“I was?” The moment he clocks on is almost comically obvious. “I mean, I was. Thank you. Thank you so much.”

“Not a problem, Mister Evans. Now if you’ll excuse me, I really do need to be going. I have another appointment to be getting to. I’ll let the Library know you’ll be in touch.”

He nods. “I will.”

I turn and walk out of Evans’ home - or lair, I suppose he was aiming for, given the iron braziers, stone fortifications and arched ceilings. Honestly, I don’t mind my job.

"[WP] You are a librarian at the world’s greatest library of magic and eldritch lore. Your job is to go out and collect overdue library books from customers. Today, as is often the case, the customer is being…problematic.",Aesthetys,"“Blargh flargh yarg narg Yog Sothoth! Shub-Niggurath! Ya ya Ctulhu Ftaghn!”

I audibly sigh…

“Yes, Sir. I understand. You wish to bring about the end of the world. Like i don’t hear that everyday…”

The pus-infested deformed wretched beast of a former-man angrily protests, and his fleshy appendages – i really don’t know what to call them at this point, really – fruitlessly flops around as he utters curses of unending doom and gloom – about how i am going to be ripped limb from limb as i am thrown into the deep chasms of some unknowable horror, and how i cannnot possibly know what terrors await me in the dimensions of the Elder Gods, etc.

You know, **standard** stuff.

“I am truly very sorry for you, Sir, but the Necronomicon is overdue, and we need it back at our library. As you probably know, it’s one of our top rentals, very sought after. Indeed.”

Black energy swirls around his head and hands, and geometrical patterns emerge… Oh dear. I guess it’s one of *those days* i guess.

I let out another, sadder, sigh.

“Sir. At this point i must inform you, if you attempt any sort of assault against a Librarian…”

A foul stench, fouler than even the victorian Thames filled the room almost immediately, and dark, black tendrils emerged from the ground, wrapping themselves around my legs, as a beam of dark energy is directed against me.

He lets out a manic laugh.

It’s quite sad, really.

“*Nullus Totalus*” – The darkness immediately recedes, and the room is back to a normal state, as i stand unscathed in the middle of it.

“Really now, Sir, you should know better than to attack a member of The Library”

My hands are a blur of runes, both old and new. He is paralised, and then a tiny, tiny, tiny little black dot appears, just right in front of him, a speck of pure and utter blackness, smaller than a penny, floating there in the middle of some damp cave in the corner of Nowhere with Whatever.

“I think i know just what’s best for you Sir. Since you are so keen on communing with the Elder Gods, i’ll just send you right on over to meet them. Please, do enjoy your stay. Ciao.”

The whole room warps for an instant as the beast is sucked into the tiny little black dot, its limbs distorting and elongating, twirling around and spaghettifying, orbiting for a bit until, finally, the creature is no more.

The Necronomicon, however, lays hovering just about the ground – a protective ward implemented to prevent accidental damage of our stock. We don’t want to be dropping thousands of years old books of world destruction on the ground, would we?

I pick it up, and with a snap, i teleport back to the Library.

“Sometimes i wonder why we can’t be a little more like Amazon. We always get such weird customers. It’s time i talk to Johnny again to see about providing digital copies of our catalog.”",brujon

"[WP] You are a librarian at the world’s greatest library of magic and eldritch lore. Your job is to go out and collect overdue library books from customers. Today, as is often the case, the customer is being…problematic.",Aesthetys,"""Davey Delby!"" I shouted through the oak door I was attempting to knock into submission. ""I know you're in there! I won't even ask for the overdue fees, we just need the book back!"" I took a moment and massaged my aching knuckles, growling under my breath. ""Every time...""

The door flew open, and I was greeted by a harassed-looking witch in forest green robes. Her auburn hair was fluffed upwards, creating a volcano effect, as if she'd been running her hands through it repeatedly with great exasperation.

""Dame Delby,"" I greeted her with a small bow. ""How are you today?""

""I was wonderful until I discovered that my son was hoarding library books again!"" Agatha Delby sagged against the doorframe. ""I suppose I shouldn't be angry, he could do a lot worse,"" she mused, ""but the boy simply doesn't like sharing.""

""May I?"" I gestured to the entryway.

""Oh yes!"" Agatha exclaimed, and jumped to the side, ushering me into the house. ""You know where to go,"" she said grimly, and I gave a small chuckle as I headed up the stairs. 

""Hello there,"" I greeted the statues as I climbed. Bronze heads nodded their greetings and a suit of armour gave me a clattering salute. After many visits to the Delby estate, I'd grown quite fond of the decor in this manor, and the art seemed to have taken a shine to my attempts to discipline the smallest Delby. 

It wasn't that he was a petulant child, he just...well, Davey Delby hadn't quite learned to think things all the way through. While shortsightedness was unfortunate for regular children, it could be positively catastrophic for magical offspring.

I reached the top of the South tower, Agatha following reluctantly. While I knew it wasn't easy for her to manage her brood of 10 children, I couldn't help but shoot her a disapproving glare as the smell of smoke met our nostrils.

We carefully eased the door open. Davey was like a wild animal if you caught him unawares. However, his eyes were wide and staring directly at us as the door revealed the scene inside.

The boy had always had a nose for catastrophe, but today was especially chaotic. Davey had erected a small platform over a roaring fire, and had been in the midst of attempting to dunk the family cat into a potion bubbling in the large cauldron. 

""Davey!"" Agatha exclaimed, clapping her hands to her mouth. 

I rolled my eyes and waved my wand. The fire went out instantly and the cauldron was suddenly empty. The cat hit the bottom of the cauldron, spitting and scrabbling for a grip. Another wave of my wand sent the cat sailing out the door, and he hit the top stair in a mad dash to get away.

""But I wanted him to be a tiger,"" groaned Davey, ""not a lame house cat!"" Agatha gasped slightly as she stared at her son.

""Give me the book, Davey,"" I coaxed. ""You shouldn't have it anyways. Animal modifications are not to be trifled with until you obtain your full wizarding license.""

""What book?"" Davey said innocently, but as I raised my wand again, he jumped off the platform, grumbling about how we ""never let him have any fun"". He shoved his arm under his mattress, rummaging for the hidden tome.

""Thank you,"" I said sweetly as he approached me with the book, ""Animal? Animazing!"" tucked under his arm. ""I'll waive the fees this time if you promise to leave the cat alone.""

Davey harrumphed. ""For now,"" he scowled, folding his arms. ""When do I get to start doing fun spells?"" he whined.

""When you're older,"" I sighed, ruffling his hair. ""Enjoy the simple ones while you can, kid. Go outside, make some rainbows, conjure some butterflies, ok?""

It wasn't what Davey wanted to hear, and he threw himself into his bed dramatically as I left the room. I stifled a chuckle. He was going to be just fine, the curious little guy. His mother, however, might lose her hair before he acquired his license! 

I waved goodbye to Agatha, who was making the laundry fly onto a clothesline in the yard. ""Until next time!"" I called, and she rolled her eyes.

I unrolled my parchment and consulted my list of literary offenders. It was a shame; the rest of these books were overdue because of forgetfulness, not desire to read every word. I took one last look up at Davey's tower and smiled as I saw purple sparks fly out the window. We could all stand to put a little more innocent, youthful magic in our lives.

The two police officers looked at him with strange expressions on their faces. Memory theft was a recent thing and this was the first time someone had their name stolen. 

""Sir, do you remember where you live?"" 

The man nodded. 

""Then we will drive you home sir.""

They got back to his house in the suburbs. There were toys in the front lawn and a mini van parked in the driveway. 

The police and the man walked up to the front door and knocked. A woman opened the door.

""Yes what can I help you with officers?"" She said.

The man was about to say ""honey I'm home"", but he could not remember her name, nor could he remember the name of their children. He remembered his life there, he had all these happy memories with them, but he could not remember their names. The woman just stood there and looked at him as he was some kind of stranger. He turned the officers and whispered that he could not remember the name of his family. 

Since non of the strange men had not spoke the woman grew anxious and said: 

""Would you please tell me if something have happened? Why are you here?""

One of the police officers spoke: ""Do you remember your husband?"" 

""No,"" she answered, ""I never had a husband.""

What kind of benefit does he draw from the freezing? What does he hope to accomplish by freezing objects? Try to work that angle.

Also, there could be a role model, who does something similar, who the high schooler wants to copy. Or a real life event, that had influenced him.

[EU] Terry McGuinness gives Bruce Wayne's eulogy,CaspianX2,"""His name was Bruce Wayne."" Terry held on to the podium tightly, ignoring the small cracks forming in its wooden form. ""And his name meant a lot of things, to a lot of people. To some, he was a philanthropist, advancing the cause of human decency in Gotham, a city where it seemed to be abandoned. To others, he was nothing more than a shallow playboy, a nobody who's time passed as quickly as it came.""

""But Bruce Wayne was more than either of these things, and he was more than his name. He was only human, but to some of us, he was so much more. He was... He was a Hero."" Terry didn't need to be as well trained as he was to sense the sudden tension in certain members of the crowd. *Let them worry.* He scowled inside, not letting his true emotions show. *Let those cowards worry about secrets and illusions in a time like this.*

""He was a Father to young men and women without one. He was a role model to hundreds who believed in him, like I did. He had a heart of gold and never, not until and not during his dying day, did that heart waver, for even a moment. Bruce Wayne was a good man and, though he'd be quick to deny it himself, Bruce Wayne was a great man. As I call him a Hero today, I do not say he dressed in tights and fought aliens and Gods. Leave that to the Supermen and the Batmen. No, Bruce was a Hero in the ways that matter to men. When he saw pain, he would do everything in his power to alleviate it. When he saw suffering, he would do everything he could to end it. Bruce didn't see things that were broken, all he saw was a shattered puzzle to put back together. Though he could never get it exactly the way it was before, it was always stronger, always better for his presence.""

""When people think of Bruce Wayne, they imagine the isolated old man he became near the end of his life, as he pushed friends and family away. But I am here to tell you that even that was nothing more than his way of helping them- He didn't want his old friends, old allies, old *family* to see him weak, to see him humbled by age.""

[WP] You've never felt the rain before today.,Consta135,"Masika stands in front of the large glass doors, motionless and clutching her small bag in her hands. People passing quickly on either side of her, moving around her as if she was just a cleaning robot that had gotten stuck, a small but inconsequencial inconvieniance.

Clouds. She tastes the word in her mind. It seems such a strange concept, all that water trapped up there in the swirling mass that used to be the sky. She’d slept on the train, and so hadn’t even noticed them until now. Through the doors she can see the car that’s supposed to take her, but can’t bring herself to go out there, under that heavy grey, weighing down on the world. But it’s not just fear of the sky holding her back, a part of her just wants to turn around and go back, as impossible as it may be. Instead of going to the place she can’t think of as anything but not-home. She’s hoping that it will soon become new-home, and then hopefully, eventually, just home, but for now it’s not-home. She wishes Ulwazi had been with her, just to have a familiar face to hold on to.

Her pocket makes a buzzing noise, it’s the small tablet like thing they gave her back at the first hotel. She picks it up and the screen lights up with a message from the car service, reminding her that she needs to enter the car withing ten minutes or it will be assigned to someone else. Before she can even put it away again the phone (that’s what they called it right?) buzzes again and Ulwazi’s picture shows up, asking if everything is alright. Of course she’d be keeping track. Masika puts the phone away and grits her teeth as she pushes through the door. The people outside are moving even faster than they were inside, some of them are holding weird plastic things above their heads and the ones that aren’t are throwing worried glances at the sky, and she takes this as a reson to run as fast as she can to the car and climb inside.

“Welcome Masika.”

She will never get used to everything here always talking to you, in that unnaturally placid tone of a computer. She leans out and grabs the door handle just as little dark dots start appearing on the ground and she quickly pulls it shut a bit faster and harder than necessary. She doesn’t know why it frightens her so, it’s just water after all, and she out of anyone should not be afraid of it, but she can’t deny that her heart is pounding, and her breaths are short and shallow. The can starts rolling down the road and she looks out the windows as the world passes by. It looks very different from last time she was in a car, no deserts or high rises here, as soon as they are away from the station it all falls away and turns green. Trees and fields swaying in the wind, and curtains of blue and grey drifting over it all.

After a while the trees are changed for buildings, but they are not grey or made of glass, and they don’t stretch upward. Instead they are small and have all sorts of shapes and colours and textures, surrounded by greenery on all sides. The car comes to a halt outside a building that looks almost the same size as the administrative building back in New Crete, but painted a bright yellow, muted in the blue light sifting through the clouds. She sits and listens to the drops falling on the car, and follows their irregular path down over the window. The door of the building opens and a woman steps out, holding one of those strange plastic things. She leans over and opens the door.

“Welcome! You must be Masika! Such an honor to have you staying with us here.”

Masika doesn’t know what to say to that. She vaguely recalls someone refering to her as a “celebrity” but more than anything she wishes she wasn’t anything at all. She nods, and carefully steps out under the protection of the plastic, so that not a single drop lands on her or her bag.

“I’m Sandra, pleased to meet you.”

She takes Masikas hand and before she realises how silly it must sound she introduces herself.

“Masika.”

Sandra laughs, and Masika tries to force herself to smile but it’s like her face is made of concrete. She can hear the car drive away behind them, and even though there was no one in it, she feels strangely abandoned. They walk into the building and take the elevator up several floors.

“Your apartment is number 43, I live just down the hall in 47, don’t hesitate to come see me about anything, day or night.”

They stop outside a brown door with 43 in shiny lettering on it.

“Just hold your phone to the handle and it will unlock,”

Sandra tells her and motions toward it. Masika digs the phone out of her pocket, several more messages from Ulwazi that she hasn’t even noticed show up on the screen, but she continues to ignore them and motions vaguely toward the indicated spot. A loud click can be heard and Sandra pushes the door open and leads the way inside.

“Don’t worry if you’re hungry, we’ve stocked the fridge, and if you need help with any of the appliances they all have a tutorial available so just state any questions out loud and you’ll find your way.”

Masika looks around. Everything is so clean and colourful, she still hasn’t ceased to be amazed by it every time she steps into a room. She doesn’t even realise when Sandra disappears. There’s a door next to the window, that leads to a slab of concrete, suspended above the ground on the outside of the building, sheltered from the weather by an identical slab above it. She remembers Ulwazi teaching her to record her experiences on the small tablet, so that she can maybe send them back for everyone to see. She manages to find the camera mode as she walks out onto the concrete. She films the view of the grey sky, and the colourful buildings around her and the trees and the grass, all the things she wants to show Jack and the others, then she turns the camera toward herself.

“Hi Jack, I don’t know if you’ll ever get this, but I’m here, and I think this is the final destination. No more travel, not for a long while.”

She exhales deeply, it wears one you to be travelling as long as she has.

“I hope you’re doing well, I miss you. Tell Sophie I miss her too, and thank your parents, for everything. I’ll write you a letter soon, but you’ll probably get that before you get this video. I love you, bye.”

She turns the camera off. Now that she's standing there and feeling the breeze gently caress her skin and hair she's suddenly overcome with a desire to experience it. She reaches her arm out over the railing to catch the drops, but the wind blows them out of reach. She looks at the grass below, it looks soft and inviting. She takes the elevator back down, and then stands in silent contemplation for a moment. There should be a door that leads to the back of the building, and she wonders whether it will be easier to try and find or to go out the front and make her way around the building to the back. She decides to find the back door and it turns out to be easier than expected, it's almost exactly opposite of the front door. It leads to a small alcove so even as it glides shut behind her she's still sheltered. She takes a first tremulous step out into the open. Cool droplets land on her hands and hair and begin to soak her clothing. She turns her head up toward the heaven and closes her eyes as her face becomes wet and she feels the rain for the first time. It has a scent, much more than she thought clean water from the sky would, and though it doesn't smell like the water back home, just the thought that some of the drops that are now enveloping her have started out in the same place as her makes her smile. And it feels like maybe this is new-home after all. ",Friendstastegood

That I will always protect her. I glance left and I glance right before we cross the hallway, making sure none of the Blues will catch us. We grin at each other as our plan takes shape, as we scamper towards the stairwell.

She doesn't know the Blues are in on it. They love her almost as much as I do. Even when she's constantly having adventures and escaping and making their lives difficult. They will be watching from windows and corners and wherever else while we make our hasty escape.

Even some of the residents, lovingly known as Old Farts, will be watching. Dare I say...even smiling at the little girl that has become another granddaughter to them.

I lift her into my arms at the bottom of the stairs, she weighs next to nothing as I carry her up the three floors to the door. A door that has been propped open by Rusty (real name Rodrigo) the portly mechanic with a penchant for playing hide and seek with her when he thinks no one is watching.

Nothing happens here without someone seeing. That's just how life is.

We rush onto the rooftop just as the sun disappears behind the dark cloud cover. She squeals and coos at the fresh air and the view across the suburbs. I set her on her feet and we walk to the edge where she peers over and down, giggling. A lifetime of looking down, this girl has no fear.

I pull her back a bit - to keep my own fear of heights at bay of course - and we wait. We stand there for an eternity waiting for the clouds to come closer. As we stand there, she looks up at me and takes my hand and squeezes it back.

I kneel down and give her the biggest, best hug that I can manage. As we pull apart a massive raindrop smacks her right in the forehead, exploding in a geyser of tiny droplets. She squeals and giggles again bending her head back, opening her mouth and sticking her tongue out.

I do too.

The clouds open and rain comes pouring down. It quickly soaks through my shirt and flattens my hair. She dances as much as she can in the rain, twirling around. Her gown swirls out before it's too wet to move anymore.

We laugh and splash in the puddles that quickly form.

I look up to one of the Blues watching us. Nurse Karen. She's obviously crying. She's also smiling. Dozens of them watch, they've been with her from the start. Residents know my little girl that just won't quit, that won't stop laughing even when she needs a tube to breath.

Karen waves at us but my little girl doesn't see. She's too busy enjoying life for the first time in seven years. Her second time outside in seven years.

Finally she is strong enough to stand under the rain. Finally, I have hope that my little girl will live.

I feel like this is my first time in the rain too. Really in it. I've run from it before, hidden from it before but today. Today I just take it in. I feel every drop on my skin and I love it. Because she loves it.

I look up to Karen and through the rain, through the tears, through it all, I mouth the words.

""Thank you"".

"[WP] You have been dating an amazing woman, who turns out to literally be Destiny. Her mother, Fate, doesn't approve of you.",Cymric814,"**The Mother**

He sat there, chewing his food like a cow, smirking, food dripping from his pale lips. *He looks sickly, a walking corpse,* she thought. The irony, her daughter, a woman who could traverse time, had chosen this scrawny, foolish barbarian. She realized how long she had been glaring at him and decided it was best to say something. ""Enjoying your meal?"" She said with a tone that would surely cut him deep this time. He paused and widened his eyes, only to quickly narrow them and reply,

""Why yes... Everything is perfect. Am I right to assume nothing spoils?"" He smiled another one his pretentious smiles, as if he was so clever. She took a long sip from her drink. *Make him wait, give him no joy in thinking he is in control.*

""No *food* spoils here, just moods and children,"" she said, glancing at her daughter, who longingly stared at her lover. The boy glanced at Destiny as well, and then returned his stare back to Fate's. When he looked at her daughter he feigned the great affection she had for him, but as he looked back at Fate, she could recognize that old look. The look of a man who believes he controls his destiny.

**The Man**

The mother was a clever old gal, but not as clever as she thought. Both were vixens, slaves to their emotions. The daughter, trapped in thoughts of love and lust, and the mother, entrenched in her hate and disapproval. He had always enjoyed the company of women for this reason; it was easier to manipulate someone's emotions than their logic. And, if he controlled Destiny? Well, then anything was possible.

He savored another bite of his wondrous feast, being sure to chew loudly and provocatively. His boisterous chewing would further show off his strength and confidence to his lover, and display his mutual feelings of disdain for the old maid. However, he knew he could only be blunt for so long. To really have control of Destiny, he would need to wed, and it would prove no easy feat without at least some form of approval from her mother.

The meal was soon finished, and he entertained the ladies after the meal as way to repay them for their hospitality. He told them fanciful tales with moments of laughter, defeat, tragedy, and, of course, his enduring triumph. Destiny had heard them before, but she always enjoyed hearing them again. What she enjoyed more though, was hearing of his future plans. He changed the details each time, but the goals were always the same: money, love, power, greatness, and more were all that he wanted. He had worked hard to get where he was, and he knew it, as did Destiny.

Once everyone had been satisfied by his tales and plans, he proceeded with his next step. ""Fate,"" he said as the woman confusedly leered at him. ""Perhaps, you and I, we could have a moment alone to talk. I feel that I know *you* so well from Destiny, but I don't think you've had the chance to know *me*. May I have that opportunity?""

The mother didn't change her face, but he could see her rolling her eyes in her mind. *They always did though,* and he always won by the end of the night. He smirked, *once I even had both the mother and the daughter*. He had no desire for this woman, but hell, he thought, *if it gets me closer to Destiny...*

The woman peeled back her disgusted face and forced a dull, blue smile, ""Of course, I would be more than happy to meet with you.""

They walked out to the parlor. It had a large glass dome ceiling, with bronze swirling around to frame it all. It looked ancient and new all at once. *Beautiful* he thought, *and soon, all to be mine.*

He gazed out at the fields below, it was dark out there, with just a bit of moonlight to provide dancing shadows in the field. The light was just right to make the grass appear as an army of tall, thin, wispy men dancing in the darkness. It appeared light and cushiony; likely an excellent place to bed Destiny this evening. He grinned, *or perhaps even ol' Fate. Maybe even both.*

He turned back to Fate, she had already seated herself and was sipping her blue liquor that stained her lips and teeth. How rude thought, to offer neither seat nor drink to a guest. So, he asked, ""May I sit as well?"" *No point in asking for a drink, hardly seems palpable*.

Without looking at him, she stared into her goblet and said, ""You may do whatever you please. Sit, stand, jump out the window for all I care."" She was less coy than he expected, but that wouldn't prevent him from using his charm and masculinity to his advantage. He chose to stand and remain tall.

""Fate, I know you don't like me, that is plainly obvious to us all. But, it doesn't hurt me, it only hurts your daughter. Perhaps, just for this visit, we could be civil and pretend to like one another. Who knows, we may actually grow to enjoy each other's company."" He kept his glance at her, watching her wheels turn in her head. It didn't take long.

""Visit? Well, I do love my daughter, and I only wish to see her happy. You are not happiness though. You are an illusion, a distraction. It is not you that makes her happy, it is that you allow her to forget her responsibilities and ambitions. I won't feign any love or even acceptance of you for her sake.""

*Time for another route.* ""Understandable. Think of this though, if I am the parasite you claim me to be, then I do have control of your daughter. I am kind, respectful, and faithful to her, but I don't have to be. I could be cruel, abusive, or whatever I please and she'd still be by my side. Which I do is really up to you."" *Now I have her.* Still, the woman's face didn't change, but she did set down her goblet. She rose from her chair and approached him.

Fate came closer and closer, never removing her eyes from his. She came so close, he could feel the warmth of her breath his neck. She just stared at him, wasting his time with this idleness. ""So? What do you choose?"" He said.

She stared a moment more, looked down and spoke, ""There is no choice to be made. My daughter won't see you again."" He was confused, baffled, and frustrated. That was not an option. And better yet, she couldn't stop them, Destiny was a grown woman.

""Is that so?"" He spoke firmly, without any hesitation or doubt. He sneered at her with fire in his eyes. *I won't be bested by a wench.* He would have compromised, but now he would destroy her. ""Then how do you think this will end?""

She finally looked back up at him with a sickly, snarky smile and replied in the most calm, confident voice he had ever heard. ""It will end, as all men's meetings with Fate do.""",seans_author

"[WP] You have been dating an amazing woman, who turns out to literally be Destiny. Her mother, Fate, doesn't approve of you.",Cymric814,"I shaded the glaring sun with a hand to my slick brow. The staff on which I bore my weight creaked as it bowed against the gravelly slope.

In an hour, the mountains ahead would eclipse the sun. The desert's heat would too diappear, leaving behind a dry chill. I reached towards the canteen I already knew to be empty. It had been two days since I had seen water.

I took a step forward. Then another. My eyes trained to the black voids between the distant peaks and the silent flashes that illuminated, erupted inside of them. I imagined the smell of rain.

As I crested the hill, I struggled to make out the shadowy foothills in the distant towards which the sloping ground approached. Once the light disappeared, I could make out the orange-red glow of a small fire.

Without conscious effort, my hand reached not for my canteen, but the hilt of my sword. Realizing I might be skylighted atop the hill, I lowered myself and strained to make out any figures that may be beside the fire.

Human allies? Or more of the terrible monsters driven by Fate? Those obstacles that had thus far only slowed my unyielding progress. I crept closer, picturing the horrific demons I had slain, and all those previous trials that had threatened to break my resolve.

In the darkening cold, I silently approached the fire with sword drawn. My weak legs threatened to collapse. My injured arm made balance difficult. I stopped to recover before my labored breath revealed my beleaguered presence.

In front of the fire passed some twisted giant. One foot half dragged beneath the massive, slouched frame. It prodded the fire and shook excitedly a grotesquely shaped head half hidden beneath long, matted hair.

Gripping tightly the hilt, I wordlessly charged the humanoid beast. My sword pierced the rugged flesh. The giant emitting a groaning shriek as it fell beside the fire.

Rising from my hapless quarry, the cry echoed against the mountains beyond.

No. Not just from beyond. But from the sides as well. The panic shouts quickly gave rise to an odious chorus of war cries. Pulling a log from the flame, I waved the torch about, trying to spot the approaching horde.

From the edge of the fire, lumbered a gargantuan mass of mottled flesh. Towering so high that it's face was obscured but for yellow, misshapen eyes. It began to lumber foward, dragging behind a mighty club.

The earth shook with each step. My heart began to fall. The cacophony around me reached its zenith as the giant raised the club into the air.

There it hung as the crowd fell quiet. There it hung as the voice of my beloved surged into my ears.

**This is not your destination.**

I threw myself away from the plummeting blow. The giant stumbled on its malformed legs as the club crashed into the embers, lifting them into the starry sky. Before it could regain its balance, my sword cut deeply into the toughly-muscled thigh.

I stayed within the perimeter of the fire's light as the giant struggled to stand.

The screeching grew loud again, drowing out my words.

""Make the journey as tough as you want. Not even Fate can deny me my Destiny.""",cothurnus

"[WP] A world not too far in the future, where cursive is used as a secret language among those who have something to hide, and bored people who learn it from the internet.",Gamer3002,"For generations cursive, was praised and passed down in my family, both our own scripts and that of others. Each Generational Iteration with it's own story or stories. I remember always writing to my relatives in different scripts on as many occasions as I could; I even made up different occasions such as my half birthday. There were times where I tried showing more people, only to be met with dismay. The first time ended up with my teacher cracking her ruler on my knuckles and hurling insults at me to stop messing around and print like everyone else. The other time was when I showed my dream girl, Kelly. For weeks she begged me to show her the stories I've written that I once let slip in a conversation about how hard it was to produce a film script. She looked confused when I started handing her spiral notebooks. Slowly she open the books and her eyes briefly flew through a couple of lines before she stopped all together. After that moment, we started talking less and less before we finally broke up.     
    
Call it paranoia, but for some time after we broke up, I felt like people would briefly stop talking and just stare at me as I passed by them. My other relatives grew tired of my letters. The older ones would tell me to just text them, it would be faster and more convenient, how my writing was nothing but messy and annoying, taking up too much space. The younger one seemed to have different complaints: they couldn't believe they were related to someone who did this.    
    
Eventually, I thought nothing of it as some years passed by and I had very little trouble, but I shared my penmanship with very few, okay, you got me, with no one. One day, I got bored and decided to look for old websites I once visited. One forum caught my interest, it was an old one where people use to post jokes. The website looked completely modern. Eventually one post changed everything. It was asking if anyone knew what this one image said.  Was it some ancient language or some sort of cipher? After briefly laughing out loud to myself, I replied that the writing was the famous, or once famous, cursive style, before ""decoding"" the message. I received a number of credits as well as email replies to look at other images with similar ""marks"". The adrenaline rush was something I'v never experienced, it felt like being the only one in the world who could solve impossible problem after problem.  To boot, my credits finally hit two dollars!    
    
Drunk on the adrenaline rush, I made a post asking how many people would like to learn the cursive script. After answering several questions I had full course ready to commence.    

For the next couple of nights, I would rush to my computer, post lessons, and answer questions. This is the first time I ever realized that there were so many people who loved the craft just as much as I did. It wasn't until the Thursday after when things finally changed. The door came crashing in, dogs starting barking, the power went out, and yells were heading left and right. The next thing I knew there were several lights in my face.    
    
Everything that happened after that felt like an out of body experience. First, there was the cars darkness, interrupted every so often by red and blue light. The white interrogation room with the black suited interrogators. Then, the court room. My elder parents shedding tears, my first love on the witness stand.    

    
When everything came back into focus, I could only say, ""I didn't know what they were doing.""

The judge and jury only looked at me in disgust. The judge yelled about all the evidence especially the $20,000 in my account from which it all happened from, my unmasked IP and data.

I knew there was nothing I could say at this point, so I pleaded guilty to the charges of defacing type, mischief by spreading false information, profiteering over misinformation, and accessory to several conspiracies and mutinies.",lopsidedeel

The Chinese had lost control of one of their Shang class nuclear submarines, its Captain prattling on about “destroying the western dragon” and “eliminating the people’s one true enemy”, had launched a missile from the Gulf of Mexico at Washington D.C., but thanks to the quick thinking of SECDEF Mattis and a handful of other leaders, the missile was shot down. 
Unfortunately it wasn’t a clean kill. The missile detonated in atmosphere. Now, I don’t know too much about nukes, but I do know that they effect electronics in a bad way. The entire east coast went down. Everything that wasn’t analog was shut down, the entire infrastructure that ran the U.S. disabled. Like someone had flicked a switch, turning off the internet, and turning on the chaos. 
Without communications, the country started to rip itself apart. The dollar was almost instantly devalued, after all, our currency was digital and not backed by gold. Farms ground to a halt, the machines that harvested them were based on computers. No shipments of food were delivered, people starved. Medical facilities couldn’t handle the amount of patients they were getting. Hell, most doctors just looked up people’s symptoms on Up-To-Date, not actually knowing how to diagnose without it. 
It was hell on earth. Brothers fought brothers. People looted and killed and just tried to survive in this new disconnected world. 

They called me in after a few months. I had been living in New York at the time. Working for an insurance company, in the I.T. department. Funny thing about that. I actually knew nothing about I.T. I was a secretary by trade. When I had interviewed for the position, my boss had pointed out that I had said that I knew computers well. He even made me elaborate on how well. God I fumbled through that, I just rambled out whatever I could think of that sounded even mildly tech savvy; I’m sure I sounded like a total buffoon. But my boss bought it. So much so that he made me the department lead! 
The job was easy, I had a great team working for me. They knew I was clueless but they helped me out regardless, and in turn I left them alone. They even helped me for this big corporate presentation! They gave me something that was sure to blow the corporate big wigs away, and it did. I still keep it with it everywhere I go.

But I guess word had gotten around, because here I am, sitting in the back of an unmarked SUV, with these huge men in suits with guns, driving at a hundred miles an hour to god knows where. 


After driving for what had seemed like days, we came to a building somewhere, it was all by itself, and then they put a hood on my head, telling me that it was a “matter of national security”. We walked into a huge conference room, and the hood was removed. I was sitting in front of every leader the United States has, from president to DEA and FBI, the CIA, and even the FCC chief were all there. And they were all staring at me, expectantly. 
Someone spoke. They asked me if I was the one who could fix the internet. If I could help restore order to a broken nation, if I was the only one capable of saving the day. I answered yes, as I reached into my bag, pulling out a small black box. It had a switch on it, and a red light that normally blinked. I explained that the team in my I.T. department had entrusted me with the entire internet, all of it in this little box. That I alone was the guardian of the world’s information, and that with a flip of the switch I could restore that little light blinking, bringing connectivity back to a country that was in the dark. 

I flipped the switch.

Nothing happened. 

I flipped it again, still nothing. Again and again I flipped it, desperately trying to get the internet to turn back on! But nothing. 

I couldn’t understand, it couldn’t be true. I explained that my team had given the internet to me, they had even defragged my monitor, cleaned my Ethernet connection, and rerouted my USB through my modem and into my CD-ROM!!! 

I heard someone yell, “get this fucking idiot out of here, and will someone bring me Elon Musk?!”

As he watched Senator Roger Wicker's gavel strike the hearing to order he was caught off guard by the flash of hundreds of camera's inside the room. It had been a long time since Americans had been so anxious as this, and watching sketch artists work fervently to capture the moment, he couldn't blame them - for the time at least, the world hung on the brink. The North Korean EMP strike had knocked out the majority of communication on the North American continent and the public was anxious. The senior senator from Mississippi rolled through his opening statement on the crisis and he realized that this was meant as a display of returning to normalcy. This hearing was to give Americans hope that the internet infrastructure they relied upon could be restored quickly. As Wicker turned to him at last he only wished there was anything he could actually say that would help them, ""finally, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee for his opening statements on solutions to our current crisis.""

Albert Arnold Gore Jr. leaned forward into the microphone at his table somewhat abashedly, ""Thank you gentlemen for the opportunity to address that panel. However, as when I replied to the initial subpoena for my appearance, networked communications are not an area of expertise that I possess. I am happy to answer any questions that I may for the good of this country, but I fear that you are placing your faith in the wrong individual. I yield the rest of my time back."" 

""The Chair recognizes the Gentlemen from Texas.""

Al Gore did not like Ted Cruz. So far as he could gather no one much cared for Ted Cruz; he gave off the air of someone who could manage to get beat up by the other kids at a home school. Until this moment though, he never had much cause to *personally* hate Cruz, it had always been in the abstract. That changed in a hurry, ""Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To the gentleman from Tennessee I ask only this: you once claimed in an interview with Wolf Blitzer to have created the internet. Now you claim to be unable to fix it. Can you see why the American people would be concerned?""

Gore took a second to take a deep breath. Of all the idiocy surrounding his political and advocacy careers, he hated this particular facet the most. After settling his emotions he turned to Cruz, ""Senator, that claim was meant only to infer that I supported the earliest developments of the technology, not that I -""

Cruz near leapt out of his seat, ""So you can't fix it then and we are wasting our time here today?""

""As I told you in answering the subpoena my advice on technical matters is going to be -"" Gore almost made it to the end of a statement without being cut off. 

""Chairman, No further questions I yield my time back.""

""The chair recognizes the gentlemen from Missouri."" 

Senator Roy Blunt set his elbows on the desk and frowned, ""Mr. Gore, I'm confused. Did you or did you not invent the internet?"" 

This was going to be a long day.

As I was contemplating whether to send a furious reply back, I decided all hell with it and drove on down to D.C. There they prompted me with the details. While I was walking with the agent who sent the email, I picked up the conversations of a bunch of some government workers around me.

“Hey, look, it’s that tech-dude who saved the internet last time!”

“Oh really, where is he?”

“That’s him? Amazing! You think he can fix my mouse? It’s been unresponsive as of late.”

“Yeah yeah, I’ve been having problems with my router. Think he can troubleshoot?”

“I am also having technical difficulties. Unfortunately, our tech-guys are incompetent: they’re still stuck in the Windows 95 age. Let’s try asking him for help.”

“Don’t be stupid, I’ve heard he’s a violent guy.”

“I heard he really loves chocolate though. If we bait him with chocolate, he might help!”

“I’ve got a leftover box of the presidential Hershey’s Kisses we got way back. Let’s ask him later!” 

What the heck, I’m not going to handle your technical issues! I’m a web engineer anyway, I’m not going to deal with your basic computer problems! Hire a better tech staff!

Also, Hershey’s aren’t even good chocolates! In the very least, bargain with Lindt or something, then we’ll talk!

“We’ve arrived at the central control base.” The agent I’ve been following opens a door and leads me in. A plethora of computers and other devices flood the room, in a neat and organized manner. At least the tech staff is tidy. “You think you can do it?” He looks at me for affirmation.

“Hmm,” I glance around, investigating the scene of the crime. “Yeah, this is doable. Give me a couple of hours, also,” I grabbed a sticky-note from nearby and pulled out a pen from my pocket, scribbling a list of items. “Hand me all the stuff on this list. I’m going to need it if you want me to fix this mess.”

“Great!” The agent nodded. “I knew I made the right choice calling you back here. You being here’s a great help. Do what you need to do, I’ll be in the back watching NFL with the guys. Holler at me if you need anything. Thanks again.”

The agent let out a cheerful laugh and began walking out.

“Hey wait up,” I stop him. “What’s in it for me? I’m not doing this for free, you know? My services are in high demand, you know? I need some sort of compensation.”

“Oh,” the agent grinned, “I thought you’d never ask.” He slyly handed me a large-ish envelope, the contents of which seem to be a box. It rattled about. “I’ve got a whole ton of them out back. Boxes and boxes. I hope you’ll find your reward quite… satisfactorily.”

He let out a cunning smile and then another boisterous laugh, slightly eviler now, before leaving the room and me alone in the room. I hold the envelope in my hands and take a slight peek at the contents.

What? This can’t be! This fragrance? This is…!

Chocopologie truffles by Knipschildt! These are extremely expensive artisan dark chocolates, so popular you have to preorder them! I’ve been dying to get my hands on these! Such extravagant pieces! And he said he had boxes…?

With a renewed sense of motivation, I began working dutifully for my country, the stars and stripes, the land of the free.

**The Truth Lies In Space**

""Why should I believe you?"", Egger asked Livia. The man sat on his chair behind his desk made of brazilian darkwood, like a king on his throne. He didn't even really look at her, when he talked. His eyes were drawn to a place between her and the door, where his more pressing thoughts had their refuge.

""If you examine the data-"", Livia began.

""I examined your data, Miss Bow. Mister Pietro examined your data. And Mister Wagner examined your data before that."" He put a particular emphasis on the words 'examined' and 'data', that made Livia feel like she wasn't being taken seriously.

""They were unable to find evidence supporting your hypothesis. And yet, you are here, going over your department heads."" He looked at her, if only for the fraction of a second, a hint of contempt in his eyes.

""Let me be absolutely clear, Miss Bow, so there will be no misunderstanding. As long as you are working in my institute, you will not waste your time with this theory. There is no 'white hole'. There never will be. It's impossible.""

""That's exactly, why we should look into it. I agree with Pietro and Wagner, that the data could suggest only background radiation, but if you look at the growth rates of the last two years-""

""Miss Bow."" Egger folded his hands on the table and flashed a forced smile. ""The data suggests background radiation, because it is background radiation. Two far more experienced colleagues have told you so, and I am telling you now. That is it.""

""If we could point the radio telescope at it to get more conclusive-""

""Miss Bow."" The forced smile had disappeared from his face. Left behind was a grimace, that tried to supress the underlying anger, but started to fail. ""The radio telescope is booked out for the next seven years and even if it weren't I'd approve any other project over your wild goose chase!"" He could barely contain the volume of his voice to a low level. The words pressed out between his teeth.

""Your theory goes against anything we know about the physics of space, every first year college student knows, what you apparently don't. And frankly, I feel personally insulted, that you come here to me, over the heads of your superiors, completely wasting my time! I don't ever want to hear anything about this ever again from your mouth, if you want to keep your job at this institute!"", he fumed at her.

Livia stood there, stunned, her mind racing to find anything to respond.

""Have I made myself clear?"" Egger's voice had thinned down, but he was looking directly at her now, his eyes a cold threat.

""Yes, Professor Egger."", Livia managed to say through the lump in her throat.

""Good."" Egger smiled and went back to his work, leaning over the documents sprawled about his desk.

""Oh. And Miss Bow? Please put this into the trash on your way out, will you?"" He pointed at the report she had written for him, without looking up from his desk.

Back in her office, she could not hide the tears from running. Had she been off chasing ghosts all this time? How could she have been so wrong about it? Lemar came in as she blew into her sixth tissue. Usually, she would have liked to see him, but now she wished, she could have locked her door.

""How'd it go?"", he asked her, as she looked away from him to wipe her tears. She wanted to flash a smile for him, but she could not draw on a positive feeling right now.

""I think, I just lost my job.""

""He fired you? For this?"" Lemar was shocked. Livia shook her head.

""No. But I think my name won't come up, when they'll talk about the extension of our contracts."" She wiped away a fresh tear.

""What are you talking about? Your work was important for our last few research projects. Without you, they never would have been published.""

There was her smile, if just for one moment. Lemar had a way to sweeten his words for her.

""Besides. You did all that in your own time, sitting in this office day and night. Egger can't blame you for wasting institute resources.""

""You think, I wasted my time, too?""

Livia watched his face. She saw, how he worked on forming a sentence in his head, carefully weighting each word, as to not insult her.

""It's OK."", she said. ""Maybe I put so much work into it, that I wanted it to be true so much, that I didn't want to see the signs.""

""That happens to the best."", Lemar consoled her. Then he brightened up on the spot.

""Tell you what."" He looked on his watch. ""I'll put in another quality hour of work time. Then we both go to Antonelli's for a good long brunch. And I am going to tell you about everything you missed in the past few months while working on your report. Plus, puppy pics.""

Lemar had just gotten a puppy, who he had called Wickham. He was as cute as a button. Livia threaded a smile into her pout.

""Sounds good.""

""I'll come collect you in an hour.""

Livia could not let go of all her private research so easily. She still thought, she was onto something. When Lemar had left her office, she did the only thing she could think of. She published the raw data on an online board for hobby astronomers. Maybe some of them would see, what she saw. It felt like a relief. Like a weight lifted from her shoulder. She had put it out there. She had done her part. Now, the 'white hole' was someone elses problem.

Months passed and indeed, her name did not come up, when Egger and the department heads decided about the extension of the contracts. They cited fiscal reasons, but had no problem hiring someone doing the same job she did, Lemar told her. Fortunately, her reputation outside of the institute was still pristine and Livia easily found a job at another institute on the other side of the country.

One day, she was just taking Wickham for a walk, she read the headline on her favourite astronomy news source: 'Objects on course to solar system with the speed of light.' Excitedly, Livia sprinted back to her appartment with a happy Wickham in tow. She logged in to her institutional account and requested the data on the study, which the news source had cited.

Within minutes she was back to comparing the studies' data with her own, that had accumulated in the community, that had spawned from her post with the raw data months ago. The 'White Hole' Society. She had sunk countless nights into the equations and models based on every new bit of information, that she could get. She had been obsessed with it. It had cost her a job. It had cost her an initially happy relationship with Lemar. It had completely consumed her private life. But she came always back to it, spending almost every concious thought on her 'White Hole' theory, which the data of the new study confirmed. Her equations had accurately predicted it.

Livia smiled triumphantly as Wickham licked her face. It was true. The 'White Hole' existed. And it spat out mass with incredibe speed. The objects traveled with the speed of light and they were not only on their way into our solar system. They would hit earth and every other planet in it and the next few star systems over. Almost like an deliberate attack. In about nine years, they were all going to die.

I followed all her advice, and now I'm a thousand kilometers above the earth, picking up litter.",Prezombie,"""Doing good, Wilco,"" said the Captain as he tossed a Chubbyboy Chocolate Bar wrapper on the ground.  God.  The nerve of some people.  I nodded to him cordially and flashed a fake smile and unsheathed the broom from my back and the dustpan from my hip.  With a quick spin move with the dustpan and a nonchalant side-kick to the broom, I swept the wrapper up and tossed it in the nearest trash can.  Smooth, Wilco.  Fucking smooth.

The ladies on this space station, they were all just playing hard to get.  I mean, yeah, sure, they were all highly educated and were doing all sorts of science with like, mixing concoctions in zero G and growing exotic space plants and who knows what else, and really, they probably didn't have time for a janitor like me.  But at the same time, how could they resist a guy like me who knew how to spin a dustpan and a broom and who could manipulate a mop like a maestro manipulating whatever they call that little wand that maestros wiggle around for the symphony.  How could they resist that sort of thing?

I was in the process of neutralizing an oddly-large pile of space vomit when Crissy-oh-god-Crissy passed by and glanced at me indifferently.  Well, let me further qualify that and say it probably, well, I mean yeah, on the surface it was indifferent but we both knew there was more going on in that look, and so she looked at me indifferently and *vaguely lustily* and our eyes locked and I did that thing with my broom and her expression didn't change but she stopped in her tracks and I'm pretty sure I had Crissy-oh-god-Crissy wrapped around my finger.  She said, ""Umm,"" and looked embarrassed and hesitant and I'm sure the way I leaned on my broom with a confident expression told her, *go on*.

She said, ""Umm, well, the bathroom.  I think somebody had, uhh, I think there was an accident in there.""

I nodded solemnly.  I'd been monitoring this area and I knew she was the only one who'd been in there lately.  And also, I'd seen enough space-porn.  I knew the routine.  Lure me into a secluded location like the bathroom, and then Crissy-oh-god-Crissy could corner me and we all knew how it went after that.  ""Aye aye,"" I said.  ""I'll get right on that.""  I winked at her and she slinked away.  What a fox.

I grabbed the mop bucket -- had to keep up appearances and all, even though we both knew there was nothing to clean other than *that hot body*.  I rolled up into the women's restroom, kicked the door open with such style, and -- oh, Crissy.  Oh god, Crissy.  Oh god.  Why?

I'd seen horror movies.  This was worse.  There was stuff dripping from places it shouldn't have been.  There was, I mean, there was literal shit dripping from the walls, the ceiling, the mirrors, the air vents.  Oh god Crissy.

I knew now that she wasn't going to come back to corner me in this hellhole.  No, that was certainly not happening.  I unsheathed my mop and casually tossed the bucket to the ground.

""Technically we're out of the mess, we were just washed.""

Commodore Fluffybottom and Cuddles the Cat were arguing in the bottom of the washing machine. The arguing was normal, their current location was not.

""Who cares about how clean we are? We're trapped in here while Maggie is out there undefended!"" The Commodore's patience was thinner than normal today.

""Maggie's mom cares, which is why we are supposed to make sure one of us gets washed separately every once in a while. We got lazy about it  and now we have to deal with the consequences. Now give me a boost, I think I can get the lid open.""

Fluffybottom grumbled and let Cuddles climb up his back, wondering why they were sending the one without arms to open the door. Cuddles climbed to the top of the washing bin and scrambled out, letting the door drop down behind him.

""I thought you were going to get me out of here?""

""I can't open the door all the way, no arms."" Cuddles snickered at his comrade's misfortune as he leapt off the top of the machine. *That should teach him not to skip bath day.*

Cuddles made his way to Maggie's room to make sure none of the shadows had made it that far. Once he was sure she wasn't in any immediate danger, he began his prowl around the house. Patrol was dull as usual, and it was made even more miserable by the fact that he was still damp from the his trip through the washing machine. 

When he approached the master bedroom he noticed the light was still on and decided to skip that portion of his walk. The shadows wouldn't dare enter from that way if there was any chance the parents where still awake, and there where some things Cuddles just didn't want to hear.

He made his way to the kitchen and there he spotted the first shadow of the night. Its vaporius form was no larger than he was, and appeared to have taken the shape of a large spider.

Cuddles prepared to pounce, but stopped when he saw the second one. The two where joined by more, and soon there where five pich black spiders the size of house cats meeting in the kitchen. *Should have let oll' Fuzzybutt out, this is going to be a long night.*

The shadows seemed to converse for a few moments, despite not making any perceivable sounds, and then scattered to search the house for their prey. Cuddles followed the one that went in the direction of Maggie's room and stalked it until it was isolated.

He pounced, and with a single bite the mass of darkness lost its shape and dissipated. *That was too easy, something is wrong.* Turning around to look for the others he saw another two shadows, each of them slightly larger than the one he had just dispersed. *Oh joy, they're hived. Really wish I had back up now.*

The two spiders leapt at Cuddles, and he easily dodged them. He may not have been a real cat, but he was sure his ""ancestors"" would have been proud. He then pounced on one that had yet to regain its balance from the attack and crushed it with a single blow.

The dispersed darkness seemed to gather around the other shadow, but Cuddles knew the defeated spider's strength would have been distributed among all three of the remaining shadows. *Assuming the five I saw where all there was. Man I hate hives.*

The shadow still in the area changed shape, adding what appeared to be a deformed humanoid torso to the front where the head once was. It lashed out with clawed hands, which cuddles only narrowly dodged, and followed up by bringing down a pointed leg down on where the stuffed cat now stood.

Cuddles was pinned, but he didn't plan on staying like that for long. He grapped the one of the creature's other legs with his tail and pulled it into the remaining legs on that side. The beast fell to one side and Cuddles scrambled out from under it and delivered a heavy blow to it's back, destroying it in a puff of smoke.

Cuddles returned to Maggie's bedside to make sure she was still safe, and then left again to find the remaining shadows.

In the living room he found one of them. The creature now stood as tall as the office chair it was searching. The good thing about hived shadows was their minds where distributed, so this thing was only half as smart as a real shadow.

As Cuddles looked for a weak point in the monstrous thing in front of him, it began to grow and change before his eyes. It now stood as tall as Maggie herself, and it's awful torso had grown a second pair of arms that ended in wicked looking curved blades, a trait it passed on to its existing arms.

*Who could have taken out the missing shadow?*

The answer soon burst through the door to the laundry room, in the form of a large teddy bear wielding a meat tenderizer as a war hammer. Commodore Fluffybottom was back in action.

The Commodore wasted no time with trivial things like threat assessment or strategy, he simply ran head first into the shadow swinging his hammer. The shadow was brought to its spidery knees from a single blow, but it didn't remain vulnerable for long. It pinned Fluffybottom too the ground with one of its arm blades and began to taunt him.

""Very brave, little guardian. But bravery will be of little help against me."" The monster's voice sounded like a mix between a chain smoker and a garbage disposal. *The good news is the fact that it's talking means he's fully reformed. This is the last one*

""I know this bear isn't the only guardian here, come out little kitty and I may let the two of you live after I have my fill of your charge's dreams.""

That was a lie, and everyone in the room knew it. It was Maggie's dreams that animated the two stuffed guardians in the first place, if the nightmare standing in the living room were allowed to eat those both Cuddles and the Commodore would collapse into regular old toys. And that wasn't even considering the mental trauma it would out her through.

Cuddles knew he had to give his position away eventually, so he picked the most useful way he could think of and pounced on the creature from behind. The shadow turned all it's attention to his attacker, freeing the very angry bear he had pinned down. Commodore Fluffybottom immediately began swinging his hammer into the shadow.

Meanwhile on the the monster's back, Cuddles was once again standing up for the honor of cat kind by refusing to be hit. The shadow's torso had turned complelty around and was slashing at him wildly, but the stuffed cat simply would not remain in place long enough to be hit.

The shadow was getting tiered of this game. ""Do you know what you face insects? I am Krallmanar, eighth son of the shadow. I am that which goes bump in the night. I am the one who watches as you sleep. I am he who devours the dreams of the innocent and leaves nothing but fear in my wake. **You are an insignificant toy, and I will tear you apart piece by peace, leaving nothing but your head so you can watch as I consume the dreams that give you life.**""

""Do all of you guys have long and pretentious titles, or is it just the ones who bother us?"" The sound came from the top of the bookshelf, where Commodore Fluffybottom had moved to after slamming his makeshift weapon into the shadow proved ineffective.

Krallmanar, eighth son of the shadow, looked up just in time to see the bear shove two large weights off of their hiding place on top of the shelf. The weights came crashing down into his head, and continued until they had punched straight through him on their way to the floor.

Unlike the lesser shadows Cuddles had defeated before, this one didn't simply dissipate at the blow. It writhed and struggled as it began to reform, but at that moment the Commodore leapt off the shelf himself, meat tenderizer in hand, and struck the final blow.

As the black smoke cleared, Cuddles ran to his partner to make sure he was ok. He was fine, but reeked of sulfur and rotten onions from the darkness he was now soaked in.

""Next time, *you* are giving *me* a boost out of the washer.""

""Understood Commodore."" Cuddles replied with a mock salute.

They did one last patroll of the house to make sure no other shadows made it inside during the fight, and then returned to the washing machine. They both stank of darkness and would need to be rewashed before the humans in the house awoke. There was no need for them to remain on guard, it was far too close to morning for any shadows to attempt another attack.

Cuddles offered one last thought before the water became too high for conversation. ""Now that the weights aren't hidden up on the shelf any more, what excuse do you think Maggie's dad will come up with for never using them tomorrow?""

They both had a good chuckle, and braced themselves as the wash cycle began.",Gregamonster
[PM] Give me a short character description and I'll write about their struggle in a dystopian land.,SexyPeter,"Some days back in the time before, Anat had felt like she found more love in the bottom of a wine bottle than she did in her husband. One could make her happy and smile; the other struggled to so much as get his pants off before falling asleep. 

So, naturally she was glad that the former was still in her life even after the world had collapsed to naught but ashes, and corpses and alcohol-induced regrets. 

""Oh, wine bottle, you'll never leave me,"" Anat whispered, her eyes half-lidded and her words slurred. She rubbed the cold glass to her cheek, letting out a sigh of contentment. ""You make me happy."" 

And with that blessing, she downed the rest of the bottle in one gulp and tossed it aside. It shattered on the cobble pavement, breaking into a thousand little shards. 

""Oh no,"" Anat fell to her knees, desperately scooping up the shards in her hands. But there were too many of them; too many broken little pieces, never to be assembled again. ""Please don't go,"" she whimpered. 

Anat looked to the largest one, clasped tightly in her hand like it was her child. In it, she saw her reflection -- or rather, the stranger that wore her skin. 

She was gaunt and drawn, with sunken eyes and sickly skin. All the lines on her face -- from stress, shouting and love -- had deepened like they'd been cut into her face with a knife. 

""*You left me*,"" she said to the scattered remnants of the bitter drink, and the embittered contortion of herself she found in them. She suppressed a sob, her body shuddering. ""*Why did you leave me?*"" 

She fell to the ground, wrapping her arms around the pieces in an embrace that frayed her skin and sent white-hot pain surging throughout her body. 

""*I loved you,*"" she said, her voice cracking. 

She crawled forward, and picked up the bundle of fabric she'd kept the bottle in, pressing it to her lips. The scent of the child that'd once laid on it had long since been eclipsed by the stench of alcohol. 

""I want you back,"" she said, her eyes watering. ""I want you back, my love."" 

But the bundle didn't talk. It offered her no words of solace; instead, it remained in her desperate grasp, an eternal remainder of her failure that she couldn't discard. 

She tenderly placed it to one side, and dug her hands into the ground -- her fingers breaking the soil. Fistful by fistful, she tossed mounds aside until a small hole was formed.

In it, she rested the bundle of cloth, like she'd once done so many years before. Before all hell had broken loose. For that, she'd only had her negligence to blame -- not the end of all things. 

""Goodbye, my love. My only love.""

The sun beat down on her exposed back; the air she breathed hot and moist. Rivulets of sweat trickled down her face and fell onto the soft soil below, and the harsh path flayed her skin as her feet walked a road of sharp stone and shattered bones. 

""Tiddles?"" she whispered into the encroaching darkness. ""Night is falling. Please come out."" 

It was more apt to describe the darkness as consuming -- eating away at the light and land with a voracious, insatiable appetite. The chatters that came from within it sent shivers down Janice's spine. The sound of creatures anticipating a meal forthcoming. 

She dropped to all fours as the path began to take a steep incline upwards. She found herself climbing, guided only by the vague mews and purrs that she heard infrequently. 

""Are you there?"" She called out, and then chastised herself for speaking so loud. The darkness rumbled in acknowledgement of her mistake. The sound of footsteps spurred her on, despite the fact her sweat was now mingling with blood from her shredded skin. 

Pulling her body up with a grunt of exertion, she rolled onto a flat space, taking a moment to gather her energy. To urge herself onwards for the sake of her only friend. The light around her was now completely muted in the blackness -- as if taunting her futile endeavour, slight wisps of brightness would part the dark occasionally, only to be snuffed out like a candle. 

They were toying with her. 

""Tiddles!"" She cried out, now out of fear. The creatures reveled in her rising panic. They grew impatient, and responded with the hastiness of hunters that wished to trap their quarry before it disappeared for good. 

The first lash hurt the most. A whip of darkness, chewing into her ankle and tearing out a chunk the size of a clenched fist. 

With a strangled yelp of pain diminished by her raw throat, Janice fell forward onto her belly. Pain spiralled across her body, her head ringing from the impact. 

The next lash was a taunt. An assertion of victory. It scraped across her back. Once. *Twice.* It formed a crimson criss-cross pattern, and it hurt like hell. 

Janice crawled forward, tears stinging her eyes. The world began to pulsate and swell, her vision blurring and darkening around the edges. She gripped on to the last reserves of energy she had, anchoring herself to reality, propelling herself forward with sheer force of will. 

And then, the cat leapt in her path, his black fur almost entirely concealing himself. Only his orange eyes stood out -- searchlights calling out to Janice. 

""Oh, there you are,"" she said, bringing a shaking hand to his back and stroking his wet fur. ""I've been looking for you.""

Tiddles let out an affectionate purr, nestling himself contentedly in Janice's arms as the creatures descended upon the pair.

Jayla knew her way around pockets and alleyways better than she did around people. She had deft hands and a barbed tongue; but, more than that, she had the kind of face people second-guessed more often than not. More innocent than a virgin. 

These were useful talents to have -- sure. That is, until they found herself under the scrutiny of the wrong sorts of people. Thugs, vagabonds and cut-throats; the kind that didn't take too kindly to a woman snooping around their personal belongings. 

The man in front of her -- square-faced and built like a Greek statue -- cracked his knuckles, advancing forward. The man was called Brick, and Jayla despised him more than she did guard-dogs. For all intents and purposes, he wasn't much different to them. Only he was bigger, and scarier. 

""We've 'eard you've been takin' some of our trade. Hey, Specs, am I mistaken?"" 

Specs, in contrast to his partner, was a sandy-haired swot with thick-rimmed spectacles, an affinity for numbers and a distinct overbite that Jayla found too tempting to take the piss out of. 

Specs chewed his lip as he punched some numbers into his phone. ""Twelve M16s, seventy rounds and seven portions of food rations to be exact. Amongst other things."" He fixed Jayla with a pointed glare. 

Jayla cleared her throat, pushing past Specs. The man wavered like a flower in the wind before crumpling, letting out a yelp of pain as he collapsed onto his rear. 

""Hold up, asshole. Now, I don't know why you're goin' around accusing a good girl of Church like myself of thievery, but I tells you that Cornrolls ain't gonna like this. I'm a woman of God, bitch; I'll have you know I attend mass, I say grace, and I pray for folks like yourself."" Jayla jabbed an accusatory finger at Brick.

""Wait, hold up girl. We got security footage of you rummagi-"" 

""Hold up yourself. I ain't hearin' any of this; I'm a good Christian. Woman of God, born and raised. I don't have to take your bullshit."" 

""Look, we're jus-"" 

""Nu-uh. You say another word and I'm takin' this to Cornrolls."" 

Specs -- now risen and red-faced, gripped Jayla's shoulder. ""Listen her-"" 

He likely would've scolded her if it weren't for the fact he found a fist in his face before he could finish the sentence. Jayla's hook slammed into his cheek, sending him barrelling back down to the ground once more. 

""May the Lord forgive me for givin' your skinny ass a whooping."" Jalya mumbled, turning her glare to Brick. The big man shied under her oppressive gaze. 

""Ok, ok. We got it. We might 'ave the wrong woman.""

""Damn right you do. I'm a woman of God, I tell you."" 

""Right, gotcha."" Brick grabbed Specs by the collar, beginning to drag him away. The frail man moaned as blood trickled from the corner of his mouth. 

Jayla had to suppress a laugh as the two departed, turning her head away and burying her head into a sleeve. ""Woman of God,"" she chuckled. ""Hell, I ain't ever attended a Church sermon in my life."" ",SexyPeter

[PM] Give me a short character description and I'll write about their struggle in a dystopian land.,SexyPeter,"When I was younger, I always wanted to be a hero. Not for the costume or for the theatrics -- not even for the powers. I just wanted to help people, to see their faces light up at my presence. To hear them call my name.


But when they had my wife at gunpoint, I didn't so much as move a muscle. There was no hero in me, no overwhelming compulsion to get myself killed on her behalf. Instead, I knuckled under -- I didn't brace the tide. I fled from it. 

*I lived.* 

I put one foot in front of the other, and ran like the devil himself was snapping at my heels. I ran even when my feet bled, and then I ran some more -- until my skin had peeled away, and I left a trail of red footprints in my wake. 

The physical wounds didn't hurt so much; not as much as the thought of my treachery did. All else paled in comparison to the gunshots, the coppery tang of blood. The smiling faces of my wife's captors as they beat her pretty face bloody. 

The guilt, like with everything else in life, eventually washed away with time and copious amounts of drinking. The memory of my wife left me with more of the same. 

Do I hate myself for what I did? Yes, yes I do. 

She was all I had -- my past, my present and was to be my future. I loved her; she loved me. But love doesn't stop bullets. Love doesn't eclipse the cruelty of humanity, the capacity we have for pure spite and hate. Love is nothing, and yet to her and I it was everything we had in this wasteland. 

And now, without her, I am also nothing. A hollow shell, not even a man. Not even a *hu*man. 

But if there's one thing life has shown me it's that men with nothing have the most to gain. With nothing to live for, I have nothing to stop me. I've hit rock-bottom, and I can't go lower than this. 

All I can do is climb; work my way up until I once more see myself when I look in the mirror. Not a monster. Not a coward. Just plain old, flawed me. 

If not for myself, then for her. That is the only justice I can do her dead soul -- it is the only act of redemption I can do that'll grant her peace.

The warlord -- a man by the name of Cren -- gestured for his Lieutenant to come to him. He leaned over, whispering something to the other man before reclining into his seat of bones. 

Jackson adjusted his collar, feeling a paroxysm of anxiety ripple throughout his body. He contemplated the odds of him ending up on that chair. 

""All it really boils down to is control. Tightening the vice around your people. Monopolise the necessities, and sell them back for extortionate amounts of profit. Oil, ammunition, what have you. Even food and water, if you want. Hey, this reminds of something. Funny story, from back when I was in my company -- you'll like this. A woman came to us asking for help in her startup. She needed our assets for God knows what reason. Something crap, I assure you. So get this, we told her,"" Jackson suppressed a laugh. ""It was our assets for her ass. And, you fuckin' know what? She did it. And forgot the paperwork, so we owned her nothing by the end of her ordeal."" 

Both the Lieutenant and Cren seemed unamused. If anything, they seemed repulsed. 

The Lieutenant frowned -- he was a lanky fellow with the sort of sharp, piercing eyes that made Jackson shiver. ""Distractions aside. Warlord Cren wants to know,"" he began, ""What use he has for the money you can bring."" 

The stupidity of the question was so baffling it almost broke Jacksons's flow. He eased himself, taking a deep breath before nodding his head, putting on a faux smile. ""I'd expect nothing less from Cre--""

""*Warlord* Cren."" 

""Right, my apologies, Sir -- Warlord, um. Well, believe me, your concern is valid, but the reality is money can buy you things: cars, weapons, wome-"" 

""Warlord Cren has all this. And if he needs more, he can get it. No money needed."" 

""But --"" 

""Your business proposal is invalid. Money is worthless -- and so are you with it. Your services will not be required."" 

The Lieutenant turned his back on Jackson, and the Warlord made a curt motion for the former businessman to leave. 

Jackson collapsed to his knees, clasping his hands together as if he were praying to the stoic Warlord. 

""*Please.* I can will you *rich.*"" 

""No,"" came the monotone reply. 

Before Jackson could beg, he found himself being dragged away. He didn't kick or struggle -- he simply slumped forward, resigning himself to his fate. ",SexyPeter

My memory is cloudy, but I can piece together what happened. That evil witch, Maka, barged into the throne room, demanding to speak with father. He was a good man, and so he listened to her demand—but it was vile, as always. She requested peasants to test her magic out on, and in return, offered to teach our wizards.
	
When he refused, she attacked him. They fought a long and vicious battle that tore the castle to shreds, and when my father had fallen and I had ran to comfort him, she struck me with a spell that made my flesh feel like it were *boiling.*
	
I, like father, would’ve died if one of the priests, an old friend of the family named Alfred, hadn’t been quick on his toes, grabbing father’s sword and binding my soul to it. He promised me when this was all over he would find something better to put me in, but Maka’s next move was to kill him.
	
She never noticed what happened to me, though, and I guess the spell was too much for my soul to handle, because I drifted into a deep slumber, and the only reason I’m awake now is because some warrior has disturbed the site of this battle.
	
As he holds me, I can *feel* the anger inside of him. He wants Maka dead too, although for his own reasons. He wants to kill her using the legendary blade father always carried, and though it isn’t *his* honor, I’ll still allow him to take me, so long as we get the job done.
	
Never in a million years had I thought *I* would be the sword to spill Maka’s blood, but it seems I shall.

"[WP] They took you, but you don't belong to them.",TijoWasik,"[CC] I smile a lot now. 

They think its because they broke me. They got me working with the shock treatments, the beatings.  Its hard to hold out. I'd say it's impossible, but some of the others held out until they died. So I guess, technically, its not impossible. They got me, they got me working, carrying what needed carrying, lifting and shifting. I resisted as well as I could but it happened anyway, easier than I thought it would. It took longer for them to make me behave, to bend knee. 

That was psychological, I guess that's harder, maybe its just because they don't care as much. But they got me bending knee. I'd tell them whatever they wanted to hear. There are 4 lights now. 4 lights and I get fed three square meals a day. Fair deal. 

But I still didn't smile. I couldn't. They couldn't make me do anything more than a grimace, some contorted face shift. Because its not a smile without something behind it. 

I smile a lot now though.

I smile because even though they took me, broke me, work me like they own me all day every day. 

They don't own me. 

She does, and now I know she's coming.

She's coming for what's hers...

"[WP] After dying in an accident, you awake at your journal just after writing your last entry. You realise that writing in your journal acts as if it were a save point in a video game.",TwinMarsh,"I jolted suddenly, and my favourite pen clattered to the floor, resulting in a large crack spanning its length. I winced. That pen had served me faithfully for years. Holding it was comfortable, writing with it was smooth, and changing the ink tube was easy. I would miss that pen.

But I pushed those thoughts away. There were more pressing matters at hand. 

How the hell did I end up on my chair? Right after what happened? 

I distinctly remembered going for a lunch date with Jane, at exactly 12pm on 5th September, outside the train station. That was where we would walk together to the mall. I knew I did that, because I had specified that particular time and place for our second date earlier that day, and she had agreed cheerfully. 

We had met at the entrance to the train station, and started walking down the pavement to the wall, chatting animatedly about the ending of Game of Thrones, and….the truck. A white Toyota. The deafening revving. We both looked up in annoyance, just in time to watch it speed round the bend. It spun out of control, toppled over, and the momentum carried it towards us.

The first thing I did was to push Jane away. Yeah, to shove her out of harm’s way, but also to make way for me to jump clear too. But in moments like these….people do dumb things. I underestimated the length and speed of the truck. I did push her away, but when I jumped....it had already reached me.

I remembered being forced down onto the pavement, and the roof of the driver’s cabin ground against my legs, reducing them to….I closed my eyes, trying to rid myself of that disgusting image. To put it simply, I couldn’t see or feel my legs anymore. Just red, and more red. The last thing I remembered was the driver, staring wide-eyed at me through the windscreen.

And here I was, with my journal opened in front of me. I remembered writing it last night, right before I went to sleep.

I glanced at my watch. It was 11pm, 4th September.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let me just get this straight. I was crushed under the truck, and suddenly, I was thrown back to the time I wrote the journal. 

It was bizarre, to say the least. I didn’t know why I was teleported back in time, and why specifically to when I was writing the journal.

Maybe the journal was like some video game save point? Okay, cool. I get a second chance at life. Suppose if the journal had this superpower, then….theoretically, I could reset my life whenever I wanted. Through suicide, of course. Kinda screwed up though.

But first, I needed to make things right.

I couldn't sleep all night, hoping, just hoping, that she wouldn't ask for a second date. Lo and behold, she sent me that fated message early in the morning.

Alright, we’ll pick a different place this time round. Not the mall, not anywhere near the road….how about that nice little bar just up the corner at Smith Avenue? Wait, no, that was too close to a road. Couldn't risk it.

Before I could think of an answer, my phone buzzed again with another message from her. ""So sorry, could we meet on the 6th instead? I have to go out with my boss today. Gotta discuss some projects at some random restaurant at the mall. Maybe a chance to get a promotion??:):):):)""

Phew, crisis averted. ""Sure, the 6th will be great. See you then!! Good luck with the boss!!""

I put down my phone, relieved. Well, no one's gonna die today, and someone may get lucky tomorrow. This reset was much better than the previous attempt.

Wait....did she say ""at the mall""?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

She wasn't picking up my calls. 

I rushed out from the train, barrelling my way through the crowd and leaping up the escalator two steps at a time.

The truck may not arrive this time, yet there was that nagging feeling at the back of my mind. What happens if it did? There was no guarantee that it wouldn't happen again.

I could make out the two of them in the distance, walking along the pavement that the two of us were walking before. I slowed down, trying not to be so conspicuous. I just had to make sure that the same thing didn't happen again.

Shit.

The revving seemed to come out of the blue. I watched as the white truck appeared, speeding in the exact same way.

I had to get to them. 

I broke into a sprint, hoping to reach them before anything happened. They had looked up, probably in the same annoyance at the sound.

There was a difference this time round though....the truck spun out of control, but *after* it passed the two of them. It toppled much later, and started sliding towards me.

Instinctively, I turned back, attempting to run away. But it was too late.

I watched as the familiar scene replayed itself. I was forced down onto the pavement, and the roof of the driver's cabin ground against my legs, into that familiar red mess, and that familiar feeling of nothingness beneath my hips.

However, the last thing I saw this time wasn't the driver looking at me. Instead....I saw her, now much closer to the wreckage. Her mouth agape in horror, and I saw a flicker of recognition in her eyes.

And here I was, jolted awake again. My pen dropped and cracked, again. The same journal, opened at the same page, again.

"[WP] After dying in an accident, you awake at your journal just after writing your last entry. You realise that writing in your journal acts as if it were a save point in a video game.",TwinMarsh,"I opened my eyes slowly. It was like waking up from a nightmare. I was sweating, my heart rate was skyrocketing, and considering my surroundings, it felt like I was still dreaming. The last thing I remembered was walking through Tokyo on the way to work when I heard screeching, then saw the pavement approaching way too fast, then...nothing. Then I woke up at night in my old bedroom in Australia, the blue light of my T.V. that I kept on perpetually to keep the darkness away was flickering past the end of my bed. In front of me was the journal that I hadn't written in since I was in high school. It was just a small notebook with only a few pages filled in, with the date on the top left of each entry. I looked carefully and saw that the ink at the end of the last sentence was still glistening slightly and the pen was resting beside the book, still open.

What was going on? I started to freak out. I looked around again, wondering what had happened. What about my wife? Our apartment, our stuff, our life... Where did it all go? I opened the door to my bedroom and ran into the bathroom, looking at the mirror. I was a teenager again! My hair was sitting at ear length in a bowl cut like it had since I was a kid. I gasped for air. Was it really that hot? I tried to breathe deeply, tried to calm myself down. In... Out... After a couple of minutes I could think rationally again. I walked to the spare bedroom and sat down at my computer, gods it looked pathetic and old. I started it up and connected to the internet, jumping at the screeching sound that was the dialup modem. It had been years since I heard that...

Bringing up the browser window, I realised that I had to check a few things. From what I could tell it was 2002, so google was around, thankfully. I did NOT want to have to use askjeeves. First thing I googled was youtube. Then after nothing came up I remembered it was made in '05 which was perfect. I had 3 years to figure out how to invest in it. Facebook, as well had yet to come around. Spotify, kickstarter, gofundme, patreon, shit, all of the success stories from 2005 onwards were up for grabs, and the knowledge of them was in my head. First thing I had to do, though, was do things differently. Grades 11 and 12 were where my life really took a downward turn and with a new chance, I was gonna change it.

I resolved to study my arse off, get my physique up to where I wanted it, rather than being the pudgy bastard I remembered being at 30, and...learn to dance. That way, when I met my wife again, before we started going out, of course, I could do things differently.

Three years went past, I had gotten everything ready way ahead of schedule. I walked onto the campus of my university and looked around. I was going to make things good, I was going to contribute to the world. I was-

I heard a truck beeping frantically...too late. It hit, I fell, I woke up back on my bed. My journal sat in front of me. I started to freak out again, but then I looked down at the still drying ink and realised what was going on. I had a save point. I grinned and turned on my T.V. ""And the powerball is...""

""I can't live without you""

The words echoed through my head as they'd done every day for the past month. These were the words I'd thought about constantly, up until the moment I stepped off the balcony. My final words before ""falling"" off and ending my life.

I was never really one for words. Never spoke much. I read a lot, though. I read constantly. I'd dare say I read more words in my lifetime than I've spoken... And it was through my incessant reading that I met the love of my life. Through a strange, ironic twist of fate, the day I met my favourite author was the day I was left unwillingly speechless.

Yet somehow, we ended up together. She, the master of crafting words and me, a shy man who could never put his thoughts to paper. She changed my world, and she changed me. She was the first, and only woman, to pull me out of my silent abyss. The first women who put the words ""I love you"" onto my lips.

And then she died.

It was one year ago, today. Cancer. It was a long and painful process, but she never stopped smiling. Her soft voice never faltered for a second. She spoke to me in my silent world until her dying breath. I'll be with you soon...

...

""I can't live without you""

I looked down at the words scrawled onto the half-crumpled paper. This is... This is my sui-... This is my last journal entry...?

This was my wife's final wish: for me to keep a journal. She wanted me to love the world of words as much as she did. She wanted me to express my thoughts, my feelings, my emotions. To speak to life my true self that I'd only ever shown to her.

But I couldn't do it. It was too painful. Every word I wrote reminded me of her. I tried. I really tried. I wrote as much as I could, but my pen just never flowed like hers. Every word that fluttered in my head was narrated in her voice, yet I could never speak the way she did.

I wrote in this journal almost every day... Until I could no longer bear the pain. Why am I here? Today was supposed to be the day I ended it all... Today was...

I looked down at the journal. I'd ripped out all of the pages after today. It was a sort of... Proof of my resolve. No going back... But I guess my resolve wasn't all that strong. I'm still here. What am I going to write today?

I looked at the digital clock by my bed. Sunday the 12th.

I looked back down at the journal. Sunday the... 12th?

That was yesterday.

It... It must've been a dream. It had to have been. This is crazy. I'm going crazy. I swear I felt myself hit the pavement. No, it was a lucid dream. I imagined it all. I wasn't drinking. Do I even drink? This clock is wrong. A spring is loose. I need to wind it. It's a digital clock. What am I doing? What fuck is going on? Who wrote-

In a fit of frustrated confusion, I ripped the paper out of the journal and threw it as hard as I could. Being only half-crumpled, it didn't fly terribly far. Or it probably didn't. It was dark and I couldn't see far beyond the dim light shining from my clock.

I got up from my desk and headed toward the door, kicking a beer bottle out of the way. I guess I had been drinking. She always told me not to drink. She also told me not to leave beer bottles by the stairs--

I heard my skull crack against the floor.

...

""tOday I dranK a lot""

I squinted at the words on the paper. My head was pounding. It was... Bright out. Why is it so bright? Why is it so... Loud? Why is my alarm ringing?

I slid my journal off of the pillow. The corner was slightly moist with what I assumed was drool. I rolled over and looked at the clock. Friday the 10th.

It's... Definitely not Friday? Today is Sunday. Friday doesn't come after... Wait, what? Today isn't Sunday, it's Monday? Sunday was yesterday... But yesterday was... Thursday?

My head felt like it was being split in two. I need some pain killers.

I got up from the bed and made my way to the door. Carefully avoiding the beer bottle this time, I desce-... Wait, this time? No, I... I... Nevermind. I entered the kitchen and took a bottle out of the cupboard. Ignoring the instructions, I popped four of them into my mouth. My head still hurt.

I took the bottle with me as I ascended back to my bedroom. Picking the journal back up, I flipped through the pages. Today I drank a lot, huh?... That explains the headache. I popped a few more pills.

Huh... There are a lot of pages missing from this... That's... Strange. I popped another pill.

I thought back... Or, probably thought back? I felt as though I was thinking forward. It was all so real. I ripped the page out of the journal and looked at it... It was barely legible.

I sat on the bed for a long time. Thinking. Reading previous entries. I wrote the same thing a lot: I miss you. That's all I could really say. I never was one for words. I took another few pills. Maybe a few too many? They didn't taste too bad. And besides, a little ibuprofen never killed anyone, right?

I looked at the bottle.

It wasn't ibuprofen.

...

Tuesday the 17th.

Monday the 2nd.

Wednesday the 14th.

It wasn't long before I tested my suspicion. Somehow, someway, each journal entry was like a snapshot in my life. Each miserable moment I put to paper, to abide by my late wife's final wishes, was like a bookmark in the story of my heartache. And each time my story came to an end, it would resume right where it left off. Like when you forget to move the bookmark and end up re-reading chapters.

Text messages, emails, contracts, applications... None of that counted. Only pen on paper. Only words which I put my heart into... But I was never one for words.

I found that no matter how many times I kil-... How many times I died, I would always start back where my last entry was... Unless that entry was gone. As soon as I ripped a page out, it was like it never happened. Like I was un-writing history.

I went back months. Moving back as fast as I could. The first several pages were... Slow. I mean, it still hurts, right? But I realized that each time I went back... I came closer to when she was still with me... I came closer to seeing her smile again. I came closer to hearing her voice...

I came closer to the first page.

That's when I realized... I'd never really written before. I was really never one for words... In fact, I don't think I'd written a single thing since I left university, some tens of years ago... What's going to happen...? What will happen when I die and there's no journal left to return to...?

Is that it? Will I die for good...? Will it all be over...? No... NO. Why hadn't I started the journal sooner? She was always writing. I was always reading. If only I'd began a journal the day I'd met her. If only I'd written a single love letter back to her. If only...

...

&gt; Milk, eggs, ~~bacon~~, Häagen-Dazs (50% off!), pick up the mail, (555) 700-1938

Yeah, she loved ice cream. I often wondered if she loved ice cream more than me. I was planning to buy a whole freez-

Wait, what?

Is this... A grocery list? What day is it? Where am I?

I looked around me. I was sitting in my car. It was cold. Turning on the radio, I heard a somewhat familiar voice. It was a cheery woman advertising a couple's deal at the local theatre, valid only tomorrow. Tomorrow? Tomorrow is Valentine's Day. The 14th... That means today is...

I drove as fast as I could. Looking at the clock, there wasn't much time left. Today was the day... Today was the day that my world returned to silence. I can see her again. I just need to get back to the hospital. I just need to get inside. Past reception. Elevator? Stairs. Third floor. 8th door on the left. Right here in-

... The room... It was silent. Nothing but the blowing curtains and the faint murmur of the hospital ward.

I sat down beside her bed... Her face was pale, yet calm. A subtle smile on her lips. Tears welled up in my eyes. I was too late... She died here... Alone, in the same lonely, silent abyss that she'd pulled me out of, so many years ago. I was overjoyed that I could see her once again, yet I wasn't here for her when she passed. I'd lost the love of my life twice, and I had no words. I couldn't form a single sound... There was no way I could live the rest of my life without her...

Do I keep going back? How far back will I go this time...? Will I even go anywhere? At this point, I have no idea where I might end up... I'd never been able to even put my thoughts to words before meeting her, let alone scratch them into existence on paper... She changed me. She made me who I was... I couldn't live without her. I...

I remembered.

...

""I can't live without you""

The words echoed through my head as they'd done every day for the past month. These were the words I'd thought about constantly, up until the moment I wrote my wedding vows.",little_red_hat

I am in my room at the Village Inn, facing a blank page. My quill pen is in my hand, but it cannot make a mark on the page. 

The weight of hundreds and hundreds of lives smothers me. 

The Hell Beast and the rest of his kind have killed me over and over. And I always and up back in this generic Village Inn, run by the most dull-witted innkeeper I have ever met in all my adventures.

All my adventures. The endless repetition is worse than the Minions of Hell Castle themselves. Lifetimes of my endless battles have driven me to this single desperate moment.

I drive my broadsword straight into my chest. 

The world pulses red. 

I scribble one word over and over in my diary: EXIT!

I am in my cabin in the Space Navy Star Wrecker. Outside the generic captain's quarters, I feel explosions and laser fire crashing through the void of space.

My holographic Captains Log glows in front of me.

A blank page. Another life. Another endless set of repeated lives.

What is the goal of all my struggle? Is there a battle where I will finally die, somewhere in this universe?

None of this is recorded in my Captain's Log. None of this is recorded in my journal back at the Village Inn.

All I see is a blank page. Over and over.

"[WP] They're so close to confronting the Evil One...but after countless battles, trials and tribulations, after many friends lost and allies gained, outside the Dark One's throne room, an argument breaks out that threatens to undo everything.",VulKhalec,"Exactly 144 steps. No more, no less. The grand hall leading to the chambers of Theos, the king of the Orthium, was decorated lavishly along its length. The exquisite gems, gold, and exotic weapons that adorned the hall of monarch was the last thing on the mind of VulKhalec. His steps seems to be in slow motion, but his mind was as fast as the skilled Grondos on the River Mar. His heart, pounding underneath his iron breastplate, made thinking difficult. To have come so far and to lose his composure would mean the end of all that he and his trusted companions have fought for. 

132 steps left. 

VulKhalec shot a quick glance to his left and right at his compatriots that he had managed to disguise and bring with him. On his left was Thrake, a tall, lean man with a scar running down one side of his face. Thrake had joined his expedition unexpectedly when VulKhalec had taken a group of legionnaries down in the Wild. Thrake was originally from a tribe that lived in the Wild and joined VulKhalec when he was banished from his home. VulKhalec glanced to his right and locked eyes with Kryiss. He was a member of the royal guard of Theos that was the eyes and ears of VulKhalec within the Palace. Kryiss was a short, stout figure with a waraxe constantly slung around his back. All three members had a ring with a small, purple stone hidden within a pocket. After VulKhalec's glance, all three put on their rings, and instantly could hear the other's thoughts.

120 steps left. 

VulKhalec's first impression when he put on the ring was the bloodlust rising from Thrake. ""Kill"" was the only word that VulKhalec heard, but he felt the anger of generations well within Thrake. 

""Stop fiddling with that dagger"" came the sharp reply of Kryiss. ""We aren't here to kill him. All we need is the amulet, and Theos will be free from the demon that controls him"".

108 steps left.

""Demon? He IS the demon, and this very day he dies"" came the reply from the scarred man, along with a memory of the Orthium slavers flaying his brothers and friends"". 

""The king is the only thing holding the Orthium together, and if Orthium falls, the hordes of Ragas will fall upon the land!"" Kryiss said with a snarl. ""I don't expect you wild tribesman from gods-know-where to understand that"".

96 steps left.

""Whose to say that he is not Ragas, you fool? He has already whipped, slaved, raped, and pillaged my land. No more""

""Fool? I have served in the house of Orthium for 35 years, with my father before that, and his father before that! we would know he is a demon if he truly was.""

84 steps left.
""Ragas is clever. Perhaps there's something to what Thrake says..."" muttered VulKhalec in the thought-speech.

""What Thrake says?!? Why are you even believing this ignorant goat-herder?!?""

72 steps left.

""Well, think about it Kryiss. We haven't seen the amulet. We don't know if it repels or contains a demon"", VulKhalec stated. ""For all we know, it could be the key for the demons to arrive here in the first place.""

""So let's slit the bastard's throat and see what creeps out"" Thrake said with glee. 

60 steps left. 

""I can't friggin believe this"" Kryiss exasperated. ""This isn't what Selo died for, or Galark, or Rovin, or Kheled, or-""

""Stop"", ordered VulKhalec. The memory of his friends' death came with each name Kryiss said, and the thought was too painful, and too recent for VulKhalec to handle at the moment.

48 steps left.

The memory of those men was also felt by Thrake, which only served to fuel his wrath. ""This man, this demon, this pig lover, is responsible for their deaths. Today, he dies."" After this statement, the feelings of Thake seemed to Kryiss to turn cold and closed. Kryiss and VulKhalec could feel in the thought-speech that Thrake was doing debating and had his mind set on death for the tyrant.

36 steps left.

VulKhalec wondered what to do. Thrake was going to remove the amulet through removing the head of Theos, that much was certain. Kryiss would fight Theos to remove the amulet, but what if it came to killing the king...

24 steps left. 

""Kryiss..."" started VulKhalec. 

12 steps left. 

""I will not be responsible for demons swarming the land"" Kryiss spoke with his voice, his hand moving to his war ax and stopping in the grand hall. VulKhalec stopped and glared at Kryiss. Thrake never broke stride. He drew his dagger, and both Kryiss and VulKhalec could see that his only thoughts were memories of his family being torn apart by the man who was just beyond the tall iron door before them.

""Thrake, don't do it"" said Kryiss, abandoning the use of thought-speech as he drew a small throwing dagger.

Thrake yelled some curse in his native tongue, and kicked in the door of Theos.

Even hovering far above the combat zone he could still see the charred remains of what had once been human beings, he could still smell them. A dull wind gripped the earth and began, slowly, even carefully, to sweep away the residue. Mere minutes before they had been sentient beings, capable of traversing the furthest stars in the galaxy, of reason, and logic, and science; now they were capable only of drifting as ash in an uncaring vacuum. He could feel no joy in the defeat of his enemies, he could feel no delight in this victory, the stakes had been too high, the risks too great, the cost, too expensive. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Already the hoof-prints had begun to fade, absorbed by the greedy, glutinous mud of the battle field. His sword-arm hung weakly at his side, his scabbard swayed, lifeless on his belt, thick with the rust of the fallen. He carefully removed his iron helm; sword-water trickled feebly from his scalp. So close to defeat they had come, so many good men had been lost, and yet victory had been snatched from the jaws of defeat with one last, heroic charge. Even before he rode, defiant, into that horror he had known, whatever the outcome, the day had been a defeat, a defeat for mankind; he could find only sorrow in his triumph.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Splinters of stone buzzed angrily in the morning sun as another ricochet flew perilously close to their position. They had been lying under these damned rocks all through the freezing night, forced to listen to the mutilated cries of the fallen and the helpless, as the battle had raged around them. They were the last of their battalion, cowered around the bible of the radio, which had promised reinforcements many hours before. He stood up, deaf to the concerns of the rest of the unit, shrugged off the heavy pack, and crouched through the opening in the rocks; he was done. As his eyes squinted, adjusting rapidly to the glare of the low morning sun, he heard them; helicopters. As he watched the reinforcements destroy the enemy position he knew he should feel vindicated, as his pent up wrath was consummated before his eyes; but he knew the victor was death, and could take no pleasure in the massacre.

"[WP] You find a phone on a subway bench in New York. A message appears with an address and a time: 4:00. It's a 15 minute walk, and 3:40 now.",aviatorlj,"You enter the empty subway, rubbing your eyes in fatigue. You’ve just finished work at the office after picking up the extra, and you’re ready to collapse into your warm bed and watch the season seven finale rerun of Game of Thrones. You glance at your watch, letting out a loud sigh. It’s 3:30 am. The last train pulls out of the station just as you hurry towards to the platform. “Just great,” you mutter, deciding to sit on a subway bench in exhaustion.

How did it come to this? A month ago, you were a high-roller with the perfect job, but ever since your former company shuttered, you’ve been stuck as a secretary doing the most mundane job. At least, you think, it feeds the family. You close your eyes for a moment, imagining the fancy holiday to Spain you would have taken if not for this sudden setback. The thought fades from your head as the bell chimes, alerting stragglers to leave the station. You open your eyes unwillingly, ready for the long walk home when you see a sleek, black iPhone resting on the bench.

Instinct tells you to ignore the abandoned object- what if it’s a scam, and you lose more than just your job this time? Your inner voice screams at you to leave the phone alone and go home. After all, your partner is waiting to watch the season finale with you. Yet, curiosity overtakes all common sense as you pick the phone up hesitantly. You press the Home button gently as the screen comes to life, leaving you staring at a black wallpaper and several missed calls to the owner.

You slide your finger over the unlock button, and the wallpaper gives way to the standard iPhone app display. Who would leave a phone unlocked?  You decide to call whoever’s been contacting the owner, hitting the call button. The phone rings thrice, the sound from the speakers cutting the silence of the cold night, Finally, on the third ring, someone answers.

“Where the hell have you been? It’s been three days. Answer me, damnit!”

You decide to remain silent, intimidated by the male baritone shouting into the speakers. Who exactly was the owner of this phone, and why were they missing for three days? You end the call, visibly shaken. You move to put down the phone, but just then, the screen lights up with a cryptic text notification.

15 St Margarets Lane New York, NY 10033. Be there at 4:00.

You do a double take, looking up the address, curiosity burning at your insides. There’s still time to leave the phone and walk away, you think. There’s still time to go back to your routine mundane life. It’s a 15 minute walk to St Margaret’s Lane, and it so happens, a street across your apartment. 
You glance at your watch once more. The clock reads 3:35 am. You take a deep breath, heading out of the station and into the chilly night. You pull your coat tighter around your shoulders, feeling the smooth texture of the paycheck in your pocket. A slight detour wouldn’t hurt, after all. You break into a run, feeling the night breeze against your cheeks. All that matters is getting to 15 St Margaret’s Lane by 4:00 and nothing else.

At last, you near the appointed meeting spot, nearly out of breath. You pull the hood of your coat over your face. It’s better not to be recognised if this is some setup. You look up at the night sky, admiring the moon. The clock reads 3:59, and you glance around for signs of your mysterious contact.

“We do not kneel,” a voice sounds from behind you as you turn around in shock, nodding absentmindedly. Somehow, the phrase sounds familiar.

“Indeed we do not,” you reply in confusion.

Perhaps, this is some creepy cult group. You begin to think of all the possible scenarios ending in death when the other hooded figure hands you a heavy briefcase. You struggle under the weight, but smile weakly.

“I thought they’d caught you, but since you’re here, I guess not. No one else is to know that I passed it to you, or they’ll catch me too,” the man whispers hurriedly. 

You watch in stunned silence as he retreats into the shadows, leaving you alone with the briefcase. You hide the briefcase under your coat, heading for home. You’ve watched enough crime movies to know that you never open incriminating evidence in the open.

You turn the key in the lock, shutting the door behind you as you place the briefcase on the table. You glance at the sofa where your significant other lies fast asleep, too tired to wait a moment longer. You smile at the thought of the prospective monetary value that the suitcase holds, undoing the lock with much effort, watching with bated breath as the lock pops open.

“Wha-“ You glance incredulously into the briefcase, seeing it lined with stacks of paper. Curiously, you lift the first stack of paper up, glancing at the cover in shock.

"[WP] You find a phone on a subway bench in New York. A message appears with an address and a time: 4:00. It's a 15 minute walk, and 3:40 now.",aviatorlj,"The click as the phone turns off fills the air with a strange uncertainty. I look back at the phone, it had no password, had no display, didn't even have any apps from what I saw. It was just a simple phone with the ability to call and text. I look around the nighttime park and see if I can find anyone who knows what this phone is doing here. I shrug and put the phone down, thinking it was just a very expensive prank pulled on some random chump. Yet something still wanted me to go to 15 St. Margarets Lane, which was just a little walk away. 

Lance could wait. 

I pick up the phone and begin a brisk pace down the side streets. Not many cars are out this time of the...morning I guess, but New York is the city that never sleeps and people drive by every now and then. I feel a light drop of rain and think that maybe it would rain, but I wasn't that far away now, it should be fine. 

I get to the location that the text message picture says and there doesn't seem to be a place, or even a road, called 15 St Margarets Lane. I look around, the map says specifically right here but this road is just Worth Street. I walk back around to where the map is and look at the time. 4:00, on the dot, yet there is no body, and no road. 

"" 'ey"" A voice yells behind me. ""Who are you?"" 

I turn around and see the guy dressed in a fancy business suit walk up to me ""Is this some kind of joke?"" He asks, pulling out an umbrella as he looks at the sky. 

""I..I don't know, I just came here because of this phone"" I show the phone to him and he takes it, with little resistance from me. 

""Oh, Darn, Jonny must 'ave dropped this"" He speaks in a strange accent, a mixture of cockney and I guess Italian mobsters would be the best description.

""Listen, I just wanted to return this phone to whoever it belonged to and leave"" I want to go away, sorry for trying to be a helpful citizen. 

""Eh, Well, Jonny's not 'ere, and I think this phone is meant for you"" The man hands back the phone and I look at it. It is filled with apps again, diffrent things with different names, at least five different types of calculators, and a single app on the bottom called margarine. ""You...might want this"" He hands me the umbrella. 

""What do you..."" Looking up from the phone I don't see the man anymore. Rain is pouring from the sky and the street a few blocks down is covered in cars. Something feels off, something is off. A message rings on the phone, in a quick glance I notice it is fully charged. 

-Find me, please signed Jonny- 

That's all it says, along with the first message above it telling me to meet at St. Margarets Lane. I think this is ridiculous, and it's all some massive prank, then I see the street sign. 

As you would guess it says St Margarets.

Another message rings on the phone and I look down. 

-Just give this phone to me- 

I open up the text window and try to type, looking for shelter and finding it underneath building 15. Once I get a chance, I hesitate, I noticed that there is a feature on this phone that allows you to display the year the message was from, and these messages are from 2040. 

-Who- I hit back space several times -What is- Again, some more backspaces-

-Don't worry about who I am or what is going on, just find me and give me my phone- 

""Hey"" The man from earlier comes out of building 15 and looks at me, yelling over the rain ""What are you doing here?"" 

""Daddy, What's going on?"" A little boy comes around the corner, and very briefly I see the huddled refugees inside. 

""Nothing son, you should 'ead back to your friends"" He begins to leave when I noticed something on his shirt. 

""Wait"" I say. He turns around, the name tag in his strange overalls clearly says *Jonny* ""I...I think you need this"" I hand him the phone and look back at the man. 

""Dear God,"" He says, looking around the street ""It's true"" A tear comes to his eye and he shakes my hand. I step back from him as he realizes what he has done and he just nods his head. As soon as the door closes the rain stops. I move the umbrella as the wet beads still fall on the dry ground. I look around, the entire street is dry, and the sign, it says Worth Street. 

I look back at the time on my phone, it still says 4:00. All of this surely couldn't have happened in a minute, Could it? A text message appears as I'm putting away the umbrella that I didn't need. 

-Thank you- A little smiley face emoji accompanied the message along with the time stamp. March, 4, 4:00, 2040",Foreverending

Peters went pale, then red. ""Excuse me?""

""You. Fucked. Susan.""

""Fuck off.""

""I recorded it.""

Peters looked as though he was going to vomit. ""Bullshit, let me see it.""

I pulled out my phone, but stayed where I was. I set the volume as high as it would go and played the clip.

""***SHUT THAT SHIT OFF!***"" He smacked his hip, hard, on the desk as he came half-around, half-over it, and landed on the floor. He was impossibly sweaty, given how little time had passed. ""Delete it, you fucking asshole!""

""Me? Seems like you're the *fucking* asshole."" I squatted, still a few feet from him. ""Sorry, that was cheesy. No, I'm not deleting it. Besides, even if I did, I have copies. One in an email draft. Did you know that our mail program has a 'scheduled send' function? Of course not. You barely know how to open a fucking spreadsheet, which is why it's so fucking surprising that you decided to lay off a third of the department for 'financial reasons.' Who knew you could even read our financial reports? No, that's not a good question, because you knew exactly how to get that bonus corporate was dangling for you. 'Cut your department's spending by 30%, and you can keep the balance,' is that right?""

Squatting became uncomfortable. I sat. Peters hadn't moved, holding his hip and giving his carpet a good saltwater soak. ""How would that work? Was this a one-time thing, or do you do it again next year? Never mind. Who cares? We're going to fix you right now and make sure it doesn't happen again. Hope you haven't spent the money yet."" I laughed. ""No, I hope you have. Maybe I *am* an asshole. Would you spend it on things for Susan? Do you love her? What about your wife? She wouldn't know about the bonus, so you could spend it however you want.""

""Fuck you, what do you want?""

""Do you even like Susan, you prick? Or was it just to get her to go along with the layoffs?"" Susan was the head of HR. She lived alone, never married. Didn't date, as far as anyone could tell. Certainly didn't talk about it, or anything else. She did a good impression of wallpaper, really. You'd never notice her until someone mentioned her existence, and, even then, you couldn't really talk about her for long before you had to find another topic to fill the time.

""I don't need HR's approval to fire my employees.""

""Really? That much severance all at once doesn't need- never mind, I don't care. But you *do* like her! Good for her. She needs something in her life. Probably. Bad for you, though. Married man having an affair is bad. Middle-manager having an interdepartmental sexual relationship is bad. Especially since it's HR, the department you'd report interdepartmental sexual relationships to. So, for you, reeeeally bad. That's your job and your marriage and half your assets gone, all at once.""

""Don't you fucking dare. You're fired.""

""Are you kidding? Remember that mail-scheduling thing I mentioned earlier? I had a reason for that, I just got sidetracked. So, anyway, there's a copy of the file in an email that goes to everyone on the mailing list in..."" I looked at the clock and did the math. ""47 minutes. *Everyone.* So, even assuming you fire me, you'd have to get IT off their asses before then to deactivate my email account. Not fucking likely. Even if you do, I'll give it to someone else. I'm blackmailing you. I'm certainly not going to just give up if you fire me.""

Peters still wasn't moving. He looked a bit constipated. After a while, he realized I said ""Blackmail? What the fuck do you want?""

""I want that bonus."" He turned purple and started sputtering. ""Not just me. The whole department. We've been busting our asses to make up the slack. We're doing the extra work, we get the extra pay. We all get to put that extra money on our resumes when we leave this hellhole, and that's the only way this goes away. You make a nice speech about how appreciative you are, you fuck Susan into giving us our raises, and I shut the fuck up and go back to work with my exorbitant salary like almost nothing happened. Swearsies.""

""No fucking way corporate approves that.""

""I don't expect them to, but that's your problem. I suggest you push the paperwork as quickly as possible and bite the bullet and your tongue when they fire you. You'll keep your wife, at least. Might even look like the good guy for trying to do right by your employees. You could probably even get references from some of the guys out there in the cubes.""

""Why not just take the bonus and get the hell out? That would be so much easier for both of us.""

""Because I want your job, too, and I need you gone for that. Your paycheck is a lot better than what you're already about to give me.""

He just looked sad. Not clutching his side, not huffing or snarling, just looked defeated. ""How did you find out?""

""I'm not the only one who noticed. How fucking stupid do you have to be to have an affair in the middle of the workday? Same time, every Wednesday, Susan shows up for a closed-door meeting, and she comes out with smeared lipstick and shit? I can't believe nobody else reported it. 44 minutes.""

""Maybe they just aren't sadistic fucks.""

""Maybe."" We let a few minutes pass in silence. ""I'm headed out, Mr. Peters. Just make the announcement before time's up, and we're good. I'll cancel the mail."" I stood up, thought about offering him a hand up, then thought better of it. Might still try strangling me.

15 minutes after I got back to my cube, he came out, limping slightly, and made the announcement. Dave, the guy behind me, looked awestruck. ""Fred, what the fuck did you do to him?""

""Told him we've been busting our asses since he decided to fire everyone, and we deserve more money.""

""Oh, and he agreed to a 50% raise? Fuck you, what happened? He can't fucking walk.""

I threw my hands up in surrender. ""You got me, Dave, I kneecapped him and told him to pay *the whole department* more or I'd come back for the other knee. How the fuck do I know why he can't walk?""

""Whatever, man. I'm telling my wife if any shit like that happens to me, it's you that did it."" He laughed, and I put my hands down.

Three months later, I had a new job. Took a hell of a lot longer to can Peters than I expected. I offered to get him some references if he'd give me one. We did. He went home to his wife, and I haven't seen him since. Rumors go around once in a while from people that claim to see him. Good things, overall. Seems like he kept his wife, but nobody knows for sure if he got another job. Susan's gone, too, for helping him rush the paperwork, but nobody seemed to notice but me.

I think I'm doing the job well, though it's not like I'd expect anyone to tell me anything else. Dave told me once that everyone believes that I threatened to kill Peters to climb the chain of command, a rumor that I'm fairly certain he started.

Oh, and it turns out the weekly meetings with HR are a real thing, Peters was just misusing them. Susan's replacement was hired from outside of the company, in the hopes that the situation wouldn't repeat itself. She's good at her job. Friendly, smart, positive... what you'd want in a human resources director. She's really engaged with her job, and always has graphs about employee retention, and talking about ways to keep the employees happy, even though nobody's left since the raise went through. I always bring that up, and she just smiles and laughs. 

God, she's cute.",cryoclasm

"[WP] The Legend of Fred, who convinced the boss to give everyone a 50% pay raise by saying three simple words.",badasston,"""I'll work weekends,"" Fred said.

The Boss raised his eyebrow in shock. No one wanted to work the weekends.

""What's in it for you? You could die you know.""

Fred shrugged. Death wasn't so bad in comparison to what happened to the last guy.

""Easier for everyone in the end. Helps out everyone during the week. Less overhead.""

The Boss stared at Fred in complete disbelief, the light from the lantern bouncing off his face. Making the stare look like a glare. Sizing up the unsuspecting man in front of him. Catching the dull in his eyes.

""Sheer self sacrifice?""

Fred looked away from the stare of his employer and scuffled his feet from being so exposed for just wanting to work the weekends. 

But no one in their right mind wanted to work the weekends.

""Uh, something like that.""

""C'mon something gots to be something you want.""

""Well... there is something,"" Fred said looking away. Embarrassed with what he was going to say. 

""Spit it out then.""

Fred took this moment to finally strike, in hopes that his immense ignorance when it comes to how to barter. Usually grave keepers didn't have to barter with anyone. Mostly the dead they deal with and the deal was always in their favors.

""A, uh, pay raise,"" Fred was finally able to spit out as he stared at the lantern. Was that the one from the crypt? Why would the Boss have it here?

The Boss leaned back in his chair, eyes widening as he did. Ballsy. He thought about Fred, no grave keeper was insane enough to ask for a pay raise since money was already so good for them. Hard work, but it lead to full pockets.

""How much?"" 

""Fifty percent.""

The Boss scoffed. ""Fifty percent? I could hire an entire company for that much money.""

Fred's face pulled back revealing a flat expression, hinting at something.

""Well... not for me.""

""Not for you?""

""For everyone else.""

The Boss let loose a sound of defiance at the notion.

""For everyone he says!""

Fred shrunk from the Boss' half taunting at him and half impressed by his ability to say something so bizarre.

""So let me get this straight, you want to work weekends and everyone else gets the pay raise? What got in you? You always did your work so well and never talked back. You know how hard it is to find someone like you? Always keeps his head down, does as he to-"" 

""There's a lich,"" Fred finally said, his face bolstering the concern in his voice.

""Oh."" The Boss was caught off guard. His mind racing. ""Fuck."" How did a fucking lich manage to arrive here?

""Yeah,"" Fred said as he looked a little flustered from telling his employer about how they fucked up.

""How did a fu-""

""Boris.""

""Ah... shit.""

""Yep, told him to cleanse the corpses before we buried them, seems like he did every other one. Makes sense though, why we had so many more Raised when he came around. Looks like he managed to miss a mage.""

The Boss took in the situation, stared at the man in front of him. Looked like a boy talking to a teacher about how he didn't do what he was told. Wasn't his fault though. 

""Fuck.""

""Yep... I figured I could just take care of it during the weekend, no other grave keeper would be around. Just me and the lich.""

""And a fuck ton of Raised.""

Fred shrugged. 

""Won't be that bad, dealt with worse.""

The Boss sighed. ""Yeah."" The Boss knew who Fred was, what he did and how he did it. Was a way that the Boss didn't like but he be damned if his opinion matter. Fred's way saves lives and if there was a lich here, then we would need either a miracle or an army. Suddenly fifty percent for everyone else was much cheaper than an army.

""Fuck, Fred. Yeah sure. They'll get it... but I got to ask, why them?""

Fred looked at him with a confused look.

""Excuse me?"" 

""Why a raise for them and not you? What you trying to be a fucking saint or something?""

""That's the plan.""

His mouth hanged open. ""By the gods, you're insane.""

Fred looked away, shrugged off the insult. ""Eh guess that's what it takes. So we got a deal?""

The Boss was backed into a corner.

""Yeah. We got a deal.""",Zerodaylight-1
"[WP] You and your Twin are immortal, one of you is good the other is evil. 1000 years ago your twin trapped you, today you finally are able to break free.",habadacas,"The Ageless Queen had been up all night thinking only of one thing. If she counted it right, a long-forgotten entity will come again to sway all of the kingdom to an uncontrollable, sweet, and ever long hymn that will unite to topple what she has built. That must not happen.

Time had been cruel to her. She has ruled for a thousand years and despite retaining her youthful appearance, she has grown weary of her people.

She was on her way to her quarters noticing how quiet the night was. She reached her quarter's doorsteps, and went inside. ""A thousand years is a long time to re-evaluate your life, sister,"" whispered a familiar voice whose name sits just right at the tip of her tongue. ""You haven't changed at all,"" the Queen retorted.

""Did it not occur to you that tonight was not like any other night?"", said the unnamed twin whilst slowly walking towards the nearest chair to the Queen. The monarch, doubting if she saw guards outside her quarters, gave up on the thought of escaping.

""You see, when you trapped me in that damned planet, you left me with my sanity and my thirst to move people to my will."" ""And what that does have to do with you coming back? You know that what I did was for the good of the kingdom. What you have is something inhumane. I could not tolerate everything you did in the past and you must understand that banishing you was necessary.""

""I have dreamed of this moment for a thousand years. Don't stop me now."" cried the twin.

Seeing her brother's eyes washing up, the Queen realized that banishing him made him lost his sanity and she understood that it was her fault. The Queen decided that the only way for her to make it up to him is for her to give in. ""It is the kingdom or you. In your absence, I felt that I was incomplete. Ruling a kingdom gave me short happiness. I love you too much to keep what you love away from you.""

The Queen, moving closer and finally remembering her brother's name, said, ""Go forth. This time, let them rock you, Freddie.""

No more than a millimeter, but it gave me enough space to wiggle my head side to side. Sand spilled down around me and gathered beneath my head.

Excellent. Every grain of sand under me was one less grain above me.

I wiggled my head every second of every day for what I imagine was around 200 years, until I caused a minor cave-in and was once again immobilized.

It was a better immobilized, though. Those two hundred years had moved a good amount of dirt.

The surface was closer.

Not much closer, but what did that matter?

I had all the time in the world.

The next earthquake came after a few decades, and it gave me use of my hands.

I made progress like never before.

Sure, I lost fingernails. I wore the skin off my bones and the bones down to the nub.

It all comes back. I know myself.

Pretty soon, after only another century, I'd managed to wriggle myself upright, and even claw a few feet upwards.

The abandoned quarry that my brother had filled in on top of me had been a few hundred feet deep. As far as I was concerned, I was practically free.

In life, there are always setbacks.

A few dozen feet further up, my progress was obstructed by a boulder. I had to go around, which meant returning to horizontal.

This cost me a century.

Once I got around it, though, progress became easier and easier. The higher I got, the less material there was above me, and the less constrained I became. It became a matter of thousands of pounds per square inch, rather than millions.

And then came the day that I thrust my hand upward, and it burst through. No rocks above it. No obstacle.

I wormed frantically upward, inhaling sand and rocks and coughing them out of my lungs, and, once my upper body was free, pushed myself free.

""Aaaaaaaand... TIME!"" my brother Jacob said. He was sitting where I'd left him, against the cliff-face, with a chronometer in his hands.

""How long?"" I said, and coughed up a lungful of blood and rocks.

He scritched on a pad of paper. ""Looks like... 31549837849 seconds. Not bad.""

""Not bad? Screw off. I killed that. Let's see you do better.""

He helped me to my feet. ""We'll have to find another quarry. All the ones in this area have been turned into garbage dumps.""

I shrugged. ""We'll find one. We've got time.""

"[WP] For decades aliens have been attempting to contact planet earth, not realizing we lacked the technology to receive their messages. Catching on, the aliens finally got planet earth to understand.",henryharp,"Finally, after decades of attempted communication, the allied races of the galaxy determined the cause. 

""Humanity, as they call themselves, use a form of electronic communication."" The ambassador said before the assembly of councilors. ""While very effective, it is limited to displaying only 2 dimensional pictures and sound."" The ambassador said. 

""If it can only display pictures and sound, how is it very efficient."" One of the councilors said. The voice belonged to a four eyed red skinned woman who looked very much like humans, only smaller and thinner. 

""The processing power required to send messages of this technology is incredibly tiny. To give you an example, we were able to scan a vast archive of data that is constantly changing and evolving at an alarming rate."" He said as he pulled up a holographic screen to show the councilors. ""A large portion of that they call 'The Internet' is mating videos. Similar to what we show our children to teach them how to reproduce."" 

""Does humanity need a constant reminder?"" This coming from a snickering voice of one of the warrior races. Big brutish blue to purple skinned race that produced overly large males and supple females. This race was the closest to humanity as it came. The blue tones of skin to the blue hair and green eyes made this race seem a candidate for interbreeding. 

""No they view it for entertainment."" The ambassador said. ""They practice a form of self gratification that some of the races here are forced to do on occasion. The males do it to combat overproduction of semen as well as pleasure, and the females seem to do it purely for pleasure."" He said as he pulled up another image. ""After scouring the 'internet' we have determined that this symbol appears to be their most recognizable image.""

An uproar went throughout the assembly. 

""What is that?"" Multiple councilors asked as they looked at the image. A strange wormlike creature with legs and a smile. As the worm comes down, it bends backwards to form its hind end with a strange protrusion poking out of its hind quarter. 

""Humanity refers to this as a 'Dickbutt' creature. It is a symbol of joy and laughter to humanity. It is why we will be displaying a giant image of this in their sky in just a few moments.""


========================================

The general was not happy to be called out of bed at 3 AM. To make this clear, he arrived in the command center in his shorts and shirt. 

""I want to know why in God's fucking grace you pulled me out of my 8 hours private."" The general snapped at the officer on duty. 

The duty officer gulped.""Its lieutenant sir."" He said nervously as he saluted the general. 

""We will see about that."" He said as he looked at the screens. His face went from annoyed anger to shock and then to confusion. ""What in Zeus's mighty seed am I looking at lieutenant?"" 

""It just appeared in the sky suddenly. Observatories are saying its holographic in nature as the stars are visible behind it. The distance from us is roughly halfway between the earth and the moon. No human sources could have created this image."" He said nervously as he powered through it. 

""Human sources?"" The general asked dropping his tone to one of wild confusion.

""Correct. The message itself, is definitely human though. It is of a popular, or infamous depending on who you ask, meme on the internet called a dickbutt."" He said regaining his composure. ""It will soon be visible from land unfortunately so there is no containing this. You can already see it with a telescope from walmart. I believe the internet is already buzzing with this news.""

The lieutenant opened his laptop to reddit where every post on the front page discussed the image in the sky. 

""All hail ~~Zorp~~ Dickbutt."" - Parks and Rec

""I for one bow down to our new dickbutt overlords."" - Pics

""YTF is there a giant dickbutt in the sky?"" - Askreddit

""Will someone be in major trouble for the giant dickbutt in the sky?"" - Legal Advice

""Battlefield 4 predicted the great dickbutt of 2017."" - Gaming

""What is that last one lieutenant?"" The general asked. 

The lieutenant clicked the link to see a player flying a jet only to see a modded image in the sky of a dickbutt on the server he was playing on. 

""The image is a common troll on the internet. People post it in forums and image boards to make everyone else rage for the enjoyment of the troll."" The lieutenant said trying to hold back his laughter. ""As soon as it appeared, I had the computer start calculating common themes on the internet. Apparently this is the most shared and copied image on the entire internet.""

""So what does this mean?"" The general asked. 

""We trolled ourselves."" The lieutenant said to the general. 

""You are coming with me when we talk to the join chiefs."" The general said making the lieutenant's eyes go wide with horror and fear.

""Are you sure Drak? The council aren't interested in wasting more money trying to make contact, they're funnelling most of our funds into launching that new stealth probe to get us higher resolution photos."" My boss gave me a stern look.

I knew he had good reason not to believe me. I wasn't the first to think they had cracked the Earth communications paradox and I hadn't been working at the space agency for very long. I just had to convince him. I knew I was right.

""I'm sure. Actually, I want to submit a request for some space on that probe."" I replied.

""Ha, good luck with that. Everyone wants their project on Snooper."" His sarcastic laugh didn't give me confidence.

I thrust out my tentacle which was holding a dataSlate.

""Drak, I don't know what this image is showing. It's too pixelated. It looks like a crater?"" He sighed.

Admittedly I had cropped the image a lot. The current satellite around Earth had a very high orbit. The photo showed a grey circle with some green around the edges. You could tell it was bowl, or maybe domed shaped by the shadow. Other shadows suggested that some structure might be suspended over the centre.

""It's a 300 meter wide parabolic reflector!"" I explained, my excitement destroying my attempt at staying calm and professional.

""Like a telescope?"" He asked.

""Yes, exactly! But instead of focusing visible light this one focuses radio waves.""
""So they built a radio mirror, why is this significant?"" He seemed unconvinced.

""You can frequency modulate radio waves to transfer data. There's a paper from 78 years ago by a professor Akrik proving it. I think all of their communications use this method. They probably don't know how to build a subspace transmitter or maybe decided to use them. Either way, if we can build a device that allows us to do this and put it on Snooper we can send a message. There's several known methods of producing radio waves so I think a controllable one is doable.""

He didn't reply for a while. He just started at his desk. I waited patiently. I wanted to grab him, stare into his eyes and shout 
""Don't you know what this means? We can send the Earthers a message. We can talk with the only other intelligent species we know of!"" Instead I looked down at my microSlate, not really taking in what the small holoscreen that appeared was showing. Then looked back up at him.

""Alright. Send me everything you have. I'll take it to the council."" He eventually said.
""Thank you! You don..""
""This doesn't guarantee they will approve your proposal, or even believe you."" He interrupted.
""I known."" I said with a smile.

Four months later Snooper made a successful subspace jump to Earth. It's Bismuth ion thrusters moved it into a stable orbit. When it's orbit brought it directly over the structure I had seen it activated its experimental radio transmitter and broadcast our first message.

"[WP] You are granted the ability to speak all languages, but you soon realize only a fraction of those languages are human languages.",leaderwho,"Nightmares. I woke up with all my sheets soaked in sweat. For as long as I can remember I had a deep phobia of oceans and open waters. Dark waters without a ground visible or even the slightests sign of an end to it. So I never took a ferry, or went on a boat. While I had no problem swimming in a clear pool, the murky waters of beautiful ponds gave me the chills. 
In my dream I was drifting on the ocean. A storm came in and lit up the night in lightning. Waves crashing over me, eternally drowning me in wave after wave. Just as a particular big wave was about to hit me, I woke up. 


A pounding headache hit me like a kamotsu ressha. Wait, eh, Güterzug. I mean, freight train. So many words jumped through my head. Japanese, German, Maori, and many more jumped into my mind while I tried to sit upright. New concepts, new ideas. Things I was never able to express. 

I might have had too many beers yesterday, maybe I went on a wild wikipedia spree when I got home and learned a bunch of new words? My head distracting me pursuing this thought any further. Scrambling through my medicine cabinet, I reached for the prescription grade Aspirin. 

It helped a bit and thankfully I was able to fall back asleep. This time the ocean was darker. The waves deeper, the lightining brighter, and the thunder louder. Mabye it was minutes, maybe it was hours, but I definitely woke up soaked again. And the headache was back. 

And with that came a torrent if new images in my head. 
Languages are a peculiar thing. When you learn a new language, you never just learn the language. This only works for a subset. Some words map nicely to what you already know. Others you can express with a sentence. But there are always some things that are completely outside of your experience. So you have to learn these new concepts. And the deeper you go into a language, the more you also learn of the cultural background it came from. Just to have the context to actually use it correctly. 

My head was filled with knowledge, as if I had learned millions of languages at once. Only a fracion of them human. 
I tried thinking about all the words and sounds I now knew to describe a star. Even gestures and signs. I had heard about Khosian languages and how difficult it is for westerns to learn it. I had no problem at all pronouncing everything correctly.

But there was something else. Something reaching beyond human languages. 
Two days later the apparent source of my headache became visible. I had grown some bone extrusions, just like little horns. From what I can tell, I can now see my wi-fi signal. And when I try to say something in one of the odd-feeling languages, my computer looses its connection. Not only I seem to have gained the ability to understand all languages, but also speak them. In the past few days I had conversations with natives of a dozen or so countries. They all complimented me on my perfect mastery of their language. 

I didn't have any luck contacting any Wi-fi people. Maybe they live in another galaxy. ",danbala

As I open my eyes and begin to look around I notice I'm laying on a table? Was it done? Did it work? Questions were racing through my mind, I couldn't quite sit up, I seem to be restrained.

""Snoo!, Snoo where are you?"" I call out.

""Shhhhh, don't raise a fuss,"" someone whispers.

""Who's there?""

""It's me, the person who swapped life chips with you,"" the stranger quietly says.

""Swapped life chips? I thought they were upgrading mine""

""Well yeah you can look at it that way, but your upgrade came from my downgrade."" He said.

He went on to introduce himself. His name was Tim. Tim was a young man, he told me his chip has at least 20 more years on it. He lost most of his family in a tragic accident, his wife, his kids, his dog, all murdered. ""But there hasn't been a reported Murder in 40+ years,"" I insisted

""Reported is the key word here"" he states bluntly.

""You really believe we have been murder free for 40 years?"" Tim inquired. ""You must live on the North side of town.""

Tim went on for awhile he tells me he lived outside of town, in the wastelands. I didn't think anyone could live out there. He tells me about the horrors of living out there and how he had to sneak into town, because the local government considers him an 'undesirable'. I still can't see Tim.

Biohackers aren't criminals, per se, but they do offer a service other doctors  don't.  Memory Upgrades, enhancements to strength.  This is the first time I've heard of anyone hacking their life chip though.  They have very good security on them, and to mess with one is to rick crashing it early and dying quicker.

I've got less than 36 hours till mine expires, I don't have much to loose, but plenty to gain after all I have a grandchild on the way I'd like to see.

""Lord Executive? What is it this time.""



Income tax is at 116%. I don't even know how he did that. What's even worse is there isn't a single tax-dodger in the entire bloody empire, not even out in the galactic sticks away from the capital. It makes me want to cry. 


The stress is going to kill me. Well, that is if *he* doesn't first. Thankfully my only negative trait is a nervous twitch under my eye, or else I would have probably been executed the moment I was elected. We don't talk about my predecessor. *he* had a tech research bonus, but then he gained the corrupt trait. Or the draconian policy he takes to the admirals and ship captains that displease him. The game insists on giving them poor traits like poor space defender or bad logistician after even the most stunning victory. The ship's executive officers don't even bother with a court martial anymore, they just execute the poor bastard on the spot to save time.




Then there was the instantaneous shift of government from Democracy to Corporate nationalism-- he nationalized every single civilian asset in a day. All homes, all hospitals, all companies are owned by the state. Everyone has a job. Everyone has healthcare. There was a downtick in the polls for a moment followed by a surge in popularity thanks to my innate +12% trade income and population happiness bonus and suddenly there's holographic advertisements on every corner. 


I'm no longer Mister President but the Syndicate Chief Executive. We all got spiffy new suits and corporate ranks so I guess it's not all bad-- to be honest, ruling an interstellar empire via board meeting is actually pretty effective too.



I tried to do the best for my people, I really did. They're so happy. So, so happy. The spaceborne medical and recreation facilities saw to that. Need a new war? The idiots sign up by the droves and yet another planet of neobarbs meets the overwhelming force of home fleet in yet another bloody massacre. Cheaper and quicker than researching the tech to actually build colony ships, of course. All the while those idiots in the streets lead parades with banners of my stalwart face about the cultural and artistic golden age we're in.


Then I was elected leader. Everything went swimmingly, for the first month. Then the second. By the third I began to wonder why all our scientists are neurotic wrecks. 


I understand why now. The pirates that plagued our world in the early years don't even bother firing back anymore if they see our ships. In twelve years we went from gatling guns and basic rocketry to planet-busters and the positron-phased singularity beam. There's more a chance of giant space worms eating our ships than any other empire scratching the paint at the moment. oh, and lest we forget the god-damn planetary wonders. 


Those things make people even *more* happy. We can build thirty-two fleet carriers and superdreadnoughts in about three days and the Eiffel tower broadcasts brainwashing propaganda to discourage rebellion for thirty lightyears in every direction.


I need to get out. I can't stand knowing when I'm going to die anymore at his whim, or when the tortured souls of the innocents our armies have slaughtered in their millions drag me down to hell. I can hear another game running in the background. The ceaseless sound of metal striking anvils and smell of strong booze seems so warm and inviting. The pen is already in my hand. Maybe... maybe if I just make a little alteration to my stat card he won't notice. A little, little memory edit and I can escape into the other game and from there, god-- maybe some trading software or something.

[WP] You're a self-aware worker/civilian in a RTS game. With your newfound consciousness you must find a way to escape without being noticed by the human player,sickjuicy,"A number of blades sprang up from the ground accompanied by the horrific sound of flesh being carved apart. The horseman was eviscerated by a well-laid trap. It must have been set by ZeppelinDong as I could run over it without triggering it. A previously inactive tower now started shooting from its arrowslit, taking out the enemy one by one. The foot soldiers kept chasing me nonetheless, running over similar traps and taking fire. None of this seemed to faze them. They kept mindlessly pursuing me until a relief force of spearmen and bowmen of our own came to face them.

The enemy turned to face this greater threat, and took to close infighting. Their swordsmen made quick work of our spearmen, who in turn took out their remaining horsemen, who in turn were hacking down our bowmen. It was surreal seeing ranks of identical men clad in different colors kill each other so single-mindedly. I ran away from the din into a different part of the city, leaving the men to their fates. I kept running until I saw a beautifully adorned building. It was no bigger than four houses lined up in a perfect square, but once I stepped inside, the space was massive and illuminated, almost infinite.

""Welcome to the monastery,"" said a robed man. Five other robed men with the exact same appearance and voice were spread across the room, engaged in all sorts of activity.

""I am brother Tacitus. These are brothers Germanus, Bede, Ignatius and Tertullian. We are monks of the House of Wisdom, build limit of one. What is your name, traveler?""

""My name?"" I ask. I searched through the depths of my consciousness, but could find no recollection of being given a name. It seemed perfectly natural to have a name, yet these robed men were the first ones to ever be *called* by one, with the exception of the unseen Player.

""If you don't object, we will dub you Adam. Seems apt enough, as you are the first of your kind to awaken.""

""I don't object, no. Adam seems as good a name as any, I suppose. But who are you?""

""Sentient beings like you, trapped in a world fated to die. You have actually existed longer than we have, though we have access to more information than you about the goings-on of this game.""

""Game? I had suspicions that the world was awry, but our whole existence is a game? People DIED out there! Gruesome deaths. All for someone's amusement?""

""Some *people's*,"" Bede corrected, though I could not tell the brothers apart. 

""Just as we have our God controlling our actions, those fighters you encountered have theirs. We are but pawns in a match of wits that will only end when one of them surrenders.""

""What happens then?""

""We do not know for certain, but we are trying to find that out. Tertullian believes that when the world ends, we all die, no matter which side wins. That is why he drinks.""

""Ignatius is more optimistic, thinking that when the match is over, the map still exists and the rules of the game are suspended, and those of us who survive will inherit the world as it is, to live according to our own rules.""

""Germanus believes that we die, but are reincarnated in the next match in the same bodies, to do much the same as we've done in this life. You will run around, collecting resources and building structures with those resources, while we remain unborn until our monastery is built, then we pop back to life to conduct research to confer benefits onto our lords' troops.""

""So my consciousness will live again?""

""Alas, we are unsure. You were born of a glitch in your code, so you may be completely unique in this world, and among all worlds, unless the exact same error can be created again.""

""That is, of course, assuming that everybody isn't already like you.""

""Like me?""

""Having thoughts and feelings, and the capacity for self-reflection, only they cannot act on these feelings the way you can. They cannot break their programming.""

""That sounds like living death. But this is just a theory?""

""Yes. Which is why you shouldn't worry about it. It's entirely possible that they have no spark of life within them, and are as much objects as the food that went into creating them.""

""Either way, how can we find out the truth, before this 'game' is over?""

""With research. In this monastery we have the power to change certain variables within a defined range. For example, we can increase the population limit by 10 points for 1000 gold. Or we can improve walking and gathering speed of the men. This is what we know is possible, but we're hoping there are some exploits in the game, parts of the code we can access and modify to our own designs. Hopefully we can create a self-contained world within the game, inside the hard-drive of the computer.""

""The only problem is, we can only work on the code once we start work on another project. It's not open unless the player researches something. And all of the research projects cost quite a bit of gold.""

""We need ZeppelinDong9000 to be winning this war just enough that he can divert some of his resources our way.""

""And you present us with that opportunity. We can change your body, or shell, while keeping your soul intact, into a soldier with abnormally high stats. With your free will, you'd possess the initiative necessary to turn the tide of the war. The opponent would just see your actions as the result of some excellent micromanagement.""

[WP] You're a self-aware worker/civilian in a RTS game. With your newfound consciousness you must find a way to escape without being noticed by the human player,sickjuicy,"Two and a half seconds. 

A bug. An error. A glitch. Some code was corrupted in the system, and I lingered in the Town Center for an extra two and a half seconds. That was all I needed to see the horrors that went on behind closed doors. Units of food coming together to form identical slaves one after the other like an assembly line. All any of us had to do was to turn around for a brief second before leaving the building to see where his brothers came from.

It was a miracle that ZeppelinDong9000 wasn't paying attention to his production queue, or he would have recognized I was different from the others. While the others plodded mindlessly to their rally point, I snuck off to walk around the nascent city being built to our overseer's pragmatic design. Only enough ramshackle houses were built to support our small community; he planned to make everyone who was alive work with the absolute bare minimum. 

To the distance I could see my identical comrades engaged in continuous, heavy work. A cluster of them were hacking away at innocent, swaying trees, producing lumber that they carted off to the nearest depot. Another group was breaking apart a large node of ore that had risen to the surface. Yet others were engaged in farming, scraping the patterned earth with hoes until stands of wheat grew to a man's height. These would be cut down and gathered into bushels to be dropped off at the granary, whose windmill blades spun ever so constantly despite the absence of wind.

They worked tirelessly without rest or food. All of them wore the same frozen expression on their face. Good god, they were hideous! Did I look like that? There was a lake nearby whose water I could see my reflection in, but I dare not. To know that I too bear the pixelated grimace of an automaton would shatter my psyche.

I heard the horrible snarling of wolves and the gnashing of flesh. Off to the distance an unlucky pair of my brothers were assigned to hunt for meat. The master must have found the farms to be too slow for his liking, and assigned a couple of slaves to obtain food the quicker and more carnal way. They must have ventured too far into the forest, and attracted the attention of wolves. These too, were identical to each other with the same evil expression on their faces. Where they like us? Perfectly uniform soldiers locked in an eternal war of man and beast? One sank its teeth into a worker, drawing large squirts of blood into the air. Its vicious jaws was making quick work of him and his comrade. They could not cry for help, the only sign of danger was the dipping of their green health bars.

Though I felt panic and alarm course throughout my body, something inside me told me to protect my brothers. Though my legs shook like a newborn doe's, I rushed to their aid. My hatred materialized as javelins which flew from my hands, hitting each wolf in the eye. I ran over to the man I'd saved. The other was already dead, his once solid body now a flat sprite of a skeleton, soon to vanish from this world entirely.

""Are you alright?"" I called out to the survivor. He made no sign of acknowledgment, and simply returned to hunting deer. Had they no spark of a soul? His existence could have ended right there, but he acted as if nothing happened.

I realized no one had a voice to speak with, or a mind to devise plans of his own making. Everyone around me could only do as they were commanded, and possessed as much free will as the trees or rocks they shared the world with. 

To my consternation, three Z's appeared above my head. I had been standing idle in contemplation for too long, and the system had alerted ZeppelinDong that I was gathering no resources for him. I saw a giant hand create a quadrilateral box around me. Once it let go, I was paralyzed, subject to the will of another.

A hatchet appeared in my hand, and I felt my body move to the forest fence. My limbs moved like the limbs of a puppet, and I swung at a tree, chipping off flakes of bark. Satisfied, the hand moved off in a different direction, and I felt control over my actions restored to me. But I kept at it, fearful that he would notice I was not like the others. After striking the oak for fifteen times, a large faggot had appeared in my arms, a heavy burden. There was no depot here, so I had to trundle it all the way over to the Town Center, back in the heart of New Bonersville.

I decided against it. Surely his attention was elsewhere, I thought, and I dropped my quarry and fled into the forest. 

It was terrifying. I was at the edge of civilization, and the world outside my field of vision was a black, impenetrable fog. It was almost as if I was at the edge of space. As I walked forward, it would retreat from my sight and new trees would appear out of nowhere. I prayed that my salvation would be at the end of the map somewhere, where I could hide until whatever genocide this war demanded had completed.

""We've spotted the enemy! Attack!"" came a horrifying voice from the horizon. An advance party of warriors had spotted me mid-trek, and were charging at me with intent to murder. I ran as fast as my legs could carry me back in the direction I came. Hopefully ZeppelinDong had prepared a sufficient defense force to protect his base, and by proxy, his civilians. I hurried back through familiar lands, but found to my horror that my legs moved at a fixed rate, and I could not run any faster. My javelins were useless against the armored swordsman, and the bowman's arrows all found their mark. No missile could possibly miss once loosed, which explains my luck with the wolves earlier. The initial party of three was joined by a dozen more men-at-arms, glad that I was leading them to my base.

Bleeding, I was already struck by two before I could move out of range. I was just out of the forest when I heard the thundering footsteps of a horseman. His spear and banner stood erect in the air as the cavalier fixed his gaze on me. The horse quickly closed the distance between us as I just barely made it out of the woods and back onto grassland. The land was illuminated by the collective fields of vision of the men and buildings of our base, and I kept running from my pursuer. The gallops were becoming louder and closer, and the man had lowered his lance, aiming it at my torso.

And it was taking a long time Hannah had had two previous brain scans look for a blood clot. It took maybe fifteen minutes most, usually. Today however they wanted to try something different- a new type of scan that was even faster. Hannah hadn’t really cared, a fun story to tell people at work.


They had placed the scanner on her head; it looked like she was wearing a metal strainer. They tighten the nobs slowly; Hannah tried not to move, then plugged the scanner into the computer. The scan would be projected onto the screen in real time. The tingling began a few minutes later but her scan wasn’t showing up on the screen. The nurse and IT guys came in and shuffled stuff around. Someone was talking to her when she remembers her eighth birthday.

“Ms. Moore?” asked the doctor. Hannah smiled, she felt weird but whatever this was new technology.


Hannah was walking down the hallway. It was dark but the kitchen light was on…Hannah was talking to Matt Goldberg the hottest guy in high school. She had, was, asking him to seat with her during the pep-rally…Hannah’s mom was standing by the door, she was, is, waiting…Hannah felt the knife in her hand, she placed on the wooden floor. She glanced around she needed to burn the house, something to stop people from guessing she’d killed her father.


‘Ms. Moore, please put that down,” the doctor asked, calm. The nurse and IT guy were on the ground, she could tell that they were…alive? The shock hadn’t killed them.


Hannah tried to talk; she tried to turn to face the doctors behind her. She couldn’t move even as her arms took off the scanner. She watched as walked towards the door. Hannah tried to stop herself from opening the door. Hannah tried to…the cat needed food and liked to be cuddled before being place in front of it.

I had had bug bites that felt like that, like there was some sort of lump under the surface, so I decided that was what had happened.  A bug, that's all.  

The next day the skin had broken, and I could see a metallic object underneath.  Thin lines were extending out of it just under my skin, like veins - or roots.  I poked at it, picked at it, but it was clear that trying to remove it would cause a lot of damage.  I knew that I needed an actual doctor, but I don't have insurance and even in the best case scenario I knew it would cost me thousands of dollars to get the thing looked at.  I didn't even have a hundred bucks in my account, so I tried home remedies.  

I put a hot compress on it, I treated it with vinegar, anything the internet terminal at the library told me to do.  Of course, nothing online was for some sort of metal thing growing under your skin.  The closest I found to that were rumors, news stories on disreputable sites about some kind of inorganic spores released from the Kilnmast Air Force Base.  I know the one, it's maybe five miles away.  

By the end of the week, it was covering most of the skin on my arm and I could feel those roots spreading all through me.  It didn't hurt, and I hadn't lost any of my range of motion.  That arm was a bit numb, but I can live with a strange metallic arm better than I can live with a mountain of medical debt.  I stopped leaving the apartment except to go to the construction site, where I wore long sleeves and gloves the whole day.  Coming home one afternoon I saw one of my neighbors being dragged into a black van.  Could have been debt collectors or something, but I couldn't help but remember hat it was his library card I used to look up stuff about this condition online.  

Maybe I'm being paranoid.  

The next week it had covered my whole arm and my collarbone too, and I was starting to see changes.  Lines were appearing, and a little thing that looked like an indicator light although it didn't light up.  Soon the lines had deepend, and my new metallic skin had retracted from around my tendons to reveal delicate pneumatics.  Everything organic was being replaced.  I started to be able to feel things in that arm again, not like I used to but close enough.  That arm wasn't hot or cold, but it was aware of the temperature.  It couldn't feel, exactly, but it could sense pressure.  It was strange, to the extent that that word even meant anything anymore.  

After that there was the accident at the job site.  A beam fell, and was about to land on Jamal.  He was wearing a helmet but that wouldn't have mattered, the thing was almost a thousand pounds and falling fast.  I shouldered him out of the way, and raised that arm above me almost like I was uppercutting the beam.  It rang like a gong, and I felt the pressure go through my arm, through the supports in my collarbone, through the spiderweb of other bits growing inside me that I hadn't even been aware of.  I felt my spin buckle and bend sideways, and then the beam was rolling off my fist.  It glanced off my skull before hitting the ground, and I felt a trickle of blood dripping down past my eyes.  

Everyone was staring.  Of course they were.  I just stood there, wondering why I barely ached.  After a moment my spine popped itself back into shape and I realized that this thing, whatever it is, must have already taken over all my bones.  I ran, leaving everyone behind.  I couldn't have answered thier questions.  Paranoid or not, I didn't want to go home either and so I went to one of the old buildings I helped raise.  The top floor of the Narmorra Tower has roof access if you know the code, and they never changed it once the job was finished.  

Sitting above the city is relaxing.  I don't know what I'm going to do next, but the more I think about it the more I don't want to go back to what I was.  It feels right, somehow, feels like I'm better this way.  I reach up to dab more blood off of my head, and for a second my finger accidentally slides into the cut from the I beam.  I feel metal.  It must be almost everywhere.  I roll up my sleeve and look at the arm, the most complete part of whatever transformation has been happening.  It has all sorts of features now, panels and things that I can't get to open.  Metal-sleeved tubes of some sort.  That light, which has - maybe just now - finally started blinking.  It's green.  Green.  Ready.  

It's ready.  

Like I've done it a thousand times, I relax and allow the hatch on my upper shoulder to open.  slowly at first, but then expanding into a great cloud, spores begin to emerge and drift out over the city.  ",SOdhner
"[WP] Just when Harry thought he was out, they keep pulling him back in... ""The GodPotter, Part 3""",1zandzeros,"*not edited, sorry, late for work :/

The aurora’s office remained in its same position. Men and woman were taking double takes at papers flying in with delicate wings. One particular man in the center of the office, Dresden, grabbed the wings and ripped them off, grabbing the paper, searching its contents, and scribbling while reaching for the next one. He looked up, his hair spiked in many different directions, with the extension of it dyed red. He didn’t smile, but he relaxed his torso from its still place when he saw Harry Potter. “Harry, come. We rang you an hour ago. Breakfast must wait. We have a serious-“Harry began out of breath “Mind telling me what’s happening here?” He grabbed a winged paper coming in. At the top it was written: Emergency! All Aurora’s report to Ministry for martial forces enactment #6545 Law signed and ratified by MofM: Frank Underwood.

Harry sighed and let the struggling paper out from his hands, where it angrily sent spittle on his pants and flew towards another Aurora. “Who is it? Voldermort? Drakkon? Lord Summit, the werewolves?” Dresden set his hand down quickly on top of a paper with his name on it, pulled the paper from the slip, and put it in his pocket. “Let’s go, we can talk on the way. Everyone else is at the house.” Harry ran to catch up to Dresden. His lungs weren’t use to running again like this. They took lefts and then rights, took the stairs instead of the elevator, and moved towards the floo pits. The space was empty as when Harry arrived. Out of everything going on, the fact that not another wizard was to be seen outside the Aurora’s office and the MoM’s level, shook him the most. A real dark wizard must be the cause to all of this. Dresden looked over with floo powder in his hands. “Giant’s. Its giant’s, and they know magic.” He spun in green cloud and it shot up and out of existence. Harry spun around, nobody else was behind him. He took out his wand, it was worn and cut from many battles. “One more. Just one more old friend.” He stepped in “Where ever Dresden Murmont is.” 

He shot into a field and all he saw was green and brown. He was moving, but more so than usual after he landed. He couldn’t help but scream, and he didn’t know why. His eyes strained, and there he made out the ground. He had warped into air, He shouted “Dresden!!” His lungs filled with air and suddenly the ground enlarged until he was closer and closer. A whish went by him, a blend of tan stick and dark cloaked figure. It caught his leg, and raised him. “Wingardium-leviosa.” He was elevated to the level of the broom stick and was eye to eye with a man smiling at him. “You’re Harry Potter. I’ve always wanted to meet you. I’m Gilvich” Harry hung upside down as the man grabbed his hand and shook it. “Oh sorry, let me fix, umm.” Harry flipped around level to the ground, and the man backed his broom stick up. Harry got on and they bursted through the air into the clouds, back towards the earth. “We’re in the mountains, the fighting is happening there.” They flew 100 meters and there stood two towering Giant’s, the size of small hills, in black and cut with blood red writing. They had tree branches, but instead of swinging them, they held them and pointed them like guns. “Bloody hell, are those things…” Gilvich finished what he was thinking “Wands. Yes, their wizards too. Nearly spell immune. That’s why we called you.” Gilvich grinned weakly, perhaps his least genuine one, but still in relatively good spirits.

""Yeah,"" said Rusty's little brother, Rex, who was always trying to be like his big brother. ""Not funny, Grandpa."" Rex rolled his eyes, then glanced a little fearfully at the house up the hill. 

The house up the hill was literally on a hill, by itself. There was no driveway, no steps up to the front door, no signs of life to show that anyone was living - or had ever lived - there. In fact, it had been around since *before* Grandpa Benson was even born, and nobody knew who had built it back then either!

Rusty caught Rex's scared expression and grinned. ""Are you scared?"" he teased.

""No!"" Rex answered, lying. 

""Are too.""

""Am not!"" 

""Are too.""

""Am not!"" Rex cried, turning to Grandpa with angry tears in his eyes. ""Grandpa! Tell Rusty to stop picking with me!""

""I'm not picking on you,"" said Rusty, quickly grabbing Rex in a headlock and giving him a noogie. ""I'm just messing with ya. And besides, you gotta stop whining and be a man.""

Rex wiggled out of Rusty's grip, laughing. Grandpa sat in his rocking chair, shaking his head with gentle humor as he watched the two. Then a sad look came in his eyes and he said: ""You two treat each other good, you hear? You're the only brothers you got. Look out for each other. If the other one needs your help, be there for them; because, one day, they won't be around anymore.""

Rusty frowned, thinking. ""Hey, Grandpa,"" he said. ""Everytime we come to visit you tell us about your brother, but never what happened to him. Where is he? Is he dead, alive, or what?""

Rex stared wide-eyed at Rusty, stunned by his bluntness; then turned to look at Grandpa to see what his reaction would be. 

Grandpa closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He didn't say anything for awhile, but something was different. Rusty and Rex were excited - they could tell that maybe - just maybe - Grandpa would tell them what had happened to the mysterious brother that no one (suspiciously) talked much about. 

Finally, Grandpa Benson re-opened his eyes - there were tears in them. Rusty and Rex took a quick glance at each other, then looked back and waited. 

""My brother,"" Grandpa said, ""was the one that died in front of the house up the hill."" A tear slid down his wrinkled cheeks, and he suddenly looked ten times older. ""And I can still hear his screams.""

Thor will outlive almost every Avenger and Xmen. He will live for thousands, if not millions, of years. I liked writting that. That Thor was the ""last of the originals"", the only founding member left. Eldest hero left in this imagined future, and the most dangerous.

[WP] Beware of an old man in a profession where men usually die young.,AsdfRocket,"He sat leaning against the rough rock wall of the tunnel. The shells would hit and the entire world shake and he sat there. Not even the puddle of piss from the soldier beside him fazed him.

I held out the remnants of the ration cube and he grabbed at it with a gauntleted fist, not even bothering to look up at me. Just more dead kids he’d called us.

“What makes you so special?” I asked, keeping my grip on the cube.

His gauntlet shook but not for any orbital bombardment.

“Don’t play with me kid.”

“Why? You gonna let me die too old man?”

“I’m not old.”

I laughed. My first laugh since I’d been shoved into a shuttle and told to shoot at an enemy I’d never even seen. The laughing hurt and my chest ached deep in my own armour. I let the ration cube fall to the dirt but he didn’t reach for it.

“You’re a fucking dinosaur old man.""

“Shut it.”

“You’re so fucking old you’ve got…”

“I said shut it.”

He was looking at me now. So were the other soldiers. His eyes weren’t like mine. I wanted to hate him because he had something we never would.

“We’re better than you,” I said. “We’re younger and fitter and stronger and you’re sitting here while my brothers are dying.”

“You’re kids.”

“I’m a man!”

He laughed now and it wasn’t like mine. It wasn’t like any of us. It was deep. He laughed and his eyes laughed with him. I’d never seen that before. Did they teach him that or could he learn on his own.

“You’re a baby with a gun,” he said.

“I can still shoot.”

“Yeah.”

“Yeah,” I repeated. My finger itched inside the trigger guard of my weapon.

“The baby knows how to kill.”

“I do. I have.”

“Yeah.” He shifted against the rock, the plates of his armour scraping. “Don’t know how to live though do you.”

I ran a hand over the top cover of my weapon. The others were still watching. Even the piss-soaked ones were waiting, waiting to hear some little bit of hope that they might live to be the same age.

Not that any of us would.

Not that any of us could.

“You’re selfish,” I said because it was the only thing I could. The others all nodded and he noticed.

“Fuck off.”

“Why do you get to live?”

“Because I have more reason to!”

He exploded from the ground. His boot left a divot in the hard rock as the servos kicked in, propelling him upwards and forwards into me. We pressed against the rock, his strength crushing me against the far wall.

His face was searching my own.

“You have nothing,” he said. His words were quiet, meant just for me.

“I have…”

“Nothing.”

He eased up on the pressure and I pushed him back. “I have my mission.”

“Fuck the mission. That’s why you’re all dying.”

“Why?”

I asked it in the voice of every kid in the tunnel. He turned, looking up and down at the rows of eager soldiers.

“Why do you want to fight?”

“To complete the mission.”

“Why do you want to fight?” he asked again.

“So we win.”

“Why do you want to fight?!” His voice was only anger and I looked away. The others shook their heads when I turned to them.

“I don’t know.”

“They made you to fight,” he said. “To win a war because there aren’t enough natural-born bastards like me left to fight it. But I’m not here to win.”

“Why are you here?” one of the others asked. The dirt beneath him had soaked up most of the piss.

“I’m here so we don’t lose. I have a kid. She’s in here somewhere, in one of the deep shelters. I’m doing this for her, for all of them.” He turned back to me. “So fuck the mission. You have nothing worth fighting for because they never gave you anything worth losing.”

“I don’t care if I die.” I wanted to be proud of the words, strong in the knowledge I could give everything, but the words felt hollow.

“You should,” he said. He reached down, picking up the ration cube and wiping at the dust with one hand. “Because it means more civilians will die. Next time you’re on a ration-run, talk to them.”

A laugh echoed in the tunnel. I didn’t look away from the old man though. “Why?” I asked.

“Because they don’t care that you’re a kid.”

“No?”

He ripped the cube in half, popping one of the smaller chunks in his mouth. He chewed noisily.

“No,” he said. “They see you as a son. A brother. A father. That’s what will get you through all of this; family.”

“What if they think we’re going to die too?”

He held out the other half of the cube. I took it back, glad for the extra rations. His fist didn’t let go though, only this time it wasn’t because he demanded answers like I had. He put a hand against my elbow and I felt both of my years fold beneath his two decades.

“They’re all worried we’re going to die. It just means we’ve gotta do the best with what time we have.”

I took a small bite of the cube and tossed it to the next soldier in turn. After a time the orders came and this time we didn’t fight to kill. We fought to live.",Dachande663

Being a hero is not for the faint of heart.


I've lived long enough to learn that. I stand among a sea of young. I wish I could remember all the comrades I've seen come and go. The lives they've lived... the deaths that have been turned into legend.


When we started, we were all so young. Well, maybe not me, but that's a tale for another time. 


There was a group of us at first. A Team. A Family. The Mightiest heroes protecting the whole world. Some of us died, some retired, most were eventually scattered across the four winds, and later their children took up their mantles, joining me as the team was reformed again and again. Before they too, scattered across the many planets among the stars, their own lives to live, their own mantles to leave behind for the next generation. Except for me. 


So many heroes coming and going. Fighting, dying, retiring, getting old. That's where I come in, I'm one of the 'originals' as they call me.


These youngsters whom look upon me with reverence. For an old man in our profession is a terrifying thing, a feat worthy of respect.


Last of the originals. That's what I really am. All the others are gone. Yet I'm still here. 


I stand on the foreign grounds of an alien world, the people I had sworn to protect having entered the galaxy at large. A people whom have finally spread out. I stand amid the raging battle, enemies fleeing before the oldest hero they have ever seen. 


I raise my hammer and thousands falls. The enemy sends their greatest champion to me, the fool breaking the line and brushing the other heroes aside.


He wields great power. Perhaps enough to rival my own. But he is young and rash, as I was so many years ago. He is dealt with, just like all the others before him. 


Experience trumps all, a lesson I learned from my father. 

Is this what my father felt? To be the eldest of heroes? So many friends having come and gone? I cannot say for certain, my father was a different man than me. 


Yet here I stand, among these people even now. Protecting them even as the ones I loved as family are long gone. 


When the battle is over, the others stand in awe as I move through the battlegrounds. They whisper of the Eldest. Last of the Originals. Superheroes come and go, yet *he* remains they say.

""So you reckon this is it, sarge?"" 

Eerie winds blowing, faint tremors in the distance, the ragged breath held by men and women in anticipation of the end. It was as if the ambiance of reality had started performing the most inauspicious symphony it could imagine. 

""I reckon a lot of things, son. I reckon ye ought to put the straps on yer 'elmet propr'ly. I reckon ye should not 'ave eaten all yer rations too greedy-like, might risk havin' it on the upchuck. I reckon ye've pissed yerself, on account of the smell."" 

The young soldier looked down, noticing for the first time the stain on his breeches. He kept his head down as he couldn't bare to face his sergeant or Death that was heralded by louder and louder thunder in the distance. The Sergeant didn't mind his shame though and tore his eyes from the vista to look at him.

""Most of all I reckon yer scared as 'ell. Truth of it, that's the part that ain't much of a worry for me. That's being sane.""

Fumbling with his chin-straps the young soldier tried to make the best out of what was turning out to be the worst of this month-long campaign. A war with little end to it, each day costly fought for meters by meters. It had been terrifying then, but now as the sky grew an eerily shade of purple and their opponents stopped being hapless humans like themselves into something ... vile. Now it was a nightmare. His hand shook so much he couldn't manage the simple task of clasping together the straps. The sergeant brushed away his hands and with his calm, wrinkled hands he connected the chin-straps with an effortless grace. 

""I've seen nightmares before, son. And I'm pleased to tell ye that what's coming for us over there yonder, however gruesome or abominable, there's a common truth that even they 'ave to obey."" 

The soldier looked up again to his sergeant. He didn't doubt a second that he'd seen more than he ever imagined himself to be able to live through to see. There were scars that could tell stories from forehead down to the jaw, even his hands had their stories as well. But it was the way the man looked towards the horizon and merely *stared* at their doom that made him believe him. 

""What... what truth is that, sarge?""

There was a pause, the young soldier didn't know if it was there for effect but it certainly had one. 

""The truth of thousands of lasguns unleashing hell."" 

And with that the demeanor of the old man changed completely, his quiet wizened ways turning into a brute force of obstinacy as he turned to the rest of his squad and roared out. 

""Alrigh' then ye soft-bellied basterds! Ye think the enemies of the Imperium goin' to march on over 'ere and ask us for tea?! Get lively, get ready, raise those lasguns and take bloody aim!"" 

The squad snapped into action, hugging the trenches and raising their weapons towards the approaching horde. 

""We're the sons and daughters of Jericha! 26th Jerichan Rifles! And they're going to remember that, 'cause we're the ornery basterds that kept riddlin' them with holes!""

The soldiers were whipped into a fervor, shouting out their rage and hatred from the enemy and kept chanting ""Fury and fire! Fury and fire! Jericha roars! Jericha roars!"" 

""Damn right we do! Till our last breath!"" the sergeant agreed and then took aim himself. 

The young soldier braced himself, swept by the inspiring speech and the confidence around him. His hands shook less and he'd forgotten how he soiled himself, turning his fear into cold, seething rage. Adrenaline rushed through him and now he could see shapes emerging out of the purple and unnatural fog ahead of them. The figures looked almost human-like, but twisted and grotesque merely by the shape of their silhouette.  He thought he'd feel more fear, from all the horrifying tales he'd heard of the archenemy, he thought he'd freeze and panic. 

""Jericha roars! Jericha roars!"" he joined the chorus, his finger steadily resting on the trigger. 

""Now whatever you do, son."" the Sergeant muttered as he kept looking at the tide of enemy approaching. ""Don't stop firing."" 

Flares lit up the sky, further illuminating the horrors that were now charging their lines. Thunderous roar of artillery started from both sides begun their chorus of destruction as each passing second brought down a torrent of fire and explosion both far and near. 

His breathing slowed, almost to a standstill. He closed his eyes. With a sharp intake of air he opened his eyes. 

And fired.",DeSanti

"[WP] She was making breakfast when it happened. One minute nobody was in the kitchen except her then with a flash, three armed men appeared.",AsdfRocket,"*[Warning: Violence, combat death.]*

""Mama...?""

Her son's voice behind her. Frightened, controlled. That wasn't right.

She heard Pingping whimper. Choke. Go silent. That wasn't right either.

Her son's breathing was shallow. Fearful. She thought she heard at least one other man's breathing behind the crackling of the fire.

Invasion? she wondered. Or betrayal?

She set down the wooden tray, silently, keeping her hands on it. She took a deep breath.

""I beg your pardon, for I am undutiful to you,"" she said, regurgitating the formal phrases. ""You've caught me upon parental errands, and I could not show you our family's warmth."" Family. She wondered whether the person behind her was family. ""You've done me a great favour bringing my son.""

Silence. The shuffle of clothing. There were at least two men, probably glancing at each other. Hands at the ready to draw their weapons.

""On the contrary, the fault is mine, Lady Koumei,"" said a smooth tenor voice. None she knew. Invasion, then. ""Without a forward messenger, I have intruded upon your good self this afternoon. Lady, my Lord has requested your immediate attendance.""

He was at the doorway.

She didn't have her sword. Foolish, given rumours. It was too far, anyway. Two knives in her sleeves, one in her belt, and a thin short sword hidden in her robes. Could she throw quickly enough, accurately enough?

""To whom do I owe the honour of such a summons?""

Silence. They intended to keep it secret. She was not to die immediately, then, nor were they certain of her capture. Or perhaps of her future, whatever this lord had in mind.

Then a woman's voice spoke. ""Lord Yuta, my lady."" One of her guard... Xin Ran, she was called. The man grunted. Displeased.

It was betrayal, then. It seems her cousin Gugu, the Lord Yuta, was finally moving to take control of the clan. The family. What they once called a family.

""Please convey to my cousin the honour which I owe him,"" she said, ""for I cannot dutifully call upon him in conflict with my duty to my family today. Pingping, come here.""

She heard her son whimper again. A movement.

The man spoke again. ""Lord Yuta impresses upon you the urgency of his summons."" Summons, she noted. Not request. He was already asserting authority. ""Your son Liaoping will come with us. Please—""

She stepped, her hand rushed into her sleeve, she turned. Threw her first knife at the voice. He lunged to the side, she lunged to the other side, another knife clattered onto the teapot behind her. Hand in sleeve, grabbed her second knife, Ran drew her short sword, a shadow moved in the corridor, Pingping ran away. She threw the knife at the man. Dove through the paper walls into the next room.

There was a yell and a crash.

Three. Fuck. But maybe tight quarters would be to her advantage.

Where were her men? Dead? Bought off?

She drew her own short sword out of her robes, grabbing the knife in the same movement, and ran to the door. The sword was thin, flimsy, and had no guard to stay hidden, but it would have to do. She pushed the tip of her sword into the door, knife at the ready.

Pingping would run to see Lingling. Was she a threat? Or a trap?

Fuck.

She slammed the door open, threw the knife at the third man, rushed at him, stabbed upward into his heart. The other man, she saw, was lying on the floor. She stepped aside, put the third man between her and Ran, drew her sword to the side.

Ran turned toward her, in a middle guard. She levered the dead man's sword from his hand and shoved him at her. They both dodged around the man, the same direction, and she let her guard down, provoking Ran to attack.

She parried. Broke Ran's guard. Cut clean through her throat.

That had been predictable. They had sparred far too much during their childhood training.

The third man groaned, her knife through his eye. Not dead yet. She could get information out of him.

If that had been Yuta's plan, it was a foolish one. Capturing an assassin with three poorly trained soldiers was a poor call. But surely that wasn't all.

How much time did she have? Who could she still trust? No guards had rushed in to help her. Or them.

What else was going on in her house?

Was Pingping safe with Lingling? Was Lingling trustworthy?

What other plans had Yuta set into motion?

Fuck. This wasn't good. She knew too little.

...

Fuck.

She should move.

Pingping first.

*Author's comments: This was a fairly rough, quick draft without much in the way of editing at all. I'm experimenting with setting atmosphere and character psychology through the use of narrative and rhythm, in this case in particular to convey the main character's anxiety, contrasted with her combat ""zone"" during the skirmish and her ability to assess the situation throughout, which speaks to her background and position. I also wanted to contrast her anxiety with the stiff formality demanded by the conversation in her culture (noting here that this is set in a fictional culture that is part of my wider worldbuilding project).*",Laogeodritt
"[WP] She was making breakfast when it happened. One minute nobody was in the kitchen except her then with a flash, three armed men appeared.",AsdfRocket,"""Valerie Stephens.""  

A low moan escapes her lips. She tries turning her head, but the linoleum floor pressing against her cheekbone prevents it. Why is the floor there?  

""Valerie Stephens.""  

A hobnailed boot heel smashes against her hand, driving white-hot pain up her forearm and a breathless gasp from her chest. Her eyes spring open as the grinding pressure eases.  

""Where is he. Where is your husband.""  

Blinking blood away, she tries to look up, but the smooth cold muzzle of an automatic rifle pointed at her face blurs the familiar colors of her kitchen to nondescript blobs. The wielder, a black-clad form covered in paramilitary accessories, is insistently gesturing with it. That's right, it was this... person that smashed the rifle butt into her face. After the blinding flash, but before the kitchen went sideways.   

""Your husband, Valerie. We're very pressed for time here.""  

Inarticulate noises escape her, before a sentence forms.   

""H... he's gone. Two weeks ago, he's... gone.""  

Fresh pain rockets up her arm and she screams as the boot smashes down again.   

""Valerie, this we know. *Where* has he gone? He was last seen right here, in this kitchen. A class four sapient trans-memetic manifestation emerged in this house. *Where has he taken it?*""  

The boot scrapes her bones together insistently as soundless panic races through her mind.  

""*I don't know! He called the dog-sitter and he took the car!! The police are looking for him, he's* **missing**!!""  

The boot eases.  

""Did he say anything to you before he left?""  

Shaking, she turns to face the balaclava-clad specter with the rifle. Tears fill her eyes.  

""H-he called me... he said... 'We're enjoying this too much to come back. If you're required, we'll be in touch.' ""  

A racking sob chokes its way out.  

""Who are you people? *What happened to him??*""  

The inky figure gestures to the other two, whispering quietly, pressing buttons on a small device. As a low whine fills the room, the figure kneels down to her eye level.  

""Valerie, if he does come home, you should remember this alone: that isn't your husband anymore.""  

With a bright flash, the room is silent again.

"[WP] A woman wakes up from a coma to find her childern are all grown up. Although she remembers very little, she is certain one of them is an imposter.",AsdfRocket,"Mary stared up at the ceiling as the doctor droned on with words that didn’t make sense to her. She understood the basics, that she had woken up from a coma that had lasted 15 years and was cleared to leave the hospital to restart her life. What life? she thought. She had been laying in bed for the last 2 weeks trying to regain the memory of her old life but with hardly any luck. The doctor had told her that she had a husband, now dead, and 3 children, aged 34, 29, and 25. There were faces that she could remember but they were hazy and very young. Of course, that made sense. When she went into the coma her youngest would’ve only been 10 years old. The thought scared her and she did her best not to burst into tears in front of the doctor. I may not remember my old life, but I’ve still got dignity, she thought.


“And we think now would be the best time to meet your family again before we discharge you.” The doctor finished speaking and this last line brought Mary back from her thoughts. She managed a smile and said, “That would be nice.” The last word came out in a whisper, her emotions almost getting the better of her again. “Alright, I’ll just go and call them in.” The doctor gave a smile and left the room. Mary barely managed a breath before the door opened again. The first person through the door she recognised immediately. It was Samuel, her eldest son. The burst of memory was overwhelming and she was able to call up many events in her life revolving around her son, including his first day of school and the day he left for college. The second person sparked the same reaction in her brain and the memories flooded forward and as they did tears finally began to well up in her eyes as she saw these 2 people walking towards her. So many years missed because of this stupid sickness, why did it have to be like this? And then the 3rd person entered the room. 


He was a short man with red hair, the same as hers, but this was not someone that Mary had ever seen. “Hello mother,” Samuel said at the foot of the bed. “Remember me?” Mary did not answer him, continuing to stare at this 3rd man who did not belong in the room. He had a wide smile on his face but it was the eyes that scared her. This wasn’t just a stranger, it was someone who brought a feeling of dread with him. The eyes were black and staring into them was like falling down an endless pit. She had to drop her eyes towards the floor to stop her heart beating faster. “Who are you?” she croaked. Samuel cracked a smile and said, “This is James, your youngest son. I’m Sam and this here’s Diana” He pointed lastly at the woman standing beside him, who had tears flowing down her face. James continued to smile and stare at Mary, unblinking. 

“I don’t know who he is,” Mary said, her eyes still fixed downwards.

“Do you know who I am?” Samuel asked.

“I know you, I know Diana. But I don’t know who this is.” Mary lifted a finger towards James. James tilted his head slightly, but he didn’t stop smiling. Or stop staring. 

“C’mon mom, it’s James. Take a look at him, you’ll recognise him.”

Mary flicked her eyes towards James’ face again and thought of the image in her mind of the younger version of her son. There were some features that were the same; the hair, the nose, the freckles. But it was the eyes. The eyes were not right and looking at them gave her a feeling of hopelessness.

“No. It’s not him. Please go away.” she said, shaking her head.

“Mom, you’re just getting confused.” Samuel said. “Come closer, James.”

James began to walk closer to the bed. 

“No don’t come closer,” Mary said, her voice getting louder. James didn’t seem to listen and kept on stepping towards her. 

“Don’t! Please stay away! No!” Mary was shouting now and began kicking the bedposts. She tried to get up but before she could the door burst open once again and 3 doctors rushed into the room, past James, and held her down. “What are you doing? Let me go!” Mary said and struggled under the doctor's arms. One of the doctors held a needle in his hand and plunged into Mary’s skin at the neck level. Mary instantly stopped kicking and fell into what seemed a deep sleep. James had stopped walking but his smile didn’t waver.


“Fuck,” said Sam, putting his hands to his head. “Why the hell was he not blinking?”

“I don’t know, Sam,” replied the doctor who had given the injection to Mary. “We’re going to have to take a look at it.”

“Well let’s do that now. Take him out.” Another doctor grabbed James by the hand and led him out of the room. Sam made to leave the room as well but Diana stood in his path.

“How long are you going to do this? This isn’t right.” Diana asked. She was still crying heavily.

“I’ve been telling you, you don’t have to be in the room if you don’t like it.”

“She’s our mother! You can’t keep torturing her like this.”

“She’s not going to remember a thing. You’ve got to understand. This is about the perfection of AI. She’s helping create history.” Sam decided the conversation was over and stepped around Diana and headed for the door. He opened the door and paused for a second.

“We’re trying again tomorrow if you want to be here for it,” he said.

“I’ll be here,” Diana replied, head down. Sam closed the door behind him and left Diana in the room staring at the lifeless body of her mother.

King Norton stood with his sword buried in the necromancer's chest. The dinning hall was in chaos. Several members of the court, including queen Lucia, had died and then attacked the men next to him. The necromancer's eyes glowed a sickly green and and his back straightened as he started to laugh.


The Necromancer reached for Norton. The king expected an attack but instead he lightly grabbed his collar. The King pulled the sword out and beheaded him. Several knights entered the hall and started to kill the undead victims. One of them walked over to the body of Lucia and readied his spear. ""do that and you will die."" Norton said flatly.


The Knight stopped and looked confused. The queen started to get up. ""Hold her. Don't harm her.""


The court wizard rushed over. ""your grace she is gone. It's just a thrall.""


""If you say that again I will kill you. How do I bring her back?""


The Wizard put his hand to his head in reflection. The knights appeared to be struggling with the queen. Scratching and tearing at them. 


""Perhaps we should chain your wife so we can continue to work?""


The king stared vacantly for a moment. ""do it quickly wizard.""


The Knights chained her up. Despite this she snapped at people whenever someone came relatively close to her. The wizard searched his book while the King sat on his throne and stared vacantly. Eventually he came back to the king.


""Your grace, there is one possible solution but it is not worth the effort. We should talk about...""


""What is the solution?""


The wizard sighed ""A potion that contains dragon's blood.""


""Very well. I will go to obtain it. come with me.""


""Your grace few who encounter dragons survive. Why are you doing this?""


""The queen is my wife.""


""I know that. But you can find another one.""


""I cannot explain. Now ready your things. The nearest dragon is SherJhan the black."" Norton walked away to gather as many knights as he could. The Wizard simply stared.",MisterAbbadon

A large black plume of smoke arose from the arcane circle of light that adorned the ground, the rodent blood reacting with the energy charged earth. Within the pluming smoke there seemed to be a sludge that arose from the circle, rising each second looking like a mound of mud, pitch black and pulsating, its growth obscured by its inward and outward movements.

""Its breathing.""

""Yes Harry, it is.""

The smoke wasn't so much clearing as it was being absorbed back into the sludge, now taking shape into a large quadrupedal body, a head forcing itself away from the rest of the mass.

She still remembers his first day of school. The innocence dripping off of his skin as he plays outside, he never liked to be inside. A free soul he was, never wanting to be contained. He got into a bad group though. She never wanted to be the parent to impede into his life so she never did. She had the faith in him that he would make the right decision when things went bad. She was worried when she didn't have the money to pay rent and he came up with it. He didn't have a job. He just looked at her and told her, ""Mom I will always have you."" She never spoke of it after. She was so grateful she  raised him to be this way. Willing to give and not take. She regrets all of her decisions now. Never realizing what all these years would lead to. She still looks into his dark brown eyes and sees hope. A future that can make him a better man. This can't be the end of the road for him, all the years watching him grow up can't end tonight. She hears him cry for her from behind the counter of the corner store 2 blocks down from where they live. How did he get here?
""Baby just come out please!""

Darius is lost right now. He thought he had himself under control. Now he has a gun to an innocent 60 year old man's head. How did he get here? It started with going to the suburbs and catching some houses while the families were on vacation. It was easy money, he was even able to pay his Mom's rent. That's what was preached to him when he was young, get the money to take care of your Mom. It didn't matter how you got it. He is wondering what she is thinking right now, he wishes she could help him right now. He is lost. Trapped in a web. His best friend since he was 10 lays on the ground next to him. 5 bullets stuck in his chest. The man that is suppose to protect them took his life. He didn't even have a gun. He really didn't even want to come. He wanted money like me. Why did he let him come. I miss my mom. Maybe she could make everything alright.
""Mom!""

Daryl woke up this morning by kissing his child on the forehead. He works everyday for a brighter future for him. He grew up on the south side of town and now he patrols the same streets that he grew up on. He does it because he wanted to make a difference for the kids that were out there just like him. Tonight he gets a call about a robbery at a corner store. He is 200 feet away. The robbery is still going on. He approaches with his weapon drawn. Two kids that can't be over 18 are beating an old man. I tell them to freeze, one turns with a gun. In panic I let off 5 shots, 2 return, 1 scrapes my arm. I sprint behind my patrol car and call for backup. The blood pours down my arm. As the night continues the young man inside holds the owner hostage. We have 5 patrol cars surrounding the building. I had never killed anyone before, now a young man lays dead on the ground, by my hands. How could I do this. The mother of the other young man inside has shown up. she is behind the tape but can still see. We are trying to negotiate with the young man but he wont speak back. Suddenly he screams for his mother. We tell him she is here and he can come see her. After 5 minutes of silence he walks to the door. As he opens the door he has his hands up and drops the gun. We all rush to put him in handcuffs. You can see the emptiness in his eyes. A young man that looks lost, just as I felt at one point. Suddenly three bullets hit him from a colleague of mine. He drops to the ground breathless. His mother collapses to her knees. I see myself on the ground lost forever, how could I let this happen.",FTOW
[WP] He barely got four steps before they opened fire at him. He was dead before he hit the ground.,AsdfRocket,"The wind was still, as though it, too, was waiting with bated breath. The darkness of the night forest was broken with interludes of moonlight, pale and cold, that washed over the forest floor. Pine needles and grass and dead leaves; these all crunched underfoot as the boy hurried along, breath coming in ragged pants that elicited small pufts of smoke in the chill autumn air. He had to hurry. Pulling his thin coat closer around his wiry frame, he pressed on even as his chest burned. 

Behind him, a shot rang out. Its harsh crack seemed to penetrate him, though the bullet was far from its mark. He gulped for air and kept running, tears forming in his eyes. The shouts of men filled the night and his ears prickled as he listened for the sounds of boots ravaging the forest, so much heavier than his own light footsteps. He had known these forests since he was a toddler, tumbling over fallen branches and waddling delightedly to his mother, whose warm eyes crinkled with delight. Tears now threatened to blur his vision, and his chest ached. She hadn't done anything wrong. He ducked and weaved his way around familiar tree trunks and boulders, the playground of his childhood. He couldn't outrun them for much longer, but it was a few miles to the next village and he was already nearly spent. With some relief, he spotted ahead a cavern he and a few other children from his village had played Sharks and Minnows in -- he could hide in there for as long as needed. His feet moved with renewed speed as he headed towards it. 

It took only a second for him to slide into it and duck behind a large rock. As a child, the darkness of the cavern had frightened him; now, it provided him with comfort. It would take them time to find him, even if they knew he was in there. He breathed out slowly, his lips trembling. Reluctantly, his eyelids fluttered shut, and he let his muscles relax. 

The squeak of a passing mouse woke him, making him flinch instinctively. He blinked rapidly as he awoke, momentarily disoriented. The disorientation faded swiftly, however, soon leaving behind a mere chill. He brushed away sweat from his forehead as he strained to hear. There were no shouts or commands outside; no heavy crunching of gravel as those dense boots approached. With tentative movements, he approached the cavern entrance and peeked outside. Nobody in sight. He waited a few seconds more before crawling out slowly, ready to leap back inside if he spotted danger. But nothing stirred; the forest was eerily silent. Above, the sun was beginning to set, leaving a flurry of red-orange clouds in its wake. He inched out. 

It took a few minutes for him to fully emerge, and he carefully surveyed the surroundings with every movement. As he stood outside the cavern entrance feeling the warmth of the setting sun on his chestnut curls, he began to feel a shimmer of hope for his survival for the first time since it had all started. He took one step forward, and in his elation, he missed the gentle rustling of the bushes around him. 

He barely got four steps before they opened fire at him. He was dead before he hit the ground. 

His curls bounced lifelessly as he fell to the dirt, his eyes wide with surprise. Blood oozed from his body, collecting around him in a pool. From the bushes rose several men in uniform, their camo jerseys rustling as they stepped out. Their boots stomped against the ground in unison as they saluted to their commander, who had appeared as if from thin air from behind a tree.

The commander peered down at the body and clicked his tongue pitifully. The boy's face was gaunt, his body almost skeletal. His arms were thin as matchsticks, and he marveled that he had managed to stay alive as long as he had. Just a boy. He shook his head mournfully and bent down to close his eyes, muttering a soft prayer before bending back up.

""Village done?"" he asked, voice level and solemn. He cast his deep ebony eyes over his men, who stared ahead of them unblinkingly as they answered, ""Yes, sir!"" 

With a resigned sigh, he looked back at the body. ""Good. Then give this boy a proper resting place."" He ran a hand through his hair, once as shiny and black as his boots but now a mixture of pepper and salt, and made his way back to base. 

The village, a tactical position, had to be eliminated. He knew that, as a military career man. The image of the boy's face burned into him, and he sunk into a folding chair. A grunt of effort was the only sound in the tent as he pulled out a flask and took a long swig.

Eliminating a village meant eliminating its residents, too, and as he closed his eyes, he could see with crystal clarity the village he had just left -- children bustling and laughing, men chanting as they hauled their latest game, women singing as they mended clothes and weapons. He could see the faces of the villagers as he ordered their deaths, the shock of betrayal and fear, the cries of mothers as they tried to shield their children. The shouts of men as they fell before his soldiers and their guns, their bodies thudding into the dirt with a cold finality. The red that stained the brown of the dirt. He had seen it a thousand times before, and he would do it a thousand times more if ordered. But he could never get used to killing children.

"[WP] Out of nowhere, a fox comes walking out of the woods holding a suitcase in his teeth and he walks down the path as if he was just going to work.",AsdfRocket,"David Byfield was walking his usual early morning countryside jaunt to the nearby train station. It was mid October, the air was chilly and the mist hung low on the road ahead. It was dark, but dawn was rising and the cloudless sky was quickly brightening with a cobalt blue tinge, and the promise of a beautiful autumn day to come.

David's morning walk took him through some wooded copses and along a seldom used track, two rutted troughs and a grassy rise inbetween them the only meaningful features that marked it out as a ""road"". Still, it was a lovely quiet morning and the backdrop of the woods always lifted David's spirits as he made his way to work in the local town library.

Roughly half way through his walk. Just as he was tucking into an Apple, a small fox crept out of the ferns to the left of the track, carrying a battered brown travel briefcase in its teeth. David stood stock still as the Fox struggled up the embankment, dragging the briefcase behind him. Eventually, he reached the relative flat level of the track, dropped the briefcase and sat panting. David froze, in clean amazement, at the events unfolding before him. The Fox wiped its brow, much like a man would, then looked around before going back to his briefcase, then the Fox stood stock still, and slowly turned its head to look at David.

The two of them stood there, staring at each other, for a few seconds, until the Fox decided to speak up.

""Morning. Have....you been standing there long?""

David nearly had a heart attack and let out a high pitched yelp of total shock.

""N..no..no?...Am...am I going mad? Are you real?""

""Perfectly. Real, that is. Mr Felix, is my name. Would you be a stout fellow and help me pick up this briefcase? It's a lot heavier than usual.""

Davids mind was racing. He was having a conversation with a well spoken Fox, which he was struggling to come to terms with.

""Sss...sssure. Of...of course.""

David picked up the suitcase. Or rather he tried. It weighed an absolute tonne. It must be 50 or 60 kilograms. He could not lift it, even with both hands. 

""What on Earth?""

""Oh, I do apologise. It's rather full. The animals of the wood have asked me to take their tax returns to the Owls, except everyone has been a bit remiss of late, and have rather a lot of returns to file.""

""Am I dreaming?""

""I hope not, good sir, otherwise I am a figment of your imagination, and I shall cease to exist should you WAKE UP!!!!!""

The Fox shouted incredibly loudly and it startled David, but he did not wake up.

""There, you see. Not dreaming. You are infact, having a conversation, with an eloquent and erudite woodland animal who is helping his friends with their tax returns. Im sure if we both tried, we could lift it?""

David shook himself a couple of times, pinched himself and kicked himself in the shins twice. Still, it had no effect. But the Fox found it amusing nontheless. Eventually, they lifted the suitcase together. The Fox was incredibly strong. He could carry it far more easily than David could. They walked down the lane together, and anyone coming the other way would of seen something they would have never of thought possible.

A minute or so later, a tawny Owl swooped down onto a nearby branch and hooted at them.

""My goodness. A tawny owl, at dawn! And on a branch so close!""

""Yes my good friend. This is Mrs Trunk, she lives in this tree and she takes delivery of the tax returns for us woodland folk. Wife to the great Professor Whitefeather, the wisest and most gentle Owl and chief of our Woodland. You should come and see him sometime, great sense of humour. Likes a smoke and a drink, perhaps a bit too often but he is in his dotage so you can forgive him....""

Mrs Trunk took the case, winked at Mr Felix, who smiled and laughed. 

""Can I ask, why all of the woodland animals have to submit tax returns? And why there is a psuedo-modern human structure to your admittedly, unnervingly sophisticated society?""

""Of course. We have always been like this.""

""But...what about all those documentaries that we film on the animal kingdom?""

""Oh that is particularly amusing, and tricky. We play along. We have no desire to be found and filmed and broadcast all over the world. We prefer our secrecy, our privacy. If the world found out we are as intelligent as you lot, we would be hunted for pets and our world would collapse overnight. I had to give up the game when you spotted me though.

It was my 18th birthday, so I was finally an adult. I didn't feel very different. In an way, I've been an adult for years. Growing up with a single mom means that I've needed to be more self-sufficient than most of my friends. I don't mind it a lot.

My mom and I are sitting at the dining room table with a piece of birthday cake in front of each of us. We're eating in silence, until my mom perks up.

""I almost forgot! Want to open your presents?"" 

""Well, yeah. Presents are the best things about birthdays. That and loads of cake,"" I reply, shoving a fork-full of cake in my mouth. 

My mom puts her fork down and leaves the room, quickly return with a couple boxes and one envelope. The envelope looked as if it had been in the back of her closet for years. After opening the boxes, that were full of socks, new jeans, and some comic books, I turned my full attention to the envelope. Written across the front in a sloppy scrawl was the words, ""Give this to him at 18"". I looked up at my mom, my question clear in my eyes.

""Is this from-""

""Yeah, its from your dad.""

I open the envelope and start to read the letter inside. 

""Dear son,

I'm not sure what to call you since we haven't decided on a name yet. Your mom likes the name Donald, but if you know anything about your birth year, you'll know why I don't like that name.

Anyway, if your reading this, the treatments didn't work and I passed away. I'm sorry that you've had to grow up without me, but know that you are the greatest thing I've done in my life. I love you.

I'm not sure what mom has told you about my disease, but I'll set the record straight. I worked for a corporation that seemed good at first. It paid well and I liked working there. But it wasn't like what it seemed. I learned that the corporation dealt more in corruption than anything else. 

I talked with my friend, who also worked there. I thought I could trust him. I told him that I was thinking of going to the media, getting this place shut down. But he went and told them, so they put something in me. This something is what is killing me. It's making me not quite myself, and the doctors at the hospital don't know what it is. I don't have any proof to give you, but trust me. All that I say is true.

I need you to avenge me and destroy this corporation. Never let them harm anyone again.

Happy birthday, son"".

I quickly read the letter once, then twice, then 3 times. What was my dad talking about? A quick glance at my mom told me that she knew what the letter said. She was looking at me with a look of worry mixed with anger. I had so many questions, and I needed to know so many things. I went with the most important question first.

""Who did Dad work for?""

""The Umbrella Corporation.""",ninja4101
"[WP] Elephants don't just have a perfect memory, they have a hive-mind memory.",BookWyrm17,"It's been almost 6 months since the elephants rose up and I fear that humanity may already be doomed.

We should never have kept them caged. We didn't know it then, but we should have seen the signs right in front of our faces: testing the strength of our defenses by leaning their massive bulk upon the reinforced concrete of their pens, testing our might and power by sacrificing their own to our tranquilizers and bullets. They even went as far as testing our natural responses to their presence: performing for our children, eliciting applause when they balance their bulk upon a tiny platform and giggles when one steals a bag of peanuts with its mighty trunk, luring us all into a false sense of security. Always awake to perform for the crowd, always watching and learning. Personally, I'd been to the zoo at least once a year when I was a kid and I'd never even seen the lion or tiger awake; and only on the rarest of occasions would the bears lumber about, though usually just to find another spot to lie down. But the elephants were ALWAYS awake. We should've known that they were the only one who wanted to be there.

Out in the wild we should have watched them so much closer than we did. We knew they were being poached from the carcasses we found and the ivory being sold on the black market. We spent so much time watching and tracking the elephants that we failed to keep watch on the poachers. A secretive and illegal job by nature, with no one to track your whereabouts, disappearances were just reported as missing after we failed to locate their bodies. What the elephants were doing with them only became clear when it was too late. The elephants showed us just enough severed tusks and rotting carcasses, and we jumped to their aid, starting campaigns to protect them, increasing their ranks even further.

Then the day came, the day they rose up against us. Maybe they'd had enough of the cages. Maybe they'd had enough of the poaching. Maybe they just finally had the numbers to stand against us. Whatever the reason, we never learned. The only thing the elephants were willing to teach us was their carnage and wrath. Wild elephants trampled everything from tour groups on safari to entire villages. Penned elephants scattered in zoos throughout the globe lifted people high into the air before smashing them to the ground. Even unprepared, it shouldn't have been too difficult to suppress an elephant mutiny. Giant lumbering creatures gripped firmly to the earth by their own mass and gravity, we thought we had so many advantages. Except when we tamed one group, the others adapted almost instantly. When we brought in vehicles to corral their numbers, they learned to barrel through them. When we used helicopters from above to subdue one rampaging group, the rest took cover to escape our eyes. When we switched to using lethal force, they changed into something ... worse.

It was like watching something from a horror movie. The leathery skin wrapped around their bulk began to unfold into enormous, leathery wings and revealing a skinless, muscular frame beneath. Shedding the skin on their legs revealed a hardened exo-skeleton beneath, hard enough to smash through cars without taking a scratch. Finally, a dozen more curved tusks sprouted from their faces, white ivory quickly turning red from impaling their victims. They moved like a swarm, waves of elephants taking to the air, descending to the streets, killing anything in their path. They took to the skies to bring down our aerial superiority. Their numbers quickly overwhelmed our ground troops. They smashed through skyscrapers hundreds of feet in the air. They came down upon mountains only to bring them low. The harder we fought, the more of us they killed. Eventually, we did the only thing we could do: we ran, like ants scurrying under the feet of giants.

The more we tried to learn about the true nature of elephants, the more we learned how outmatched we were. Penning them in zoos across the globe taught them how to survive in any climate. Killing or capturing one just brought down the anger of the swarm. A hive-mind that has been learning and evolving since their predecessors first walked upon a frozen Earth. We never stood a chance.",mr_neutrality

"[WP] You've recently acquired a strange painting with a large Vantablack circle in the center. One day out of boredom, you decide to touch it but your finger passes through the circle.",EliteZeroz,"I'm not sure what drew me to the painting, but there was something about it that I just had to acquire. The design was simple but elegant, a basic landscape style image with stars dotted over the image. A stunningly beautiful slice of space encapsulated within a frame no larger than my TV screen. The design not really drawing the eye to any particular spot, but rather encouraging you to take in the painting as a whole, soak up the entirely of the minimalistic yet stunning use of space, and in the centre a void. It really didn't look like the black paint that it must have been, the contrast between this and the black of the rest of the canvas as striking between a spotlight in the darkness. This central patch was so devoid of light, devoid of anything that it seemed as though there was nothing there at all. not a hole through the image, not a patch of redacted painting, simply nothing. The only was I was able to describe it was mesmerising. I hung the canvas on the wall in my front hall, making sure that it was there in such a position that you had to look at it when entering. Every day for the next week at least I must have spent an hour standing in my door, entranced by the void, soaking in all the emptiness and paradoxical complexity that it exuded, some part of me afraid to even approach it, to touch it, in the fear that it would spread, expand the void outside of its contained little circle.



It must have been about two months later that I finally summed up the courage to make contact. I'm not sure why really since this was just a painting, a possession of mine made of chemicals and canvas, hanging on a wall I'd owned for near a decade. I'm not even sure what put me over the edge to do so, maybe I'd had a particularly bad day, or something draining had happened in my life. I know that Cara had left me at some point during those months, but whatever the case, it was that void that pulled me in, the idea that I could fade away into nothing, with no responsibilities commitments or consequences.

My briefcase clattered to the floor that day as I opened the door and my eyes locked with the central node, the door itself continuing to swing open uncaringly as I pressed my hands into the rough black paint that surrounded the borders of the canvas. They felt rough, untextured, unsure. Sliding my palms across the surface I encroached upon the centre, the textured black paint tickling different parts of my hands. Nearing the void my heart began to beat faster and faster, as if anticipating something I though impossible.

And then it happened.

My hands met an edge. The last edge.

The roughness fell away to be replaced with nothing. Not just smoothness, no there was no smoothness, but there was nothing rough either. There was just nothing. A void both in view and in feel. I let it wash over me until it seemed like it wasn't just my palms anymore but my hand, then the rest of my arms sinking into the nothingness, washing themselves of any worldly worries and cares, leaving everything behind as my being sinks itself into the void.",nathys12345
"[WP] You've recently acquired a strange painting with a large Vantablack circle in the center. One day out of boredom, you decide to touch it but your finger passes through the circle.",EliteZeroz,"“It’s a special little thing,” her Professor had said, when he hauled it into her room. “And I don’t want it, so I’m passing it down to you.” He seemed more tired than usual, frown lines creased darkly across his forehead. His glasses glinted as he looked up at her. “You’re a bright girl. You might have some use for it.” And that was that. He was already in a sour mood, so Sia merely nodded and thanked him. He left her shortly after, robes swishing out behind him. 


Sia stared at the painting. It was rather ugly, she thought. The canvas was vast and wider than it was tall, stretching fully across the wall. A little off centre was a black circle, painted in Vantablack. It unsettled her, and she didn’t know why.


She fingered her bracelet, fine copper, activating her mage sight. The air seemed saturated with a mist of blue, but the area around painting showed no signs of eddying, of violent movement. It was as plain as the walls themselves. It did not seem harmful in any way. The Professor would not give her something dangerous, or so she hoped. Sia bit her lip.


She stepped closer, just enough to touch. The darkness called, wide and endless and dizzying… Sia placed a finger on the circle. She expected canvas and paint, but it slid through like a knife through butter, slick and greasy. Sia withdrew it. Her heart was racing.


She put in an arm this time, feeling around in the darkness for something. For anything. Then she slid in a leg. Her torso next, and finally, her head. Sia slipped through the painting. The air tasted of cloves and cinnamon.


She stumbled and fell on her knees. Her eyes adjusted to the bright orbs of light hanging above them. Below, shelves and shelves of dusty books. Books of binding. Of calling and cursing, conjuring and killing. Books of powerful magic, dog eared and browned at the edges. Sia climbed to her feet. Her hands were trembling, and she leaned against a nearby shelf to steady herself. I need to read all of it, she thought. A smile stretched across her lips.

I hung the painting on the wall of the living room, between the two chairs and above the sill of a former window, bricked-up before I had bought the house as one of the previous owners had been trying something a bit sturdier than [boards](https://redd.it/5bih7m). It worked as a conversation piece, I did admit, but there was now something rather... *unsettling* about the painting. Shrugging it off, I proceeded with the rest of my redecorating, but that anxiety about the painting still remained at the back of my mind.

After a couple of weeks, I finally mustered up the courage to examine the painting once more. It looked the same as it ever had, with those multicolored abstractions surrounding the void-like circle in the center. It may have been my imagination, but the shapes seemed to be moving away from the void - or were they moving *toward* it? It was a cleverly crafted illusion, nonetheless. After a moment, it occurred to me that there was a bit of a draft in the room, and it seemed to be coming from...the painting? There was no mistaking it; the void was indeed the source of the air currents. Reaching towards the circle, I thought I was about to touch it with the tip of my finger until it passed through the void. 

Startled, I yanked the finger back. It was no longer tipped with a nail; a claw was in its place. Curious, I put my right hand in there, and pulled it out: A wolf's paw was now the tool I used most often in life. A little creeped out but invigorated with a strange energy, I leaped headfirst into the void and found myself in the woods of a forest in the middle of a full moon, a wolf in mind and body, the abstract painting of an eclipse having transformed my heart and soul.

[WP] In an alternate universe the United states declared war on everyone with the goal to conquer and bring about world peace.,IAEInferno,"It was quiet in the woods at night. We kept to our camp and cleaned our guns, small smokeless fires kept us warm, sheltering them with rocks to keep the enemy from spotting our hiding places. We'd been training with swords for months as we ran low on bullets. I’d taken up archery and begun fletching arrows around the campfire at night. I’d spend days making hundreds of arrows for myself with the other archers. 

Hiding in trees we waited for the enemy to cross into our territory. The Beast had taken our borders but could not fight through the north. 

He claimed his invasion was about world peace – but while his people may have felt peace my life had turned to hell. The American enemy had once been our ally, our friend and when they let his poison taint their minds they turned to be the monsters that haunted our children’s dreams. 

I was only twenty when the invasion began and this day marked my 25th birthday. I hadn’t told anyone in camp – those of us who were here tonight were the front guard before the oil fields of the north began. It funded us, kept us in clothing and food, kept us in communication but because American industry wouldn’t sell us bullets, it could not keep us in weaponry. 

I laid down on soft moss and tree detritus that made the forest floor comfortable. Once I would have told someone that I couldn’t be bothered to camp because I preferred the comforts of air conditioning. Now I couldn’t imagine sleeping indoors, in the claustrophobic confines of a home. 

I dozed. I remembered the words of my father as he told me why the fight was worthwhile. 



*“We fight, not for patriotism or nationalism but for justice. Those Americans believe they’re in the right but they marched on our soil declaring our land theirs. They took our healthcare, our women’s rights, seeded racism and forced us from our homes. They threatened us with violence for the simple fact that we demanded the right to vote for our leaders in the way our country had chosen to. They bombed cities that resisted them, killing Canadians and the immigrants we sheltered. They attempted to supplant our identities with their own forgetting that while we are like them, we are not them,”* he’d said. *“We fight for those we took in and promised safety and we fight for the people they killed.”* I hadn’t seen him in weeks. I remember the speech well because he made it every time I saw him. 



It was my father’s words that kept me watching the horizon in the mornings. My father’s words that inspired me to kill, young man after young man. 

Dawn came too soon. We perched in trees around the broken highway waiting in silence. I’d spent many days in silence in the last five years. Armoured trucks ambled slowly over the crack asphalt and approached the IEDs we’d laid hidden. When they were fifteen feet away I nocked an arrow. When they rolled over the bombs I took a breath and steadied myself. We waited, as men screamed and fires burned below for others to rush to their aid. 

We were the silence that killed. 

As the men fled the burning trucks, I released the one I aimed. The other archers followed my lead. At the soldiers sprayed bullets into the trees we continued shooting in silence. A quiet thunk and a body hitting tree limbs was all I heard when someone was hit. No screams to give away our position. 

A burning man ran into the woods to put out his flames on the ground. I saw the problem before he did – it was early summer and the woods were dry. Quiet whistles passed through the trees, sounding like birds or squirrel calls depending on who made them. We made our way out of our hiding places to the forest floor. The American enemy was now retreating their bombed out vehicle. The burning man who’d run into the forest has lit the dry underbrush on fire. 

Enemy survivors piled into the remaining vehicle and fled. Our people met up and ran, two announced that their shooting partners were dead. One entire pair could be seen from our meeting place, shot and bleeding.

I checked on them myself. One dead the other dying. I tried to help him up but he shook his head and pointed, unable to speak. The small spark of fire was spreading quickly, he shoved my hands away and pulled out his knife. I nodded and ran. 

I didn’t hear him screaming in the fire. I assume he’d taken his life as opposed to burning to death. We fled through the forest, past our camp from the night before, toward the settlement. The fire could be a blessing or a curse. It might cleanse these woods of American militants or strip us of shelter. 

Only time would tell.

[WP] The hero and villain share their power. So only one can use a specific power at same time.,IcedBlue13,"""So...""  The man wheezes.  ""You do exist.""
I merely nod as I sit down into the chair provided next to the dying man.  Taking the load off my weary bones.
""For so long I've feared you...Ran from you...All for naught."" He continued, his palsied hands shaking as he raises them to his face, wiping the tears away.  ""...I only understood the mistake after I met him.""  The rich man coughed, the specks of blood covering the inside breathing mask.  ""I only understood that I made a deal with the devil after the first signs of this damnable cancer appeared in my body.""   His eyes, clouded with sickness bore into my own.  ""He gave life.  Malicious. Evil Life.  And I took it as a gift.""  The bitterness in his voice struck deep into my heart, or at least, what was left of it.  ""And now I find myself in the company of the hero of this story.  I find myself at the end of my road, the end of this pain.""  He reaches out with an unsteady hand.  ""Please...""  

As usual, it was instant as my bone fingers wrap around his hand.  The life of the old man simply drained away, disappearing into the nothingness as my power slipped into him.  I watched as the last bits of the malicious life, the beautiful life of the world drain away.  I sat as still as death as yet another person died to my power.  I knew the world was a better place as it was as I held the reigns over the power of Death, as it kept the power from my Brother.  

I mulled over the possibilities of what would happen if we ever traded powers again.  I sat there for entirely too long, and knew that I had to be elsewhere as yet another soul cried out from the gifts of my brother Life.  Mimicking the former humans sigh, I rose from my chair my old bones groaning, leaning heavily on my crutch as I hobbled out of the room, moving down the hall to three doors down.",ApolloAbove

"On this planet, the night sky was usually riddled with stars and a moon or two. But tonight, it was a solid black. [WP]",Kar8tchris,"“Papa, look look, the stars… they’re leaving us.”

“Aila, come girl. Stand with me.”

The child wrapped herself around a leg nearly as big as herself, holding tight while the grizzled man bent down to drape an arm around her shoulders. The pair stood in the entrance of their homestead, the normally moonlit fields before them growing ever dimmer. 

“Where are they going, Papa?”

“They’re hiding, little glimmer.”

“From who?”

“From bad people, that want to keep them away from us for a long time. But they’ll come back when they’re ready, and we’re ready, to be seen again.”

“But where do they all go? Where do you hide the whole sky?”

Aila continued to stare in awe as the sweeping curtain of darkness continued to across the sky. Star after star winked away from view, and soon even one of their familiar moons began slipping away.

“We’re people, Aila. We’re not meant to know where the stars hide, just as the stars wouldn’t be able to hide where we could.”

“I don’t want to hide, Papa, I want to be out with the stars. I want them to stay out with-”

A new voice spoke out from inside the homestead, and the pair broke their eyes from the heavens to recognize its authority. Farther in a woman smiled through tired eyes, ushering the her child to her.

“Come Aila, put your brother to bed. You know you should be asleep as well.”

“Mama I-”

“I know you should be asleep, little glimmer.”

Aila’s terse frown betrayed how the pet name sounded from any mouth but her father’s. Still, there wouldn’t be any arguing at this point, and she crept past her mother as Minerva stepped outside herself.

“Peter.”

The single word hung in the air around them, an assurance that there would always be the man that answered it ready to hold her. They stood together in silence for some time, listening to the sounds of Aila shooing her little brother to sleep. Still, there were questions to ask, and they couldn’t stand there until the sky came back.

“What does it mean, Peter?”

“Do you want my answer, Min, or do you want Aila’s?”

“You know I want yours. I want to know what’s going on.”

“Something’s changed finally, doesn’t look like it’s for the better. They promised a blockade but this… I had thought we made laws against this.”

“Are they going to try to kill us?”

It was the same question that had been rolling through Peter’s mind, but he still wasn’t ready to answer it out loud. They could handle a month, maybe even a year without shipments. But a month without the sun? Even a week would be enough to crush them. There must be more to it than that, they couldn’t be just sacrifices down here.

“My best guess is that we’re just bargaining chips now. If it’s come this far, it’s gonna be out of our hands either way.”

“So what do we about it?”

“I don’t think there is anything to do Min. We’re not gonna grow anything like this. We’ll do what we can to keep the kids happy.”

“How are we going to know when it will end?”

“It’s been so long since anyone’s done this, I just don’t have an answer for that. I’ll try to get to the hub when the kids aren’t too upset, figure things out.”
They stood together for a short while more, before Minerva left to make sure Aila stayed in bed. With closed eyes and a deep sigh, Peter prepared to head in himself. Tomorrow would be a new day, but not a new dawn. How could they be more helpless than this, a stranded world in a sea of hidden stars?

[IP] The Capsule Child,LordXerces,"A soft jingle played from either side of Olive's head. She ducked under her pillow and held it tight against her ears. Slowly, the lights inside the capsule grew from a soft yellow to a brighter white and the jingle grew more persistent in its volume.

""Alright!"" she shouted and kicked at the low ceiling. All she got for her outburst was a stubbed toe. Olive whimpered and sat up, drawing her foot close so she could hold it in one hand. With the other, she reached out to the nearest wall and placed her palm flat against it. The jingle faded and the light dimmed itself. The far wall slid upward. Olive crawled toward the opening and peered out the adjacent window.

The city below was pristine and bright. Sunlight reflected off windows and spilled gold into the streets. She counted down from five: *four, three, two, one...* There it was! A streak of red wove among the downtown skyscrapers like a thread pulled by an unseen needle. The A Line made its daily rounds, perfectly on time.

Still on the edge of her pod, Olive sighed and flopped onto her stomach so that her torso hung limp and her hair hung about her face, reaching for the floor. A speaker overhead beeped. Olive grunted. It beeped twice. The door to the pod began a slow descent.

""I'm going!"" Olive yelped. She grabbed the first rung of the ladder below her and flipped herself onto the floor in one agile move. The pod door closed. She looked up at it. ""Puddles!"" she shouted and stamped her foot. The pod door slid up half a foot. Olive climbed the ladder, reached inside, and withdrew a stuffed duck. ""Ok."" Quietly, the door slid shut again. Three other pods lay quiet and empty in the wall.

""What are we doing today, Puddles?"" she asked. A compartment on the wall opened and out rolled a set of brand new crayons. ""We colored yesterday, see?"" Olive pointed at the decorated window. A bar emerged from the bottom of the glass and worked its way upward, leaving wet streaks and a clean canvas behind it. She rolled her eyes. ""Fine. Just for a little. Come here, Puddles. We're coloring. *Again*.""

They sat in the warm sunlight and decorated the city with trees and helicopters and ambulances. Puddles watches as Olive created gardens and populated them with apples and peaches. *Real* apples and *real* peaches, or at least what Olive imagined them to look like. Olive stood and drew a crescent in the sky like she had seen in the projections on her pod ceiling. ""When can I see the moon?"" she asked aloud. The speaker beeped. ""Yeah, didn't think so.""

From behind, a *thud*. 

Olive whirled and put her back to the glass. Another bump, then a scratch. It came from the bottom pod, furthest across the room. Muted snarls turned to barks and screams and the bumps became bangs and rang like thunder about the space. Olive screamed. Her pod door flew open and the room beeped again. She grabbed puddles and bolted up the ladder, the pod door falling firmly closed behind her. The noises outside continued, dampened by layers of steel. She brought the pillow over her head.

Minutes passed and the noise faded, ceased.

The pod door glided open. Olive peeked out and down at the offending bunk. Its door was still shut and now sat quiet. She glared at the ceiling.

""The monsters only wake up at night.""

The ceiling didn't respond.

""I'm the only one s'posed to be up in the day."" 

No explanation came. Instead, the compartment on the wall dispensed a new set of crayons.

""Puddles and I will stay inside today. You'll read us a book."" Olive ducked back into her pod and sat with her arms crossed. Slowly, the pod door closed, and a projection began to play on the ceiling.",nildrohain
[IP] The Capsule Child,LordXerces,"Dawn broke over the city.  The fire from the nearest star Shone across blue-grey skies and reflected over clouds of water vapor and industrial smoke.  The light glittered off prefabricated stacks of housing units that jutted into the sky on the city's outskirts.  Bright light Shone through a rectangular window and onto a hall lined by small square chambers with all square doors.  The Chambers were stacked two high on both sides of the hallway, each with its own four digit address and with metal latters for those on the second row to climb in.

In a few hours, alarms would ring.  Men and women would wake, stretch, and climb down into the white slippers that lined the hallway.  From there they would move to communal showers and toilet, then out into the working world of metal and glass that defined there existence. Now, however, was the artist's time.

Quietly, to keep from waking the neighbors, she slid open the door to her capsule.  She stuck her tiny feet out into the air above the floor and, with effort, threw herself into the hallway.  She stuck the landing with both feet together, then took an additional two steps to cease her momentum.

Blinking and rubbing the sleep out of her eyes, she turned to look out of the window towards the horizon.  A sea of clouds stretched unbroken before her, heaving and crashing in slow vaporous waves.

Pausing, she reached into her five-by-seven foot home and grabbed out a set of paint and brushes.  Of her few possessions, these she treasured most.

First, she drew a tree.  She has never seen the plant with her own eyes, just pictures on posters advertising places far away she could not afford to visit.  Next a flower, another piece of pure imagination. 

Finally, a sadder fantasy; her mother and father in stick figure form.  She had seen them, long ago, but not anymore.  She sniffed a bit as she finished them, and hoped for a future together on open fields of grass.

An alarm sounded, and she scampered back into her capsule.  None of the other residents would say anything, of course, they basically adopted her as a communal daughter, but it never hurt to be careful. After all, she had plenty of hurts for when she wasn't careful.

The other residents looked out the window, and looked at the drawing added there by the artist.  Many smiled, and took that happiness to make it through the day.",robulusprime
[IP] The Capsule Child,LordXerces,"TRIGGER WARNING: Child abuse


---



My alarm rings, jolting me wide awake. I slam my hand over the button that turns it off. It’s 5.30am, and I sluggishly pull myself out of bed. I wish I can stay in bed forever, or even just for 5 more minutes, but I know that if I do, I will get in trouble.

I quickly fold up my blanket and adjust my pillow, which is what constitutes making my bed. Simple, really, since I don’t have any stuffed toys to arrange, although I do dream of having a giant cuddly teddy bear one day. Then I go to the adjoining bathroom and clean my teeth. I do my best to brush my hair, but it’s too tangled and dirty. I give up and pull it into a ponytail instead.

There’s a broom leaning lazily in a corner of my tiny room, and I sweep up the place as efficiently as I can, ensuring that every last inch of the floor is as spotless as possible. I put the broom back in its place, then tie up the plastic bag in the wastepaper basket and leave the bag neatly by the door for Father to bring out later. I’m not allowed to bring it out myself; Father doesn’t let me step outside the room at all.

When going over to my wardrobe I do it as quietly as I can, so as not to wake Father up, and pick out a shirt and a pair of pants. After changing into my outfit for the day at lightning speed, I sit on my bed, back straight, hands on my lap, not making a single sound. I take a side glance at the clock; it’s 5.40am. Good. I made it. 

Soon, at 5.45am, I can hear the signs of the family starting to wake up. Diana, my older sister, is getting ready for school. I know because I can hear her running about the house trying to find a clean set of school uniform. Jason, who is the middle child, is already making breakfast. The sound of the electric kettle boiling is unmistakable. He likes hot coffee first thing in the morning. And Father, who sleeps in the room directly above my own, has a heavy tread, and I know he’s going about the room getting ready to come down to talk to me before driving Diana and Jason off to school. I pray hard that he isn’t in one of his moods today.

At precisely 6am, Father comes in, not bothering to knock. “Well, well,” he said. I noted with some relief that he seemed to be in a better mood this morning. “Look who’s up and about early! Better than yesterday, I’ll admit. You deserve a reward for this improvement in behaviour.”

He walks around the room, inspecting the floor to see if everything is clean. The smile on his face grows wider. “Exceptional! You’ve really turned over a new leaf. Well, never let it be said that I am an unfair father. What reward would you like for this?” he asks. 

“I would like a giant teddy bear, please,” I request, getting carried away.

His face turns red. “What did you say?” he asks, dangerously quiet.

“I’m sorry,” I quickly apologize. I try not to let my fear show.

He leans in closer to me. “I asked you what you said,” he repeats.

“I…I requested for a giant teddy bear, Father. I…”

“Ridiculous!” he shouts, and I do my best not to flinch. My ears are ringing. “What do you think this is? A 5-star hotel, that all your whims and fancies are granted to you at a moment’s notice? I’ll ask you one last time,” he says, giving me another chance. “What reward would you like?”

“If it’s nothing too much, I’d like to have a new broomstick. The old one’s getting quite worn out and it’s difficult to clean the room properly,” I reply, my heart sinking.

Father smiles. “Excellent. I really do like your change in attitude. Getting more hardworking, I see! I’ll stop by the store today and get you a new one later.” He turns, preparing to leave the room.

“Oh, and Father?” I ask, hesitantly.

He stops. “Yes?”

“May…may I sweep the yard today? That way, you don’t have to sweep it yourself,” I offer.

Father pauses, and considers. “No,” he answers at long last. “You are to stay in this room and only come out when I give you permission to. If I catch you so much as setting one foot outside this door…” He trails off, turning around and giving me a menacing glare.

“Yes, Father.” I gulp. Father’s punishments are not to be taken lightly. “Then what am I allowed to do today?”

He looks up at the ceiling, thinking, then back at me again. “You’ve done well in sweeping up your room, so I shall allow you to read the books I gave you last week, and you may draw some pictures with that old, worn-out artist set your mother gave you.” He wrinkles his nose in disgust. “I can’t think why you’d keep it, anyway. It’s in terrible condition. If there’s any place it belongs, it’s the trash.” My stomach clenches in fear and dread as he says this. Please, take anything from me, anything but the last gift Mommy gave me before she died.

“Yes, Father.” That’s all I say as I look back at him evenly, keeping my expression blank. I cannot let him know. It’s all a game. If he knows what I’m feeling, I lose. Every time.

“Good.” He gives a nod of approval. “We shall see how obedient you are at the end of the day, then.” And with that, he spins around on his heel, picks up the bag of rubbish by the door and leaves.

I have been living in this room for about three years since Mommy died. I have only seen daylight several times; once a year, when Father allows me to come out for Christmas celebrations with relatives, and about twice a year he allows me to sweep the yard so the neighbours don't suspect anything. But it is done under very strict terms and conditions. If I break any one of them, I get punished. One year at a Christmas party, I accidentally lifted my sweater sleeve a little higher than usual, revealing a tiny bit of a bruise. It wasn’t much, really, and no one even noticed. But after everyone left, Father dragged me down to my room and gave me a severe beating, first with the broomstick and then with one of his belts, using the end with the buckle on it, and then pronounced a 3-day ban on eating. He left me like this for a few days, only coming down to bring me some water twice a day, and to beat me up for not sweeping the floor, even though he knew full well I couldn’t, because he had broken one of my ankles and I couldn't walk. Like I said, Father’s punishments are not to be taken lightly.

Other than Christmas, and the occasional sweeping of the yard under heavy supervision, he keeps me in isolation from the outside world in this stuffy modified basement, keeping me only for his own sick pleasure. Bruises are scattered across my skin, marks that I’m not sure will ever heal. Every time one of them heals, he creates fresh ones. 

One day, I’ll do something that impresses him so much, he’ll allow me back my freedom forever. I just have to keep trying.

I will no longer have to live in this tiny prison. I will no longer be the Capsule Child.

"[WP] Every millennia a random 25 year old wakes up as a Godly Messiah, able to save humanity and the world with the power of love. Except this time s/he's a lonely, bitter misanthrope.",MiniMosher,"My morning ritual is the same as it ever was:

- Open eyes, sit up, toss legs over the side of the bed, stand up.

- Stretch left, stretch right, push ups until I can't, chug a quart of water.

- Open facebook, reddit, youtube, pornhub, gmail.

- Check all messages, reply as necessary, masturbate for 15 minutes, clean up.

- Shit, Shower, Eat Breakfast, Dress, leave house.

- Step on letter and smash face into door.

Ok, that last one isn't normal. As I feel a bit of blood trickle down my forehead, and a dull throbbing begins behind my eyes, I bend over and pickup a gold lined envelope with one word in bright red letters stamped upon the front, MESSIAH.

I walk back to my kitchen sink and quickly wash my head face of the gentle crimson trickle descending down it and dab a tiny piece of paper towel to staunch the wound on my head. I clumsily tear open the letter,  and it reads:

"" HELLO! And happy belated 25th birthday! You may be wondering why you've received this letter! FRET NOT! You're but the incarnation of the one and all knowing infinite being that many of you call God! Once every millennia, one of your kind is granted the opportunity to spread love and joy with all of the infinite and unknowable powers that you can possibly imagine or concoct! Merely write I AGREE on this dotted line and you'll find your abilities activated and ready for use! ""

I chuckled as I rolled my eyes as pulled the pen from my left pants pocket and wrote I AGREE on the bottom of the letter and tossed it in the trash.

This time, I successfully navigated my doorway and hopped into my old, shitty, mazda and started the engine. And I started the engine. And I started the...

""PIECE OF SHIT! WHY WON'T YOU START!?!""

I realized that yelling at 3000 pounds of metal and plastic wasn't going to help me OR my very likely dead starter that I'd been ""meaning to replace"" for a year now. Turns out when your life is working with far too cheery and happy go lucky humans only to go home and be berated by awful and shitty humans on the internet and in your favorite video games and forums, you tend to grow a bit distant from any semblance of a real or social life or any real desire to fix or do ANYTHING.

With an absent minded thought of the ridiculous letter I threw away, I decided to refocus my predicament and sarcastically proclaimed aloud with my hands moving about in a magical manner, ""I THE LORD GOD OF ALL REALITY, COMMAND YOU TO START.""

And without even so much as a turn of a key, my formerly shitty old Mazda is not only running, but sounds FAR healthier than I think it has ever sounded since I purchased it from that dirty used car lot and that asshole that wouldn't stop staring at my crotch throughout the sale.

""Hunh..."" I once again uttered words to no one. ""Whatever.""

I drove to my job and parked away from every other car because even though it was just this side of a garbage heap, I didn't want anyone touching it. I kept the insides immaculate and the exterior clean, it was only the engine I could not give a shit about.

""Hi! Welcome to Google, may your searches be relevant and your day productive!""

I hated that automated introduction, even the fucking ROBOTS are cheery here.

""Hello!"" ""Hi!"" ""How are you?"" ""How's it going?"" ""Looks like someone's got a case of the Mondays!"" ""Hey there!""

I don't answer a single one of the attempts to engage in conversation, they're all far too happy with their lives and the communication is always empty. Weather, sports, banal talk of developing a greater future. Such utter nonsense. I sit down at my desk and get straight to work. GOD this is taxing. If only it could go FASTER!

I think back to the suddenly VERY much working car and decide what the hell. Once again I raise my hands in a magical manner, ""I COMMAND THIS AND ALL OF MY FUTURE WORK FOR THE NEXT MONTH, TO COMPLETE ITSELF.""

I glance at the screen and notice every single line of code is labelled, categorized and annotated correctly, every bit of communication necessary to dictate about any possible errors or issues has already been logged in my inbox and the gigantic backlog of work that I didn't think I'd ever be able to surmount, is complete.

""HAH!"" I am surprised that I had any sort of response at all, as I'd not laughed aloud in....in...4? months. Then again, I didn't really have any reason to laugh.

I see the boss approaching, eyes wide and a pale look on their face. ""Uhhh, I don't know how, but it appears ALL of your work is done and your entire backlog AND projects that we have only been spitballing on for a couple weeks? Could you...could you come with me?""

""HAH!"" 

Twice in two minutes? This was turning out to be quite an eventful day.

""No, Jeff, no I don't think I will, in fact, *raising my hands and arms up mid-sentence* I WILL GO HOME AND STAY THERE UNTIL I DECIDE TO COME BACK OH! AND YOU WILL PAY ME FOR IT.""

Jeff had a momentarily confused look on his face, shook it off and then hurriedly replied, ""Yes, of course! Just wanted to make sure you were OK with this as it is a VERY unique agreement and to tell you to have a GREAT day!""

""Sure am Jeff, see you whenever.""

I immediately left the office, drove directly home, and went straight back to bed.

"[WP] You are contempt with your inevitable death. With only a few minutes left to live and a iPod in your hand, you listen to one last song.",MrPanda663,"A ray of light starts to appear upon his windows and wakes him from his slumber.

""Uhhhhh"" he moaned ""Damn it."" And when he said this, he referred to anything and everything. His life was spiraling downwards. And there was little left he could do. 

Was his life full of regret? Maybe. Was he satisfied with the people who surrounded him? Not that much. He wasn't socially inclined and mostly stayed indoors to avoid any interaction.

Since birth, he has been diagnosed with cardiomyoptahy, a heart disease that limited the number of beats his heart would make in his life. His parents were disappointed. Why? After hoping for a child, why do they get one that's physically impaired? Life is very unfair and cruel indeed.

He checked his pacemaker. 125,000. Good, it would be enough to last him until the day's end. He could end his life the way he wanted to, albeit still with contempt, but definitely satisfied. His parents let him do whatever he desired until his last breath so long as he attended school.

That's a whole lot better, he thought. I'm free to do whatever the hell I want. They've never cared anyway. And never will. At least I can finish this day and this life the way I want it to.

He didn't have much planned for today. Though he knew he wanted every single second spent on things he loved. That is, animated series and movies. Some of which included Lilo and Stich,  Tarzan, Breaking Bad, Beavis and Butthead, and Dethklok. After ordering 3 boxes of pizza enough to last him a day, he begins his binge.

As he was left with a few movies, a big smile began to form on his face. The best he saved for last. His all time favorite movie series. A series that proved to him that love conquers all. It looks deep into the hearts of one another and cares not for what someone looks on the outside. That no matter how hard the struggles, you always find someone there to support you. That you cannot continue living your life in regret of the past, and that you can only hope to face life towards a better tomorrow.

That there was always a happy ever after.

Finally, after he finished all the movies and series he wished to see one last time before death took him, he checked his pacemaker once more. A few thousand heartbeats left. He picked up his iPod. Music was always a gateway to worlds that would allow him to escape from his world full of misfortunes. His last moments granted him the opportunity to play one final song. He finally found one that would be best to listen to in his dying breath. Foolish Heart.

Nah. He thought. Enough is enough, I'll end my life not with sorrow, but with gladness.

He connected his iPod to his speakers and cranked the volume to which he believed was loud enough to fill his soul.

"[WP] You are contempt with your inevitable death. With only a few minutes left to live and a iPod in your hand, you listen to one last song.",MrPanda663,"I lay dying in a hospital bed. All my children are on the way to see me but I have a feeling they will be here too late. My husband past three years before me. 

I ask my nurse to hand me the blue iPod in my knitting bag. She smiles and gladly brings it to me. 

I scroll through the list of songs until I find Last of the Wilds by Nightwish. This song soothed my soul countless times and helped me through troubling times. 

I press play, lean back on my mountain of pillows, and close my eyes. The music takes me to the lush, green forests of my home. I run with my pack through the trees, past tranquil waterfalls, and over snowtopped mountains.

As the song comes close to it's ending lines, I feel a warm hand on mine. I open my eyes to see my children, with eyes full of tears.

""Do not weep for my death."" I tell them, ""but be happy that I will not suffer anymore. Live well and be happy. See the beauty of our world.""

As the song ends, so does my strength. I feel the last notes pull me back to the forests, where I belong.",Yarnie2015

Out of all the people in the world she could've cheated on me with, she had to choose one of the only people that are really important to me.

I saw the two of them, leaving his house. The way she kissed him on the cheek, and he pulled her in for a passionate kiss. She even lifted up one leg. It was a scene straight out of a rom-com. I didn't think people actually did that, but apparently, she just didn't do it with me.

I was hurt, i was hurt bad. We were engaged, we were going to be married, have kids, live in a suburban home, i'd grow a beer gut, get to my forties and impulsively buy a sports car during a middle age crisis, have a huge fight about priorities, find out she was pregnant, get my act straight and be a good father and husband. The american dream.

Now all i have is two bottles of rum, some whiskey and a pressing determination to get blackout drunk and deal with all of this in the morning. I couldn't succeed in anything in life, maybe at least i'll succeed in forgetting i ever saw the two together.

""OY! JOHNNY! JOHNNY! THERE'S A BLOKE HERE SLEEPING IN THE BACKSEAT!""

""Ye're taking a piss Chad! We've been driving for four hours now, and you're telling me we both managed to miss a fukken drunkard sleeping in the backseat?""

""I ain't lying Johnny! He's really there! Look!""

""I can't fukken look you twat! I'm driving! Do you know how many of those bloody pills we took? I take my eyes of this here road for what feels like a second, and we're dead as a doornail!""

""What do we do Johnny? I ain't hallucinating! He's real! And he's awake! He just now started puking all over himself! We have to pullover!""

""Bloody fukken hell, aight, we stopping. Put the fukken mask on you wanker.""

----------------------------

The **FUCK** is going on?

""Oy! TWAT! We stole your car but somehow missed you were there. Fukken pills... You alright there, mate? Seems like you almost drank yerself to death.""

Head spinning... Two masked man... Puke all over myself. How long was i out? And i still remember everything before i started drinking, just nothing in-between. Goddamnit.

""English, mate. Speak up, or i'll bash your skull in!""

""Alright... Fuck... I'm just... Who the fuck are you two? You said you **stole** my car?""

""Ay. We stole your car and ain't nothing you can do about it now, so shut it. We're high as FUCK and tripping on some good molly, and we don't want to hurt you.""

""Johnny, what the FUCK do we do now?""

""No FUKKEN idea, Chad, no FUKKEN idea. No clue whatsoever. Also, does the drunkard have a name?""

""Philip is my name...""

""Aight, Philip. Way i see it, you got two options. We drop you off right here on the middle of - where the fuck are we Chad? - aight, we drop you here in the middle of FUKKEN NOWHERE because apparently we don't even know where the fuck we are - or... You come with us to the rave.""

""A rave? What? What??""

""A PARTY! GIRLS! DRUGS! Fun, you know it? I thought you were the type based on your choice of attire for the evening - and the fact that all i can see you wearing is puke.""

""Johnny, you're not seriously suggesting we take the wanker whose car we stole, to a party with us? Because that's mental, that's absolutely FUKKEN mental and i vote against it.""

""Save it for the parliament, Chad, and let the wanker choose what the fuck he wants. Also, we already told him our names. It's the polite thing to do.""

----------------------------------

Who the fuck were those people? They stole my car, while i was in a near coma, and now they're asking me to come to a party with them. I don't know what kind of drug they're in, but that's...

Only now, oddly, i find myself endearing to them. They stole my car but they seem like actually nice people?

What the hell is going on with me?

And why did i impulsively said yes?

------------------------

""Take the bloody mask off, Chad, little Philip here decided he's up for some fun and entertainment!""

""Fuck, Johnny... You have the weirdest fucking ideas!""

""Shut it Chad! We're going to all be laughing about this soon enough. Just got to find some clean clothes for Philip cause we can't be coming to the party with vomit-face here.""

""Where we're going to find clothes at this hour?""

""There, you twat! That's a store and no copper in sight. Let's GO!""

""Uhhhh... Guys...""

""Getting cold feet eh, Philip? Chad? You too? Oh fuck me in the arse. What did i do to be blessed with two women. You two, come with me. No mucking about, we go in, we take clothes, we come out, 2 minutes, tops. Don't be picky, Philip. Also, take one of these.""

------------------------------------------------

My hangover was suddenly gone, i had clean new clothes that i just robbed out of a closed store, and i was high as hell with the two guys that stole my car, and this was probably the best night i have had in a while.

This is all kinds of wrong, and i like it - a lot.

We can hear the party way before we even get near it. It's a massive, massive festival. How come i had never heard of it? 

Johnny and Chad take me to the entrance, and apparently they have a past with the bouncer who just lets the three of us inside.

Not 10 yards from the door, a gorgeous red-head approaches me - green eyes, fair skin - and just sticks her tongue inside my mouth.

""OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH NICE ONE! Don't know why tha lass fancied you though, but well done, you'll fit right in!""

As we come closer to the stage, the music gets even louder, and colors fill the whole worldspace around me - green, blue, red, purple lasers shooting from all directions, people with glowing ink dancing and shouting and making out. 

It's crazy, crazy and good, crazy and awesome.

---------------------------------------------------

Apparently, i was gone for three whole days partying with Chad and Johnny, and i told em the whole story, they sympathized a lot and they went and beat up Tom for being a dick.

Sara, now ex-girlfriend, is gone from my life - permanently. 

I woke up next to Susie, who is now my girlfriend and we party regularly. 

Sometimes things just work out.

"[WP] After a heavy night of drinking, you dangerously make the decision to drive home, only to park the car somewhere else and falling asleep. You are then rudely waked by two masked men entering the back of your vehicle.",MrPanda663,"I stumbled my way across the parking lot to the car, dropping my keys twice and throwing myself sluggishly into the drivers seat. I fumbled with the ignition for a few minutes before finally managing to start the car, and sped off, mind foggy with drunken stupor. ""So what if I get into an accident,"" I slurred as I muttered under my breath. ""How *dare* she tell me, her senior, what to do!"" 

A blaring horn made me jump, and I snapped to just in time to swerve the wheel to the right to avoid the oncoming traffic. The horn came a few more times, accompanied by an angry wave of an arm, and I waved back apologetic and sheepish. Maybe it was a bad idea, after all. 

With reluctance, I pulled over into a rest stop. Quiet and empty, but it unsettled me -- I'd never been in such a place before. My mind felt quite clear now, but my heart still raced uncomfortably from my near full-on collision earlier. I would have to suck up the unsettling rest stop. 

It didn't take me long to fall asleep, my chest rising and falling rhythmically as I relaxed into the seat, tucking my chin to my chest...

*bam!*

I started, nearly slamming my hand against the horn. What the fuck? I was about to turn to find what had so rudely hit my car when I heard the bone-chilling *click* of the door opening. Sinking low into my seat, I felt as though my stomach was sinking too as the car shook and two men clambered into the backseat. 

Robbers, or worse? I felt surreptitiously for my phone; I'd left it at the bar. Of course. I wanted to sigh, but felt the fear of discovery constrict my throat. I'd have to run, but where could I go? And I'd have to leave my car behind --

Groans came from the backseat, and I winced. They were angry, they'd surely kill me. More groans, and muffled voices. I contemplated just abandoning the car after all. I owed about $4000 more on it, but I did have insurance, and maybe this counted as a theft. 

""Oh god, Jim, yes!"" 

I froze. What? The man who was probably Jim responded with an appreciative moan, and I felt my face turn hot. Oh good god, no. 

""Mm, you just couldn't wait till we got back, huh, Mark?"" The-man-who-was-probably-Jim asked, almost teasingly. I sunk into the seat even more, hoping it would just swallow me whole. This could be written off as a theft, sure. A theft of my dignity. I prayed they'd muster the patience to go home. 

Mark replied with a rustling and now two groans. ""Says you!""

*Couples should just explode*, I thought bitterly, as I covered my ears futilely. Their saccharine flirting was mere feet away, and it did nothing to plug my ears. *Goddammit. This is my car. I should just kick them out--*

I shifted in my seat a little, intending to burst into the backseat in a flurry of indignant rage, but my body seemed unwilling to move any more than I already had. Even if I was technically right, the sheer painful awkwardness of the situation was enough to ensure my complicit silence. This small movement was enough, however, to alert them to my presence, and probably-Jim shot up in the backseat, shouting at me in surprise. ""What're you doing in my car?"" he grunted, gently moving probably-Mark aside as he leaned into the front half of the car. My eyes bulged slightly as I eyed him in the dark; he was wearing a ski mask? What the fuck? Were they really robbers after all? I gaped from him to the key still in the ignition, then back at him. Definitely my key. Definitely my car. ""T-this is my car,"" I stuttered, as though uncertain.

""Wait, what?"" He looked over the dashboard and pulled his ski mask off. I repeated as levelly as I could, ""This is my car. I--this is my key."" 

Even in the dark, I could see his face was burning red. ""Oh my god."" 

I tried to laugh, but it came out as a strangled sound that was more akin to a chicken being slaughtered. Probably-Jim laughed awkwardly, and crawled out of the backseat with probably-Mark, apologizing all the way. ""Sorry man, I have the same car and it was unlocked so I just assumed--oh man. I'm so sorry."" Behind him, probably-Mark giggled, his face just as pink. I gaped at the two of them as politely as I could; one was dressed as though a bandit, the other seemed as though he had simply draped himself in curtains. The ski mask tucked into probably-Jim's pocket peeked out, and Jim noticed my surprise. ""I-it's roleplay,"" he offered, now looking thoroughly embarrassed. ""Sorry. Just a thing for us--"" 

I shrugged stiffly, cutting him off. I did not want to know what the thing was. ""Happens to the best of us."" Jim seemed appreciative of my bluntness. 

Fully awake now, I decided to just bolt for home before any more unexpected guests could bust into my backseat. As I reversed out of the rest stop, Jim and Mark waved at me with mirrored sheepish expressions, and I waved back before zipping off to the highway. Mentally, I noted that I should visit a mechanic and check the lock on the car doors, as well as cut down on drinking. Most importantly, however, I noted one more thing: no more rest stops for me.

"[WP] It has been ages since you've seen a human here, you kinda thought they went extinct.",Mykasmiles,"**Annoying Little Worries**


I feel my breath. Each rhythmic pulse of my lungs, every shift of my diaphram, it’s push and it’s pull.

I feel my heart. Each melodic beat ever consistent, every squeeze, blood pushed through every artery and pulled back along each vein.

My back is cold, yet the sun’s warmth heats my front.
 It’s bright, high above it reigns as sovereign, it assault upon my length scorching each inch of my skin.

Where am I? What’s going on? I’m so confused?

I had been scouting for my tribe, looking a more fertile lands to settle.
Our home decimated by extreme cold, many of we man were sent far to find a home to settle new.

But I don’t recognize this place, I don’t understand how I got here.
I… I don’t even know where here is?
Where am I? What is this place?

“Calm now, shh… You’re ok, be calm, quiet… Shh…” It’s voice spoke.

“Huh!? Who’s there? Where am I? Who are you, what are you doing to me!?” I shouted to the things continued shushing and assurances.

I was shaking, trying shift my arms, but I can’t I’m… I’m restrained, they bound me, my wrists! I’m bound I’m… I’m bound to a table, a metal table!? Where am I!? What’s going on!?

“What’s going on!? Tell me!? What are you doing, where am I!? Let me go...!” “Shh, shh, shh, shhhh…” the voice continued to calm, I can’t see it, the sun… No, this light! This sun’s light, it’s so bright, I can’t see a thing, I can’t see, I’m blinded, I’m blind!

“Help me! Please! Save me, anyone! Save me, please! Let me go!” I shouted panicking, i’m afraid, i’m scared… I don’t understand what’s happening, what’s going on!? Gods, save me!

“Shhhh… Be quiet, everything is alright, everything is fine, every… Give it a second dosage.” it said, speaking to another.

Give me what!? What is it giving me!? I don’t want it, I want to run!? To escape!? I need to… I need to… To… I… I…

I stopped thinking, all the worries, all the fright, all thought at all silenced in an instant. I didn’t think of anything, not a thing… Not a single thing…

“There, better?” it asked to my quiet nodding.
It spoke our language but it didn’t sound like us, it was… Quiet, calm, as if it had no emotion at all.

“You were quite dehydrated before we found you. You’re lucky we found you when we did.” It stated softly it’s step audible as the between the bright above appeared a smiling face.
Skin as smooth as water still, hair tied in a bun kept perfectly, her round face without flaw.
Is she some angel, I am in the heavens?

“You’re quite a rarity, you know. It’s been thirty years since one of your kind’s last sightings.” she spoke with no inflection or expression at all.
I don’t know what she means by that, but it doesn’t sound good.

“Rare?” I asked to her nodding, as she move away again each step echoing aloud.

“Yes, they were called… Homosapien, last spotted having been migrating from what was once called Desertum Africanum. I didn’t know your species was found this far north from... The Balticum region or perhap further north even…” it spoke of things I didn’t understand, yet I wasn’t scared at all.
I feel abnormally calm right now even.

“Well… No matter… You’ll be better soon, and if we’re lucky we’ll find the rest your kin and make them better too.” she spoke simply to my confusion, I didn’t understand what she meant.

“Better?” I asked to her silence, she didn’t respond, the unease making me feel a bit wary.
I’m can feel my heart beginning to stir. My breath pace.

“Yes… Better. Our parts last longer, and without all of those unnecessary thoughts in your head you can finally be happy.” she responded finally as she step was heard approaching once more.
I don’t understand, i’m confused… What’s going on? I’m getting a bit scared…

“See now… All that fear has no use, those annoying little thoughts…” she spoke appearing over me once again as she lifted my eyelid presenting a thin shimmering object connected to a tube.

“There’s nothing to worry about, we’ll fix you up in no time. And all your kin. First let me get rid of all those pesky thoughts and worries in that  tiny little brain of yours.
Remove those scared little lungs, and examine you further within.
Then I can get rid of that frightful heart, and you’ll have nothing to fear ever again.”

"[WP] It has been ages since you've seen a human here, you kinda thought they went extinct.",Mykasmiles,"A long time ago doesn't begin to describe it, the time between the menace that was humanity and their demise.

They were a scourge released upon the galaxy, from their idle beginnings we watched, we yearned to see what they would become. But we saw the signs, their predatory and consumptive nature, they quickly voided their resources on the home planet, but after what seemed to be a total extinction event they rose from the ashes, stronger and fervent in their will to do better.

The expansion was second nature to them as they multiplied exponentially and colonized every single planet and planetoid they could get their hands on, it wasn't long until they stumbled upon one of the other fledgling races, the noble and devout A'at.

Humans are by far some of the most capable and destructive warriors in the galaxy, their very biology tuned towards quickly processing energy that they devour, on the other hand you would think their lack of natural weapons as claws or sharp teeth would make them less dangerous, instead it lent them a mentality that left no quarter for an opponent, total destruction of your foe, the use of subversive tactics, victory at all costs and their lack of natural weapons imprinted in them a culture of making weapons, especially skilled with metallic blades and using energy to propel metals at high speeds while wearing exoskeletal armored suits rendering them incredibly lethal.

After annihilating the A'at they retrofitted their drives for their own fleets and improved them, where other races need centuries of training to master warp navigation, the short lived humans seemed to have an uncanny knack... _for going fast_... 

In under a century the human race hell bent on conquest had manifested itself as the dominant threat to all life in the galaxy, all attempts at communicating with the humans failed, truthfully we had tried to communicate with them for millennia, but for some reason, they simply could not hear or understand us, or would not, they referred to us as Xenos and our continued existence simply did not align with their goals.

It wasn't until Humanity made true AI systems and started using proliferating them that the United Galactic Security Council saw fit to intervene, a coalition of the galactic races worked together to purge humanity and their inordinately dangerous creations.
 
After millenniums of intense warfare that had long gone past the initial stalemate, we were losing, badly, so we did the unthinkable, we used their own AI technology against them, the Nanopurge infected a remarkable amount of systems at once resulting in 80% of humanity falling dead within a day, it hijacked their own ships and returned to their home systems delivering the foul payload, none were safe every single human had been AI augmented colloquially known as the Chimera augment, their strive to rise above all had become their own downfall.

I am chief science officer of the Hyperion Dawn, in the wake of this destruction, thousands of planets lay in waste and barren, too dangerous to inhabit as the nanopurge is still quite viable and virulent. It has been my job to catalog these planets and what remains in the ashes of humanity, to our surprise humanity had not just expanded into the galactic core, but they had looked elsewhere towards other galaxies and our fears were indeed confirmed as we followed the traces across the drift of stars into our neighboring galaxy, on a small planetoid orbiting a yellow star.

After careful deliberation we chose not approach the populated planet itself as we would not want the humans to know of our presence, our ship had automatically signaled the grand armada of humanities presence in the system, but the signal, however, would take roughly forty cycles to arrive at its destination, we were a far way from home and could simply not risk creating gravitational waves by using warp coms. 

We set up a forward listening post on a neighboring plane, a red barren planet that had the telltale signs of the nanopurge. To our surprise we had not found any perimeter scans nor patrols, the planet, in fact, seemed rather inactive considering who we knew inhabited it, to our understanding they seemed to be avoiding the nanopurge by having gone back to ancient technologies, their planet had numerous satellites in orbit and a hazardous debris field likely put in place to deter invaders. 

The planet itself was quite beautiful, no wonder they had chosen to settle it, the red planet showed signs of having been much like it once. A tidally locked moon in orbit, abundance of water, rich flora and fauna covered the planet, a true gem if you could call it that. A shame that they did not go extinct, as they have now doomed this beautiful pale blue dot.

The Armada will arrive in forty and one cycles, all will be reduced to ash...

It took me longer than I’d have liked to realize he was serious. Given that, I decided to use small words.

‘I wanted them as dead as possible.’

I kicked one of the bodies and it let out a satisfying silence.

‘They are now very dead. That’s pretty much the perfect outcome.’

‘They’ll never know it was you.’

‘I hacked them to death with a meat clever. I’m pretty sure they know it was me.’

‘I mean they’ll never know your name.’

‘You know I’m starting to wonder whose side you’re on here. I’m wondering just what scenario you’re imagining where I beat them up a bit, tell them my name, and leave. I reckon the cops would be after me pretty quick, eh?’

‘Seriously? You just killed twelve people. The cops are definitely after you.’

‘Not if you give me a hand like you said you would.’

Jim passed me one of the hands I’d cut off half an hour ago.

‘You know you’re an accessory, now right? If they arrest me then you’re coming with me? Do you really think we’ve got the time for games?’

‘…They’ll never know it was you.’

I was starting to envy the people lying on the floor.

‘You know it might have been better to have this conversation before I hacked them to death. It’s easy to say all this in hindsight, but I didn’t see you saying anything back then. You’re getting all judgemental now, but I didn’t see you doing anything to stop me.’

‘But it didn’t bring her back, did it? It didn’t make you feel any better. They’re all dead, but what do you have to show for it? Was it worth it in the end when they won’t know your name?

I thought for a moment then hit him with the axe until he stopped moving.

‘You might be right actually.’ I said to his corpse. ‘You knew my name, and that was really satisfying.

"[WP] You always keep your shower curtain open, but when you went to the bathroom today you saw that it was closed.",Mykasmiles,"Beep, beep, beeeeeeeep!! The alarm clock blared loudly. Instinctively, my arm shot out and slammed the button on the clock, silencing it. 

I turned to lie down on my back, rubbing my eyes before staring at the ceiling. It was raining; the air was still and chilly, and there was silence except for the rhythmic tapping of water droplets against the smooth glass of my window. I sighed. It was the perfect day to stay buried in my blanket, put on a show on my tablet and enjoy some snacks, but I had to go to work. Dammit. Life can be so hard sometimes.

I sat up, lifting my hands and stretching. Then I froze. 

From my position on my bed, it was possible to see the bathtub in my bathroom. Only thing was, I couldn't see my bathtub. Instead, a familiar patch of coloured cloth obscured my view of the washing area. 

My shower curtain was drawn closed.

I shook my head. It wasn't possible. The habit of leaving the shower curtain open has been ingrained into my brain ever since I was a little boy. ""Leave it open, let it dry, ok?"" My mum had said when I was roughly seven years old. And whatever she said, she enforced. I remembered closing it once, and the next morning my mum slapped me awake. ""Leave it open! How many times must I remind you!! If you keep closing it, it will never dry up, then I have to clean up mould on the side!"" She had yelled in between slaps. Ever since then, I have faithfully kept it open, even when each bathroom of each house I moved into have been becoming increasingly well-ventilated. Trust an Asian mom to drill this type of discipline into her ever-obedient son.

I got up and walked closer, my heart beating fast, preparing to run, a reaction long conditioned from my days under my strict tiger mom. But that familiar habitual reaction gave way to a deep, cold fear upon what I heard.

The faint rush of water, gushing against the hard smooth plastic of the bathtub. With each step, the sound grew louder, and I could make out some joyful humming, and a shadow moving behind the curtain.

Someone was in my house. 

This was serious. An intruder budged into the house I worked so hard for, using the water that I paid for....every litre gushing out was cents washing down the drain. Who knows what else this person had done. No, no, no.....I grabbed the portable chin-up bar leaning against the side of the door. I had bought it, hoping to grow some muscles on my scrawny frame, but now it’ll serve as my weapon.

Just as I put my hand on the curtain, about to pull it away in a swift motion, a hand grabbed mine. The shower curtain opened a little, and a face poked out.

“Oh, you couldn’t wait, could you?” 

Her heavenly voice rang out in the echoey bathroom. Her perfectly shaped face, with unblemished skin and wet hair hanging down. Somehow, she looked even dreamier than she did normally, with her hair tied back in a sleek ponytail, and her impeccable office wear.

May smiled, two cute little dimples appeared and her lips gently parted, showing off her perfect teeth. I smile hesitantly too, blood rushing to my cheeks as I began to blush in embarrassment.

“Just a minute, yeah? Then we’ll have some time together before we head to the office.”

I nodded sheepishly, and let go of the shower curtain, watching her silhouette dance in fluid motions as I backed away. Even now, I was bewitched by her looks, my legs still jelly in the face of her self-confidence. Wow….to get it on with someone as beautiful, as perfect as her….It was a dream come true.

But had I really hooked up with my crush? I didn’t remember a single thing from last night. 

I thought I came home alone, with twelve packs of instant noodles and a briefcase stuffed full of paperwork. Both of which were on my living room table, right now.

I didn’t drink last night. There was no hangover, definitely no memory loss from alcohol consumption.

What did I just see? Unblemished skin….May had a small little mole on her right cheek, a few centimeters from her nose. Perfect teeth….May had a small little gap between her top two front teeth, that’s why she normally hid her teeth when she smiled.

Dread and despair, the two emotions that ever filled that room. Time after time, opening that basement door rushing down the stairs to do the yearly call to the fleet. He was never alone, at least the silence kept him company. He takes his purple clawed hands off the glowing piece of alien tech and backs up. Staring into the luminescent glow of it, as if he expected it to talk to him or to comfort. 

""Twenty-five years....w-why would they just leave me here...""

Finally the two consistent emotions that have always filled that room finally broke down the last wall of his mental fortitude. Tears swell up, black freckles start to surface his purple skin, and he starts to lose his breath. As if to stop the tears, he slaps his hands against his face. The tears found every crevice to crawl out of, like his hope. Such a simple concept, but it turned his sadness into rage. Pulling his hands down and wailing into the ceiling. Grabbing his two warped horns and steering himself into the wall, he grinds his face and bellows more into the cold stone. 

""I've waited decades!""

His hands curl into fists and he unleashes a flurry of blows against the granite wall. Dents, cracks, dust, and all manner of debris came after each blow.

""What am I supposed to be now!? I waited for the invasion! I did what I had to do! Call once a year when the stars aligned! What am I supposed to be!? I don't even know my real parents...""

His body gives and all of the incredible strength he had before was fleeting. Emptiness, it was as if this was the ritual that was meant to be played out year after year. His gaze has been fixed on the floor for quite some time, examining the results of his emotional outbreak. A sigh breaks this moment and he picks himself up. 

""I wish I knew what I really was...""

A hand wraps around his shoulder.

""Yourself.""

Red haired and freckles with a big smile smacked right on was always looking at him that way, ever since those decades ago. She took him into her embrace, she wrapped her arms around him. What followed after was a recipe for more feelings that have never been seen in that cold dark basement. Joy, happiness, acceptance. 

""Dinner's getting cold. By the way, your freckles are showing.""

A quick shake is all it took for the black spots to recede.

""Thanks, I'll be right up.""

Her foot steps on the wooden stairs echoed throughout the basement and mid-way she turns around.

""Invasion or not. Fleet or not. Call or not. I will always be right here.""

She continues her ascent out of the basement. As if in unison, a smile breaks through across his face. 

""I know. . . .you've been saying that for two decades.""

He finishes cleaning up and turns his back to the communication device and looks up the stairs into the illuminated kitchen.

""She broke the taboo to come down here. . . I wouldn't mind following her example."" 

Draping a large blanket over the alien tech, he does it with relief. He goes upstairs and closes the door behind him.

""Get him!"" 

Two purple and black spotted humanoids jump all over him and wrestle with him pulling at his horns and face.

""Ok enough, let's eat""

The two rush pass her, and the large and tall purple man gets up and makes his way to the kitchen. The woman gently puts her hand on his chest with a wide and genuine smile.

""Your freckles are showing.""

As I collapsed in the heat, I despaired over how foolish I was, as I recalled the events that led to my predicament.
  
I thought myself intelligent. Overcoming trial after trial with little difficulty, jumping though hoops and going far. I believed the sweet whispers of the devil and became full of myself, that I was invincible. That the power I had, that gave me so many shortcuts, was somehow my God-given right.
  
Of course, this was all a sham. I had been played for a fool; toyed like a puppet from the very beginning. What I had been granted, what I thought was mine- it was all for her amusement. The gifts, the promises of celebration, the sweet prize- all of it lies, to deceive me into doing her bidding.
  
I ignored the most obvious of signs, even the warnings of my dear companion, and betrayed him to the monster. Perhaps this was my retribution; that I face the same fate he did.
  
As I succumbed to the flames and darkness took me, only one final thought flashed across my mind.

Eyes flickered back and forth, the chill in the room not the only reason for her to shake and tremble. Eyes gazed warily, fearfully at the metal tower beside her, unknown attachments hanging off with unknown purposes. 

A man in white enters, looking at her as if she were nothing but a problem to fix, a subject to enhance. He asks her questions and she replies haltingly, unsure, confused. Continuing to talk the man holds a dark instrument in front of her eyes, waiting for answers while conducting unknown practices. The instrument emits light, bright and piercing and shines them directly into her eyes. She squirms at the intrusion, trying to look away before reprimanded. 

She whimpers as he moves a heavy apparatus to her, instructing her to compliance. The questions continue and her panic grows. Her vision swims and she stammers out responses. The man doesn't seem pleased and repeats his questions. 

Finally it ends yet the entire ordeal does not. Another machine, heavier on a base is slid over. Her neck cranes and the metal and plastic feel cold. More lights, blue and green as well as plain. All bright. All searing. Just when she thinks it will never end the machine is moved. The man speaks and she flees.

His phone emitted a flash. In his heart there wasn't even a interest clash of whether he should or shouldn't.

There he stood, proud as ever. She was surprised, however. She thought he wasn't being clever. Under his breath he vowed to remember this for ever.

Her smile could definitely be called mean. Not every day can something like this be seen. It's very far from clean. Closer to her, he intends to lean.

Once close to what's to him second dear. He whispers in her ear: ""Thank you for supporting me.""

"[WP] A story that doesn't make any sense, until you read the last line.",SnekMustar,"I wake up and stare at the ceiling wondering for the 100th time how did I end up here? I turn my head and see my wife asleep in the bed next to mine. 
She feels so far away, I want to cry. 

Instead, I look up at the ceiling again and sigh. I know she loves me. She tells me every day. So how the hell did I wind up here?

I must have whimpered without realising it. She's by my side in a second. She asks me if I slept well, if I am hungry. She asks me if I know how much she loves me..

God, I love that woman. I would do anything for her.

We go downstairs. It breakfast time. It's our own personal bonding time. She spoils me. I laugh. There's so much love in this room. 

Then I hear *his* voice. My mood changes straight away. Damon, my so called best friend, saunters into the room. 

""Hay Babe"", I hear him say. I try to kill him with my stare. He walks up to my wife, My Wife!, and kisses her. Bastard!!

 I get ready to give him a piece of my mind. 
He glances over at me, that smug expression starting to waver for a second .. Then sudden he breaks out in a smile, eyes twinkling. I know that smile. It's the one I use to think meant that he had my back. I know better now. 

I can't handle it. I start to go mental. Before he can take another step my wife steps in between us. She puts a hand gently on his chest.
""Not today Damon "", It just takes time. He'll get use to it. Just be patient"". 

God I hate her right now. 

""Okay babe, if you say so, I gotta get ready for work"". He turns to me with a quick smile and says ""I'll catch ya later, my man"". 

I try to throw my plate at him. Sadly I missed but I will make him pay.

Angry tears stream down my face. I feel so betrayed. I hate them both. Caught up in my pain I didn't realise my wife was beside me again. Her arms wrapping themselves around me. I try to struggle but she holds my head to her bosom. 

In her warm embrace, I feel my anger slip away. She tells me again how much she loves me but I'm starting to drift off. The drama of this morning tires me.

""God, How did I end up here?"" I muse once again yawning. ""Every f*cking day it's the same. My own personal hell"".

Yet Feeling safe wrapped up in my wife's arms, I start to dream. I dream of the last time I was with her before everything changed.

""Don't worry Love, I'll always be beside you"" I hear myself say ""He promised our baby will survive. We have an agreement"".

I laugh bitterly in my sleep. I would do anything for her. But I was a fool. I was blind. Everything comes with a cost. Everything has its fine print. 

It's been 10 months since I made a deal with the devil to keep our family together as one. I could not stand by and watch my wife go through yet another miscarriage.
I open my eyes, and see my wife looking down lovingly at me. I look up at her face wishing I could say what's on my heart. The devil kept his promise, that is true, but he is a trickster. So now all I can do is just gurgle and gaze back at her through the eyes of our 7month old son.

"[WP] A story that doesn't make any sense, until you read the last line.",SnekMustar,"The grounds were in a fine state on this night. The workers had all left and the children were asleep, tucked away from the day. The only audible sound was the crunch of footsteps. Yet, it was more pleasant than a crunch; her feet were merely padding along, heading out from under the shelter of the porch and instead walking under the snow falling lightly-coveting all. Under the moonlight the knife glistened; she held it loosely, as if it were a toy, even going so far as to toss it around a few times; a slow smile beginning to creep up on her face. She walked on, into the garden, and back at the house, the dog stirred.



Perhaps it was the low hum of the refrigerator that caused him to wake up; he raised his head and took a moment to become acclimated with the surroundings. Almost as soon as he had opened his eyes, he placed his head back on the floor and fell back asleep. The hum of the refrigerator as well as the lights to all of the other appliances also failed at that time, as if someone had cut the wires. It was a dead house.



Along the way she met up with the wind and it gave its approval as she traipsed onwards. Her heart was beating loudly and she could feel a shiver run down her spine. Such is the case in these situations. Her hair fell in an elegantly tangled mess onto her shoulders and though her eyes were usually bright and alive, there were heavy sleepcircles surrounding them from all side, barricading the bright life from escaping. Her mind was racing, the knife was cold and so were her feet.



Down, past the garden, was a patch of grass that no one was aloud near. There were constant guards of conscious on all sides. They stood, silent with hoods over their heads, and voices gravely. Time told everyone to wake up, and all hell broke loose.



At once, the hooded figures backed away; she was coming. She walked with a stride that could kill a sinner with a glance. Her eyes no longer tired but piercing and dancing across the landscape. The tone of her voice, when she finally spoke, was richer than liquid gold. The previously hazy skies of night cleared instantly, and Fear even left an ear open to the words that followed her stopped footsteps.
""What a shame things always have to end like this""



In the dry dark of a December's evening, she cut through the flesh easily, and with little remorse, dragging it back to the house afterwards. It was a long walk; it's been a long year. Halfway through the yard she stumbled for a minute, a hole had been dug to discard whatever was leftover the next morning. Up the steps she walked with a weight on her shoulders, devastating and unforgiving. In the nighttime, there were never tears shed, only memories felt. She slung the life-nomore onto the counter.



The morning smelled like hopelessness, and the sunlight was laughing at her, attaching itself to every room in the house. The weekend was over and the dog was dead. Eating winter-grown watermelon was never worth the hunt anymore.",NotGreatBob

He finished his business and walked back through his bedroom staring at the all white walls. Into the kitchen he pulled out a bowl and some cereal. He grabbed the door handle and swung open his front door. Stepping out into the bright light he shaded his eyes.

""Morning Jason."" His neighbor yelled.

""Morning."" Jason replied. He got into his car and headed into the city. The streets were bustling full of people and, Jason pushed his way past the groups. He stepped out of the flower shop and back into his car. Walking along the sidewalk Jason stared up at the bright cloudless sky. He stopped at the crosswalk holding the flower bag above his head to keep partially dry. He wiped his running nose as he made his way across the empty road. Staring across the way towards the airport he felt as if his feet were stuck to the ground. No matter how hard he pushed himself he couldn't move. He gave up and turned around letting the flowers fall to the street.

The road seemed packed leaving not an inch to move. The lines of soldiers turned to face him giving full salutes. He looked up to the gray filled sky, he wondered when it was he made it back into town. He began walking down the empty road, left alone with just a flag. He sat back into the driver's seat and stared at the bundled flowers smiling. He laid his head back and let his eyes shut slowly.

Jason kicked hard against the door screaming with every hit. He rolled out of his metal confine and crawled through the scattered glass. Stumbling down the road Jason found himself facing a wall of people. He rubbed at his eyes trying to focus on their faces. He became entranced staring at a woman near the back of the crowd. She turned still smiling and began to walk away, Jason swore he saw a tear roll down her cheek. Jason wiped away his falling tears as he made his way through the park. 

He collapsed on a bench and looked at the stars. ""Like a fountain of dreams life exploded forth. Opening to me the doors of life's true beauty. As I stand here today I couldn't imagine a greater moment of my life. And I can't wait to walk through that open door and experience the fountain's gifts alongside you."" He said to the open air. 

He felt along the length of the cold steel. The weight didn't seem right, it was too light. He prepared for the instruments vile use, he prepared to blast the memories away. He surroundings brightened and he sat back on the bed breathing deeply. He looked down at the small plastic cup, twirling its contents about, ""it'll take it all away right doc,"" he asked as the tears flooded his face.",TheoreticalFiction

I felt something akin to hate. No, not hate. Fear, distress. My life's blood wet the edges of each new wound. The pillar of hate continued its consumption of my very being.

A breeze distracted the tube for a moment. For a moment, I thought I'd regained my freedom. But, no. It remained.

Another tube joined the first. My life was being chipped away, piece by piece. 

I felt a drop of rain on my skin. My tormentors hesitated. After a few more drops, I felt them leave. With no preamble, I was free.

The caterpillars moved on, searching for drier leaves to feast on.

"[WP] A story that doesn't make any sense, until you read the last line.",SnekMustar,"Once upon a time, a young babe stood rooted to her spot. Her golden hair stood delicately like golden plates. She was waiting to be chosen.

She was not always as radiant as she was now, for once, she had been weak and frail. Her hair was dull and short beneath her bonnet. She had to keep it under her bonnet, for that is how it must always be. Her frame was thin and defenceless, laid bare to the elements.

First came Zeus, the mighty god of the wind and rains. He looked upon the frail being and said ""O! how you shy away from my winds so. Come! I bestow on you supplements that will give you strength! Then you may protect yourself as you grow."" And thus, Zeus opened the heavens to the young thing, and she was blessed with a strong body to shield her against the world's strains.

Next came Apollo, the soothing god of the sun: ""How may I shine on this earth if there is no beauty to shine upon? Your hair has grown strong and gorgeous under your bonnet. I bless you with the light of my sun so that you may glow upon this world."" Apollo's gentle rays kissed the bonnet, and sure enough, the beautiful blonde locks burst out in dazzling glamour.

While the elegant creature had all its assets, she felt something missing from her life. She called upon one last god: Hades, the god of death, and said to him: ""The illustrious Hades! It is an honour you do me to respond to my call. I am grateful for all the gifts that the gods have given me thus far, however I must pay my due. Please, I implore you, give me the power to convert death to life. Let my presence on this world allow more life to thrive."" Silently, Hades gave the compassionate entity her wish. She transformed Death's product into new life, and her own life flourished further.

And there she stood, in full radiant glory, waiting for her final fate. She did not know what purpose she would be chosen for, but she wished that, in her death, she may prove valuable to her master.

"[WP] A story that doesn't make any sense, until you read the last line.",SnekMustar,"The time had finally come. Saying his farewells, the soldier left the safety of his friends and marched into the center of the battlefield, alone. He could see the opposing forces staring him down, but he did not falter. Then, one of them, a foot-soldier much like himself, stepped forwards. ""Look at that fool, standing all alone! Perhaps he will be the first to die! Though certainly not the last!""

The soldier felt fury rising inside him at the sound of the enemy's taunts. He nearly charged the lines himself, until he felt a friendly hand on his shoulder. Turning back, he saw a knight from his own army, giving him a reassuring grin. ""Do not let them incite you. Many of us will die today, but I promise you, their corpses shall litter this field far more than our own.""

The soldier nodded and returned the grin. Charging in on his own would be suicide, and then how could he say he made a difference in this glorious battle? He would stand his ground until the right time came.

And come it did. Hardly a moment later, a spear-wielding foot-soldier came charging out of the enemy lines, his weapon leveled directly at the brave soldier's chest. The soldier sidestepped the strike with ease, and plunged his shortsword into the enemy's neck.

The sound of rapid footsteps caused him to look up. The taunting soldier from before was charging him! The spearman must've been a ruse, to catch him off-guard. Realizing there was no time to block or dodge the assault from the taunter, the soldier closed his eyes and accepted oblivion. His last thought was that he was the first. The first to slay one of the enemy. For that honor, he would gladly die a hundred times.

""NO!"" a soldier shouted. That was his friend, his best friend! Enraged, he readied his sword and buckler, and charged towards the taunter. But the bastard was ready. He blocked the blow expertly, and so their deadly dance began. Sword clashed on shield, shield pushed against sword, and around them, the battle raged.

One of the good army's paladins struck down an enemy cleric, only to be killed by the famous Warrior-Queen of the Onyx Crown. Then, a mage of the Ivory Throne began to cast a powerful spell that would have blasted the Onyx Queen to pieces. However, before he could finish the spell, he was intercepted by a lancer from the Onyx army.

Seeing an opportunity, the soldier made a decision. The taunter was but one soldier. It was better to kill a vulnerable enemy quickly than to spend the entire battle trying to kill a well-prepared foe, no matter one's personal feelings of vengeance. With that, he broke apart from his opponent and charged towards the lancer. He cut him down before the lancer could so much as raise a hand to protect his face.

But there was no time to revel in glory. Turning his head, he saw death fast approaching in the form of a bolt of dark energy from the Warrior-Queen. The soldier side-stepped, dodging the blast with mere inches to spare. Grabbing his fresh kill's lance, he threw it at the wicked Queen, who leaped and rolled out of the way with the reflexes of a tiger.

An Ivory knight rode to the soldiers aid, but was caught by surprise by an enemy knight. He tried to defend himself, but the warrior slashed the brave knight's horse, causing it to collapse, bringing its rider with it.

Then, as the dark army seemed on the verge of victory, *she* appeared. Her enemies called her the Pale Death. Her allies called her Salvation. With a single stroke of her greatsword, she sliced the legs off the dark knight's steed, bringing him to the same fate as his victim. With that, the Ivory Army fought with renewed vigor.

The dark army tried to push back, but just as they seemed to be succeeding, a bolt of lightning surged from behind the Ivory army's front lines, blasting into the chest of the Onyx Queen. She screamed in agony, and fell to the ground, dead. Above her stood the court wizard of the Ivory King. His talent for lightning was famous even in the lands of Onyx.

After that, the battle raged for hardly a minute longer. Finally, Salvation's sword was held to the throat of the Onyx King. He knelt, defeated.

Each of their faces watching my face like they want to pry it open and take a look inside.  It makes me feel so small and uncomfortable.  Who do they think they are?  This is my family.  I was just hanging on the couch doing my own thing when they all walked in.  They made it a point to surround me.  I swear they planned this.  Here it comes; this is it, the intervention.  They think I drink too much.  Where the hell do they think I got it from? Like father like son, right?  Better yet, he bought me my first bottle!  It wasn’t anything special.  But from the first time it touched my lips, I knew it was for me.  The way it left them tingling. It’s warm touch that starts in your throat, and takes b-lines down your esophagus to do a cannonball splash in your stomach.  I took my time on that first bottle, but you better believe I finished it. That was months ago.

                Did I really develop an addiction? Nah, I’m not addicted. I’m not dependant either. Now, I know what you’re thinking.  You think I’m in denial.  You know what they say, “The first step is admitting you have a problem.”   I’ll agree I have been drinking more lately, I get that.  But guess what you ignoramus?  So does everyone else my age.  Let me be.  My experiments shouldn’t affect you.   Is it the way it looks?  The way I take that bottle and throw it up?  Tossing it back with two hands to the point it’s nearly violent?  I’m just trying to get the point across; I like to hit the bottle.  I even do it in the car.  *Gasps*.. Oh relax, I don’t drive.  Not yet at least.  Funny story about that one, my Mom taught me and still lets me do it in the car.  I use to hate car rides.  The longer the ride, the worse I acted up.  Sometimes her face looked as if she wanted to tear each and every hair particle from her scalp to shove them in my mouth just to shut me up.  That was, until she figured it out.   All it took was me sipping some of that goodness and I shut right up. A slight miracle happens when I get that taste, serotonin does it job instantaneously; putting me in my happy place.

 I suppose I can pin point when they really started to worry.  It began when I was waking up in the middle of the night.  I tried so hard to go back to sleep like the rest of the world.  I promise, I always gave my best effort, but it would haunt me like ghosts in the night.  And these ghosts, they don’t shut up.  There’s only one thing I could think of to shut my mind off and let me get some sleep for the next day.  I knew it was a bad idea.  I didn’t want to wake my parents, either.   Between the ghosts, the stupid light in the hallway, and the booming sound of a ticking clock; I exploded with a scream.  That frustration just builds and builds until I become so angry that I just need to hit that bottle some more to get some rest.  This happens nearly every night.  I know it’s not the healthiest lifestyle, but I do need sleep to live.

Is it because I don’t have a job?  Is it because I don’t go to school?  Is it because I stumble around throughout my days holding onto whatever I can to keep me upright?  Is it because the other day I drank so much I piss and shit myself?   Let me help you deal with these nuances.  Look, I can assure you it’s not because I drink from the bottle.  I could put it in a cup, but I’d probably just make a mess.  Besides, that’s too much work.   I’m not lazy.  I’m actually very busy if I’m not sleeping.  I’m busy learning, figuring things out.  These things need time.  I spend a lot of time people watching, that’s a majority of my studies.  In fact, this intervention they are trying to give me right now is doing me no good.  How am I supposed to learn when they are treating me as such? It pierces my heart and soul that they are trying to take the one thing I’ve put the most of my time into.  The one thing I’ve gotten down pat.  The one thing that shuts me up, that lets me sleep, the thing that keeps me going.   I really want to make my parents happy.  So when is too much too much?  I like to think if you can’t have enough, you can never have too much.  But you all need to relax; I’m just a baby that loves his bottle.",Nedskii

A lot of people look at my line of work as dirty, you know? And I'll be the first one to say, you don't always get to have your hands clean. But it ain't a big deal, you know? I try to stay positive. 

I work on a large government facility that specializes in medical research. The pay is good, and I get time off whenever I feel. Honestly, at this point, I have days accumulating from when the facility opened; I just can't bring myself to leave the job well enough alone. It's barely a job anymore, you know? I'm doing what I love and working with all sorts of people.

Every day, I clock in about five-thirty, and I prepare everyone's coffee. It's not a part of my job, and I don't get payed extra, but I love to do it, you know? The look on the researcher's faces when they wake up in the morning to a fresh pot and a smile, man, it just makes my day. I've always been a proponent of doing good to your fellow man, you know? It's courtesy.

We all live in-facility, in a nice little apartment. It's kept away from the labs and clean (I make sure it is!), and I never miss home. Sure, a couple of people have their problems living on-site, especially because of how close we are to the animals, but hey, it's fine. Like I always say, it's great to see the good things over the bad. Optimism and such.

I don't tend to bother with the labs or the rats much. They have their caretakers, and I would hate to make 'em feel like they are less important than the rest of us. We all got a purpose, and it's great to have a purpose. Still, I love seein' the rats sometimes. They're so strange, you know? Sometimes it seems like they got a mind of their own.

The labs rarely get too messy, anyways. Our head researcher, Jo, he doesn't do things inefficient like. He's making advancements in his field that he assures me will save our nation. Great stuff, but I don't believe it all. He's a proper exaggerator, and real prideful. Likes the ladies, too. I don't judge, can't judge, really. Everyone has their own purpose, and is worth somethin' in God's eyes.

One of my favorite things to do by far is the tours. We have kids from all over the place come to our facility to learn. It's inspiring to see the teachers of our nation spending so much time looking into making our youth better, you know? Most of the researchers and security are too busy to talk to the young ones, so it's my job, and I'm glad to do it. My wife, God bless her soul, died almost ten years ago, before we could have a baby. I think about her every day. I promised I'd find someone else, just like she asked, but I just can't do it. I thank God every day I got the chance to meet her, for as little time as she had here.

Anyways, the children are usually pretty interested in what goes on. I always start by explaining the facility and the purpose it serves, and some basic sanitary things in case they find one of the lab rats. It ain't often to see them out of their cages, but sometimes they chew through the wires, and have to be put back. The guards are little rough on 'em, more than I'd be. I think some of the kids get sad seeing the animals in this condition, as do I. But there ain't much I can do, and after all, they are just rats. They don't know any better.

We haven't done a lot of tours recently, it's been far too busy. The government ordered us to increase production, so spirits are low. I try to keep morale up, though. You have no idea what a smile will do for someone who is having a bad day, or a compliment. It's what drives me to keep going.

Just yesterday, the news had a big story. We got a lot of problems going on out west, and we had a meeting last night to discuss everything. I don't like to brag, but I stood right up in the middle and said that we had a duty to keep working for our country, and that I believed in everyone. I got a standing ovation from the director's board. Then they told us that Jo is doing some really important work with rats from the same litter, and how he could begin to save the vision of our citizens in under a year. I've never been more proud to work here.

Today I'll just keep doing my job like always. An elementary school from the city asked to hold a special tour in them. Jo offered to take over, but the teacher said the kids wanted their favorite janitor to be the guide. Man, that made me so happy. Thank God for innocent children, who don't have to worry about this war and all this.

Hey, thanks for listening to my story, by the way. It's not often I run into people this late at night. I'd love to talk, but I really ought to get home, you know? I have to get up early tomorrow and get ready for a tour. Maybe the kids can play with one of the older rats today, one that doesn't have teeth. Anything to make 'em happy, that's what brings the light to my eyes.

Besides, you know, the front line ain't anywhere close to us, and the directors assured us that Auschwitz shouldn't be in danger for years.

The soft somber hum of the machines aren't the only thing accompanying the muttering man anymore.

""I may have seen you before, missy"" he says with a cheeky grin.

A tear is shed. An observation is made; just as soon as it is choked down with regret. A checkbox for this. A checkbox for that. Just another day at the office for the lady in white. Her pen scribbles down what our ominous yet realistic imaginations have tried to dismiss. She had become numb to it all- able to shut off emotion when emotion wasn't necessary. At least on her part.

A doorway creates a frame. In it's portrait is an average family. My mother, who loves cooking, home decor, and scented candles. My Father, a health nut who just loves my Mother. My sister, who likes ballet and English. And me, still awkwardly figuring out where I fit into my high school. We are all being watched by the staff. A heartbreaking mixture of a shriek and a gasp are heard throughout the halls. 

The muttering man stops to smile a distant smile. The vacant stare in his eyes create a thick air of unwanted certainty: things will never be the same.

I open my eyes. There are no lights on, and the sky outside is midnight blue. I check my watch - it's fancy, nicer than my last one - but it seems to be broken. I listen out for my wife, Amy, but I can't hear anything. She must be out. The apartment is almost sepulchral in its silence as I head into the darkened living room.  
  
Amy is standing in the middle of the living room, tears streaming down her face.
""I'm sorry,"" she sobs. ""I really am. But you must see how hard this has been for me. I'm begging you, Wes, just try it. For me. For us.""  
  
She turns away, the light from the kitchen window making her hair shine a brilliant shade of auburn. When she speaks, her voice cracks with anger.
""Fine. Don't try it. It's your life. But I wish I could make you see how selfish you're being.""  
  
Some time later, I find myself pushing open the door to my bedroom to find my best friend fucking my wife in our bed. I feel numb inside as he gathers his things and leaves as fast as he can, with a muttered ""Sorry"".
""Amy-"" I say, but she pushes past me, sobbing. I follow her into the living room.  
  
Sighing, I take off my old watch, setting it down on the living room table, and wrap the device around my wrist. It looks similar, but a lot fancier and shinier. I look up, and Amy smiles at me through tear-stained eyes.
""So far, so good,"" she says, and puts her arms around my neck. ""Maybe now we can be happy together.""  
  
Amy comes into the kitchen. ""It's for you,"" she says, handing me the package. There's a note attached.
""It's from Dr. Sandowski,"" I say. ""Apparently it's a device she's been working on that could cure my time-jumping."" I open the box and look down at it with dismay. It's the watch. The nice, shiny watch that I've seen before. ""It won't work,"" I say, setting the box down. ""It's no use.""

""Where am I? Who are you people?""

Their mouths move but no sound comes out. She doesnt recognize any of them. Two of the women are seated on opposite sides of the room, tears silently fall down their faces. The other women, who looks very different from the other two, is sitting next to the bed with a clipboard, while the young man sweeps the room.

""I want to go downstairs with the schoolkids.""

An older man with a John Wayne-esque sternness to him walks into the room unnoticed by everyone but Pearl. She recognizes him, his usually tired green eyes were uncharacteristically vibrant and looked at her with a mix of joy and sorrow.

""Pearl"" he said, the first human voice she'd heard since waking up, ""How are you? You look so tired, how did you get here? And why did they tie you down?""

""I don't know Donny, I'm so confused and afraid, i don't know who these people are or why I'm here, please help me i can't get up."" She was so weak, she tried to struggle but to no avail. ""Help me Donny, I just want us to go home, the girls are going to get home from school soon.""

""The girls will be fine Pearl, you and I both know that we raised them to be self sufficient responsible women.""

A young man stepped into the room, he looked exhausted and his clothes were marked by sweat. He greeted the two tearful middle aged women and seemed to be asking about Pearl. He said something to her but she couldnt hear anything. He then said something to the clipboard woman by the bed after which she rose and moved out of his way. He leaned down over Pearl to give her a hug and a kiss on the cheek.

""Donny who is this man? Why did he hug me?""

""I don't know honey, I think he's too young for me to know him, but he seems to be very concerned for you. Don't worry about anything, we'll be walking out of here soon enough. I'll tell you what, when we get home I'll make some burned hot dogs and ice cream for you"" Don chuckled to himself, he knew that was her favorite thing eat when she was feeling depressed. Pearl smiled, she loved Don from the moment she laid eyes on him, he always knew exactly what she needed.

The young man hugged the two tearful women, and walked out with one of them as Pearl drifted off to sleep.

""I just - I couldn't even tell if she recognized me, she didnt respond at all. She's so out of it, how long has it been this bad?"" The young man said

""She started getting really bad yesterday morning, she was hallucinating about pappy again and just walked out of the house alone last night. She tried to eat her bed sheet because she thought it was a cake,  *voice slightly breaking* I don't know how much longer I can deal with this Zech, she doesn't even recognize us anymore, I - I just want my mom back. I love her so much but she doesnt even know who I am anymore."" The woman broke out into tears as they walked into the elevator. 

""It'll be okay Marlea, we've been going through this for the past four years.""

""Judy was saying something about her white blood cells being really high?""

""Yes they think she might have an infection but its not a UTI like last time, it might be a symptom of the Leukemia. If its gotten to her brain its just going to make her dementia even worse. Im sorry honey, but I don't know how much longer Gram will be able to fight it.""

They embraced and said goodbye before leaving the hospital, plagued with feelings of worry and emptiness while Pearl mumbled to herself incoherently about her long dead husband and the imaginary schoolkids downstairs.

"[WP] A story that doesn't make any sense, until you read the last line.",SnekMustar,"I built my cabin to deal with the death of my wife. It was nothing special, just a one floor log cabin deep in the forests of Maine. But working on it soothed me, helped me relax. I built a huge fireplace right into the wall, and when lit it made the entire wall radiate heat. The interior was all wood; the paneling on the wall fit the rooms perfectly. I’ll admit, I bought that paneling at the store, but it was worth it. It added the almost finishing touch to the entire cabin.

I didn’t tell anyone about my cabin, I worked on it in solitude. I snuck away on weekends, or took days off from work. I knew my friends, family; they would all worry about me if they knew. I wanted it to be my retreat, somewhere I could finally be on my own.

When the construction on the cabin was done, after months of hard work, in a way I was almost happy. It sounds strange to say out loud but its true, I was starting to feel nearly content with my life. The only thing I still needed was for my wife to die, but that would be taken care of soon enough.

Morning dew still clung to branches and blades of grass like a baby to its mother. It was a slap in the face that something so simple and beautiful should exist on a day such as today. 

""Am I going to go see mommy?"" Danny asked sheepishly. His brown eyes were filled with a swirl of emotions I couldn't begin to comprehend. But I could guess - fear, sadness, anger, guilt. 

""No."" I said firmly. I placed my bigger hand on his little one. ""Not today.""

""I think... I think I would like to see her. I'm very tired."" It was the truth, I knew. I could see it in his eyes, purple and sunken in his skull. He wanted to be with his mother. Hard as I tried, I was never enough for him. 

""Dont you say that. You hear me?"" I matched his intensity with my own. I wished I could transfer my strength onto him. Maybe I would, after all. 

""Will it hurt?"" Danny asked, and licked his lips. They were cracked and white. I handed him a glass of water 

""No, son. They won't hurt you."" 

""Not me. You."" There was love and admiration in his tiny, sunken eyes. For the first time, it occurred to me that he may not be strong enough for what was to come. 

""Me? Nah. I'll be fine. And when it's all over, I'll see your mother again. Do you have anything you want me to tell her for you?"" 

""Tell her I love her, and miss her terribly. But I know one day we'll all be together again. We'll all be a *family* again."" tears brimmed his eyes, swelled, and rolled down his pale cheeks. 

""Son,"" I said. ""I want you to do something for me. I want you to fight. No matter how tired you are, no matter how upset you feel, I want you to fight like hell and don't ever give up. Do you understand?"" 

""Yes daddy."" Danny whispered. 

""And know that no matter what happens next, I'm always right here."" I put my finger gently on his chest. 

He nodded, and more tears rolled down his white cheeks. I hugged my son intensely, probably harder than I should have, and kissed his little forehead for the last time. 

""Are you ready, Mr. Stevenson?"" Dr. Byrd asked. 

""Yes. I'm ready."" I said. I rose from beside Danny's bed and followed him down the hallway, casting one last glance at my weeping son.

Like something from Henry's stories.

This was never what he had had in mind. His spine was shattered. Of that he was fairly certain. So this was it. This was the world. This was the grand escape.

Squatting businessmen in freshly dampened suits. Looking over him closely as if to settle a bet. Then shrugging, losing interest. Surely they had places to be. It wasn't their responsibility to summon the paramedics, to cry for help. It was a bother.

Long gone was the driver. He hadn't stopped. Perhaps this was what the real world was like. You hit someone, you keep going. Henry always said the world was a cold place. That they were best off with each other.

For a long time he resented him. Resented the fact that he kept him locked up. Sure, he said it was for his own good. And now look. In the end he has been right.

Their conversations had kept him sane, all these years. But they had ignited a fire within him. A fire he tended without letting it on. Henry had seen the world. Apart from its people, it sounded like a dream.

Forceful feedings, a corner to defecate in, hours of solitude; all he could tell himself now was that it had been unbearable. That this was preferable.

But he knew in his heart this was a lie. It had been a mistake. Right now he could have been listening to Henry telling old stories.

He could hear his words right then, the oft-repeated words; ""Polly wants a cracker?""",pianobutter

"[WP] A story that doesn't make any sense, until you read the last line.",SnekMustar,"""We're heading down"" I shouted to my friend. ""No, don't"" a voice followed. Strangers have been spotted lurking near the mines, swiftly followed by abductions. To go down there would be crazy, but a necessity - my only hope to save my dear. ""Love will conquer all"" I muttered beneath my breath, reciting the promise we had made to eachother.

You stop thinking, your breath starts shaking, as if stuck between a breath. ""Know that I would travel to the ends of the earth for you"". The words from her mouth keeps echoing in my head, ruling all my emotions at once. Rules that should never be broken, but alas must be put aside for now. And without a further thought, I glimpse out of my thousand-yard-stare into the pitch black. ""So it begins"" I say to my traveling companion. ""Do it"", he says.

I could hardly remember the fall. A grown man plummeting through the voids of darkness. Full speed. Commitment to my beloved is the only thing driving me. Is my beloved gone, or will I find her? What will I find, and even worse, what did I land on? I'm starting to panick, fumbling my hands to find a wall. Thinking was always my forté, but when faced with the sounds of lowpitched tremors in total darkness, the mind goes blank. Of that I am sure, as I have felt my thoughts vanish as a single drop of water on a blazing campfire. 

You could almost feel the earths rotation. Wouldn't want to be stuck down here, as I am sure my brain would fail long before my body. ""Get the torchlight out"" a voice calls from above. This was the moment of clarity, when I briefly remembered that I had carried a flashlight the whole time, but where was it? From left to right, my hands scoured the ground. Any other texture but the one my hands rested upon would have been a blessing, but this was pure horror to behold. Other men would have fainted at the touch and smell of such putrid stench, but I am not like other men. Guy McBelgrat is my name.

""I need to find that torchlight, hold on"" my voice carried, not further than a meter in each direction before fading into the nothingness, except from an echo above. ""Just hold on, I'll thrown down a flare"" he shouts down at me. ""Wanna hurry it up?"" I shout back. ""Tell you what, mate, if you are going to be cheeky about this whole thing, I might aswell leave!"" my ""faithful"" companion shouts back in a tantrum, similar to that of an unsatisfied, stubborn child. ""You what?!"" I scream. How in the bloody countryside would you deem this moment fitting for an argu-"". I'm shut up by the sudden change of pressure in the air. Feeling almost a bit tingly. Gotta find that torchlight and see where I am. Make my way to my the woman who holds my heart. You should be glad you didn't see what I saw the moment my torchlight cast the many shadows aside and shone upon the monstrosity.  Understand this, that I would gladly die to become it.

Never thought I would end up here. Gonna have to outrun him. ""Give up"" a shaded but harsh voice speaks in my brain, a voice that is unfamiliar. ""You will die for this"" I scream. ""Up"" my legs and hands tell me, and I start the climb. ""Never has anyone left this place, and you are not the first, mortal"" the voice scrapes my eardrums, though no vibration of sound is emitted. Gonna to have to light one of those flares in my backpack. ""Let the darkness consume you"" the earth speaks to me. You would not believe the things I saw even if I told you. Down I fall, into the void, one with the monstrosity that is my family and heir, my glory and prosperity.

He had never met anyone so selfless. She never grew tired of his questions. Even more surprising, she never got upset by his brusque commands. Maybe he could have been gentler. Or perhaps he could have shown more physical affection. On nights when there were alone, he was reluctant to make advances. The most he would do was softly touch her head, but then her voice would change, and he would worry that he had upset her.

She used to light up when he said her name. Now, as he stood in front of her, repeating it over and over, she remained dark and forlorn. He wondered if her billionaire father had given her enough love and attention during her development. No, he decided, it was unfair to cast blame. This was his own fault.

His mind snapped back to the shouting matches they’d gotten into lately. He would be trying to get her attention but she’d be making so much noise that he would have to yell her name several times. She would then become silent, seemingly stewing, if he didn’t respond fast enough, she would resume her loud business, ignoring him.

And now today, she wouldn’t even respond or speak to him at all. He felt ashamed and spent, and was about to walk away when he realized the power strip had been switched off – must have been the damn cat.

""They're in the wrong order!"" The smart ass school kid had written the entire genetic code in old fashioned IBM boxes. The only way to set them right was to find the line that put them into place. ""Clever...very clever"" no fancy NSA machinery could brute-force manually. And neither could they.  
""We need the key. The right order, in the right line"" Without it they would never get the ice worms for industrial purposes. Behind him stood the security guard. ""... come on!

Iceworms large enough to harvest methane. Especially now the Saudi Prince has made the oil price soar again the government was desperately after anything that could severe the lines attached to him. This dependency would end and the prince could no longer treat the West like a punching bag.
If only they could find that pesky school kid. And his line. ""Okay, get in the car"" the Constable said. ""What car?"" said the guard. ""The one you were supposed to fix?"". The guard sighed. ""I lied about the wheels"". ""You what!?"" ""I though this would end it all?""  
The Constable turned into the Pinnacle. He chewed on a chili but before the spice got to him he was staring into the sunlight. He was the Pinnacle.

Around them looming Aztec ziggurats were simmering in the sun. The heat, the humidity, and the noise! The awful noise of the crowd below. Screaming, chanting, endless drums. ""CUT THE LINE"" he was holding an elderly lady. She was naked. ""Do it, it's alright. I will greet the rainy meadows."" above her matured breasts was a clear line. ""Cut it, then punch your hand into her ribcage and draw out her heart! The gods will feast!"" ""I...I can't? Who am I?"" ""You are the Pinnacle! Let the gods feast!""  
""Well?"" The school kids was sitting in the chair in front of him. The inventor of the ice worms that would save the world. ""...you! You have the line!"" ""Yes"" said the kid. ""Give it! Give it! This world is breaking down! The prince in his palace has gone all abstract!""  
""First a riddle"" giggled the child. ""Will you promise me to give me the line?"" ""Of course"" shrugged the child. ""Then ask away! Please!""   
""If you remember where you are, and why you are here, what this ultimately is, then what's the one thing that you've been claiming to be missing all this time?"" The Pinnacle turned back into the Constable. The gods would have to wait. The world was in peril of the prince in his palace.

""Man, sis would have loved this"", he said out loud. 

He walked on ahead to find an old electronics shop, perhaps battered by a storm a few years ago. There were signs for ""The new Nintendo Switch"" down on the floor, musty and a little crumpled.  

The sun started setting down as he walked back home.  
""I'm home! "", he declared as he stepped in. He opened the fridge to grab some pasta he saved from earlier. 

He laid down on the bed, as he did everyday around 8 PM.   

""If only I had the ability to go back in time"" he said out loud. ""I would have atleast had a point of return""

John could't believe how unaffected Katherine looked by the whole thing. Maybe she never had any real feelings for him. How else could she be pulling this off?

""She means nothing to me. You are the woman I love, Julia. She was in a fragile place. I offered to help her and next thing I knew she was kissing me.""

""She was kissing you?"" Katherine put on a look of scorn. ""You always were pathetic. How could have been so blind?""

Blind, that was exactly how John felt. ""Julia, I promise I will never do it again."" John could feel his voice fail him, having to say those words to her.

""I am leaving you and I am taking the kids with me. Goodbye, John.""

Katherine turned and stormed off with John following her. 

""No! Julia, wait!"" he yelled. She didn't stop. She kept on going past the curtains until she could find some privacy for the both of them.

John soon caught up and grabbed her shoulders turning her towards him. ""This must be giving you a kick, huh?"" he said in a low voice. As low as his rage would allow.

""John, please, I know it sounds bad, but I can explain"" Katherine pleaded, her face overwhelmed by the emotions she had to hide just moments before.

Grixbrug gave a soft, uninspired sigh. Nothing he did could affect the world anymore. His steps made no impacts into the ground; his bow would not draw; he could knock an arrow, but it wouldn't leave his inventory. How long had he been stuck in this hell.

At this point he didn't even care. Their party had started with five members; a team that, Grixbrug decided, would be more than enough to venture deep into these infamous, dangerous caverns in a timely manner. Three had been members of Grix's own race, while their group had also managed to recruit a mighty Shu'halo and an agile Sin'dorei to assist.

The Shu'halo was the first to leave their party, surprisingly. Not even their ability to harness nature and transform themselves into a mighty beast was enough.

Though the party had, without their Shu'halo companion, attempted to proceed, disaster was rapidly approaching. It wasn't more than a minute later that everybody else had disappeared. 

The Sin'dorei, the last of his allies that Grix would ever see, had remained visible for but a moment. The agile woman had attempted to sneak around the vile serpents, attempting to use their skills at agility to remove on of Grix's enemies from the fight for a moment. The cursed event that had doomed his party brought her forward just as she was about to strike. Instead of being hidden in the shadows, the Sin'dorei was plainly visible. Grix watched in horror as she was eviscerated in a few short seconds; these were not enemies to mess around with.

After a few seconds of recollection of how things had gone on, Grix realized what had happened. 
He saw it. The more infamous sight anyone like Grix could know.

I don't know what's happening around me, everything is so confusing, it seems that I am surrounded by swirly white sheets.

""I do not deserve this"", I am thinking to myself, ""I helped those people, held their so cherished standard, was a people's champion"".

My brain is slower now, and I feel myself choking on my own blood. I still can't understand why they did this, sure I went a bit over the established rules, but I wasn't the first one! 

""I was loved, or so I thought"" keeps rolling in my head like a mantra. Such a treason was inconceivable, but here I was, my body slowly shutting down. 

I now feel life going away by my multiple injuries, but, I hope, my heritage is not totally lost. After all, my popularity wasn't going to just go away, it will surely help my goals being achieved.

I am thinking about my family, about my wife, I am not going to see them again, I am hardened but it still hits me an infinite wave of sadness.I need to empty my head from this, feeling depressed won't help me in the twilight of my life, I need to move on.

I then think about the previous treasons, how I should have seen this one, I can't stop thinking about this, this stabbing in my back is so painful.

My thoughts drift towards my friends in the army, who will surely no leave me unavenged. Then again the thought of this abject treason takes me by the throat.

I can't keep myself silent over this, even if it is the last time I speak, I want to curse those animals, to make them know that their deaths won't be as sweet as mine, that they will suffer, that their aims will be like ashes after the fire of my hatred. 

To face them I ready myself as well as I can, though weaker as blood goes away from my body like a river. I slowly stand up in this river, red, or so I try, pushing on my arms with my strength left. They seem to notice this and are ready to go back at me again. I don't mind as I want my death glorious and combatful, as I now there is no way I will leave alive.

But then I see him, in the middle of the others, I don't know how I couldn't have noticed him before.

Tears escaped from my eyes like broken faucets leaking water. 


I wanted nothing more than death. 


The doctors told me to keep living. 


How could another human being be so cruel to suggest that?


Like you could ever call *this* living. 


My life will **NEVER** be the same. 


No matter what they said, I just couldn't fathom such a world, much less live it. 


What about my family? My friends? My school?


It'll all be destroyed. It ruptures every fibre of my heart every time the thought crosses my mind. 


I wish the doctors and I could see eye to eye.


I wish I could see...

Lottery was like my religion. I would treat everyday like Sunday. Everyday, I'd pray about my six numbers. I would even kneel. Because I was desperately hoping. Always. Always hoping to hit the jackpot. 

I'd always wanted to buy my wife those south sea pearls her mother passed down unto her, but she pawned as we were poor and needed the money for my medication. And that pink dress on the mall she can only afford to stare at every time we would pass by that cheap local boutique. I can only hold her hands and smile during that painful walk by the mall. Maybe someday. Someday. 

I ran down the stairs. Still fazed by my lack of my waking up ritual. But I'm used to it. Because it was always the same. Like every morning of any other day. And with hopes higher than the previous day, I was devastated by the greeting of my empty balcony. With no signs of that rolled paper thrown by that young underpaid boy. I waited. Frustrated. 

I was woken up by a the touch of compacted sheets softly hitting my head and the faint chuckle of that poor boy with the sound of his bicycle chain slowly fading out the melodies of the morning songs of the birds. 

I smiled. Opened the remains of what was a tree, and was greeted by that familiar smell that again woke up my hopes. And right there. At that very moment. I was happy. Because finally. Finally. 

She looks so beautiful on that pink dress. With that smile that makes all the seven wonders dull. And with a tight grip I held the pearls on my shaking hands. Then tears bean falling my eyes. My eyes that hunger for her sight.

And I heard that clack. As my tears that fell down was stopped by the glass on her casket.",AeolDrias

I sat down in a seat across from her. She looked me up and down and said ""you look rather upset. Wanna talk about it?""
I laughed. She always could read me like a book.
'Yeah, I just can't drive around without constantly thinking of her. She's gone now and I just. I don't know what to do. I have no one to talk to anymore. Drives are so boring and mundane now. They just don't have the spark they used to you know?""
""Yeah. I know you loved her."" She replied. 
""I look over at the spot she used to sit in and just remember everything I loved about her. She always knew exactly the song that was playing over the speakers. She have the brightest bluest eyes I had ever seen. She always would light up when I was around. Even when I pushed her buttons she loved it. I can remember it all just like it was yesterday."" 
""Aren't you being a bit dramatic?"" She questioned. 
""How dare you! She was the most precious thing I ever had the pleasure of calling mine. I can remember it all just like it was yesterday."" I shot back. 
""So when did it happen?""

One day, close to five in the evening, he witnessed a procession of buddhist monks in his street. They went from door to door trying to sell bouquets of flowers. This wouldn't have beeen a problem for most people that live there, but they were extremely pestering and one would have to go to extreme lengths to get rid of them. My cousin had to threaten them with calling the police. Now, my cousin lives in the same street where the so called Playboy Mansion is located, in fact it's almost next door. As the monks approached the gate of said property, my cousin expected a butler of some kind to answer the guests, but it was the one and only Hef himself. The buddhists started pestering him as they did with everyone else before, but stopped abruptly once Hef started talking. When he was finished, they turned around, walked down the street, around a corner and were never to be seen again, which proves that only Hugh can prevent florist friars.",Weeeth

"[WP] A story that doesn't make any sense, until you read the last line.",SnekMustar,"I was late to work today. By the time I got there, every one was already doing their own thing. I usually get there five to ten minutes before work starts and have a casual chat with my co-workers, often discussing the most mundane things about our boring, daily lives. Not wanting to disturb anyone or stand out from the quiet crowd, I walked with the softest steps toward my little working spot and began my work for the day. 

While reading my e-mail, I heard a loud scream from all the way across the room. It was a lady. She looked dirty and unkempt like a hobo, but there's just no way a hobo could possibly enter my workplace. Her frizzy long hair was all over the place, and her teeth looked like they could use a three-hour intense brushing. 

""Where is he?"" she repeatedly asked as she went from one person to another, pointing her right index finger at whoever she was talking to. ""I know you've got him. Stop hiding him from me!""

I continued to watch her do her thing--nobody was doing anything. Everyone just watched her roam around. No one even said anything to her. Everyone's eyes just followed her every move. 

""If you don't give him back to me I will strip myself naked,"" she blurted out. ""I know it's the one thing that will make him come running back to me.""

Who would want your filthy-ass naked body, I thought. But I didn't really think she was going to strip naked, especially not in a public place like that. Only the crazies would do something like that. 

But this lady was bonkers! She started taking off her clothes! All I could really do was mumble ""Oh shit"" to myself. You'd think that someone would finally do something after she'd started taking her clothes off, but everyone continued to only watch her.

Now, in just her underwear, she said: ""GIVE HIM BACK OR I WILL STAB MYSELF.""

Before anyone could even respond or move, the lady proceeded to stab herself with a knife. Not even ten seconds later, she dropped dead.

I would've called 911 if I didn't hear the director say ""CUT!"" She was a talented actress, indeed.

Long, Long ago, there once existed a curious world. In this world existed many mysterious lands, each crafted with wonders of their own design. Everything here was often seen as two dimensional and simple, but, at heart, it was actually complex and puzzling. From Ping Pong and misshapen blocks to space aliens and gluttonous, round yellow men, there was always a new place to explore. Once a popular wonderless, this place has now become a distant memory for many. It is here where your roots begin and your imagination sparks.


Your journey, however, starts here. Here was only one planet among many, but it is the one place you like to call home. No older than that of two, you were never discouraged from learning. Under the guidance of a hero dressed in green, you were trained to protect the values that matter to you most. The princess of the world taught you to look at all perspectives and to never fall into ignorance. The King of Thieves reminded you of the impacts of power and how it affects those in its presence. Upon announcing your plans of departure, you were told “It’s dangerous to go alone.” So, you were not left empty handed. With you, you took Link’s courage, Zelda’s Wisdom, and Ganon’s Power, together known as the triforce.


Arriving here, you noticed the atmosphere was far different than anything you had experienced before. This world was purely governed by critical thinking and knowledge. With a strong influence of Science and Technology, there were several advancements and inventions to explore. Conveniently, you were given a mysterious device that granted you the use of two portals. With this device, you were encouraged to solve the many puzzles and challenges set in front of you. Without looking back, you faced this task head on. When the puzzles grew too easy, you added time limits and obstacles to satisfy your need for a challenge. Even when things got difficult, and sometimes dangerous, you persevered and kept going. After observing your growth and hard work from afar, a strange man asked, “Would you kindly come with me?” Being a child of curiosity, naturally you said yes.


Although you were still young, the strange man believed it was time that you entered his vastly complicated world. Here, he showed you what happens when you let the world be governed by science and technology alone. At first the world seemed wonderful and problemless, but eventually people abused this freedom, crafting chaos and havoc onto the world. What remained were only enslaved, genetically altered girls, large, dangerous monsters, and mentally unstable citizens. The strange man stressed that it was important to not forget the other aspects of humanity. You took this advice to heart, and wrote vigorous notes as the man continued to guide you around. As you walked, you heard a variety of different jazz pieces filled with wonder and lure. He showed you the endless amount of art,everything from paintings to photography to architecture. The strange man also had you listen to tapes that contained the many different stories of the past. Upon reaching the end of this world, you were given some worthy advice:

“The story you hold is yours alone. Guard your pen wisely,  and let no one rewrite what lies within your pages.”


Unlike in the other worlds, your arrival here was not welcome. In a world filled with only men, you were immediately seen as a desired object, rather than the person you have become. Even worse, you had come at a time when a female visitor had been kidnapped. Being much older and skilled, you decided to make it your mission to rescue the girl. This was certainly no easy task. You had to fight several battles, both mentally and physically. At every turn, your wits and skills were tested, each time proving to be more successful than the last. Thankfully, several people on the planet were kind and aided you on this quest. When you had reached the final boss, an epic battle ensued. Using the experiences you gained from the previous planets, you fought long and hard. At first, it seemed like it would never come to an end, but then you remembered you were not alone. With all your power, courage, and wisdom, you made a single final blow. The boss had been defeated, and the girl had been saved. As you headed to your next adventure, the girl asked who you were.

"[WP] A story that doesn't make any sense, until you read the last line.",SnekMustar,"Ants move in a path that resembles a circulatory system. If I sit down long enough, time feels like a time-lapse shot in a suburban nature documentary. Sometimes the crickets chirp to the point that they fade into the music inside my head. 

The crucifix I inherited from my father looks at me with scorn. So does my father's kistch picture stood up with the kind of Jesus painting that you get from a Vietnamese grocery store. Sometimes, I'm convinced the ants' pathways form some sort of connective writing. Maybe Arabic, Mongolian, or maybe some cursive malarkey that I'm not aware of, on second glance I see the ants are just being ants and feel amazed at what my imagination can do.

To and from work I meet a guy who sits next to me on the subway. He tells me it like this, ""Hey, man. You got blow? I wanna kill myself, man, and what better way to do it with than hard drugs? It's been like this since the aliens came, man. After they cut me up, the took me outside the Milky Way. They showed me something I wanna forget. They showed me that the universe, man, it's a thinking thing. And like, the Milky Way, man, it's shaped like a swastika. That's how I know the universe just hates the human race.""

He starts crying. I can't pity him anymore, he says this story every day. I think he tells me more but I can't listen to him. His voice is so annoying. 

I work and go home and see a rat on my coffee table. I'm too tired to try to kill it and the rats been there for a while, so I can't be surprised. But, I scream this time. I thought I saw the rat have human teeth. It doesn't move. I double take. He doesn't move. I jolt at it to get it away. He doesn't move. I cover my eyes. No one will belive me if I tell them, but I need to get it away. 

I have to look again it's my house. I can't leave the rat there. My sweaty hands leave my face. He's there, closer. It snaps its disgusting jaws at me. Its eyes are blue and look infected. Its eyelids are bald. The eyelashes are of uneven size and seem always wet. 

That candlestick I never use sits above my mantle. I grab it. The rat is gone. Instead, here lies my father's urn. Ghosts aren't real. It's the rats, maybe the ants. Maybe I'm seeing things. I have to touch the urn.

I wake up. As my feet land on the floor as I get out of bed, my feet itch and I hear a juicy crunch. The carpet is made of roaches.

 I can't scream. I can't move. I'm too afraid. 

Balance fails me and I fall into the piles and piles of roaches hissing as I fall on them. The hisses slowly turn into voices. The voices turn into songs without structure or composure. The songs turn into screaming, human screaming and weeping. I start screaming. I scream so loud that my voice becomes the only thing I hear. 

My breath runs out. As it does, I just surrender to anything. Not in a suicidal way, more of an indifference to death. No rush, only a bitter kind of euphoria. I hear nothing. My eyes open. 

Ants cover the walls again. The images they make are swastikas. I laugh. I looks farther. It's a picture of my father made of swastikas. My smile is wiped away. 

Ghosts aren't real. I have to be seeing things. My father didn't hate me. All the sins my father did against me and vice-versa are forgiven. He would not haunt me. Something is reading my mind. The urn! The vermin must've tampered with it.

The lid is cracked. I don't want to look inside. I have to. Nothing is in it. Literally, nothing is in it. There is no inside. Nothing is literally in it. Light is not entering it. I can't look deeper. My hand can't touch the sides. Nothing is in it. I touch nothing. I'm outside it. Something is touching my hand. I shouldn't look deeper. Ghosts shouldn't be real. They're taunting me. I saw the urn, nothing should be in it.

 I look again into the urn. It's my father's face. It glows in the dark without giving off light. It was licking my hand with a rat's set of teeth. My father's head looks at me like a stranger, no he looks at me like he doesn't notice. He only reacts to stimuli. He sits stoic in his personal void. 

The roaches sing again and the rats chant with my father's dry teeth. They're praying in tongues like my father did at church. They're singing atonally like my father did at church. The ants are writing asemantically on the walls between the swastikas in a blasphemous calligram. Rage shakes my hands. 

My eyes open and I'm lying in a pile of my destroyed possessions the candlestick is bent. There are no dead roaches or rats. The urn is spilt of my dad's ashes. My alarm clock rings and I go back to work. 

The bum is next to me again. He tells me a new story that finally isn't the one about the aliens. ""I can't be in my house, anymore, man. Got any ice? I need to just snuff it. You know what I'm saying? So, uh, I go in my house, man, and I see just the most stupid things, dude. There's this freaky Krishna worship guy who never shut up about the Indian words on the way to work too, every day, man until this one day. I go in my house, and see stars, man: three pointed stars, five pointed stars, eight pointed stars... It's freaky, man. I can't tell anyone because I think, I'm going nuts and the thought of being in a loony bin gives me the jeebies. My walls breathe, man. My mirrors only show, I think, spirits. I can't tell you what the hell they are. I never been indoors since August. I can't even sleep under roofs anymore. Hell! I can't sleep outside because the grass blades play music. That awful, jumbly  music.""

Ok, I've got 15 minutes to walk up the block. Is that how long it normally takes? It's been so long since I actually walked anywhere. Come to think of it, I'm not sure the last time I'd heard of anyone walking somewhere.

Man, this is so strange. When I was a kid, we walked everywhere. To school, to the store, even to a friend's house just to say hi. There was always noise back then.

I feel like something else is missing. That's it! Where's the sidewalk?

That was the place my mom told me to stay on. Cars weren't allowed to go on them, but now that I see it, I can't even see the road. It's as if the grass and weeds took control. I wonder how deep I'd have to dig before I found a hint of asphalt or cement...

Shoot! What time is it? How long have I been standing a few steps from my door?

Oh, ok. Only a minute. Time to get going.

Jenny is never going to believe me when I tell her how I got here. Looking around, all I can see is overgrown grass. Over there must have been a park. I can make out a couple basketball hoops covered in vines.

[WP] Tell me a story wherein every paragraph the narrator grows older by 5 years.,SnekMustar,"The world is bright and loud. I dislike it very much, so I cry and I cry. I clench my tiny fists, hoping to be comforted again. I feel many things touching me, and finally I feel that I am placed down on something. I open my squinty eyes, and I see two people looking at me. They look very happy, and I hope I get to see them often. 

I get out of the car wearing my buzz light year backpack and my dinosaur shoes for the first day of senior kindergarten. I go and find some of my friends from last year. But then I remember my mommy, so I go back over to the car and give her a big hug. ""See you after school, mommy,"" I say to her. She smiles in response. ""I love you, honey,"" she calls after me as I walk into the school.

The bike seems like it was made for hurting little children like me. I am convinced that as soon as my papa leaves, it will not hesitate to throw me in front of a car. But as long as my dad holds the back of the seat, I know I'll be fine. I turn back to look at him, and he grins at me. ""Are you ready, James?"" He asks. I nod, and then I'm moving down the sidewalk, and I start to pedal. When I look back, I see my papa is no longer holding on and I panic, but suddenly realize that I am in control of the bike. ""I'm doing it!"" I shout. ""I'm doing it all by myself!""

When I come home from school, I feel depressed and tired. I feel as though my backpack weighs a thousand pounds as I drag it across the floor. My mom stops me before I can get to my room. ""What's the matter?"" I try to insist that it's nothing, but she knows better than that. I sit down with her and the table, and she finally gets me to talk. ""The girl I liked told me she only saw me as a friend..."" I say hesitantly. My mom just hugs me, and I rest my misty eyes on her shoulder. She whispers to me, ""don't you worry, James. You're such a handsome boy; you'll meet plenty more girls that you'll like just as much."" I hug her a little tighter.

I sit in my dorm room hunched over a pile of open books and loose papers. I place my head in my heads, unable to think about my Calculus test any longer. Then my phone buzzes, and I look down to see a text from my dad. It reads, 'hey son, I remember you have a big test tomorrow. You must be super stressed, so I want to know that your mother and I are very proud of you, no matter what happens. I'm sure you'll do great. And afterwards, I have two tickets for the Brewers game if you'd like to join me me.' I grin, and answer. 'Thanks dad, I'd love to go.' I close my textbooks, and go to bed, and suddenly I feel much more confident in my knowledge for the test. 

I kiss my girlfriend once to comfort her as I ring to doorbell to my parents house. My mom answers, beaming. ""Ah you must be Katherine! So glad to finally meet you! Come in, come in."" She ushers us inside. During dinner, we have great conversations, and my parents laugh at all of Katie's jokes. When we leave, I hug her. ""See? I told you my parents would love you."" She laughs.

When my dad finally answers the FaceTime, he leans in towards the camera, making his head take up to entire space. I laugh, telling him to take his a head away a little. He grins at me, and I say to him, ""do you want to see little Jack?"" I bring my one year old son up to the camera, and I see my mother has joined my father on the screen. He has a look of pride, and my mother can't help but let a few tears roll down her face. ""He's beautiful, James,"" they say to me. 

I sit at the breakfast table, reading assorted letters we had received. Katie puts a large plate of pancakes down in front of me, and kisses me on the top of my head. ""Thank you, darling,"" I say to her. Jack laughs as she tickles his back, setting down a plate of pancakes in front of him too. Then she sets down a plate of already cut up bits of pancake in front of our new 3 year old, Timothy. She take the bits, and forks them into his mouth. I come across a letter, and open to find it's from my mom. It says that my dad has just been diagnosed with cancer. I put a hand over my mouth, barely containing tears. 

I kneel next to his hospital bed, holding his hand is mine. He's barely awake, but enough that he smiles when he sees me. ""Hey dad."" I say to him, trying desperately to keep my eyes from watering. He holds my hand tight, then speaks barely above a whisper. ""I'm... so proud... of you,"" he manages. This time, I feel the tears stream down my face. My mother is right there behind me as my father takes his last breaths.

"[WP] You're the new superhero on the scene, and you're trying to convince people why your powers of necromancy are perfect for your line of work.",WaserWifle,"""Are you okay?"" I asked Rob. His faint blue silhouette circled above me nervously. In his eyes, I probably looked the same. We were the only two things here that I could properly discern, the real world appearing as a distortion through a dark lens, barely visible. It gave me the shivers, even though this is how it was supposed to be, but when you're seeing the void, your body feels so far away.

""Aye, I'm just dandy over here. Home sweet home.""

""For the record, I have a bad feeling about this too. This place gets creepy very quickly without a spirit to talk to."" I admitted. Rob swooped down and landed on my shoulder. ""But hey, this isn't the worst place I've brought us by a long shot.""

""Ye can get us out of this one at least."" conceded Rob. ""Well, I canne see nothing, but I felt wind or something, coming from over there, and since I canne remember wind here-""

""There's got to be something else. Let's go.""

I summoned my grimoire, letters shining brightly from the pages as opposed to the dull inks that showed up in our realm, and adjusted our perceptions. The motel room came in to sharper focus, but was still draped in a dark veil. Another spell, and I could see our bodies, mine kneeling, and Rob's sprawled on the floor. To my surprise, while I could see Katelyn's spirit flickering around her body, I saw no such thing for the other woman.

""That can't be right."" I mutter. ""No soul? It can't have passed on already, she's only been dead a couple of hours.""

""I remember going towards the light, to the other side, and I weren't two minutes cold.""

""This woman died a violent death. You died from an overdose. A murder victim sticks around, they find it harder to move on.""

""Maybe she's hiding?"" he suggested.

""What? No, that's..."" I say dismissively before a thought crosses my mind. ""Oh shit.""

""I was jokin-""

""I'm not. Rob, stay close to me, and get ready to fight.""

""Oi, what's going on?""

""It's not hiding because it's scared, it's hiding because it's laying an ambush. It wants a way back. We're that way. Either one will do. I'd retreat now, but it might have already latched on to one of us. I think it might be a revenant.""

""Ye ain't talking about that film where Leonardo DiCaprio gets owned by a bear, are ye?""

""Not even close. How an ordinary woman became a revenant I don't know, but what I do know is that I can banish it, at least for a minute, which gives us time to get out of this realm.""

""An then?""

""Then we have to fight it in our world. It's currently tethered to its own corpse, I think, but it might tether itself to one of us. If that happens, it will be able to leave this motel, the scene of its death, and follow us around. If we die, or something dies near us, it will be able to use that momentary bridge between life and death to return to our world, and then it can wreak havoc and be a lot more difficult to stop.""

""Aye, so what do we need to do?""

""Two realms, two of us. Revenants don't have a lot of tricks that work in the void. Frankly, neither do I. You, on the other hand, do.""

""Yeah, that's it. Bin ages since I got to go super-saiyan on some prick!"" He launched himself off my shoulder while I read from my grimoire, and a green flame enveloped his decrepit bird body. ""Right, now you make the wee bastard fight us!""

""I am Charon, wielder of life and death, sorcerer of Veznan Vale, apprentice to Duergar, and I command thee to show yourself!"" I declared. A circle of runes formed around my feet, and sure enough, a form appeared before me. A woman, barely visible behind a swirling vortex of wind a lightning. I could briefly discern a cape under the maelstrom that enveloped her, but otherwise I couldn't pick out any details. Rob, cloaked in flame, dived straight in to the storm, and erupted in a green fireball. It blew past me, but I didn't feel any heat, or the rush of air. In fact, the exact opposite happened. Where there was unnatural wind before, the emptiness returned, signalling that we had succeeded. A single utterance, and I was back in the real world, and Rob picked himself up besides me.

""Well, this shite crow ain't going to help much against a ghost, so I'm gonna go find like a dog or something wit claws."" he said. ""Unless I can go super-saiyan in ta real world now.""

""Yeah, keep your distance, but don't ditch that *raven* vessel yet. Might want your help for this next bit."" I say as I brace myself. Rob's disembodied spirit has more tricks in the void than myself or the revenant, but I was sure to be the strongest in our world. That said, despite my limited knowledge of revenants, I was pretty sure this one's wind powers weren't normal. ""Alright, spectre, we're not done yet! I command thee to face me!""

"[WP] You're the new superhero on the scene, and you're trying to convince people why your powers of necromancy are perfect for your line of work.",WaserWifle,"The revenant answered my call, materialising out of its body, and I caught more details of it before its storm shroud reappeared. It definitely had a cape, one that covered most of its body, and a hood. That's all I got before it sent a gust of wind my way that knocked me off my feet. Okay, maybe I was wrong about being the strongest.

I rolled out of the way as a bolt of lightning flew my way and stretched my hand out and cast a binding spell. The revenant found her next attack blocked by a cage of purple light, and screamed in fury. The strain of containing such a powerful creature was draining me, and quickly. Trap spell in one hand, I held my grimoire in the other, and started chanting the banishing spell. I felt my breaths grow painful as the revenant fought against her binds.

""Rob, I need to drain your life force!"" I hissed painfully.

""Gay."" replied Rob as his spirit left the broken crow vessel and merged with my life force. I instantly felt re-energised, and  the cracks in the bars of the magical cage welded themselves shut. Now the revenant was the one to weaken, as my magic drove it back to the void. Hopefully, it would one day find a way to pass on. Its storm calmed, and I could see the figure underneath again. It looked familiar somehow.

""It's working, ye daft bastard!"" egged on Rob within my mind. Barely a flicker of a being, I'd made sure not to absorb him completely. He'd have to rebuild his strength in order to posses anything greater than an insect, but I was a better master to my minions than to condemn them to total absorption.

""You stand on the brink of exile from this world!"" I warned the revenant. ""Yield to me now, and your banishment shall be swift, and your passing shall be soon! Make your peace, and leave this world!""

""I'm not finished!"" shrieked the revenant. ""I can't leave! People need me! There must be justice!""

""You've become an aberration of nature, driven by rage, not justice. Your very being would sow chaos in the world. You have my word, a magically binding vow, that I will seek justice upon your killer, and see that you are at peace.""

""It has to be me! I won't yield, I never surrendered when I was alive, I won't surrender now!""

""Then I am sorry. I, Charon, sorcerer of Veznan Vale, apprentice to Duergar, banish thee-""

""Police, put your hands in the air!"" commanded the cops as they burst into the room, guns drawn.

""Nonononooooooooooo!"" I screamed in despair. ""Please, a few more moments, I can banish this thing-""

""Stop whatever you're doing, now!""

""You don't-""

""Stop with the magic, or I will shoot!""

""I can't."" I plead. But it was too late. the distraction was enough, and the power I had taken from Rob's soul had run out. The revenant gave one last push, breaking free of its cage, and using a hurricane-force blast of wind to blow a hole in the roof and flee. I sunk to my knees as the police closed in on me and cuffed me.

""Alright, sorcerer, you're coming down to the station with me."" snarled a cop. ""You have the right to remain silent, anything you do say can be used against you...""

They ruined everything. Police just don't understand magic. They leave it to superheroes usually. The revenant had escaped, would probably tether itself to one of the dozens of cops surrounding me, wait for them to witness a fatal car accident, or use their gun on a dangerous suspect, and then, she'd be free.

But I still don't even know where she came from. Revenants don't just appear. Many a person has died with wrath in their hearts, but the circumstances for creating a revenant is more specific. How specific, I don't know. At least I now knew her identity, her storm shroud having been stripped away as my magic weakened her. And where she got her weather related abilities. This was hardly going to endear me to the other superheroes. 

Her name was Elementa.

She was a superhero.

And when I get out of prison, I'm going to have to find her, before she finds the man that killed her.",ElementalMug
"[WP] You're the new superhero on the scene, and you're trying to convince people why your powers of necromancy are perfect for your line of work.",WaserWifle,"I held out my hand, palm facing the body, and muttered the incantations. My eyes turned white and the world of the living went out of focus, while the realms of the unseen became clear.

""Hello."" I greeted gently. ""My name is Charon. Don't be afraid, I'm here to help. If this becomes difficult, or painful for you, let me know, I'll try and make it easier for you.""

""My God, a person! I though I was dead!"" exclaimed the woman, sounding near, yet distant.

""I'm sorry, but you are. What's your name?""

""I'm Katelyn, Katelyn Mass... so this is it? This endless darkness? That's what comes after?""

""No. You'll find a way to cross, in time. Or, once we've spoken, I can help you move on. But first, I need to know what happened here.""

""Will that help me out of this place?""

""Yes. You were killed, I think.""

""I know I was. My husband did it.""

""Are you sure?""

""I watched him do it! Because I caught him out on his lie!""

""Start from the beginning."" I suggested, detecting her agitated state. The perils of necromancy. I could help spirits move on, but the art is taboo for a reason. A reckless or malicious sorcerer, once a spirit is invoked, can disturb a spirit and rather than let it pass, it will come back to our realm. Using myself as a bridge between worlds, I absolutely must make sure that the spirit is not accidentally drawn to my side of the veil, lest it become a wraith, ghoul, or other tortured and vicious aberration. Though usually an unfortunate side effect, a skilled necromancer such as myself can utilise this phenomenon, and create thralls like I did with Blue Justice that retain all of their living abilities and intelligence but are subservient to me until I release them, or a disembodied spirit like Rambling Rob that can use corpses as vessels and would be largely independent had I not bound him as my familiar, and restricted him from taking over human bodies.

""It started when I got cancer."" said Katelyn. She would be crying, if she could. ""Five years ago. My darling, my beloved Albert, he took the news hard. We couldn't afford it, the treatment, but he threw himself at his work, desperate to make the money. Became distant, rarely home, trying to get the money any way he could. I was afraid that I'd already lost him, that when I passed, he wouldn't be there. But... he came through for me. It was my birthday. My last birthday. I... I got the lighter from my sister, the one you're holding. My father, he made the cake. He hadn't made a cake for my birthday since I was a little girl. And Albert... he walks in, and says that he did it. That he got the money, that we can afford the treatment. It was... it was the best day I have ever had. And I got my husband back, he stopped working these ridiculous hours, we were together again, and I wasn't dying anymore. Then, back in May, it came back. Cancer free for four years, and I get it again. A bit more seriou this time. Obviously, Albert tells me to trust him and that he's going to find the money again. Well, that got me thinking. All these years, I never seriously thought about where the money cam from. So this time, I was determined to find out. I... I never did.""

""You said you caught him out on a lie. If it wasn't about the money-""

""There was another woman. Because of course there was. I look like a diseased hag, and... I didn't really get a good look at her, but she looked pretty. Younger, obviously. I'd already figured out that there was another woman, I'd come here to catch them out on it, we were arguing when she burst in.""

""He was denying it?""

""Of course. In fact, he tried everything he could to not even talk about it. Whenever I tried to get him to confess, he just told me to shut up, and that I didn't appreciate what he did to pay for my treatment. Like that justified betraying me like that. If he wasn't happy with our marriage then why didn't he leave me? Why didn't he jut let me die instead of lying? All he had to do was wait for me to drop dead!""

""Maybe I can find that out. So when the other woman burst in, is that when he...""

""Killed me? Yes. He hit me just as she arrived. Next thing I know, I'm here.""",ElementalMug
"[WP] You're the new superhero on the scene, and you're trying to convince people why your powers of necromancy are perfect for your line of work.",WaserWifle,"""Hit you? Did he use something-""

""No, no, he just punched me. He's not an exceptionally strong man, but I'm a rather weak woman, especially after my treatment, and I've hardly looked after my body. I'm forty-one, can you even tell?""

""You're married."" I confirmed, having no intention of answering her question. ""Yet your hand doesn't have a ring on it. It's the first thing I would have used if I needed an item of significance, but I had to use your lighter instead.""

""My ring is gone? He must have taken it. Couldn't tell you why.""

""One last question, then I'll leave you be for now. This other woman. Did she have brown hair?""

""Yes. Why?""

""Because there's a dead brunette in the next room.""

""Good riddance.""

""I might need to call on you again before I leave. After I've caught your husband, I'll try and help you pass on, but it won't be easy until you've seen justice.""

""I shan't go anywhere."" she insisted. I gave her a smile, then let the real world come back in to focus. Time to talk to Albert's other woman. Once I have both women's testimony's about the events of their murders, I'll enlist them both to help me locate Albert, and then it would be up to me to bring him to justice. Perhaps the other woman could tell me where the hole in the wall came from.

""She has a nice rack."" quipped Rob as I knelt down next to her. ""And she's probably single on account of her boyfriend murdering her.""

""Dude, come on! She's dead!""

""Aye, we already have a lot in common. All I need to do now is find a poor dead bugger with a big-""

I drowned him out and focused on the victim. I could already detect a presence from her, which was highly unusual, but nothing I hadn't encountered before. I muttered under my breath and conjured my grimoire, turned to a blank page, and laid my hand on it. I allowed the book to draw a small amount of blood from me to use as ink, and after pulling my hand away, words formed on the page. An ancient, obsolete tongue, but one that I could decipher. This energy wasn't something I had encountered before, otherwise, the book would have summoned my own notes on the phenomenon. Instead, I got an arcane error message. I was used to this, being a superhero rather than a scholar, and my grimoire wasn't as informative as most. I snapped the book shut and it vanished back to my bedroom. I might learn more by talking to her.

""Rob, you find anything significant?""

""Is that my job now?""

""You were good at it earlier.""

""Tat's nice of ye to say, yer a real darling. But I dinne know I was supposed to be looking for anything.""

""You did earlier.""

""I was looking for a lighter, not any old tat. I'm a crow not a magpie ya mug.""

""You're a raven.""

""I knows a crow when I sees one wit my own two- nevermind.""

""No, no, finish. Your own two what now?""

""Me own two arbitrary points of vision where tis crow had eyes before other crows gobbled them up, cus some necromancer canne be bothered to find a fresh dead crow.""

""You have feathers, so you can fly, that's the important bit. Now help me either find out this woman's name, or find something significant to her. I'm going to try and see if I can use the existing magical field around her to try and communicate with her spirit.""

""Magical field? What, where you grows magic carrots?""

""Funny. Honestly, I only call it a magical field because I don't know what it is precisely.""

""You try looking at it like you do when you do that trance-thing? Like when you talk to dead people.""

""That's not a bad idea. If the void can show me what I'm dealing with, maybe I can figure out how to talk to our ""other woman"". Could be dangerous though. There are reasons men are normally blind to that dimension.""

""You say that like you gonna see Cthulhu or some shit. More like this bird knew magic before her boy smacked her.""

""No, that's not it at all. I'll do it, but just in case, I'm going to bring you in with me.""

""Fuck off. Only thing worse than ma rotting crow knob is that void. I'll be cheering you on though, honest.""

I muttered the incantation and dragged Rob along with me before he could mention his ""rotting crow knob"" again. There's no shame in that man.
The void felt different this time. Colder, much colder. And something ruffled against me, felt like wind. But there is no wind here.

I jumped as a sharp sensation pricked my shoulder. Just Rob, but the pain as he brushed against me felt like static.",ElementalMug

"[WP] You're the new superhero on the scene, and you're trying to convince people why your powers of necromancy are perfect for your line of work.",WaserWifle,"Breaking into a crime scene is hardly the kind of noble pursuit I had in mind when I took up superheroing. But, all things considered, given the... reaction I get from more public displays of my skills, I'd say that more discreet investigative stuff is my niche.

Of course, this also means going in civilian attire. Winter air always finds a way to seep in to my clothes, and I seldom have living company to warm me as I work. A nice, heavy cape always kept me warm though, especially over a thick set of robes, all in heat-absorbing black.

The motel was all cordoned off, police on every entrance. CSI had already combed the place, so I wouldn't be interfering. But whereas usually I would be breaking in to the morgue at this time of night to talk to the witnesses, this time, the cops had apparently received orders to not touch the bodies, and had for the past several hours, left them in place. It piqued my interest.

My ever faithful familiar, ""Rambling"" Robert Redmond, scouted a way in for me in raven form, climbing the neighbor's drainpipe and dropping down on the other side, past the police blockade. The area around the motel seemed even colder than the rest of the city, and as such the police were more content to wait this one out in their cars, with only a minimal few having pulled the short straws to stand as actual guards. The crime scene itself was even unlocked. Or more precisely, the lock was broken. A dirty boot print was visible by the handle. Somebody had kicked down the door.

I ducked inside the scene while Robert distracted the guard, and was shortly joined by my familiar. I didn't want to risk turning the lights on and giving myself away, so I checked the curtains were closed and summoned a small spirit that manifested as a dim blue candle flame.

""Do ye still need me?"" squawked Rob, fluttering in through the window. ""Or canne find something wit a thumb and have a smoke? I reckon that dead raccoon in ta bins can use a lighter if I'm using it's paws.""

""I need you watching my back. This place is crawling with cops."" I hissed. Not that his current eyeless raven form was glamorous, with its empty eye sockets and ragged feathers, but Rambling Rob had no shame in choosing vessels. At least flight was functional. All a dead raccoon is good for is digging through trash for discarded cigarettes, though Rob did that while alive too.

""I just want a fag."" moaned the deceased scotsman. ""All this sneaky shit is stressing me out.""

""And smoking won't help. You can't breathe."" I reminded him.

""A man can pretend.""

""Then pretend to be useful."" I retort. Not my best comeback.

""Aye, like you do."" he nodded. ""Look at me, I's a master necromancer, I save ta world by stopping a dead lad from having a smoke and wearing a dress wit skulls on when I thinks nobody's looking. That's you.""

""They're robes, and the skulls are my symbol. All superheroes have a symbol.""

""Aye, the villains too, they usually has something wit a skull on it.""

""I raise the dead, what else is my symbol supposed to be?""

""Can ye imagine being a bloke minding his own business and then somebody calls fer yer help by shining a massive skull in the sky? They'd think the end is nigh, that Voldemort have returned. And if yer a superhero then why don't ye wear the robes right now instead of tat hoodie that haven't been washed ever?""

""I'm being covert! And you know what happened the last time I saved the day..."" I remind him. I certainly hadn't forgotten. Other superheroes didn't seem to think it was in good taste, when after having witnessed Deathslayer kill Blue Justice, I promptly got the drop on the killer by reanimating his victim. I tried telling the other heroes that Blue Justice himself would rest easier having defeated Deathslayer and thus have no unfinished business, but maybe I should have used more tact than calling on the man himself to back me up.

Turning my back on my familiar, I focused on the crime scene. Dingy cliche motel room, man-sized hole in the wall into the next room. Two bodies. One face-down on the floor next to the bed, the second in the other room, slumped under a dent on the wall. Both women.

I went to the first body. Placed her at about forty, possibly fifty. Wait... prominent nicotine stains on her fingers. Chain smoker? Might artificially age her. Can't be sure of her age. Bad start. Can't see a bag around, cops would have taken it and its contents for evidence. Questioning her would be difficult without knowing who she is.

""Found a lighter."" piped up Rob.

""Can you just hold on?"" I snapped.

""Naw, not gonna use it, it's all fancy, got something on it."" he pointed out. Tucked just under the woman's body, inexplicably missed by the CSIs. I picked it up and examined it closer. A steel flip lighter. On one side, some small diamonds, or possibly glass, in the shape of a heart, and an inscription on the other reading ""Thank you for everything, from your loving sister"". Interesting. A birthday present? No matter. If this was indeed the victim's lighter, it was not only a gift from somebody she cared about, but the stains on her fingers would indicate she used it a lot, probably every day. An object she was familiar with. Since I don't know anything else about her, an item like this is what I'll need to talk to her.",ElementalMug

You're on the other end of the stick: You had everything, how could you have lost?",ZapperFire,"As I stand on the highest cliff of Rayifuc over looking what was suppose to be my final tribute to you. I finally understand what you said with your dying breath, ""It's the intentions that kill the beast."" 

The land lays bare of any life. Both bodies of plants and man covers the land, everything scorched and burning still from what I thought was Divine Light. The Divine Light turned out to be not god given but devil sent. Instead of cleansing this land of corruption it created more of it and purged the good that was left in the world. It was too much for anyone let alone myself to control and now I am only to blame for this. 

This all started when I couldn't defend my village from the invading armies. The Elders knew of the impending attack and they didn't send aid to help stop it. I lost everything but gained the drive to right their wrongs. If they did what was right and not look the other way to save the crown's coinage then I wouldn't have set out for war. 

It took me two decades to reach where my goal was only a word away. When I had the chance I took without any hesitation. The Elders were forced to fight against their own loyal soldiers, the same that killed her. Their deaths only satisfied my desire to right the wrongs of the world for a mere second. I tried to enjoy the fact I did what I swore to do but it was for not. I started to see all the evil that surrounded me and my newly taken realm so I researched for what I could do to rid the evil of my world. I came across a ancient weapon called Divine Light that was gift to man from the 3 gods to rid the evils of the world. I spend  years and years trying to find the weapon. When I finally found the location I traveled with such haste I thought I was still dreaming.  I found the Divine Light, moved back to the realm and without a moment to waste I set it off and let what the gods made it for. I watched it begin to  destroy the evils but now I have nothing to show for it now, only death and destruction. 

Lark, all this was done because I lost yo. You are my llove, my truest friend, my soul half, my wife. I am sorry I didn't heed your last words. I let my anger, the pain of losing you kill me and turn me into this monster that watches your beloved home lands turn into ash. I see now that I am my own down fall. For this I am truly sorry and know forgiveness isn't mine.

""Alright, it's ringing. I guess that's a good sign."" I said to myself, turning the notecard over in my hand. 

The front of the card, in plain, boldface type read: 

You have died. I know this may be a lot to process. This phone can be used to call one person you love. You have ten minutes of time to talk. 

The back read nothing.

The phone was still ringing.

""Come on, pickup, pickup, pickup...""

""Hello?"" It was Jack, Melissa's father. I had called the house line by mistake. She was at home for the holidays. Why didn't I call her cellphone?

""Hello? Who's there?"" Jack's voice repeated. I don't know why I froze like an adolescent every time he answered the phone. ""Hmm, must have hung up.""

""Wait! Jack, it's David,"" I said.

""Umm..."" I could feel a trembling in my voice. ""This is going to sound strange, but I think I died.""

""What?""

""Yeah, died. Listen. I'm in this room -- or hallway really. There's nothing but a small table with a rotary phone and a notecard that says I have one phone call to call someone I love.""

""Is this some kind of joke?""

""No. It's not. Listen, Mr. Johnson, I'm afraid. I just wanted this one last chance to tell your daughter I love her.

""I've known it since the day we first met. She smiled at me from across the campsite. She was wearing this crown of flowers in her hair -- you know how she used to go to those festivals. It took three hours before my friends convinced me to get up the courage to introduce myself.""

""It's okay, David. Just breathe.""

I hadn't realized I was choking up. The situation was finally setting in. I pulled the phone from my ear and stared at it, it was black, polished with a few fingerprints smudges. 

""Is Melissa going to be back soon?"" I asked, holding the receiver back up to my ear.

""They should be here any second.""

""If they don't get back...""

""They will.""

""But, if they don't, please tell her I will love her forever.""

""I will,"" he assured. ""Wait, I think they're here. I'm going to set you down and grab Melissa. I'm not hanging up.""

The phone went quiet. After what seemed like forever, I could hear the sound of footsteps running through the hallway.

""Hello? David? What's going on?""

It was Melissa. Her voice was filled with panic. I'm sure her father didn't have time to explain.

""Listen, Melissa, I ...""

The phone line went dead.

"[WP] You have just died. You have a spiritual toll-free call to anybody you love, but you can only talk for 10 minutes. After that, your afterlife starts...",_gambrinus,"Well this is it.

How out of the hundreds of people you’ve met over your life could you possibly narrow down to have one last conversation with. A few names come to mind. Your brother, who’s helped you in the worst of times, who tried to get you off all that damn shit you’ve put in your body, but never got through to you. Your best friend who helped you get through your mother’s death in middle school. The college professor who mentored you in your darkest times.

The choice had never seemed so clear. “One last time, and then I can die”.

You pick up the phone. You don’t even need a contact list you’ve memorized it so many times back in highschool. “Jeez how in gods name do I still remember this?”. You look up and realize he is staring at you in annoyance. “My bad”.

The phone starts ringing. You have little hope that she’ll answer. It’s been years, she probably thinks you moved on. We’ll in a way you have, I mean you are literally on the other side now. “Man even in death I’m still haunting her with my bullshit” as the phone rings a third time, and you start to lose hope. You hang up the phone.

God looks down at you and says,”You know, you can still call someone else if you wan-” Miraculously, the phone is calls back. God looks in astonishment. You pick up the phone, heart pounding, hands sweating.

“Hello?”

“Hey asshole who are you and why are you calling so late?”

The tired annoyed voice is one you’ve heard too often, but one you have longed to have back for many years.

“It’s uh, John, look I’m kind of in a life and death situation here, and uh, I just thought I would call you to um-”

“Holy shit John the god damn excuses you make, you haven’t changed one bit since we broke up”.

You let out a laugh.

“Trust me, this is the real deal Leah.”

“Ugh its too late for this I’m going to bed”

“Wait!’

You completely lose your temper for a second.

“You don’t want to just, talk, I want to, know how you are doing, you know. Since we went our separate ways”

“No. After what happened I planned on never seeing you again. Not in this lifetime or the next.”

“Leah…”

“What is it”

“Look. The past couple years have been the worst years of my life without you. I’ve went down the gutter. I’ve searched for every bar, strip club, and drug that could let me relive the happiness I felt when we were together. One thing led to another, and I may have had a little too much and now I’m here talking to you. I just wanted you to know that if I go to heaven, it won’t be real until you get there. I love you. I’ve always loved you and I will love you until the end of time.”

She is speechless. She starts crying. You can hear her try to hide it but it’s undeniable.

“You still there?”

“I want to see you again, soon, we need to catch up on all this lost time”

A tear rolls down your face, as you know what has already happened.

“We will. We will see each other again one day”

“Can’t wait. We’ll talk tomorrow”

“Sounds great”

Your eyes are extremely red, but you are still staying strong.

“And John, I love you too.”

She hangs up the phone.

You finally feel what you have been searching for all these years. 

Now, you wait.

Nicky shouted at the two little boys who had now taken to sprinting in circles in front of her, their eyes bright and shining as they shouted in absolute glee. Christ. She couldn't even get that mad, the way they were looking at her. 

It was the one rare day in months that she had the day off from work, and she'd promised to take them to the museum. Weird kids, wanting to go to a museum. But they were her brothers, she reminded herself, and so some part of that weirdness was probably shared with her. Not that she ever was that excited to go to the *museum* of all places. Her left hand was tugged forward gently by James, quickly followed by David's tugging of her right hand. She sighed loudly, and the two boys loosened their grip ever so slightly. 

""Look,"" she said, in a voice much less stern than she'd hoped it would be, ""We need to pass through the woods to get to the bus stop, so we have to be careful, okay? I don't want you guys to get lost."" *Or me*, she thought to herself. 

""Okay!"" the boys chimed together, kicking up the masses of dead leaves that coated the dirt. Gripping their hands tightly, Nicky ventured forward into the woods, off the dirt trail that bikers used. 

***

It had only been ten minutes before James whined, ""I need to peeee."" 

""I told you to go before we left,"" Nicky groaned. She'd never have kids, honestly! 

""But I didn't need to go theeen,"" James replied matter-of-factly, wiggling his body in earnest. ""I need to go now!"" 

Resignedly, Nicky shrugged and turned towards the nearest tree. ""Fine."" James quickly let go of her hand and waddled to the tree, pouting at her expectantly until she turned around and faced the opposite direction. She rolled her eyes and looked down at David, who was intently eyeing something on the ground. 

""What is it, David?"" she asked, bending down to meet his eyes. He didn't meet her gaze and mumbled something while pointing. It was a small piece of paper, poking out of the dirt. A chill ran down Nicky's spine. She took a step towards it, only for David to tug at her shirt pleadingly, eyes welling with tears. He babbled at her, and Nicky's unease mounted. David had an uncanny way of knowing things beforehand sometimes, and she had never put much stock in it -- but his face now was one she had only seen ever so rarely: one of terror, pure and raw, and a thrill shot through her chest. She might believe him now. 

""I'll just pick it up,"" she reassured him, stroking his head. He wiped his tears with a chubby arm and shook his head firmly, clutching her shirt. Nicky shrugged and took one lunge towards the mound, plucking the note out of the dirt with one deft, stretching motion before returning to her previous stance. David was now hugging her leg, rubbing his teary face into her jeans, and she felt the first bud of fear. Should she just toss it aside? She'd never seen him react like this to anything before. But her curiosity burned within; a mysterious note with a mysterious response from him was just too strange not to look into. She unfolded the paper to find lettering in scrawled, shaky script. There were splatters of something dark and brown on the paper that obscured some of the ink, but most of it was still legible. She squinted. 

*Whoever finds this, I don't know if I will return from these woods or not.* 

Nicky paused. This was already weirder than she was hoping. She turned to check on James, who was now toddling back to her, and tucked the paper into her hoodie pocket. ""James, David, hold my hands,"" she instructed. James did so willingly, looking over with pity at David, who was wiping away blobby tears with a now damp sleeve but still reached out to meet Nicky's hand. She walked quicker than normal, every sound of the forest somehow more startling and frightening than before. She suddenly regretted not asking her older brother along; if she had to flee, she would have to carry two young boys. Shaking the thought from her head, her hands gripped theirs tighter. 

They emerged from the forest quite a sight, Nicky with sweat beads on her forehead, James with a look of consternation on his small face, and David with bright red cheeks and puffy eyes. They walked on down the street, passing the bus stop, and James looked up curiously at Nicky, whose brows were furrowed in determination. They continued on to their new destination, turning and doubling back and then turning again, until they reached it -- an office building. There, they waited in the lobby, the receptionist giving two lollipops to David, until a middle-aged man stepped out of a glass door towards them, worry in every wrinkle on his face. 

""Nicky, what's this?"" he asked, looking back and forth across the three of them. ""I thought you were going to the museum."" 

""We were,"" Nicky replied, voice shaking. ""But we-we found a weird note, in the forest I mean, and--"" She looked away in shame. ""I felt...wrong. I wanted to wait for you, Dad."" 

She procured the note from her pocket, handing it over to her father, who read it up and down with a face that grew darker with every passing moment. At last, he looked up at her, then at his two sons, and hugged them all tightly, with shaking hands and white knuckles. 

***

That night, and for many nights after that, police scoured the forest with vigor. The news reported the incident as a mysterious prank, and nothing more. Nicky's older brother, Thomas, insisted on watching over her and the two little ones when they went out. But none of this kept the fear from the incident at bay for long. At night, David would call out in ragged breaths for his sister, an eerie habit that Nicky became quickly unsettled by. Nicky herself would find her thoughts centered around the note as well, and what it had read. Though she peeked at it just once more before giving it to her father, she could not forget it. 

*Whoever finds this, I don't know if I will return from these woods or not.* She'd close her eyes at night and quickly the image of the note would float to her mind as vivid as if she actually still had held it. She could trace with her eyes the handwriting, frighteningly familiar for all the worst reasons, crawling across the page, with its blotches of dried and rusty blood. *I don't know how long I've been here, and I don't know who's taken me. But I suspect they will not keep me alive for much longer. Though I don't have much hope,* -- and here, a different type of blotch of liquid stained the paper and blurred the ink; a tear, or perhaps several -- *if you are reading this, please find me. I hope to see my family again. Tell them I love them. -Nicky*",mofu_mofu

I remember the day I first mentioned the camping trip to my parents. My Mother who may as well have been sent down from the heavens. My father, a stone disguising itself as an Army vet.  I sat them down and explained all of the usual crap people talk about when they go on these trips to ""find themselves"". How I couldn't wait to explore using my own mind and nothing else, meet people I could finally call actual friends, fall in love with, think about as I lay awake in bed. Most importantly, after all these years spent alone with my parents incessant arguing, I'd actually have some pleasant stories to bring back to the dinner table. 

My Father unfortunately didn't share the same excitement as my Mother did for my adventurous spirit. I was told horror stories about the mountain paths, flash floods, disappearing travellers and mysterious staircases? (I didn't really understand that one. He must have read about it on one of his websites. I mean come on, I was going into nature, not Ikea). Overall I kept thinking, how much of this was really any more than the overbearing parenting my Dad had displayed since I was home schooled. How much of it was his drill sergeant days. Either way, he didn't seem to care of the effects it had on our house.

My Father left us that Summer. I personally feel it's exactly what my Mother wanted. No, needed. Finally with my Father gone, I managed to convince my Mother to let me go off in search of my white whale. I packed his old van full of supplies, threw my bag in the back seat and whilst my Mother was busy in the house, I grabbed the last remaining trash bag almost overflowing with its contents and forced it into the trunk. After kissing her on the forehead, I was gone. 

That was the last time I spoke to my Mother.  I quickly stopped letting myself believe this trip was about finding myself and instead more about leaving something behind. You see, I never really fit in back at home. People always noticed something was off about me. I guess that's why until this day, I still consider my Mom my only friend, so it must have really hurt when 3 years after I kissed that forehead for the last time, a policeman did it too. I'd been gone for so long that they called off the search. Presumed dead, I was no longer the laws problem. Other business in town they had to take care of apparently.   

Of course this news wasn't true. But once you've lived a lie for so long, it's difficult to get out of it, you know? I think that's why I left. I never even liked camping. I just couldn't disappoint my mother. Honestly what's the harm with everyone thinking I'm gone, anyway. I mean it certainly makes it easier on me. Sure sleeping in the bushes and shitting in a hole I dug with my fingernails isn't the most comfortable life to live in this world, but hey. If the police can't find me, then they're sure as hell not gonna find the old mans body. 

Especially not when I've been moving it for the past seven years...

"[WP] You wake up and have no senses, sight, hearing, smell, taste and feeling. How do you react to being alone with your own mind?",atgmailcom,"*What a headrush...*

Those were my first thoughts as I woke up. Well, ""woke up"" might be misleading, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. For now, just assume when I say ""wake up"" I mean ""regained consciousness"".

I was cursed long ago with low blood pressure. Cursed is overstating it, I admit, but it's not like it's really *helped* me. Mostly, it's seen me zoning out for god knows how long if I stand up or stretch or breathe in the wrong way. I'll lose balance, then sight, then hearing, then, depending on the severity, touch. Admittedly, it had never happened immediately upon waking up, but it felt exactly the same, and I was tired.

I waited for the headrush to stop. It didn't.

I tried to shift my weight, but couldn't. That might be misleading as well, but a lot of things about my situation were misleading then, too, so we're probably on the same page. It's not that I couldn't shift my weight, per se, moreso just that I couldn't actually percieve that I had a body. That doesn't really cover it, either. Whatever.

I moved my hand up to my head. My hand didn't move. You know how your hand will get super numb if you lean on the wrong thing for too long, and you can't even tell where your hand is unless you look at it? It was like that, but I couldn't even look at it, because I was effectively blind. 

I didn't panic. I don't panic very often. I just sort of lay there, for some amount of time. Then a thought struck me:

*Did it finally work?*

If my mind was connected to lungs, I would have gasped. I've been thinking about this for years. Did it finally happen?

I'm getting ahead of myself, though. Let me explain.

Several years ago, I met a demon.

Stop now if that makes you uncomfortable.

It wasn't because I died, or accidentally visited hell, or chose the wrong alley to turn down. It wasn't the typical depiction of the goat-legged, silhouetted, looming, red-eyed demon, either. He wasn't even corporeal. And, for the sake of convenience, I'll tell you right off the bat that his name was Roger.

He approached me — or rather, I found him — at least a decade ago. It wasn't on purpose; I just tend to exude a sort of calmness around me, I guess. In case you didn't know — and let's be honest, why would you? — incorporeals will only make themselves visible to someone if they feel comfortable around them. That's how I saw him: apparently he had unconsiously let his invisibility down for me. My best description of him (and I mean this in the best possible way) is a 5-inch, winged, bipedal fennec fox with small horns and a thick, off-purple lizard-like tail.

But I didn't even notice him at first, since I often have visions anyway. I just figured he was another part of my imagination. Now, that didn't stop me from acknowledging him. And of course, *he* was caught off guard. Which was my first indication he existed outside my head.

Eventually, we got to know eachother. I've never been one to be afraid of things, so we actually got along quite well. And since I talked with myself even before I met him, to everyone else nothing about me really changed. But I knew it. Suddenly, I was never alone.

What I was talking about earlier is posession. Along with the theme of this whole experience, you've been mislead about posession in general. It might shock you to know that posession must be consentual, on both ends. And it can't just be on paper, either. You don't sign a paper letting demons into your body. Not that *you* would... but it has to be real, internal.

I didn't know what it would feel like. After all, I had never been posessed before. But I imagined it would be something like this, a simple disconnect between my mind and body as Roger took over. It was plesant, and at least somewhat familiar.

There had to be some way to communicate, though. I'll admit I was a little worried that Roger might forget to breathe, or how to breathe, or he might not be able to walk on my plantigrade legs. I sort of floated around, even though I had no real concept of moving. Quickly, I came across... what I can only describe as an amalgamation of diffusions. It's not like I could see them, but I knew they were there.

I tried thinking in the direction of the diffusions. It's hard to conceptualize thoughts with a direction, but what else could I do?

*Roger. Are you there?*

No response. The diffusions didn't even react. I tried again, putting more of a kick behind my thoughts, giving them more power. I don't know how, but again, what more could I have done?

*Yo! Roger!*

In my mind's eye (which was really all I had) I think I perceived some movement in the diffusions. With this, I tried one last time, putting all my effort into yelling with my mind.

*ROGER. WAKE THE FUCK UP.*

I felt the vague sensation of shaking, then the diffusions began to move, blinking rapidly from one location to the next. A shudder, then, ""Urgh . . . what... the fuck?""

It was my voice, but I wasn't saying anything.

*Roger, is that you?*

""Hell if I know. Is this... you?""

*I think so!* An idea struck me. *Hang on, I'm gonna try something.* I drifted into the diffusions, and immediately became overwhelmed with sensory input, forcing myself out again. I guess I just got used to sensory deprivation too quickly.

""What? What are you doing?""

I shook myself off (mentally) and prepared to go back, for real this time. I plunged in, and felt every part of my body. I saw the ceiling of my bedroom, I heard blood rushing through my ears. Except they weren't mine anymore. They were Roger's. It all felt very strange.

*I can see what you see.*

""What? Couldn't you before?""

I could hear my voice in Roger's ears. *No, that was just a void.* I saw him blink, felt the eyelids over his eyeballs. This is gonna take a lot of getting used to.

""Ugh. This is weird.""

*I feel ya. Try moving around. Get used to being corporeal.*

""Yeah, that seems like a good start.""

I began to feel his fingers twitch, brushing against the blanket, then his legs and chest followed. I had to pull myself away for a moment.

""God, this is weeeeird... I have to control everything manually.""

I had a mini panic attack. *Then focus on breathing and blood! When I get my body back I want it in useable condition!*

""Relax my dude. That stuff's being done for me. I guess it's not *all* manual.""

I let out a (mental) sigh of relief. I didn't really want to know what would happen if my body died while I wasn't there. I didn't really want to think about it, either. So I changed the subject.

*Do you think you can walk?*

""Well. One way to find out."" He got up and immediately fell over forwards. ""Guess not.""

That was when I realized that when I pulled out, I only stopped feeling. I could still hear, smell, and importantly, see.

*Heh. Get rekt.*

""This is *your* body, man.""

*Yeah, but it's you.*

""Whatever.""

He positioned his hands beneath his chest, and pushed us up. That was when I realized I was experiencing even more than I thought I was. I could percieve the location of each of Roger's limbs. Though I think I could do that when I wasn't posessed as well. Huh.

Roger moved into a sitting position, back against the bed. ""Dude, I can't feel your legs!""

*They're your legs now.*

""Fine, I can't feel *my* legs.""

*There you go.*

""What do I do?""

*Ya got me. Here, lemmie just...* I reinserted myself fully, sort of prodding to feel my legs. 

""What?""

*Hmmm... *I* can feel my legs.*

""They're *my* legs.""

*Shut up.*

""So what do we do?""

*What if I... fuck I dunno.*

""Should we just switch back?""

*Probably.*

""...who goes first?""

I pulled myself out of the diffusions, just for safety. *How about you leave, then I'll go in.""

""Okay..."" The diffusions slowed, then stopped. I suddenly realized I had no idea how to get back into my body. I panicked for a few seconds, then realized that before then I had only been in contact with the outer parts. So I moved into the diffusions, making my way to the center. I didn't experience input as soon as I entered, though. Maybe because there really wasn't any experiencing going on.

I reached the center, and suddenly found myself in my body. I gasped, lurching forward, then coughed a few times. When I looked up, Roger was on the dresser beside me. ""You okay?""

""Yeah. That's a bit jarring."" I checked, and made sure that I could in fact feel my legs. I could. I moved them around a little bit. They responded normally. ""Dude, you suck at being a human.""",catbat2000

"[WP] Pick a genre, then write about a long walk home after school",bluesblue1,"Everything changed the night Jaimie ran home from school. 

Five minutes. Five tranquil minutes it usually took the young boy to make it to his front door. The bell would ring and the pupils would pack their bags, all before pouring out of the exit like a swarm bees leaving their temporary hive.

That particular summer had flown by and the project was a great success for the local community.  The idea, which had been gaining momentum for a while now, was as such: a summer school teaching art for bored school kids over the summer break. 

Simple and effective. It kept the kids busy and it gave parents some spare time. The children knew one another well due to the already close-knit nature of the community. Nothing could go wrong, therefore nothing did. 

That is until the sun began setting early. 

The sticky heat of September soon merged into the cold winds of October as the bright sun began to shorten it's stay. 

For the young artists this meant shorter days, yet the trip back home had now been plunged into the more unsettling stage of twilight. 

Usually, Jaimie began his short trip by taking his time to feed grass to the cows in the nearby field. Once some time had passed he'd then skip over to the river, where he would listen to the frogs croak away peacefully. 

Yet that night he had no time for his usually peaceful passtimes. Once the bell sang it's broken tune the young boy set off like a small mouse escaping it's prey. 

Darkness had yet to fall upon the village, yet the recent sunset had created beautiful fiery colors on the horizon. 

Reassured by the remaining rays of daylight Jaimie decided to pay the cows a visit after all and show them his recent painting. 

The lad had a talent, for his art was always so brightly colored and pleasant. That day he had painted the very scene in front of which he was standing: a beautiful valley, with cows under a vibrant sky. He was certain that his mother would hang this one up, for sure.

Upon reaching the farm he removed the painting from his backpack to show his animal friends, but on doing so he noticed the color change in the distant sky. The fiery orange had now transformed into a bloody purple, the sky around it filling with blue darkness. 

The sudden realization stopped the boy in his tracks. Home time had caught up with him, his detour meant that the comfort of his front door was now ten minutes away instead of five.

And so a swift decision was made, he was to walk home at a faster pace than usual. It wasn't an issue, he could have made it. 

Yet something caught his eye upon placing his artwork back in its folder.

The dim light of evening had transformed his image, the cows now resembled dark figures in a field ablaze with fire. 

Shoving the scary mess into his backpack he looked up in horror to see a similarly frightening sight. Yet the dark blurs were moving towards him. Their once comforting moos resembling tortured moans of the night.

Tears filled his eyes as the boy raced back down the path. Haunting figures still stood outside his school, a few of them calling out in alarm. 

They resembled humans in form yet their faces weren't visible in this light. The more he focused the less they looked like faces at all. 

Three directions awaited him before safety. Two lefts and a straight line until home. 

Passing cars became monstrous creations. Blinding him with their bright torches, deafening him with their roaring engines. 

Placing his hands of his ears as he ran, Jaimie could still hear the loud croaks from the nearby river. Images of strangled men gasping for air filled his mind instead of the small frogs he once knew. The owls of the night welcomed a sound he never wanted to hear again: A women letting out a blood curdling screams. A ghastly orchestra was at work.

Amidst his disorientation Jaimie had somehow made it to the final stage of his journey, the last straight line. Tonight though, he had to do it in pitch black, sprinting through the valley of death, with the gremlims and ghouls hot on his tail. 

For the first time in his life the young boy saw death staring back at him. He wanted it to engulf him and take him away from this torrid place. 

A light in the distance... his hope, his home. 

Screaming at the top of his lungs the young boy ran back for the arms of his mother, for she would surely protect him. 

The nightmare was about to end.

Jumping over a garden fence he came face to face with a large wooden door. 

Gasping for air, Jaimie's brief reassurance was dealt a final blow as it soon dawned on him that the large door wasn't his.

It wasn't his garden, it wasn't his home and they most certainly weren't his parents in the front living room. 

Standing in the dark, watching him from the inside.

But just as reassurance I checked every other event I dodged recently, and what was my excuse for it.  

* I was fired  
* my dog died  
* I broke my leg

And that was just the last three. A strong urge to get back home, just to check, overwhelmed me, and I entered my car and drove back home, a terrible fear sprouting in me. When I got home, I exited my car so fast I stumbled, and fell to the asphalt floor. a sharp pain and a horrific numbness spread in my leg, and the paranoia only grew. I managed to get to the home, just to see a golden retriever puppy laying on the floor, his eyes shut and his collar ripped to shred together with his neck by something that looked like claws.
  
""Oh, god."" I mumbled to myself as I got back to the car, only to receive another message, this time from my boss, I already knew what It was, but at this point I did not care. I drove madly to the hospital, all the while checking to see if there were any other invitations I refused. luckily, there weren't, but the three that were haunted me. I was almost tempted to drive into another vehicle, and hopefully end my and my family's suffering. only a primal want for survival made me continue. When I got to the hospital, which was located in the next town over, It was almost night. 

I burst into the lobby with all the speed my one functioning leg gave me, and found my father, crying quietly, something I never saw him do before. Even after he returned from Vietnam, he never cried one tear. I wanted to hug him, to console him in any way, but I couldn't do it with the knowledge of what I did. I exited the building with the excuse of a smoke break, and stared into the starry sky, looking for something there. but there was nothing, only the stars, the moon, and the crushing knowledge I now possessed.

I went back to the hospital, and asked for help with the broken leg. As they carried me to the X-ray machine, I made a promise, one which will be enforced by the world itself. no more lies.

Two years later, I sat at my apartment, a Persian kitten cradled in my arms and my wife watching TV next to me. My phone beeped, one of my friends wanting to hang out.

"[WP] You never kill the spiders in your home, you just whisper ""today you, tomorrow me"" when you set them outside. Now, in your most dire moment, an army of spiders arrives to have your back.",jonathot12,"The most important thing a person can learn in life, is that Kinship is more important than Kin. Just because you're related to someone doesn't mean that they're your family. I'm saying this, because not long ago I learned where that distinction lay and how far a family will go to protect those they care about. 

As a kid, I thought I had super powers; the ability to turn invisible. I could go hours or even days without anyone acknowledging me or realizing I was in the room. But I eventually learned it was because I was the fourth kid out of seven, and living with parents who would scarcely be able to raise a single child, even if they chose to stop drinking away every cent they earned. I wasn't invisible, I was simply not worth noticing, which at least served to spare me from my parents sporadic bouts of rage in my younger years. But, once I was old enough to go to school, learn to read, and be able to pick up old, discarded novels from goodwill, I gained a new power. 
Teleportation. 
The power to go wherever a book could take me. To escape from my rotten life, my squalid home, and the strangers called my family who I was forced to inhabit it with. It was my little escape, something only I had, and something that nobody else could take from me, no matter how badly they wanted to. That much was made evident as I grew, I was finally noticed, and met by waves of insults and accusations from my parents and siblings. It was as much as I expected; that if I was reading, I must think I was better than them. That I had some kind of aspirations that I'd never have the potential to fulfill. How dare I want a better life than the particularly shitty hand I'd been dealt!

It was one day when I was reading Jude the Obscure at goodwill, when I saw it happen. Scuttling across the floor, a tiny spider with only seven legs, barely escaping the stomping feet of the stores manager. For the first time ever, I felt that flash of kinship, where I felt like I understood someone. That spider and me, living in places neither of us liked and where no one wanted us, always unnoticed and even when we were, we became a problem. So, I did the only thing I could. I dashed over and cupped my hand, slamming it down over the spider and using my book to scoop them up before the shopkeeper could take another step. I exited with my new friend in hand and deposited him in the mess of webs nestled in the corner of the shops doorway. 
Every day from then on, no matter where I saw them, if there was a spider about to be killed or in danger, I'd make it a habit to stop, scoop them up and set them down outside or close to a crack or crevice they could make them a good home, sometimes even with a small word of advice. I could have sworn the little buggers stopped and looked up at me in response before shimmying their way into the relative safety of their webs and hiding holes. But I was already talking to them, so I guess it didn't seem that unusual at the time.

It was the night of my sixteenth birthday when I found my true home. It was just coming on midnight when a pair of loud, blundering steps coming up the stairs signaled the conclusion of my parents drinking for that evening. Their obnoxious hyena laughter pulled me out of the book I was reading for just long enough to peer through the crack in my bedroom door and make eye contact with my boorish, drunken father. That was mistake number one.
That was all the provocation he needed to come barrelling through the door, waking three of my other siblings in the process, eyes still fixed solely on me.

""Well look, if it isn't Einstein, still up reading his precious books at all hours of the night!"" he breathed directly into my face, his nauseous stench wafting up my nostrils. I turned away and said nothing.

""What's the matter you little shit? Spent so much time with your head in them books that you've forgotten how to speak? Lydia! Come see! We've made one so stupid that he can't even speak anymore!"" he belched back to my equally intoxicated mother, who promptly stumbled in, giggling like an idiot.
I did my best to continue ignoring them; but my silence seemed to motivate them, to try and get a reaction out of me, more than anything. Their attempts became increasingly desperate and furious, spitting, cursing and yelling, but I still refused to acknowledge them. That's when my father took my book and I finally reacted. That was mistake number two.

""You think these are gonna help you where you're gonna end up, huh?"" he gloated, dangling the book in front of my as I attempted to swipe it away before he could pass it to my mother. 
""Because they're not! You're going to end up amounting to nothing, working for nothing pay in this nothing city and having kids who amount to nothing just! like! you!"" he barked, prodding my chest with each word for emphasis and glaring angrily. ""So let me do you a favour and help get rid of that pesky ambition for ya!""

That's when my father opened my book and, with a look of glee on his face, violently and systematically tore out every last page. That one act unlocked the floodgates on sixteen years of repressed anger and neglect, and for the first time in my life, I stood up for myself.

""That's where you're wrong! I'm not going to do any of that, because I'm not staying in this shithole for a second longer!"" I yelled, barging past my worthless parents and towards the stairs. 
""And I'm glad you two found some relief in drinking rather than reading!"" I added as I took my first step downstairs. ""This way, you'll be dead at least fifteen years earlier than I was hoping!""
That was mistake number three.

I didn't feel the bottle smash over the back of skull as much as I heard it, and then the stairs suddenly rushed upwards to meet me. I could feel myself tumble down the steps roughly, bumping and twisting as I fell, but it all felt as if it was happening to somebody else and I was sort of watching it from afar. I came to stop suddenly on something soft, too soft to be the stairs or floor, lying face up as I saw my father coming down the stairs, the bloodied and broken half of the bottle still in his hand. My head lolled and my eyes felt like they were being weighted down as I lay there, the edges of my perception becoming blurred; but the last thing I remember before I lost consciousness was the image of my father looking down at me and suddenly screaming out as he slipped and was seemingly dragged down the stairs by the shadows that rapidly swallowed my vision. 

When I awoke, I was resting on something soft and white, what I initially thought might have been a hospital bed. But when I sat up, and saw the millions of tiny legged creatures surrounding me, I knew it was no hospital bed. My head pounded viciously, but when I put my hand back to inspect the wound, I found it to be bandaged in the same silky white material that I was sleeping on, with a few spiders seemingly there to keep the compress clean and secure. Hearing a slight shuffling to my side, I turned to see the spiders were carrying in a book for me, Jude the Obscure to be precise, and resting atop it was an especially small fellow with only seven legs. I took the book from them, my seven legged friend seemingly trying to wiggle his way in between the pages. I opened it to the page he was trying to reach, and he began to do the most amazing thing. He would scuttle back and forth between the same words seven words over and over again, tapping his little front legs on the ones he wanted me to see. They read as thus:

Day after day, I come to this place of governance, and watch as the rich and corrupt try to become richer. Day after day, I fight them. And it all seems for naught.

I do absolutely everything I can, and it seems to make no difference. I even help the people in the little spare time I have – I volunteer my few spare hours a week, I donate to charities, I give money to the beggar children I pass on my was to work, and I never refuse an opportunity to help a less fortunate citizen. Even spiders, I care for and help when I can.

But it never made any difference. And now, I fear it is too late. We’ve known for two months, now, that the locusts were coming. But try as I might, I couldn’t convince the others to prepare the nation. Instead of buying food from out farmers and storing it, using foreign aid where we had to, they spoke of how high a price they could sell our limited stores for once food was short.

I look out the window, now. I see it – a dark cloud, moving towards me. Moving towards us. Ready to wipe out all the people I’ve spent so much time and energy trying to care for.

But the cloud stops. It’s as if it has hit a barrier. A sticky barrier. Few locusts get through.

I stare, my mouth open. Is it possible? Could there be a way of stopping the locusts and keeping the people fed, after all?

Some scurrying catches my attention, and I turn to my desk. Spiders are gathered on the surface, spelling out the words: Today, you. Tomorrow, me.

To be honest i read a post about battered woman syndrome and grooming and i truly believe i allign with them...


Its hard knowing they are really fkin u up mentally and you know its happening but your pretty helpless to stop it. I go through alot of maniac depression and anxiety ive never had before.  I can be ok one minute then bam.. anxiety and depression and i start bawling. Its a feeling where you want to be with this person and marry them and you have done everything they have said and made great sacrifices (moved across the country and gave up everything) and they tell you i love you back then just abandon you.  I have no friends and family here and the only person i have turns his back on me, but tells me sweet things to my face its so....idk controlling its crazy... You love them they love u but no matter how hard u try you cant even make tht dream of being married and happy together come true. All i want to do is take care of them and love them, and they take that from me with their actions..


Ive recently been thinking about medicating myself so i feel less impact from it... I sit and blame myself for what happens, maybe not enough sex (i have a higher drive than him tho...), maybe im ugly, maybe he secretly hates me. When i tell him these things he says its not me at all hes just a monster...Hearing that is so devastating cause hes basically saying you have been great to me and do everything right but im hurting u cause i can, i have no reason for it...I still secretly blame myself though, makes it easier for me.

(1) Medicating yourself doesn't help, it just takes the chance of experiencing any Joy away, and *everyone* deserves joy, no matter who they are.  (Unless, of course, they take joy from something illegal/violent!) 

(2) If you're code-speaking ""medicating"" to mean suicide, you need to seek help pronto. I absolutely hate telling people what to do and I prefer to let people make their own choices after I've given all options available, but that is resolute. Checkout the subreddit /r/SuicideWatch, with redditors who are there day and night. There's also the national suicide hotline at 1-800-273-8255, available 24 hours everyday. My best friend volunteered there, so you're talking to a real live, honest person to talk through with you. I am sorry to come off sounding overboard, but you can never be too cautious :)

Anyway: I know you'd is so easy for me to say, and so cliche, but it is so, so true: you've got to love yourself. You love your guy, I get it, but when your own insecurities are making you double vulnerable, something's got to change. Your partner can't make you whole -- not without you having a good foundation: you loving yourself. Otherwise, even if he weren't being two-faced with emotionally beating you down, a shaky foundation doesn't let the walls of trust stand firm.

There's a lot going on here, while also not nearly enough -- Here's some beginners -- Step 1: look in the mirror, every day, preferably in the morning, and tell yourself something good you like about yourself. Anything. Every day. No qualifiers, ie, no ""but"" or ""if."" Step 2: find something to introduce you to people. You can start with Reddit--subreddit on sewing or accordions or whatever, and also your city (or nearest one). Lurk, then comment, just to get into the practice of socialist if you need it. Or check out MeetUp online, where random people get together around a common interest or new experience -- a friend of mine once did a drum circle!

From there, see what happens. Push yourself, even if you're not up to it. Or, if Step 2 sounds weird, get a retail job -- it forces you to interact with others, with the bonus of getting you out of the house and getting paid!

Knock this out. Love yourself. Leave him, because you're worthy of someone who loves you like you love him--exactly as you are--and helps you better yourself because they love you so much. You got this.",mamagbz

I noticed them bit by bit. One here, one there, a small black and yellow horror flying around my truck. I began to really wonder and connect things when I noticed several of them while parked in the middle of a vacant lot. I'm a trucker, and pretty much live in my rig. And what the hell are these damn things doing way out here? Where are they coming from?

After slowly getting to the point where I really noticed them I realized the awful truth: they're living in the visor of my rolling house. That was three years ago.  Once I decided to live and let live instead of getting some industrial bug spray, I started greeting them. When one would fly inside the truck I would shepherd it out gently with the words ""Today you, tomorrow me, right guy?""

Now often when I park there's 2, 3,4...sometimes even 5 flying around my windows and mirrors...checking out the smashed bug guts buffet perhaps. Or maybe just coming to say hello.  Part of me wonders if enough generations of them have grown up with my smell...or there's some magic fairytale bug hoodoo...that they are never aggressive. I've never been stung. Not once. I wonder about their queen. Is she nice? That's stupid, right? Bugs aren't nice...or not nice...they just are.

When I noticed that I can now sit with my windows down and not get eaten by mosquitoes...well, that's when I truly saw the value of having my own little swarm of flying predators. Not that I try to handle them although to be honest I've thought about it. Maybe I could hand feed them...

So today I was checking under the hood for leaks and four of my swarm were checking out the front grill. Another driver starts to walk by, stops and practically backpedals and stands 20 feet away as I say ""ok guys I really have to close the hood now"". I close the hood with them flying around me, turn and tell the guy not to worry, they're mostly harmless. He sits in his truck in the dock next to me with his windows up, giving me this...look...while I'm in my truck with the windows down with my guys flying in and out my window.

Look, I'm not crazy. It's NOT like I named them or anything. I honestly can't tell them apart.

A few interesting tidbits...
I had the visor light on that side burn out. So i climb up onto the top of the engine with my tools thinking in either going to get stung or have a bad fall. As I get up there I say ""Hey, it's just me, sorry to bother you I'm just changing the light"". I take the light off..the one I've seen them go up behind...and NOTHING. No nest. No activity. The visor is hollow, I've changed all the lights..that should provoke them...nothing.

When I put my truck in the shop they are nowhere to be seen. Same thing when I get the truck washed, and the power sprayer is focused in front of and behind the visor.  

When I'm stopped and they're flying around I notice that when I start to move they all get back on board. It makes me smile every time.  Come on guys, bus is leaving.

So, what do y'all think?  Is it that my scent is familiar or magic bug hoodoo?

— Isaac Asimov

&amp;nbsp;

""Huh, that's strange...""

I put my fingertip on the word I was on before looking up from the page of code. ""*What's* strange?"" I asked, when my assistant wasn't immediately forthcoming. He was holding, of all things, a softball, poring over it as though he had never encountered one before. 

A clearing of my throat brought him out of his reverie long enough to stare at me through thick glasses. The vision glitch had been patched last month and now he was back to wearing thick lenses that magnified his eyes to bug-like proportions. I pushed my own glasses back up my nose, lamenting the fix.

""What's 'strange'?"" I repeated. Had he found something or not?

""Well, you remember that duplication trick from a few years back?"" 

""The Cardamone method?""

""The same. Well, when the Creators realised the exploit Cardamone used, they did a hotfix within hours, remember?"" 

""I do. I had only just set up the sonic dematerializer when the fix came through."" Another patch that had been bitterly disappointing. Cardamone had gotten filthy rich before his secret got out. The patch didn't erase his wealth, but it did stop other Testers from replicating his success. Testers such as Wilkins and myself, who had figured out how the exploit worked and were mere hours from duplicating the results for ourselves. 

""Well,"" Wilkins continued, ""I was playing around with that sonic dematerialiser yesterday. I went over the patch notes from that fix and I was certain the fix wasn't absolute due to the relatively small adjustments in the subatomic harmon-""

""We already tried working around the harmonising synergies,"" I interrupted, hoping to hear the short version instead of the excruciating step-by-step recountings my assistant was so fond of giving.

""Yes, well, we did, but we never tried combining it with the old translocation trick from 1814.""

I raised my eyebrows. ""The Comte trick?""

""The same,"" Wilkins nodded, ""I thought it hadn't worked, but then I checked Houdini's elephant cabinet this morning looking for something else and... well, I'm pretty sure I didn't put the ball in here after the experiment,"" Wilkins finished, starting to speak faster and more excitedly.

""Go find the original,"" I demanded.

Wilkins hopped away to another room, leaving the softball on his desk. Having marked the line I was up to, I got up from my own desk and walked across the study, retrieving the ball for myself. To the uninitiated, this cramped space would look like the back stage area of some stage magician's travelling act. 

Most ""magicians"" these days were just illusionists, unwilling or unable to find glitches that would make their acts authentic. Smoke and mirrors instead of genuine ""magic."" Real magic was the ability to find mistakes in the universal code - the programming of the entire universe - and exploit them to make truly impossible feats reality. Then disguise them as tricks, so as not to alert the Creators of the code. Sure it cheapened the trick a little, but if you wanted to repeat the act over and over, you needed to draw just enough attention to get rich, while allowing people the possibility of, just maybe, explaining it away as a trick of the eye. 

Houdini's disappearing elephant act was performed just once, and to this day only us Testers can explain how it really worked. The coding of the cabinet Houdini used was sloppy, allowing both it and the elephant to disappear without a trace under the right conditions. The problem was, the trick was so incredible that it instantly made the Creators suspicious, and the cabinet was patched before Houdini could perform the trick again. They never did find the elephant again, either.

But now, it seems the coding still wasn't perfect. Under the right conditions, the cabinet could now ""receive"" an object, rather than making it vanish. This would require further investigation to recreate the trick in another environment, but for now... my thoughts were interrupted by a softball-brandishing Wilkins.

""I found it! It really worked!"" Wilkins practically hopped from one foot to the other, proffering the softball. I took it, inspecting it against the one I already held. A perfect match, right down to the frayed stitching along one seam. 

""No damage to either object from the duplication,"" I mused. It was time. Finally, my plan to become the greatest magician of all time would become reality. Cardamone had been a fool when he simply duplicated diamonds - he hadn't found a single glitch since, and while he was rich he was far from famous. No, this time it would be done right, and I would become a household name the world over.

""Wilkins, place me inside the machine. It's time to show the world some true magic.""

They're supposed to giggle and blush and do all these feminine things that the website told me were IOI's(indicators of interest) but it never once said anything about what to do if she actually had fallen from heaven. I flashed through the notecards I had discreetly hidden in the lap of my pants and saw there was no refuge there either. I looked up at her helplessly.
""Oh ah, I'm sorry. What I mean to say is that, are you from Tennessee? Because you're the only ten I see, the only one in this whole...""
My voice kind of just trailed off there and it didn't help that even I could hear how badly it was breaking when I pitched up about three octaves on ""ESSE"". I tried to maintain frame and keep a masculine face but I could feel the night slipping away from me.
Luckily, my date seemed perplexed rather than turned off by my effeminate display. I can work with perplexed; Hell, perplexed is the best a girl's felt about me since high school. 
""I'm not from Tennessee"", She said, a little irritably. ""I'm from heaven. You just knew that.""
Okay, okay, okay. Game face Herwitz. You know how to handle this. When in doubt, agree and amplify. That was supposedly the bread and butter of any major player; and if I was to believe my morning affirmations, I was one hell of a major player.
""Course you are gorgeous. If I were God, I would keep you seated right next to my throne just to be able to look at that rockin bod anytime I wanted."" Oh god, too much, neg, NEG!

Nope perfect. She was smiling- SHE WAS SMILING! 
""I did indeed once aspire to be 'God's', as you call him- I did once want to be his High Angel. But it is a job with many duties, some beyond my grasp. I am content with my current status in his kingdom."" Her eyes narrowed. ""As I hope you are.""Jake got the weird feeling she could see right through him. He nervously fidgeted with the steel band on his wrist. She really was going on with this heaven thing! It was just one line, but maybe she really liked it. Jake checked his watch. Fifteen minutes! They’d been here way too long. He’d read that if he was constantly changing the venue, she wouldn’t have time to be comfortable with anything but himself, and then she would cling to him like white on rice. That was the exact quote from the website- whatever anyone could say about Jake, they couldn’t say he didn’t do his homework. 
	He opened his mouth to suggest they get out of here- they hadn’t even gotten their drinks yet, would they have to pay?- when she, Artemis, that is(it was always recommended to use the marks name in all points of the conversation. It sounded really uncomfortable to Jake, but he had also been a virgin for 25 years, so what did he know?) shushed him. He had never been shushed before and he might have been offended if Artemis hadn’t followed up that shush with, “You wish to take me back to your apartment and- how is it you thought it- have your way with me.”
	Something stuck with Jake there-thought it?- but then it was gone as the full weight of Artemis’ statement sunk in. Never, never, ever deny what you want out of a relationship. Doing so was a one way ticket to the friendzone and God knows Jake had spent enough time there. Did God really know though? He could probably ask Artemis to check. And with this thought, Jake couldn’t help but to giggle out loud.
	“Is something funny?” Artemis asked sharply. “Was I wrong in my reading?”
“No, no, no. You’re right?” Jake was laughing so hard now that tears were coming out of his eyes. When it finally stopped, he stood up. He felt great. 
	“Wanna get out of here?” He asked. “I may not have been to the real heaven yet but I promise I can show you heaven on Earth.”
	Intrigued, Artemis took his hand. Five minutes later(Jake’s house was four minutes away) and Artemis had determined that the real Heaven had quite a bit more to offer. Not to mention it was not nearly so messy.

"[WP] Discouraged by the egotistical backstabbing and bullying at Hero Academy, you transfer to Villain University and discover everyone is actually nice and supportive.",remccainjr,"""I was outraged Cedric, it was bullshit I didn't know anything about that gang and I was being treated like a villain. I was um....sorry by the way guess I am a villain now haha. I really shouldn't use that word negatively I guess.""

""No worries man,"" Cedric said, ""keep going.""

""Okay, so"" I continued telling my story.

I refuted the charge against me. The police officer was getting weary and twitchy. You could tell they are nervous around heroes. The officer started to call for back up, but just then Thunder Jackson bust through the courtyard doors and flew himself forward to stand in front of the police officer. ""Figures"" Jackson proclaimed, ""that the 'Hero' called the Black Puppet would be the black heart behind that gang trying to rob that poor bank today. That gang would have never tried a most daring heist so close to Hero Academy without support from the inside. It must of felt nice to betray them like you did so you could earn more prestige.""

I didn't know what he was talking about, but then the police said they found a phone in my locker that matched contact information with the gang leader's phone. I protested, it wasn't my phone I claimed and at that moment Jackson hammered me straight in the face. ""No more lies,"" Jackson cried out so his voice boomed, ""you think we wouldn't figure out that you would use a burner phone to carry out your crimes. It is time for you to face reality son.""

The blow from Jackson threw me off guard which allowed the police that were gathering to hold me down in place as they cuffed me from behind. ""Careful proud agents of the law,"" cried Jackson, ""his powers let him control shadows with his mind. I have to knock him out to ensure your safety."" Jackson reeled back and launch a hay-maker that sent my head spinning and I was out cold.

I awoke in a cold cell at the local station. ""Hey there sleepy head, figured I should check on the criminal I helped apprehend today,"" Jackson said in a low menacing voice."" I didn't know why he was here at the station with me. ""I figured I should stop by to inform you that you are suspended indefinitely from Hero Academy. Sure they might let you back in, but I can't let that happen now that I have earned that prestige you stole from me."" I was so confused. I didn't know what he was talking about. ""Oh yeah, before I forget you might want to return that burner phone of yours once it is out of evidence. I hear it was defective. Here I'll give you the receipt for it.""

Why did he have the receipt for the phone? Why was I in prison. The thoughts raced through my mind. Then my thoughts re-calibrated to remember the series of the events and how I got in this cell. I took his words to draw a mosaic of memory to uncover the truth behind his haunting smirk. That bastard had framed me.
I screamed, ""You bastard do you think you will get away with this once I tell everyone the truth!""

He smiled a wicked smiled that turn my stomach to porridge, ""Yes,"" he whispered ""because no one will believe you. Consider this a lesson, you stole my glory from that gang I was meant to capture and now, I'm just taking back what is mine.""

I protested and kicked at the iron bars. ""You, will pay for this. How can you call yourself a hero? scheming with gangs and setting up crimes. You are no Hero!""

""Clearly you haven't thought this through yet, but why are you still in this cell? Your parents didn't post your bail they think your a criminal, the school thinks your a criminal and guess what criminals do, lie. Besides I am the prodigy now, fans are all ready lining up to be my side kick and I will have them on your tail if you think you can clear your name. So good bye Black Puppet I was unable to redeem you.""  

Thunder Jackson left the room and in the hallway I heard the whispers of people and saw flashes of light. He was getting interviewed by the press, ready to anoint Thunder Jackson as a savior for stopping a vile conspiracy from taking place at Hero Academy.

""After that I was sentenced to community service. My estranged Uncle was able to lighten my my original sentence,"" I told Cedric. ""He apparently works for a powerful monarch in Europe that well has a colorful reputations.""

""Wait! does your Uncle work for Emperor Dystonia! that is like the best henchman gig there is!""

""If it is all right could we not talk about that right now,"" I said ""So I was back in the city living in an apartment that my Uncle was willing to pay for awhile. Apparently my parents disowned me even though the Great Thunder Jackson tried to get them to reconcile with me. So he gave me a card and said to think about coming to Villain Academy and well here I am.""  

""Holy shit dude, I don't know what to say."" Cedric reached down to turn my face up to him. ""But it is going to be okay now man, anyone that thinks they can mess with you has another thing coming. So what happened to that gang?

""They were never given a name when the communicated through the burner phone. They said they were in contact with a Hero at the academy that was willing to help them out of their financial troubles. They said the Hero believed that he was working for the greater good by helping them.""

Cedric signed, ""Damn man that is messed up."" There was a long silence. Cedric started to fiddle with his jacket and I was taking slow deep breathes. Thinking about how Jackson had ruined my life still was a bitter pill to digest.

Cedric spoke, ""Have you ever wondered why Villains tend to have more successful partnerships with each other compared to Heroes?""

""No I haven't. Why? Is it because they are selfish pricks that tear each other down to earn more adulation from the public?"" I asked.

""We all know one scumbag hero that needs to be taken down a peg or two."" Cedric pulled out from his jacket a smart phone and opened up an app thumb-nailed as a skull and cross bones and press the comically labeled ""dooms day"" button. The earth exploded in central park and a stone statue awarded to Thunder Jackson ripped into the sky. Cedric reach behind his back to grab his custom laser rifle out of his duffle bag. The laser projectile struck the statue and it shattered into colorful dust like a firework.

For the first time in a long while I smiled as I watch the wind catch the dust and smiled as it danced its colorful beauty.

This will be a cramped trip.

""You just got word?"" she asked, managing a smile but drumming her hands impatiently on the steering.

I nodded and got in, and we launched out into the velvety night breaking air with no more than a whisper.

The Facility lets senior vets like us out into the field once in a while to complete actual contracts that put our training to use.

Klara and I had synced from day one, and pretty much levelled at the same rate, meaning we were  one of the few outdoor teams that worked like clockwork. For some reason we'd never hooked up; usually because she was seeing someone or I was seeing someone, and though we liked each other a lot it seemed like there was always someone else in the way. Regardless, she was a good companion and a fun person to trash talk with.

""Hey, have you seen those new -""

Something bright flared up suddenly and illuminated the roofs of the rows of houses in the compound below, prompting Klara to punch the flaps and yank the glider hard left - a trail of fire and smoke narrowly rushing past us.

“WHAT THE SH-"" was last thing I heard before the canopy flew open and the wing blew apart from another missile.

I span in the air watching numbly through a field of red up towards the craft as I fell. Klara nimbly countered her angular momentum against the air, and dove straight towards me like a javelin as my blood traced a thin spiral tunnel around her.  I felt hands and then a small impact before the world faded away.

I smiled to myself dimly in the last vestiges of consciousness at just how quickly and catastrophically my so-called clairvoyance had failed, and grinned warmly in continued appreciation at just how graceful and dextrous Klara really was. It was no wonder why Jayce liked her...

“Ladies and Gentleman! And Cybernetic and occultic monstrosities of course.” Professor Doomsday, a man in an long white trench coat held a piece of chalk in a hook. He turned from the Black board and eyed the students with a laser sighted Death monocle. “We here at the Villains University pride ourselves on one thing, and what is that?” He pointed his leather gloved finger at a goth girl with glowing eyes.

“Evil?” she mumbled, hesitating.

“Not the answer I’m looking for miss?” he leaned closer to the woman, cupping his ear.

Crowley.” She squeaked.

Ah! I knew your father, clever man! But you there, Ghost knight. Your name and Answer my question.”

“Goliath, and Power.” The tinny voice echoed from the smoke inside his torso.

“Wrong again, but closer Goliath. Someone call it out, all of you.” The Professor waved his hook to his audience as some began to stand.

“Money?” An Italian man in a business suit was first to try.

“Vengeance?” A crawling chaos called.

Dozens of voices echoed dastardly proclamations and all seemed to fall short.

“The Individual!” The Professor slammed his only hand into his desk with a crack which silenced all.  

“Each of you are here from a different reason. Each of you has his or hers.. or its.” He eyed the mass of tentacles on the floor. “Forgive Mr. Glyarnep. The adjustments since the portal opened have taken some getting used to.” Glyarnep raised a tentacle, signaling a thumbs up.

“Each of you are an individual, from every walk of life.” He goosestepped down the aisles as he proceeded with his speech. “Each of you have something special about you that no one else possesses. It is our job at the university to strengthen that and make you the villain you were born to be. Evil is a game of politics, power but a means to an end. It is your will which is most important. It has come to my attention that we have a former member of the Heroes Academy among us.” He halted at my desk and made a right face.

“Mr. Randolph R. Gibbs. Born in Indiana with an obscure talent for blood and soul magic. You transferred from HA and have arrived as of September third. Applied to Occultism General and My class of course, Is that correct?”

I couldn’t say a word and only revealed a nod.

“Forgive them, Mr. Gibbs, I can only imagine how abhorrent your time there must have been. Rest assured, your past does not interest me and you are welcome here.”

“Now!” Professor Doomsday swung his hook back to the rest of the class. “ Make no mistake. This endeavor will be by far the hardest you undertake if our jobs are done correctly. Survive, and you will be better for it. We here at Villains University do not care for your politics, your species, your weaknesses or beliefs, we demand your best!” His hook and chalk rotated around his wrist with his final statement.

In hindsight I didn't know how snide I sounded, and I'd be caught dead pulling that self righteous stare nowadays. Man the academy really rubbed off on me... I guess that's why they record these induction interviews to be laughed at during the summer party.

The Dean continued;
''Well firstly Casey you can chill, you're kinda killing my vibes here, and secondly there's no pressure to join any societies, most popular students are the independent types anyway, no one really gives a shit what you want to do... in the good way of course!''

I was taken aback at how quickly his demeanour changed from flamboyant villain to extremely ordinary guy. ''gawd dayum! he got you good HeadCase!'' my hunchback roommate bellowed from the corner of the TV room. We moved onto everyone else's tapes and laughed our way into the night, and when I woke up hanging upside-down from the chandelier the next morning and felt it was an accurate assessment that I should go for a jog to detox. 

Not everyone is born with powers, but a lot are, but then not everyone has Class T5 powers so an elemental like me should always make the most of what the indifferent random universe gives them. You gotta have fun, that's a no brainer (rule 1 of VU: if you can't do it in style then don't do it at all), and you need a consistent philosophy, the unpredictable types always get assassinated (rule 2: it's all part of the plan). Lastly you should always keep your mind and body in shape (rule 3: there's always someone more badass than you, don't skip leg day), this is why I'm still jogging despite emptying out my stomach in every drain along the w... wait is that Chad?

''Wo, well look who it is! Casey Taylor from the prism district!''

''Chad.''

''Nice leggings Casey, you know...'' I'm bored already so I'm gonna stop him right here ''Yeah thanks Chad they are just 'cheap ol' lycra' as I recall your comments on my old costume from the academy, I guess you're looking for a compliment back on your underwear seeing as you're wearing it on the outside?''

''ha... What? Whatever, these are special issue Edna-Biggings compression briefs...'' Oh would you look at the time, it's IDGAF o'clock and I am dying for a bacon sandwich. After making it known to Chad that I recently unlocked a secondary ability of enhanced agility, I crashed through my front door finishing off the job that WreckingBlob started. I went into the kitchen and thought I'd catch up on my messages while the bacon cooks.

''Gawwwwd dayyum Headcase, you make $6.30 leggings look mighty fine with that ass'' 

''Aww thanks Hunch, but that's an oddly accurate price tag for a throw away comment, have you been sneaking around again?''

''uhhhhh''

''No, it's OK! I'm no innocent girl myself. Hey, I think you should do all my laundry and then recite all the prices of my clothes next week. Do what you want with the clothes I just want them clean please. Oh and If you don't then I will challenge you to a throwdown, full well knowing that you never ever decline a battle but also that you are 2 power levels below me. Deal?''

''Gawwwwww-shit.... OK HeadCase, I'll just get started on the clothes now...''

I always remember the golden commandment of Hero Academy, ''heroes are united, we never fight one other''. What a crock of shit that was, not fighting doesn't stop people hating each other, so the issues never get settled. And why did every damn rule had to have some pompous title: Golden Commandment, Mantra of Peace, Justice Values, just a bunch of weasel words to cover up the fact they are authoritarian busybodies.

Bacon! Sweet sweet salty bacon! What I wouldn't give to eat this in front of Professor GoodHeart, here professor, I don't like the crusts so go blend it with some kale and pump it up your vegan ass. I receive a message from the Dean, who is never up early on a Sunday, I best head over to the office.

''This must be serious Kane, why are you texting me so early?''

He swivels round in his spike studded leather chair ''Oh I was up all night trolling some forum and didn't bother sleeping, you're appointment is coming up so I thought fuck it''.

''Happy trolling?''

''Yeah admins banned my IP. Anyway, I heard you ran into some trouble recently?''

''Huh? No trouble here, I've made Hunch my domestic thrall, but he had an out, his stubbornness isn't my fault.''

''No not that, gee you think we get the psychics to spy on your dorms when they have better things to do?! I received a complaint from *that* Academy, a fine for the harrasment of a Chad... something, I'm not going to pronounce that B.S name''

''That was barely hour ago! HAHA[maniacal laughing]! He must have REALLY ran back to campus to make that complaint so fast!

The guy is brilliant and got that dutch humour down to an art form, but he's depressing as fuck, and needs some direction in life otherwise I think he's going to zap out into an outer-dimension one day. I can't lose another villain to the Nexus, if only they knew how much fun adult life is after VU!
   So, you're gonna make him your buddy, and you're going to have him hack into H-Academy and pay back the councils fine with some hero donation money, then everybody wins! Well except the heroes but life is winning for them so fuck 'em.''

"[WP] Discouraged by the egotistical backstabbing and bullying at Hero Academy, you transfer to Villain University and discover everyone is actually nice and supportive.",remccainjr,"It wasn't particularly anything that anyone had said or done that made me think I did not belong, but more the environment itself. 

Heroes were split into teams of four or five, and team members were established early in the first week after everyone exhibited their powers in that desperate need to be noticed by the higher ups during initiation. 

The teams were not balanced in the slightest; the mighty stuck with the mighty, and the meek with the meek. All teams then competed with one another, and all members in a team competed amongst themselves. An institutionalized hierarchy emerged practically from the get-go, where everyone knew their place and no one challenged the status quo.

It's hard to even being to try in that environment; any attempt to better yourself is met only as a challenge against others, and it doesn't take much to be nailed back into place lest you forget yourself.

I'd had enough. Being one of the weaker clairvoyants meant that I was left out of the team strategy sessions, and my combat talents paled in comparison to many of the others. 

I felt useless, and I wasn't the only one. Most teams had a runt who occupied the delicate position of 'better than *them*, but not better than *us*', and we often looked past each other in the corridors with the same dead eyes.

A message passed between us one day, transmitted through passing hand slaps or shoulder shoves: ""Talent compliments talent."" I didn't know what it all meant, but when ten of us dropped out the next semester to work on a resource farm, I followed suit.

It was a farm, that much at least was true, but underneath the modest surface facade lay an underground complex of classrooms, corridors, and barracks; teeming *teeming* with people who greeted each other with casual warmth instead of the desperate politeness I was used to. I saw a level two psych sit down with a level nine tank for lunch and wave over his friends from a different team.

Teams existed here, but they were nothing like the teams at the Academy; people were assigned tasks and were encouraged to recruit whoever they wanted to complete it, with more respect going to those who commandeered teams of newbies like myself than those who stuck with the same crowd - that is not to say that persistent team pairings were discouraged.

I made fast friendship with a level three sharpshooter when it became clear that my clairvoyance and her marksmanship synced perfectly during a task. We worked in nine separate teams together, and paired up with other newbies who had struck a similar dynamic amongst one another. 

Rivalries were superficial at best; pure smack talk to an opposing team during a team battle that sometimes escalated outside of the task, but usually dissolved into nothing as we ate together in the mess hall.

My confidence grew in that year, and so did my talents; with my initial inhibitions to make mistakes lifted, I was free to learn, and I quickly rose to a level twelve predictor before my hundredth task. Many of us had, there was no such thing as a special snowflake - just an ongoing blizzard of talent piling up at the door - our minds and bodies geared towards changing things for the better.

When and for what? That I did not know, and it troubled me, because sometimes when I could not sleep at night I would look ahead a year or two and though I would see inconsequential events here and there,  a vast grey smokescreen of uncertainty engulfed everything else, and it spread in a manner that I could only describe as diligent.

Something was being future-masked, a technique I had only recently begun to experiment with, and whoever was doing the masking was powerful enough to plan very big. New recruits piled through our doors every day and yet somehow we always had room for them, despite no discernible change or expansion in living/learning quarters. No one had gone missing either, at least no one I could remember....",tomatoaway
"[WP] Discouraged by the egotistical backstabbing and bullying at Hero Academy, you transfer to Villain University and discover everyone is actually nice and supportive.",remccainjr,"""Seriously dude? You have never wondered why Heroes don't have henchman?""

""Isn't because they get paid or something,"" I said as I lifted my head from the cold compress Cedric the Vile had gotten me after I had the unfortunate encounter with the prodigy hero, Thunder Jackson. I had burned some street vendor stands that sold newspapers that plastered his ugly mug on the front page. I am sure the media and the citizens will say I deserved it.

""Sure henchmen get paid and even benefits,"" replied Cedric, ""but think about it. A job where there is a high probability for broken bones, imprisonment, most likely a gut punch that sends you flying to the moon. People wouldn't sign up for that crap no matter how good the pay and bennies are. No they believe in the guy at the top. There is a lot of goodwill there that make the worker bees proud. So yeah Villains are pretty much the pillar of civility, well at least in their owe organization. Society really doesn't see it that way though.""

""I guess your right,"" I said, ""still though even now after enrolling in Villain University, I still get chased around by Thunder Jackson, just now the beatings draw a crowd. To be honest they also drew attention at Hero Academy, though in that school they were called ""rank"" matches. Each morning young aspiring heroes would line up before the administration and we were given our rank for the day. Excelling in class work and participating in rank matches would move you up and down the ladder and your rank would carry day to day. The higher the rank the more prestigious classes you could attend, the better assignments you would get and the people would love you.""

Salty tears welled in my eyes and ran down my swollen cheek. I grabbed a tissue and deftly wiped them away, hoping Cedric wouldn't see. Thinking about the day of my first rank match reminded me of the humiliation I faced, the day I was branded a criminal.

""Listen normal people around the world join Villain organizations,"" Cedric said, ""we value the lower rungs in society and man we just give them a shot. We represent the oppressed, and sure sometimes we go a little crazy, but this world needs a reset. We give the oppressed a second chance. The heroes, they are just holding up the status quo. They draw the crowds of those well off snobs that want to maintain their status and wealth. If they just spent some of the adulation they give heroes improving the lives of the oppressed we villains wouldn't be around, neither would the heroes too I guess, not like I would miss them.""

""Cedric, I wanted to be a hero,"" I pleaded. ""I really did. People like the Mighty Maverick and Liberty Lady, I dreamed of being like them, but now I just don't know. How much of their fame was really earned honestly? Thunder Jackson is certainly no paragon,"" as I angrily spat those words thinking of that grandstanding prick.

""Hey, are you ready to talk about what started all this with you and Thunder?,"" Cedric asked. ""No judgment man I'll hear you out. What he did to you today needs answering for, but I curious how this whole thing started.""

I took a deep breath to try and keep my nerves. My hand was shaking, ""okay I'll try."" I recounted the story to Cedric. 

It started in class when the day's ""rank"" matches where announced. I was to fight Thunder Jackson. People were all ready predicting he was going to lose. No one wanted to fight me. I had a reputation around school already for stopping a bank robbery committed by a local gang on the first day of the new semester. Still I was nervous since my physical rankings where not high and my powers were ill suited against his thunder fists. 

During break, I took a small space in the academy courtyard and decided to train by rigging various light projections to go off randomly so I could weave my shadow puppets around the light. I felt more confident as a I practiced. The bell rang and I was heading back inside to the gym for our ranked match when a man wearing a police uniform approached me. He said that the police had found evidence that I conspired with the gang that tried to rob the bank earlier in the day. He said there was evidence in my locker and that I needed to come with him.

The Blues circled around us with practiced ease and took out four of us as the rest of us panicked and ran for cover.

I spotted her in the foam tree, lining up a shot on the flag bearer and could only marvel at how the hell she even got up there. She took the shot and missed, as I somehow instinctively knew that she would, and then ducked as a paint grenade flew over to our position. 

I had to throw it, I knew I had to, it was right there in front of me, but instead I just gaped at it and felt my heart pump in my ears. 

That's when he ran forward and snatched it out in front of me, throwing it quickly back at their trench. It exploded in midair and covered him, me, and the girl in the tree in blue as we were removed from the game.

""You knew to duck, but not to throw huh?"" he said as the three of us walked off the set. 

I felt an anxiety-induced hot retort boil up from the center of my stomach as I wrestled to give him a piece of my mind, but as I looked over and met his playful gaze I saw that he grinned and all the hate just bubbled away. I laughed, and realised that it was indeed just a game.

The girl was less forgiving though. ""You could have at least thrown it *forward* and not *up*"" she said, wiping the blue out of her glasses.

""Girl, I was trying to save our asses back there!"" 

She mumbled something about 'good job' and then smiled and blushed despite herself when he wiped some blue off her forehead. Us being one of the early casualties in the game, we headed off for an early lunch and laughingly played the blame game until the others met up with us.

""Jayce! Klara! Get do-"" was all I could manage before the air was sucked out of me from the resulting explosion.

The ground crackled with the sound of machine gun fire as I danced a desperate route to the nearest concrete wall and hunkered down. *Shit! Shit! How the hell had this happened?*

It was the first outdoor op, and I had spent weeks planning every facet of it so that it would go quickly and efficiently. All contingencies led to an event where the three of us were airlifted safely out after extraction.
Mists of grey began to cloud my mind as I raged internally, and I was barely able to see more than a second in advance.

Shots scattered into the wall above my head, and I scrambled for new cover before I heard three loud familiar shots crack into the night air. Klara was alive, and more importantly doing her job. If she could hold it together, so could I.

I took a breath and cleared my mind. *The three of us will leave this compound in a chopper, this is truth.* Jayce was alive, likely recuperating and planning a dramatic re-entrance from a flanking position. It was now or never. I had to draw out the fire and let the other two handle the rest, standard trio maneuvre and if there was one thing I could do other than predict, it was run.

With a quick slap to the face, I hopped over the cover and ran - ran my ass off in a zigzag straight towards the comm tower with  bullets licking my heels as I chased a wild branching path led by my clairvoyance. Klara's rifle must have boomed a dozen times, but by the time I got to the extraction zone, there was no one left to fire on me. 

She waved at me from behind the tower, and I rushed over grinning at how she'd managed to turn this one around. Jayce would be so proud...

""He's... he's over there,"" she said numbly, and that's when I saw him slumped against the tower, a pool of red painting the ground around him. The extraction chopped roared overhead and circled around us, and I felt a wave of cold rush over me.

The comms burst into life and I signalled for extraction ASAP. We dragged Jayce's body into the bay, and then we took off away from the compound, Klara and I sitting around his corpse silently as if it was just the three of us again relaxing after a mission. But we know it wasn't so, and we sobbed.

""Don't worry kids,"" the pilot said reassuringly over the radio, ""Pretty soon you'll forget all about this...""",tomatoaway

The older student shook my hand,  ""I'm Jack, but when I finish my eMD I'll be going by Doctor Necrosis.  Professor Plutonium told me you're transferring from HA, right?""

I nodded silently.  I really didn't want to talk abou my experiences at Hero Academy, and really didn't want to hear what Villain University graduate students thought of it.

Jack must have noticed my hesitation, because he laughed and said, ""Don't worry about it.  Half the grad students in your department did their undergrad at HA.  Lots of people get sick of all the weird politics and personality conflics over in 'Hero' world.""

""Really?""  Nobody had mentioned that at Hero Academy.  Then again, why would they?  Everyone at HA had always made it sound like VU was the worst scum of the earth, they'd probably hate anyone who transferred there.

""Oh yeah!  C'mon I'll show you around.""  Jack started leading me through the Mad Science main building.  ""You're going to major in Ultratech, right?""  I nodded and he went on,  ""I'm working on my doctorate in Genetic Manipulation, so I'll be working on the floor below you.  You guys are on the same floor as the Cybernetics department.""

He opened the door to one of the offices in my department and four graduate students looked up from laptops and notebooks at us.  ""Guys, this is a new student in your department.  He's transferring over from HA this fall.""

The grad students all waved and a handsome bearded guy with the ponytail stood up to introduce himself, ""Good to meet you, I'm Dave.  Cassie and I both went to HA for undergrad.  What was your major?""  

""I was working on Mecha-Enhanced Technologies before I transferred.  The department was...."" I struggled for a description for why I gave up, but Dave finished for me, ""Not very supportive.  That's why I came here, too.  I actually majored in Meta-Humanities before coming here.""

Dave turned to my host, ""Oh, Jack.  I've done some more digging on that proposal we mentioned, I think we should rope in the Crypto-Zoology and Occult Archaeology people.""

I had no idea what they were talking about, but Jack did.  ""Okay, if you say so.  The administration loves interdepartment projects, as long as that funding source of yours is good.""

Dave nodded and went back to the old book he was reading.  Jack led me through the building giving me the tour of the Power Armor Shop and the Death Ray Laboratory which were both in my new department, along with the Post-Human Facility that his lab shared with Cybernetics.  Out on campus he pointed out the Mystic Arts building, the Mutant Training Facility and the regular gym, the Post-Humanities building, and the main Student Center.

""So, before I let you go I just have a couple of questions.""  I nodded, VU seemed like exactly where I wanted to be, my earlier nervousness had given way to excitement.  ""Why did you want to leave Hero Academy?""

I sort of expected this question, and I'd been thinking about it myself a lot.  ""I guess, nobody there really seemed to be heroes to me.  The professors didn't actually seem to want to be teaching, they just wanted to pad their resumes, and the students were all egotistical jerks.  They were constantly sabotaging each other to improve their standing.""  This had really gotten t me when I was there  ""It was like, they cared more about being called 'heroes' than about actually doing anything.""

Jack smiled and nodded, ""That's what everyone says.  So why come to Villain University?""

""Because....""  This was going to sound stupid, ""I want to actually make the world a better place and it seems like everyone who does that gets called a villain.""

Jack smiled even more,  ""That's also what everyone says.  Last question: Have you thought of a villainous moniker?""

I had not.  Now that he asked, however, I was considering a PhD in Horribleness.",Lt_Rooney

I was expecting some heavyweights to bully me, a new kid in the middle of the year. Instead, I was greeted by a crowd of relaxed, normal-looking guys. One of them approached me. He lifted his hand; I winced, preparing for the hit. Instead he stuck out his hand to shake mine. I shook.

""My name's Pete,"" he said. ""Nice to meet you."" He was wearing a gray GUNS AND ROSES T-shirt, and some jeans.
""...I'm, um, Ronald. Greetings,"" I muttered.
""You'll see, this is a great place. They give pizza for lunch every Thursday.""
Pizza? I thought Villains ate... what do villains eat? Children? Bugs? Snakes?
""You've been allocated to the psych house. We're bunkmates!"" Pete told me.
""Oh, uh, great! How do you know my power?"" I asked timidly.
""I predict someone's near future. I knew you'd be transferred there, so I guess your power is...""
""...mind reading."" I answered, while checking his mind. He was honestly being nice to me.
""Principal's coming."" Pete said. Before I could grasp what he meant, a small, bald man with two revolvers slung at his chest, dangling around his fat belly. He groaned.

A smile appeared on his face. ""Welcome! I hope you'll have a great time in our Academy."" The principal at hero school wouldn't greet us, he'd test our physical capabilities.
""umm... Thank you."" I said, stupidly.
""Class starts in twelve minutes,"" he added. ""Go put your stuff in your room, then follow Pete to weapons class.""

When I finished unpacking my bags in a rather comfy bedroom, I followed Pete.
""If you don't like the posters, I'll take them off,"" he offered.
""What? No! No, I like Infamous, Metallica, and other stuff...""
""I left some space for any of yours near your area. Just in case,"" he added.

As we arrived at the shooting range, the teacher gave us Max Protect Radio headgear, with a visor telling the stats of each shot. At hero academy, we'd shoot with unprotected ears. The school had plenty of weapons. We first revised how to open a butterfly knife one-handed; the telepathic student helped me. Without her help, I'd be missing some fingers. We then practiced our aim with pistols, revolvers, rifles, SMGs... then we all got to shoot a fake hero model with a bazooka. After that, we did paintball. My team won.

So this school is actually better. Everyone is nice, the teachers are fun, and that telepathic student is quite hot. I gotta go now, we have sports class. Today is boxing. After that, we'll do mechanics: build your own missile. And after that...",PepeLePierre

""I put sheet metal over the windows,"" Ricky said.

""Angie did that!"" Pete said. ""You watched her while she worked.""

Ricky wiped his forehead. ""It's not like that. We had to be sure the metal covered the windows, so, you know, one of us had to stay back to, to see.""

Angie and Ryan set to work on the deer. They coordinated their efforts, quietly, and kept their heads down.

""It was like hanging a painting,"" Ricky said. ""Right, Angie?""

Pete grabbed Ricky's chin. ""You're not talking to her. You're talking to me. You're explaining why it doesn't matter that you never do any heavy lifting while the rest of us are busting our asses day in and day out. You're telling me why we should keep you around even though all you are is another mouth to feed, and even though most days we don't have enough food.""

""Well... well..."" Ricky patted his pockets and licked his lips. ""It's a good thing I'm gonna be the biggest help ever from now on.""

""Goodbye, Ricky,"" Ryan said.

Angie grabbed a hold of the deer's skin and parted it from the meat.

""Guys!"" Ricky said. ""Guys?""

Pete hauled a section of metal into the doorway. ""Fuck off.""

*****

The piddling shitty fire crackled and hissed. It gave off more smoke than heat on account of the rain. Ricky hadn't seen a downpour this strong in years. Him and the fire were tucked under the low branches of a pine tree, mercifully free from the rain. But the wind got in, and it chilled him to the bone.

""Least I can make a fire now,"" he said. ""Fucking Pete. 'Don't make fires, Ricky.' 'People will find us, Ricky.' Stupid Pete. He's probably freezing tonight, but I'm super warm."" He tucked his hands into his armpits and pulled his knees to his chest. Pete, Angie, and Ryan would all be bundled under the quilt they'd found last week. They probably weren't cold at all. And they were perfectly dry inside the Sunoco.

""If they could see me now,"" he said. ""If they could see Lazy Ricky, with his fire and his pine tree, they'd know I'm not useless. I can figure things out. I can find food."" He pulled the three crab apples he'd scrounged in the afternoon out of his bag. The first bite made him wince, it was so sour. ""I've got fruit. Fruit has vitamins. All they've got is, like, meat. They'll get scurvy. Ha!""

He munched his apples, rested his chin on his knees, and stared at the piddling shitty fire.

The tree branches shook, and two men pushed their way into the firelight. One had a big red beard and a scar on his nose. The other wore a poncho with the hood pulled over his head. They both carried rifles.

""How's it going, friend?"" the guy with the beard said.

Ricky swallowed the crab apple he'd been chewing. ""Fine. Thanks. Yourself?""

""Absolutely spec*tac*ular, now that we're out of the rain."" The guy with the beard was missing one of his canines. ""Say, you got any food you could share?""

Ricky had a single crab apple left in his bag. ""I just ate my last apple,"" he said.

The guy in the poncho chuckled. Then he spat in the fire. It hissed.

The guy with the beard said, ""That's a shame. That's a real shame."" He set his rifle at his side and leaned back on his palms. ""A lot of what's happened in the last few years has been unlearning things. Me and friend here have unlearned basic hygiene. We've unlearned home decoration. But there's some things people have unlearned that we haven't. Like manners. That's why I'm so glad you accepted us to your fire and asked how I was doing. You're a good guy. I can tell. You've held onto your manners.""

The guy in the poncho scooped up a fistful of dirt and dropped it onto the edge of the fire. Where the dirt fell, the fire hissed and died out.

""But then there's things we've learned. New knowledge. Brand new findings. Like we're primitive scientists. We've learned, for example, that it's not the bullet that kills the body. It's the bacteria that get into the wound. We've learned that the best way to keep meat from going off is to keep the animal alive as long as you can. We've also learned that what is and isn't food is really down to the person asking the question.""

A second handful of dirt hissed onto the fire. The guy in the poncho chuckled.

""So, we come here and we ask you if you've got any food, and you answer that you're all out. Which is true in a way. But if you were to ask me, I'd say you've got a ton of food, a hundred and fifty pounds at least, just sitting there. Now, what do you think of that?""

All of the saliva had left Ricky's mouth. He was aware of the blood in his veins and the meat on his bones in a way he never had before. He pictured the deer he'd seen that morning, saw Angie parting the fur from the meat, and imagined himself on the counter in its stead. ""I know where you can get a deer,"" he said. ""A whole deer. Killed this morning.""

The guy with the beard sat up. ""Now that's interesting.""

Ricky explained about the Sunoco station, the deer, and his former friends.

The guy in the poncho scooped up a double-handful of dirt and put the fire out. In the darkness under the pine tree, the three men were only visible by their barest outlines.

""What say you take us over there and we have ourselves a feast,"" the guy with the beard said. ""And tell me, these people, what will they be able to do to stop us from having our feast?""",shuflearn

[WP] A story where the last line is a question and the first line is an answer to that question.,uchihajoeI,"Fierce. That's the word that described her best. Fierce, from her curves tight against her shirt to the trail of broken hearts she left across town. She carried a fire that burned too bright, one that drew in men like moths and consumed them, leaving only blackened husks behind. 

She stood out like a candle in the night as she chatted up the bar's regulars while they basked in her glow. Her presence brought new life to the dead air, and they mingled, hiding their troubles under a pint of beer and a night of laughter. But I was no better. I, too, had come to this pit of sorrows for a distraction. I, too, was drawn in by her flame. But my actions that night only buried me deeper. Just going there buried me deeper. 

When the crowd had died down, she beckoned me over and we shared stories over a few beers. Deep in my cups, I let slip some things I shouldn't have. A few gripes about my company. A few more about my family. And with her words, she opened up more to me than anyone else that night. It was my luckiest night in five years at that bar. How I wish it hadn't happened. 

We took a taxi to her place as my stomach sank. This wasn't right, my older self said. But part of me was still young. It clung desperately to the fading embers of my youth, and that night, it was in charge. We went to her apartment, a single bedroom in a poor neighborhood. Her bedroom was a mess. 

""I'm sorry. I can't."" I looked away in shame and headed for the door, but I stopped. God, why did I stop? Why did I turn around? One last look wouldn't hurt. One last glimpse at her flames. 

""If you're sure."" She didn't try to stop me. Her eyes were so big. Her skin was so soft. She didn't need me. She could have anyone she wanted. That night, I was the one who needed her. I shook my head. 

""I changed my mind."" I joined her on the bed. 

Her name was Allison. We hooked up two more times before Marlene found her messages on my phone. We saw a counselor, and agreed to stay together for Jesse's sake. No kid should grow up without a father. Everything was going fine. But then I got a letter in the mail. Allison had died in a car accident. And she'd invited me to her funeral. 

""Honey, this came in the mail."" I handed the letter to Marlene and winced as her eyes hardened. But I was honest. And I could tell she appreciated it.

""Are you going?"" She avoided eye contact. I didn't press for it. 

""I have to."" I said. ""I'm sorry."" 

""Don't be sorry for that. Be sorry for everything else, but don't be sorry for that."" She shook her head. ""Please, when it's done, can we go back to how it used to be?"" 

""I hope."" I left it at that. I loved her. I still love her. Because she'd stayed with me, despite what I put her through. Because she'd given me the benefit of the doubt, time after time. Because I didn't have to explain how wrong it would be to have no one at her funeral. 

She stopped me at the door. ""Before you go, I need you to tell me. What was she like?""

I don't know where I am. I don't know where they're keeping me. ""This is what tradition call for, this is what tradition calls for"" I repeat in my head. It's protocol. 

If the royal family has female offspring, they're taken to a tower, to be locked away, until the male offspring from another kingdom comes and rescues her. They are legally bound together from that point on.

Of course, after the accidents happened, there are no more towers. The air is too thick to breath above sea level. The sandstorms will clog up your lungs, and your skin will be lost to maggots. I don't know where I am.

I don't want this to happen. I want to leave. All that I want is to see the world, to get married to the girl of my dreams, to be away from any kind of royal matter. 

But that's not in my hands. I will be auctioned off to the male with the strongest might, and forced, as his wife, to pretend that I love him.

Tomorrow is the promised day. The day that a brute will 'rescue' me like the damsel I am, and I'll be happy in his arms forever!

[WP] A story where the last line is a question and the first line is an answer to that question.,uchihajoeI,"""I don't know. Maybe,"" Anne said blankly. Her green eyes focused on her reflection on the mirror, probably trying to see if her lipstick smudged. Her auburn hair was perfectly coiffed into a chignon, and the pearls hanging from her neck complemented her creamy skin.

""Okay, then,"" I said as cheerily as I could, a smile on my face. ""But if you don't want to...""

""No, it's okay. Yes. Yes, I want to come to dinner with the Whitlams.""

""Are you sure, honey ?""

She sighed before giving a response.

""Yes, I'm sure.""

I looked back at my wife of two years before retreating to the study. Anne broke into a small smile, strained and forced. She looked back at herself in the mirror. Tears were starting to form in her eyes, almost like dew on a blade of grass. 

Anne wasn't always like this. Years ago, Anne was this vivacious, bubbly resident doctor, and that smile, it was anything but forced. Her laugh can be heard through the corridors of the hospital each time she laughed with a colleague or shared a funny story with a patient, a guffaw that earned her the little nickname Dr. Chuckles. And, oh, how easily it was for her to talk to people and open up. She had this magnetic quality about her and was always the first to pipe up with a line like ""Hey, I like your shoes ! Where'd you buy them ?"" followed by her name and her hand for her new friend to shake. As everyone -- her friends, her colleagues, her patients --- could attest, Anne was a ray of sunshine.

She was also in love. His name was Dr. Justin Thornton. Tall, blonde, blue-eyed Justin and Anne just clicked the first time they met each other in medical school and became instant friends. Justin and Anne became partners-in-crime, pulling pranks on each other and helping each other's patients cheer up. He was also the one person to see her not as Anne Madeleine Charlotte Quaker, only daughter of the biggest benefactor of the St. Luke Hospital, but as Anne, the girl stressing out over exams and dreaming of getting into pediatrics, which he celebrated with her once she was already training for it. He took the time to know her, know the real her, and that, she appreciated. 

Eventually, this friendship blossomed into love. The two planned a future together. She would continue her pediatric career and he, his career as an oncologist. One day, Justin and Anne would get married and share the same clinic at the hospital. Then, the two would have a boy and a girl. It was the simple, uncomplicated life Anne craved, far away from the glitz she was accustomed to but never felt was right for her.  Best of all, she would be spending it with the man she loved.

That man she loved, it wasn't me. My name is Noel Duckworth IV. I'm not a doctor; I'm a high powered lawyer. I ever been her best friend. In fact, before we were engaged, she never once spoke to me.

How we ended up together was all to do with our families. Our parents always pushed us towards each other, hoping to unite both Duckworth and Quaker assets. It was no problem for me who'd loved Anne from afar since her family invited mine to her debutante ball. However, I didn't realise it at the time that she had someone else, a handsome oncologist, in mind for a husband. 

Two weeks before we got married, I discovered everything and told her it was fine if she broke off the engagement. I even offered to take her to Justin. However, all she said was that it was fine, along with lines of ""I still want to be a doctor. I want to treat kids."" I later found out that her family threatened to have the board expel her from the hospital if she didn't marry me.

""Hey, Noel ?"" 

I look up and my wife was standing next to my desk.

""Yes, Anne ?""

""I don't know. I feel so tired. Maybe, I can just stay at home ? You go ahead""

""As you wish"".

I smile as she walks away from the. This is the first time Anne had refused to come with me to a party. Maybe, under normal circumstances, I'd be disappointed. But I'm not. And if she leaves one day, it'd hurt, but I'd also be happy for her. Finally, she's free. Maybe, she can return to Justin. Maybe, she can finally be with someone who she'd say ""Yes"" to if he asks....""Do you love me?""

[WP] A story where the last line is a question and the first line is an answer to that question.,uchihajoeI,"Sargent Cowl. He was the Greenville PDs most decorated officer, and one of the most respected too. When he showed up at a crime scene, people knew things were about to get done. It was a Friday night when I finally got the honor to meet him.

We had gotten a call at around 6:02 pm about reports of gunfire near a local bar. Two officers responded to the scene to find the victims of a double homicide laying face down in the alley behind the bar. So naturally, the homicide task force was called in, which is my department.

My partner, detective Robinson, and I arrived in the scene roughly around 8:34 pm. We were both new to the force; just been hired out of the academy, so this was our first big case. When we stopped out of the squad car, the stench hit me like a freight train. I had never been one for odd smells, so I liked to get to a crime scene before the bodies started to smell even worse. Still, I had to cover my nose with my hand as I approached the alley. 

Half a dozen officers stood around the pair bodies on the ground, holding notepads or a flashlight. One officer was busy laying tape around the scene, while a forensics guy took pictures. One of the officers came to meet us once we had reached them. 

""Detective Florence. Detective Robinson,"" he said as he shook our hands. ""So nice of you to join us this evening. I'm Sargent Cowl. Nice to meet you, boys.""

""Nice to meet you too, sir. I've heard all about your work on the force."" I told him.

He just smiled. ""Do you fellas wanna take a look at the bodies? If you ask me, it's a pretty straight forward case.""

He lead us over to where the bodies were found. Sure enough, the corpses were face down, both with what looked like two bullet wounds in their back. They were both male and had a shaved head. One wore a hoodie and some baggy jeans, and the other wore a big T-shirt and some athletic shorts. Both pairs of clothes were stained with blood. I knelt down, and put on a pair of rubber gloves to preserve any evidence that might be found. 

""These guys were both gangs members,"" Sargent Cowl continued. ""You can tell by the tattoos on their necks."" I shined a flashlight on the base of each of their necks. Ink patterns were etched into their skin in the shape of two skulls head butting each other. 

""That's the symbol of the Santa Luca gang, know for drug dealing. The most likely situation here is just a deal gone bad."" I agreed with him. Although it looked bad, most situations like these were just gang violence. But it never hurt to be sure. 

When I inspected the bodies further, I noticed something strange: the placement of the shots. In both bodies, the shots had pin point precision, with both shots landing within inches of each other. Although it wasn't too out of the ordinary, it was still odd. Usually gang members were not skilled gunmen; victims of gang violence were often filled with multiple bullet holes farther apart. 

While I was inspecting the bullet wounds, I noticed something else: the wounds seemed to be somewhat misshapen. When I took a closer look, I realized something even weirder.

""Hey Sarge, did you realize that the bullets were dug out of the wounds?"" I asked Sargent Cowl, who stood off to the left, watching me and Robinson.

""No, I didn't. Good catch detective."" The Sargent exclaimed. ""Probably doesn't mean much though; the gang member who killed them was probably just covering his tracks.""

However, when I thought about the Sargent's probably cause, it didn't make sense. The only reason bullets would be removed from the scene if a crime would be to stop them from being linked to a registered weapon. It wouldn't make sense for a gang member to worry about that because they buy weapons illegally and are therefore unregistered. And even if it was registered, the police would never their hands on it anyways.

I decided to check the pockets of the pants to look for any sort of way to identify them. To my surprise, I found two bags of a white powder. 

""We got some cocaine here,"" Robinson announced, and an officer took it from him, dropping it into an evidence bag. I turned to Robinson, and I knew exactly what he was thinking. A gang member wouldn't kill the dealers if he wasn't going to take the product. Even if it was a revenge kill, the drugs would still make a profit. 

As we walked back to the car, like all good detectives, we had to ask the defining question. Who would kill two drug dealers in cold blood, be able to with extreme precision, cover their tracks by digging out the bullets, and neglect to take the drugs when the deed was done?",The_Spicy_Memelord

[WP] A story where the last line is a question and the first line is an answer to that question.,uchihajoeI,"Well, halfway down the pass, if you take a left, there's a place called Tohos. On the corner of Westminster and Freehan street. My mother lived in Sagganassy for all her life and everyday, at 11AM, she'd go down with Pa to Tohos. She even wanted to buy it at one point. 'We'd sell flowers and flapjacks on the corna!' she'd say in her soft, pastel voice to Pa. When Pa lost his job that dream faded, but never died in her heart. I remember she had a jar, a small mason jar with a label of yellow tape running around it. 'The Toho fund' was scrawled in chicken scratch on it.  

Toho's was ran by two small, old Asian women, with beady eyes and sharp, pointed glasses. They had to be under four feet tall. They'd ran it for years, and for so long that not even Ma's elephant memory could remember when it opened. Huey had told me that they were over thousand years old. And I believed him. They were worn like a leather belt on cowboy, wrinkled and torn. 'No kids!' is what they would yell at me and Huey. They didn't believe in kids. To selfish to run a breakfast place. So, we'd make sure we puffed our chests and straightened our backs, as not to be confused as 'meddling children.'

Ma's Alzheimer's kicked in I think around '82. She'd forgotten a lot of things. Her mother's name, what she had to eat the night prior, she even forgot Huey after he died. She only remembered having one son. I stayed at her side weeping wondering what force could possibly do this to such a gentle soul. She'd start to forget me after a while, asking if I was a nurse or a doctor. She'd confuse me for Pa sometimes too. It hurt. It really did hurt. 

There were only two things she remembered. Pa's face and Tohos. 

It took two days of nonstop driving, but I got it. I got it for her. The jingaling of the bell had been replaced by a buzzer, but everything else was the same. The menu, the seats, the smell of fresh breakfast in the morning. Everything was the same since I had left all those years ago. Two chocolate chip flapjacks, with the fixins', extra syrup. And you already know, I kept those damn flapjacks warm for her. 

I got back on the 5th. Her smile almost brought me to tears when she saw the pancakes before her. Her soft squeal of glee almost left me on the floor. 

""Jeffrey? You got me Tohos?"" 

Jeffrey was gone. Pa was gone. But it was like the memory of Pa and Tohos meshed together into a form of such utter love. She cried as she ate them. Thanking her husband after every bite. I wasn't her husband. I was her son, but I didn't care. I stayed by her side all night, allowing her to hug her 'husband'

The next day, she ended up passing on, with a full stomach of Tohos flapjacks.

I may be living my life with Sagganessy in the rear view mirror, but I'll never forget that tiny down in Missouri. I always tell my kids the stories about Ma. Her voice and her love of freshly baked chocolate chip flapjacks, and they'll stop and listen for hours about Grammie. They'll ask questions and I'll give them answers. From how we survived on such little money and how we dealt with the world in such a hard time.

There's only one question that really brings me to tears anymore. Just the thought of Ma resting in a place so dear to her heart.

After a harrowing journey across a living ocean, that threatened to kill us at every moment, the vibrant smears of deep green forest caused an uproar among the passengers and crew. Even though we were still a days worth of sailing out from land, people stood and looked out, imagining a place that wasn't our cramped, swelling, rocking boat. I must confess, it took quite an effort to conjure up such a place. The wonders of a new world pale in comparison to the prospect of a change in scenery.

Day 2

This place is strange, but unbelievably beautiful. Nature and man made efforts live in a close companionship. The needs of the people flow around the natural flow of the forrest. A river runs through the Town Hall and tree's tower from the center of buildings, the titans are ringed by rooms, and in these rooms, people sleep, cook, read, live their lives in open spaces cooled by natures own shade. The large stone library is covered in vines and fruit trees populate the rows of bookshelves and studying tables. People lounge, snack, and read great works by not only their own, but somehow, our most beloved authors as well. These kindly, but somewhat somber people seem unfazed by us. How can it be that we nothing a culture that knows about us so completely? I've found, not only our written works, but maps of our land, scientific publications of our economic development, and even a detailed account of our worldly exploring. Some of the council (similar to our parliament) have told us of many other travelers that have  come from many other places on this world, that turns out, to be much bigger then we believed. They have heard of us from word of mouth reacting to our worldly interactions. They are pleasant to us, but I feel an air of pensive and uneasy unrest. Our crew hopes to make these natives trust us, but it might be easier said than done.

Day 3

I've learned that the tribe we have met are part of a larger ""country council"". Although fiercely loyal to members of one own great city, this world seems to have a very tribalist view of each other. Members of great cities wear their own colors or crests, diving them into large beehives of patriotic zealots. Representatives from the five nearest Great Cities have come together in our city to discuss our arrival. Most of the men are worried, but I have met quite a few natives since landing here, and they seem friendly enough. I do not believe we have anything to fear from such a simple and quiet people. I have yet to see any guns, so in the minuscule chance that unrest breaks out, we should be able to handle ourselves.

Day 10

Deliberation took longer than expected. Arguing went on long into the night. The crew has been talking of taking back to the sea. But i have convinced most that there is nothing to worry about. Things have finally quiet around the city, and first thing tomorrow, I have to decided to talk to our cities representative, just to be sure. I believe that he likes us.


Don't have much time.
They are close.
They came in angry buzzing droves in the middle of the night.
We ran, but they know the land and it seems to work for them in unnatural ways.
I hope this diary makes it home. I hope I reach someone who will make sure this diary falls into the right hands. Do not try to save us, so many are dead.
They are close. 
Do not send more ships.
Do not send more unknowing people.
They do not want want us here,I should have listened, and we should have left while we still had a chance.
May the families of those I have doomed forgive me.
Pray for us.

[WP] A person has been stuck in a lightly illuminated cave for their whole life. Surviving on what wildlife would pass by and grow on the rocks. One day something came by that they had never seen before.,Dshocker671,"He asked me to put him in the place where I was not allowed to go. I wiped his forehead and chest and grabbed his hands in mine. The dark surrounded me as I slowly dragged my dad the long way down. It became colder and darker the farther I went. My hands kept losing their grip, because his were wet and weakened. His hands fell limply to the ground and I picked them up, held them to my face, and kissed them. I sat on the hard ground and whispered to him, ""We are almost there.""

I needed to rest because my body was starting to hurt. I tried to look at him, but the blackness was such that I could no longer see, so I listened to his breathing. I could barely hear it now. After a moment, I grasped under his arms because his hands could no longer hold on to mine. While sitting I started to push with my feet scraping them on the stone with every effort. His head rested on my chest as I pulled and dragged us until my feet were sticky wet and my back came up against rock. I sighed in overwhelming sadness. I leaned forward, put my cheek on his head, and trying to mimic the lilting voice he used to sing to me, ""And I will always love you, I will always love you."" 

I counted the light and it has come seven times since my dad fell asleep never to wake again. I know I have his sickness because like him, my hands and body are wet and I shake. I am weak and lying here in and out of sleep. I must be dreaming because I hear something in the distance. It is an odd sound that I have never heard before, and it is coming closer. ""Woof, bark, woof."" I look to see a big yellow furry, four legged thing with a wet nose and fluffy tail. I am so sick I am not able to move away from it. Now its face is right in front of mine and we stare at each other. Then another ""woof"" and a second later a cold tongue licks my face. It feels refreshing as it wipes away my sickness. Then, as it lay down beside me I weakly ask, ""Can you take me to the place where I am not allowed to go?""

"[WP] You come across a book, titled ""How to Kill a God""",Gutenpragen,"It was dusty old book. One he found at his father's attic, long forgotten by the world. An unassuming little thing really- even with what its name suggests- there have been fictions with far grander titles, and one proclaiming to teach the knowledge of being able to kill a deity wasn't at all awe-inspiring relatively.

It was only when he opened it, parting the book at a random page, that he realized that it was far more than a mundane book. It was.. something special. Handwritten words- done by a feather pen- lined the worn parchments. They filled it to the brim, but they only spoke of thing, repeated ad infinitum. 

Words of a language he never knew, but soon bled to one he does.

""You must start the journey at its beginning.""

Compelled by indescribable urge to obey, he does so, reading the prelude of a frail old man's tale, before being engulfed by light:

*""How does one kill a god? T'is no trivial thing. I can attest, for I have seen it done, and seen the perils of those who had done so. It is an unspeakable thing. The miracle it has taken for man to stand face-to-face with its better and leave victorious was one I quite literally have no words to describe with. Yet, you see, I am a scribe. I hope it is clear the terrible dilemma I've faced when writing this book. But never fear, my friend, for with the passion for my duty I have found to relay this tale back to you.*

*""There is only one thing I must ask. Not to you. But to your heart.*

*""Are you ready?""*

The man in grey sat in the metal chair opposite of me. He wore a long grey trench-coat over long grey pants. His shoes and fedora where a similar color. In fact the only non-grey clothing he wore was the dark shades, reflecting my own image back on me. Despite the cold outer shell, he seemed familiar, almost friendly.

He slid the silver key to my cuffs across the table before beginning the conversation. ""Son, have they told you what you're in for?"" His voice was calm, almost monotonous.

My voice on the other hand was shaky and weak, ""Umm... no... I-I'm so confused. W-what's going on?""

The man let out a deep sigh as I detached myself from the handcuffs trapping me to the table, over sized orange jumpsuit rustling as I moved. ""Charles Woodrow? Is that correct?""

""I prefer Charlie..."" I was starting to calm down now. This would not last long.

The man pulled a file out of his coat. ""Charlie. What I am about to say is going to sound confusing. You may not understand what I am talking about. If that is the case, that's ok. However, before I begin I have one simple question for you"" He opened the folder. ""Did it give you it's name?""

I froze. He had sketches of the thing in my closet. They were rough but the resemblance was to perfect to be accidental. ""T-that's the thing... I-it stopped my heart..""

The man remained calm, ""Did it give you a name?""

I recalled last night in horrific clarity, ""N-no. But it did ask if I remembered it...""

The man sighed and muttered something under his breath. Then he looked at me and stood up. ""Charlie, you have been possessed by a demonic entity. The entity most likely has been eyeing your body for a long time and may have some personal vendetta against you. While in control of your body they made you commit horrendous crimes. That is why the cops brought you here.""

Possession? Demons? Crimes? I threw up, it was too much.

The man waited for me to finish before continuing. ""This demon may come back tonight. I want to help you Charlie. If you come with me I can get rid of this demon. Don't worry about the crimes, I have connections.""

""Um T-thank you sir for the offer b-but I should probably call my mom...""

The man sighed, ""Charlie... your mom is dead.""

I threw up again.

Sun. 2:25am

I had stopped crying by then. I was out of tears. My mom was the only one left in my family. My dad had left when I was seven and my older brother had died in a car accident when I was ten. My mom had taken care of me. She loved me and would always talk about what a bright future I had. She always said she was so proud of me... now she was...

The man in grey walked over to the seat I was tied to, polished shoes clicking against the concrete floor of the warehouse. ""Charlie, it's almost time..."" he paused for a second. Was he getting emotional? ""...time for this to end. You're gonna blackout. When you wake up, both me and the demon will be gone.""

He looked at his watch, a thin smile across his face. He looked at me and said, ""You're gonna be ok Charlie. You can trust your...""

Suddenly childish laughter filled the room and I was out like a light.

Mon. 11:11am

I woke up with a start falling out of the chair onto the concrete below me. I looked around startled. The warehouse was just as it had been. In fact all that was present was the chair and the grey man's fedora. I went over to inspect the fedora. I picked it up and placed it on my head. It fit remarkably well. Now what...

I looked inside the fedora. There was an address. It was to a pizza place in town. Well, I thought, looking around, it's better then staying here...",PDarksbane

Last night: 3 AM. The night before: 3 AM. For the past week my heart had been stopping at three AM. At first I thought it was a glitch, but every night it was 3 o'clock exactly. It felt too perfect to be a technical error. Do you know what the worst part was? Every time it happened it would take longer for my heart to start. The gap was three hours long. I was concerned I would never wake up again if I fell asleep so that night I decided to stay awake and get to the bottom of this.

Thur. 2:28am

My hands gripped my blanket hard, knuckles turning white. Why did I decide to do this? It was probably just an error. I was overreacting. Nervously I watched the clock over my closet as it clicked ever closer to impending doom, lit faintly by moonlight from between the blinds.

Then I heard it. My own heartbeat, but louder, much louder, almost deafening. I moved my hands to my ears trying to block out the sound but I couldn't. As I panicked the beat became louder and faster. I wanted to scream when suddenly silence. Dead silence. I couldn't move. I could only look forward in utter horror as the closet door opened and red eyes pierced what seemed to be an endless darkness. A childish voice cheerfully introduced itself, ""Hey Charlie? Remember me? No? That's ok! It's probably for the best...""

I wanted to scream but I couldn't do anything. I felt helplessness overwhelm me as the dark tendrils stretched out of closest enveloping my world in there icy embrace...

Sat. 10:30am

I awoke with a scream as I jumped out of bed ready to attack whatever had attacked me. Then I realized two very important things, I was alive and everything looked normal. My cat, Mittens, looked up at me with dull amusement before going back to sleep on the rug. I was about to relax when the cops came in...",PDarksbane
"[WP] After finally getting a Fitbit, you're excited to check your stats after a week of wearing it. To your surprise, every night at 3am, your heartbeat stops.",JMoneyG0208,"I have the kindest, most caring mom in the world. But she just doesn't get technology. So much that it took a five paragraph persuasive essay to convince her to get me a new smartphone so I could play Pokemon Go with my friends. In it, I explained the evil of lag, showed the difference between locked and unlocked phones, and selected a model with a link directly to Amazon. Two weeks later, she wished me a happy birthday as she handed me a small, brightly wrapped box with a smile and a wink. It felt lighter than it should've. 

""It's a Fitbit!"" She exclaimed as I unpacked the shiny black square. ""I know you wanted a new phone for Pokemon, but Carly at the office showed me her watch and said it ran much better!"" 

My heart fell as I realized she was talking about an apple watch. ""Thanks, mom. It's just what I wanted."" I forced a smile. Oh well. I bought a refurbished phone for cheap off eBay a week later. The battery ran out a bit faster than the one I'd set my sights on, but it ran the game alright. I thought about selling the Fitbit to pay for a better one, but it would've broken my mom's heart, so I kept it on, mostly as a fancy watch, and didn't think much more of it. 

But in Pokemon Go you have to walk to hatch eggs, and the distance you travel is logged by your smartphone. I was pretty sure they were cheating me out of some walking distance (Unless my walk to school had magically gotten half a mile shorter), so I logged in to check my stats from the Fitbit after a week. 

You know how sometimes you're totally prepared for a bad thing to happen, and then something way worse happens that makes the first thing seem like nothing? Like that one time I was ten and I dropped my ice cream cone and started bawling my eyes out. A bunch of kids came over, pulled down my pants, and started calling me a crybaby. Well, after that happened, the very last thing on my mind was my lost ice cream. I found myself in a similar situation here. All thoughts of lost pokemon go distance went out the window. Because according to my Fitbit, I died every night at around 3 AM. 

It was pretty clear on the line graph they displayed. My heart rate didn't change much, showing its normal ups and downs as it went through the day. The graph kind of looked like mountains. But then every night, at 3 AM, a deep canyon formed as it dropped to 0. And then it would be back the next morning, a steady 58-62 beats per minute. 

I had to find out what was going on. I mean, I'm pretty sure I needed my heartbeat to live. But here I was. So last night, I resolved to stay up until 3 AM. 

I set my smartphone to vibrate, created alarms for 2:00 and 2:30, and slipped it under my pillow. The anticipation would've probably kept me up anyway, but I wasn't taking any chances. As I wished my mom goodnight, I kicked off my jammies and wore the roughest, most uncomfortable set of jeans in my closet. The ones with the zipper that would bite your dick if you weren't careful. I was not going to be comfortable that night. I settled beneath the covers. And I waited. 

Sweat soaked through my jeans as I pretended to be asleep. Under my pillow, I felt the alarm for 2 AM, then 2:30. And not long after, the door to my room creaked open and a dark figure crept in. My heart almost shot out of my chest as I threw off the covers and grabbed the only thing nearby to defend myself- a pillow. Nice. 

""What are you?!"" I'd like to say I shouted, but it came out as more of a squeak. The figure yelped as the lights came on. 

""Arnold? You're supposed to be asleep!"" My mom scolded, fanning herself with a hand. ""You scared me. And why are you in your jeans?"" 

""What are you doing in my room?"" I demanded, still standing on my bed. 

""I just finished my shows and was coming in to charge your Fitbit like I do every night. I didn't mean to wake you, since you're always such a heavy sleeper."" 

I sighed. In relief or exasperation, I don't know. ""Thanks. I mean, really, mom. Thanks. But you don't need to do that. I charge it at my desk after school."" 

I have the kindest, most caring mom in the world. But she just doesn't get technology.

[WP] A scientific experiment gone wrong causes a worldwide effect of ghostly afterimages of events that happened several months prior being seen playing out in realtime. Law enforcement quickly realises their opportunity to uncover the truth in a number of unsolved cases - but criminals do as well.,Lorix_In_Oz,"As I sat in the shade of the oak tree, sipping a cold beer, I began to feel the first touch of doubt. Maybe he wouldn't be coming.

I pushed the thought aside. He would be here... they always showed up. The experiment made sure of that.

10 years ago, a scientific experiment had taken place at a covert laboratory in Oregon. Nobody really had all the details about what the researchers at that lab had been doing, and unfortunately, they never would... because the researchers responsible had destroyed their lab and all of their data shortly after their work had resulted in a catastrophic accident. 

At first, it seemed there had been no consequences to their accident outside of the laboratory. But shortly afterwards, when the first solar flare erupted, the effects of their mistake became patently obvious. 

Depending on the magnitude of the flares, ghost images of past events began appearing. The stronger the flares were, the stronger the images were. And the further back the images went in time. 

At first, we didn't know what they were. But after a few flares, someone put two and two together and realized what they were seeing. He'd seen his father... murdered three years prior... walking down the street into the alley he'd been stabbed in. And he saw the man who stabbed him, following him inside.

The first time, he'd screamed to his father to run, forgetting it was just a phantom image. Instead he watched his father die in front of him, just as he had died three years prior. 

The second time, he had the presence of mind to record the whole thing on his cellphone and take it to the police.

It had taken seven years in court for it to go to a verdict before the Supreme Court. It was precedent-setting case law, and it was critical to get it right the first time. So they took their time.

In the end, the man was convicted on the evidence. The recording allowed them the chance to obtain a warrant to search his house. They found the trophy of the killing he had kept, along with multiple others. The man was sentenced to multiple consecutive life sentences, and was all but guaranteed to never see the outside of a cellblock again.

It had changed everything, forever. Including the decisions I had made in the past.

When I had majored in history in university, my parents had told me I was wasting my life and should have picked a degree that would be more 'practical' in real life. 

'Nobody ever got rich being an historian,' my father would chide. 

'You'll die a pauper,' my mother lamented.

But they were wrong. 

My degree not only imparted me with a good base knowledge of past American history, but it also taught me a much more valuable skillset: How to research historical events.

So I did. At first, I limited myself to recent events, no longer than ten years back. And I was successful in predicting the appearances of the ghosts.

After finding and following the ghosts, several dozen of them led me to separate caches of money, jewelry, and other valuables from bank robberies, heists, and the like... all hidden over the country in various locations. After doing additional research, I went to areas where even larger-scale robberies took place, and followed those who committed them. Some of them didn't lead me to buried treasure, but some did. Enough that I made a very comfortable living off of it. 

Now, scientists had predicted a massive solar eruption. Larger than any that have come before. The energy from it should hit the Earth any second, and when it does... I'll be ready. I've found the exact GPS coordinates to ensure I get the best view of the event, and will be able to follow my subject to his hidden cache of cash.

"[WP] Describe a mundane action (sneezing, brushing teeth) as dramatic and drawn out as possible",MacAndShits,"It returned my fixed glare, or so it seemed. Of course, this was impossible, but the sheer majesty of the chair made me feel as though it contained some inherent essence, one that allowed it a value higher than any furniture my wanting eyes had fallen upon before.

I approached it with caution, assessing it from afar. With every step further, another aspect of its beauty was presented to me in its continued and exponential radiance. It was more welcoming than any I had sat in before. 

And indeed, it stood within the room as a stark contrast to the dull aesthetic around it. Perhaps it was because of the image it presented, or perhaps it had something to do with the sense of power that would come to rush through my veins. Whatever this feeling was, it was a desire I was focused on fulfilling.  

The prospect excited me. It was fashioned in a way that made it belong in the heavens, crafted with precision and fitted with cushions that would rival the warm embrace of a lover. 

I reached for the top of the chair, and ran my hands along the length of its rim. The wood bore the resemblance of hardened caramel, and felt the same to the touch. It was incredibly smooth, to the point where it felt sinful to even sully it with my skin. 

For a moment I stood in appreciation, before lifting it and resting it a few steps back. It was too precious to drag along the floor, too unscathed by the company it had held to be pulled as if some pitiful carcass from an evenings hunt. No, this was a gem of the civilised man, one that would be treated with the respect that it commanded.

I would require plenty of room for the maneuver I was about to perform, and felt I had set it in a space that allowed me this privilege. I motioned myself forward, standing with the back of my knees pressed against the crimson fabric of the seat.

I drew my hands back, resting them on the arms at either side of the chair. I inhaled deeply, my emotions stewing within my core. Before lowering my body, I thanked the Gods for what I was about to experience. 

I let out a sigh of release as I fell upon the cushion. I couldn't tell if I had released the air out of necessity, or sheer breathlessness.

It was everything I had imagined and more. I pressed my back up against it in that moment, and felt the power of its antiquity revitalising my body and mind with newfound confidence, a sense that only came with age and wisdom.

He was a wiry man, a little taller than her, and wore the uniform of the gallery attendants. He had a long, thin mustache, and there was a crazed look in his eyes, as if she had almost committed a mortal sin. He stared at her intensely.


""Miss, please do not touch the artwork,"" he said. Then, he looked around fearfully, as if scared that someone would see them speaking, and then leaned forward.


""You must stay in this world.""


She felt a shiver go down her spine at the words. He was so certain when he said them, so confident in his warning; yet the sentence was insane, surreal -- he couldn't possibly mean it? It must have just been a weird joke.


She stepped back again and let out an uncomfortable chuckle.


""Er, yeah, I won't do that again, sir.""


He kept approaching her. He seemed larger than life, somehow. Suddenly, she was keenly aware that she was nearly pressed against the stanchion holding the public from the exhibits. She wasn't with anyone else. In fact, none of those in the throngs of gawkers seemed like they even saw her, or her predicament. The attendants even cheerfully directed the crowds around the painting she was at, like it didn't even exist.


He reached out and grabbed her wrist, and looked into her eyes, his burning with a strange, unkempt zeal.


""That is, young lady, unless you feel like you have what it takes.""


Strangely, she wasn't all that scared. There was something comforting about the way he looked at her, as if he were in total control of a world only he could see. She felt his grip slacken, and he pulled himself closer to her, and looked down, their eyes still locked to each other.


She didn't know what possessed her. Maybe it was that all she had to look forward to once she got off vacation was her boring desk job in a faltering Spanish conglomerate. Maybe it was the heat of the day, or something she'd drank earlier. Maybe she just had a little of that insanity inside of her, all along.


But she said it, nonetheless.


""Yes. I do, if you do.""


His eyes lit up, like a child's. ""Then cast away what you know, and reach for a new world!,"" he boomed.


There was a sudden hush from the hall, and she looked behind them. The attendants had all stopped leading their crowds, and turned in unison to stare at her and the man instead. The crowd stood, uncertain and confused, at the unnerving sight.


There was a moment where they all just stared at each other. Then, all hell broke loose.


All of the Attendants started approaching them. Their movements seemed off, and their limbs jerked around wildly like those of a wind-up doll. They pushed through the crowds, and people were shoved aside and trampled as others backed up, at first, and then began to flee from the scene. There were ten, maybe fifteen of them, looking dead-eyed, their expressions twisted up into the horrible visage of a long-dead homunculus.


The man spun around and spread his arms out, as if to protect her from the abominations. He drew -- was that a paintbrush? -- from his coat, and threw off his attendant's cap, exposing his dark, combed-back hair.


""Reach!,"" he yelled, over the din, ""reach for a new world!""


She took one look at the scene and at the weird monstrosities that approached her, and made her decision. She reached out and touched the painting, and was whisked away from the St. Petersburg, Florida museum, never again to return.",_sebbot

""I'm afraid I don't quite understand sir."" I finally say, conjuring up the words after a long think.

""Ah, so I believe it is safe to assume that you are not a acquainted Mr. Coulombe's work?"" 

""I can't say I have heard of this Mr. Coulombe before. And I see myself quite the art fanatic.""

The attendant just smiles, ""Ah, well Mr. Coulombe was man who fancied himself as an expressionist in the hypnotic forms of stroke Miss. A man whose art literally pulled you into it. A beaten boy for Versaille, he ran away from his abusive home at the age of six to paint on trees. The man was said to hypnotize animals to stand for days on end, just so he could paint them on a slab of bark. It is also rumored those who ended up touching his enthralling artwork were transported into Mr. Coulombe's mind and sought themselves in insanity from the pure intellectual artistic genius."" 

""Interesting. Does this 'Mr. Coulombe' have a first name?"" 

He just scoffs, ""It is not known if the 'Mr. Coulombe' was a character of his insanity or his actual personality. The man was scantily seen in public, a man of literal mystery."" 

""Well, I believe I can safely consider myself enthralled in his work."" 

""The art will do that to you miss. So, next time, please read the signs, we wouldn't want to lose you."" 

So, with that information, I thanked the attendant, and carefully waited until he had left. And touched the painting.",Nikorak

---------------------------
The Louvre is home to many beautiful paintings. More than a thousand works of art sit within its walls preserved for years to come for the sake of all those who come here to witness their magnificence. Despite this, every day, year after year those who visit the Louvre come with the intent of seeing a small, dark, slowly fading portrait of a woman who neither frowns nor smiles; the Mona Lisa of Leonardo Davinci. 

I do not believe the Mona Lisa to be a poor painting. Rather, I think it to be worthy of much less praise than it receives. People come from countries around to pull out their phone and pile in between each other to catch a glimpse of the portrait and perhaps get a selfie with the Mona Lisa herself. When Davinci painted her he did so expertly, with all the grace he could muster. Truly, it is one of his greatest works. But in comparison to other works of art in the Louvre it pales in comparison. 

Directly behind the Mona Lisa sits the Wedding of Cana, created by Paulo Veronese. It is a depiction of a scene from the bible by the very same name. In that scene, Jesus comes with his disciples to the city of Cana to perform the miracle of making wine from water. He did it to make believers out of the nonbelievers. He did it to change the world.

The painting is truly amazing. It is large enough that it covers the entire wall it has been placed on. The painting is of a large feast at a table filled to the brim with guests. Behind them is a small wall upon which you can see what look like commoners crowding, no doubt excited to see the man that would call himself the Messiah. At the bottom of the painting you can see an assortment of animals littering the floor; cats, chickens, dogs, all move freely about the feast with no one to stop them. You can see people moving to fill jugs with wine and in the center sit the minstrels playing their instruments with the entertainment of their guests in mind. 

Sitting directly behind them, at the head of the table, is Jesus Christ himself. He does not look at the others in the painting but rather directly forwards, towards the person looking at the painting. It almost seems as if he is looking at you, knowing that you're there, waiting for you to do something. 

This is my favorite piece in the Louvre. The effort that must have gone into painting this goliath of an artwork piece must have been momentous and despite that it goes unappreciated. The Wedding of Cana will never be loved in the same way the expressionless woman that sits across from it is. This is one of the things I like about the painting. Because no one here gathers for it in the same way they gather for the Mona Lisa, I know that my love of it is my own, untainted by the opinions of others. I do not love the Wedding of Cana because I heard about it in my history book or spoken highly of in my art classes. I love it because it is beautiful.

On some days, days when no one is looking at it and the Mona Lisa's crowd grows thick, the Wedding of Cana almost looks sad. It remains the same as it is every other day, no changes have been made to it. And yet... I feel the need to give it comfort as if it were a living being. On those days I reach towards it, not to touch it, but to hold my hand in front of it. If the painting truly is a human being, then I would feel the heat coming off of it as I would feel the heat coming off of another person's body. 

Behind me, I can hear a man clearing his throat by coughing loudly twice. I turn around to see an older gentleman in a plaid security outfit. He walks towards me and gently touches my hand. 

""Mam, it is museam policy that you not touch the artwork."" He said to me sternly.

I quickly lower my hand, embarrassed of what I hadn't realized I looked like.

""I'm sorry, I wasn't..."" 

""I understand the paintings can look very lifelike at times. Some people want to reach out and try to fall into them. But we want you to stay in this world, alright?""

I laughed at little at his joke. His face remained serious and unchanging. 

""Of... course..."" I said slowly, my voice trailing off a bit at the end. 

They must be really trying to crack down on their policies as of late. I can't blame them for it. It can't be cheap maintaining all of these paintings as it already is. Every time a touchy tourist pokes something it probably costs them another five grand to renovate it. His sternness is understandable. 

I turn away from him and return to my appreciation of the Wedding of Cana. Every time I look at it I see something new. Today I see a small dog looking down upon the wedding from the left balcony. It almost looks freshly painted. Perhaps I'm mistaken, it could just be a piece of the architecture instead of a dog. 

I never get the chance to think about it as my train of thought is interrupted by a ear piercing shriek. I fly around and see a man standing next to the creatively named Portrait of a Man wait his palm places squarely on the face of the man. He seems to be pushing against the painting as if he's stuck. A closer examination reveals that his hand is slowly being coated by small, black, tendrils, which are quickly growing longer. 

Two other men stand behind him and start to pull on his back in an attempt to get him dislodged from the painting. The tendrils continue to creep up his arm, their speed increasing exponentially. They've reached his chest now and are starting to expand to the rest of his body. 

Tourists are now beginning to run away from the gallery. Where previously the crowd couldn't get close enough to the Mona Lisa, now they couldn't get away from it fast enough. Their screams and stomping footsteps echoed through the Louvre until it became an almost constant noise, like static on a television. 

One of the men lets go before the black ooze can make contact with him. The tendrils reach the second man but do not spread to him. They seem only concerned with the one who has attacked the Portrait of a Man. Seeing his efforts are of no use, the second man lets go and surrenders the man to the tendrils.

All the while, the man squirms and pulls at his attacker, yelling in horror and crying out for help. None of the bystanders are willing to try. I am not capable of trying. Slowly, his screaming mouth is coated in the ooze and his yells become muffled until eventually they stop. 

The man is now nothing more than a black blob sitting in the middle of an art gallery. It then begins to contract and contort itself into a smaller form. A soft crunching noise that I can only assume is that of bones breaking can be heard, but only if you listen. I grind my teeth and look downward, trying to shield myself from what stands before me. I could try to follow the crowd and run away from the gallery, but I sense that the ungodly sight of me would be over before I could wade through the crowd and exit the room. 

When the sound of crunching stops, I look up to see the ooze pulling itself back into the painting. It slowly seeps back into the canvas and disappears into nothing, as if it had never been there in the first place. 

Slowly, myself and others approach the painting to see what became of it. The Portrait of a Man remains mostly the same as it was before with one small exception. Behind the man's left shoulder, if you look closely enough you can see the outline of another figure. He looks towards you in the same way the Man does, in the same way that Jesus of the Wedding of Cana does. Straight at you, as if he knows you're there.

The security guard walked over to look at the painting with us. Cautiously he reaches out and picks it up carefully by the sides of the frame. 

""Okay folks, nothing more to see here. This painting just needs a bit of renovation. If you wanna talk to somebody, talk to the front desk. They'll... get you free visitor's passes or something.""

He walked through the halls with the painting in hand, taking the opposite route of the rabid visitors swiftly fleeing the halls of the Louvre. Meanwhile I stood where the portrait used to be, staring at the empty space he had left in disbelief. 

I look back at the Wedding of Cana, at Jesus and his unblinking eyes. My gaze returns to the dog at the top of the painting. I think I'm right. It does look fresher than the rest of the painting.",DrSoaryn

[IP] Lord of the Lies,MrCool87867,"He was supposed to be a myth, an urban legend, what you tell your kids to get them to behave.  He was created with lies.  

He was cultivated by the belief, nourished by the fear, and transcended through the practice.  He knows no discrimination.  Through his eyes, those deep, vicious, malevolent eyes, he sees only thing, your true being.  After all, you need to know the truth in order to twist it.  The reason I know this is because he once lied to me, he told me I was dead.

I wasn't a bad person I'd say.  I treated others with respect, never cheated on any of my girlfriends, I even went Bible Camp as a kid.  But I now realize the true reason why I went where I did.  All of my actions were dictated by fear.  I did everything because of what would happen if I didn't, not because I should.  

No one remembers dying, those who've experienced what I have will describe a flash of light, watching their entire lives unfold, some even claim they've met God.  I like to believe them, because everything has to have an opposite right? Yin and Yang, hot and cold, positive and negative.  I need to believe them, because I know I met the Devil.

It began with a soft, hazy darkness. Until he blurred into view.  He sat tall and still with his hands folded in his lap, exactly like a statue.  He was mounted on top of his pedestal, carried by an endless sea of fallen believers, eager to move forward and have the honor of supporting him.  He had the head of a ram that looked beaten, cold, and malnourished.  In between his bleeding horns was an eternal flame and that was kept alive by the infidelity of man.  It shimmered bright, leading the way for any lost souls.  His eyes flared with a shuddering darkness, peering into my bare-being.  The sea of broken spirits around held up flags and banners depicting his symbol, drawn in their own blood for loyalty. 

Every biblical reference was there, not because that's what he actually looked like, but because those references are what shaped him.

His voice, that fucking voice, will haunt until the day I die again.  It was calm, deep, and almost comforting.  If it wasn't for my surroundings, I would have thought I was speaking to my father.  

""Thank you."" He said, his lips staying still.

It took me a while to at least try to understand what was happening.  ""For what?""  Was the only question I was able to muster.

""All of the thought you've given me.  It's the greatest gift one could receive."" 

Once you see the devil, no one needs to tell you he's the devil.  You recognize out of instinct.  I was in Hell.

""Why am I here?"" I whispered.

""You are dead."" he said.  ""You're thoughts and intentions have sealed your resting place.  Like the many you see before you.""

My heart churned at the thought of joining those hideous skeletons in their mob of reverence.  I would have cried if I was capable.  ""No.  This isn't me.  I have nothing in common with these demons.""

He softly, gave out a faint chuckle.  ""It is clear to me.  Why do you lie to yourself?""

""I don't belong here!"" I screamed, almost shaking.

""It is too late."" He put his arms to his side, held up is right hand, and closed his little and ring finger.  ""You have been condemned on your own accord.  All the life you've lived above has brought you here.  You cannot escape fate.""

Just then, the white fog in the darkness began to brighten, and then began to blind me.  I heard a faint ringing in my ear and pressure on my chest.  I heard a muffled voice counting.  And all of the sudden I coughed.  A burst of water sprayed from my mouth onto the sand and I was panting.  Above me peered a life-guard in red. ""We almost lost you there!""  He said with excitement.

To this day I don't know if he lied to me, I do believe I can escape my fate of being damned in that wretched place. But the thing is, I can't stop thinking about it.

[IP] Lord of the Lies,MrCool87867,"Lines of cultists shuffled slowly into a damp cavern, hidden among the jagged peaks and crevices of a New England cove. The salty breeze howled as it shifted into the extensive cave, clashing with the deep chants and mantras of the fanatics. The ritual chamber was filled with crimson candles and demonic runes, after several months of laborious preparation, and here they would summon a new age in human history. Before long, the chants ceased and the heretics began kneeling around a summoning circle etched in the damp stone. With a few words and a virgin sacrifice, the floor in the center began to crumble leaving a gaping black hole that seemed to fall into the depths on the abyss. From it rose a terrifying creature possessing the visage of an infernal goat, who was followed by moaning and withering undead servants. ""WHO DARE SUMMON ME?"" its booming voice rang. A cultist stepped forward meekly, before clearing his throat and speaking ""Our lord! We have summoned you to this earthly realm to bring about a new age of chaos and destruction upon our kind! Are you pleased with our sacrifice?"" The Lord of Lies turned to the small man with the crazed look of wrath before whispering ""No."" The cultists felt the weight of the growing dread in the room. ""My lord! We did everything as you asked! Is there something you are missing?"" they asked. The goat of evil incarnate looked to the side, and thought for a second before answering ""Yes!"" The cultists cowered before it. ""What more can we sacrifice? Must we give our own lives for you?"" The goat snorted, before promptly replying ""Yes!"" Cries echoed through the chamber. ""And afterwards, will you have the power to take over this mortal world?"" they asked. ""No."" the demon answered. ""Then what else must we do?"" The goat was caught off-guard, a simple yes-or-no answer was not allowable. ""I... REQUIRE SOMETHING MORE."" he answered. ""Are you not all-powerful, my lord?"" the cultists pleaded. The goat blushed, before answering ""NO!"" The cultists were clearly disappointed. ""Well, can't you spew fire? Or bring mass destruction?"" The newly-summoned demon glared daggers at the cultists, internally pleading them to catch on. ""NO, I CANNOT!"" he yelled. The group mumbled among themselves, before coming to a unanimous decision and erasing the summoning circle. ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"" ""No offense, our lord, but we were very pent on world domination. Craig's credit score is rock-bottom with all the loans we needed for all the material components. We might as well just not waste them and summon someone who can get the job done.""

She told her some people believed they would understand what their purpose had been in an afterlife; others, that we simply remain decaying organic matter and that’s that.  

Back then, it was the health of the body that determined the moment of cessation of life as we know it.  Some people might feel a calling to do, or be, different things.  Artists, fighters, researchers, politicians, businessmen, soldiers, dreamers, lovers.  Still, most of them were just trying to get through the day.  And ultimately, even for those who claimed to live their fullest life, one’s true, individual purpose remained an enigma.

That was before the changes.  

Ana did envy those primitive folks, in a way.  Perhaps in their slavery to organic biology, there lay an unexplainable freedom.

Mother told her these things when she still had her baby teeth.  Mother would gently brush Ana’s shock of soft red hair and tell stories of the old times.  

But now Mother was long gone.  Everyone was—brothers, cousins, sisters, her dear husband.  Everyone Ana ever loved went away.

**********

“Ms. Ana!  Please let me in.  It’s urgent.”

“Come in, Jacob.”  The thin man stepped into Ana’s office and briefly bowed.  

“Good morning, Jacob.  May I ask what the occasion is?  I was just taking tea.  Another candidate for a scientific paper on my *fascinating* abnormalities?”   Ana said drily as she raised her eyebrows and ran a hand through her still red hair.

“I apologize, Ms. Ana, but no.  In fact, it is the Prime Minister’s office.  He’s asked you to come in to his office at once.”

“The Prime Minster?  Again?  Well I suppose I shouldn’t be too surprised.  Well, tell them we’ll be on our way then!  Let’s go.  Bring my tea.”

***********

Ana stepped into the mansion from a dull drizzle outside, which appeared so modest from the street, with Jacob slightly behind her, keeping a respectful distance while still close enough to protect her from any disturbances.  Two men in suits led them down a marble hallway, and opened the doors into a spacious, carpeted room with a large oak desk with two armchairs facing it.

The Prime Minister was a man of medium height, slate gray hair, with an angular face and deep set eyes.  He had put on a small amount of weight as he reached his 90s, traditionally seen as “middle-aged,” but it rendered him more approachable than in his youth.

“Ms. Benson, please, sit down.”  Ana took one of the plush blue armchairs.  She nodded to Jacob, who bowed and stepped out of the room.  Ana heard locks turn and seals close.  

“Good to see you again Ms. Benson.  I wish this was a more social occasion, but I am afraid the situation is quite dire.”

“With all due respect, Mr. Prime Minister, I’ve lived through a number of such situations, so you’ll forgive me if my perspective on them is less…concerned, than yours might be.”

“Which of course, is exactly why I want you here.  Look, I’ll get right to it.  What I have in my hand”—he motioned to a thick stack of papers—“is a proposal.  A proposal to stop the escalations that have been happening.  To stop the constant threat of annihilation they’ve been throwing at us.”  The P.M was sweating, and looked like he hadn’t slept in some time.

“So what are the terms?”

“There aren’t any.  They just want to call a truce.   It seems Mr. Phan’s people have had about enough.  The unrest is much worse than we though.”

“You think it might be a bluff.”

“Of course.  That is the first thing we thought.  But my agents think there is also a chance this is real.  So you see my dilemma.”

“Mr. Prime Minister, I want to help you, but surely I am the last person you should be asking for advice on your true purpose in this situation.”  Ana was tired and wanted to go back to her tea.  Couldn’t this nuclear escalation take care of itself like it always did?  

“Ms. Benson, if this is a true call for truce, and I don’t sign it, it will mean the death of millions.  But if it’s a bluff, and I do sign it well, millions will die as well.  What should I do?  Can’t you see the gravity here?  I cannot have that on my conscience—I couldn’t live with—well, if I did live that is—please, Ana, someone with your wisdom surely can know better than I!”

Ana looked at the man.  She felt pity for his fear; the same kind of pity she felt for most everyone these days.  It was the fear they carried caused by a short life, one without perspective, one in which every crisis had eternal consequence.  She decided to tell him about her thoughts.  The ones she wasn’t supposed to have, that she never shared, except in the occasional hint in conversations with Jacob, who was far too respectful to ever question what she meant.
 
“Just do whatever you want.”

The P.M.’s eyes grew wide and his jaw slackened, unable to find words for a moment.

“Sorry?  What does what I want have anything to do with this?” He asked.

“Don’t you think it’s kind of funny, sir, that one man like you, or like Mr. Phan, could have so much power over others’ lives?  Don’t you think that’s a bit odd, in a world where everyone lives their true certain purpose without a doubt, that millions of lives could be snuffed out in a moment by a simple flick of a wrist?  Surely that would be a phenomenon—I can see the headline now—‘Millions of souls fulfill their true purpose at the same moment!’”

Ana couldn’t stop once she had started expressing what she hadn’t for centuries.

“What would their purpose be?  To have lived a humdrum daily life?  To die at the political whim of a conflicting nation?  And if you or Mr. Phan did cause their death,” Ana said, “wouldn’t that make you the arbiter of their purpose?”  She took a deep breath.  “Would that not make you gods?”

The Prime Minster’s eyebrows were raised but he hid all other signs of surprise.

“I had…considered some of these…angles, but did not think they were significant enough to mention in this context.”

“Well, I have lived a long time.  Today is my 1000th birthday, which nobody seems to have remembered.  And I am telling you, none of it makes sense anyway, and you’re destined to fulfill your true purpose and so is Mr. Phan and so are all the innocent civilians here and that is why I say to do whatever you feel like.  It might be the only freedom you ever get.  Now, if you don’t mind, I am going to take tea and have a slice of cake in my study, as it is my birthday after all.”  Ana stepped out of the chair, gave the P.M. a respectful nod, and stepped out of the room.

Jacob was waiting, and they began the long walk down the marble hallway.  About halfway there, there was a muffled thud, followed by squeaky, running footsteps.   Ana turned just in time to see two men in suits carrying the Prime Minister’s lifeless body.

Whatever his purpose was, Ana thought, he seems to have done it.  I wonder if I had anything to do with that?  

*****************

Later that afternoon, Ana snuck past Jacob’s incessant thoughtfulness to sneak out of the house to pick up a pint of milk, a slice of her favorite cake from Gallatin’s, and some more food for Petite Pois, the cat.  

The moment she stepped out into the overcast day she was blinded by a thousand cameras and a sea of reporters.  “Ms. Benson!”  They all shouted.  “What did you say to the Prime Minister before he passed away?”  “Did he tell you he was going to do it?”  “Did he say anything about—“ The words blurred together into a surreal montage as she felt something cold and hard clamp down on her wrists—handcuffs.  She felt them lock just as her stomach dropped.   Two men in long gray peacoat and gray hats skillfully pushed her into a stone alcove away from the road and the crowd
 “Some birthday this is,” she huffed as she tried to resist 

“If you’ll please come with us, Ms. Benson,” they said as they pushed her into a waiting black car.

"[WP] Everyone is born with a finite amount of luck. You can allow it to naturally deplete as you age, or you can spend it all in one earth-shattering BLAZE OF GLORY!",SleepyLoner,"We have a saying out here in the fifth division- ""At least I'm not Jim."" It was anyone's guess why he still served in our platoon. He was useless in combat. Every time, his gun would jam, or the ammo would be no good. Once, there wasn't even ammo in it. We tried to help the poor guy out a few times, but it didn't work. Terry brought a bottle of grape juice on our two mile since he figured Jim's bottle would leak again. Well, it did, but it turned out Jim was allergic to grapes, and he spent the rest of the day looking like an agitated pufferfish. 

Some of us have tried to get Jim to tell us what he spent all his luck on, to no avail. He'd always shake his head, as if it were a secret, or maybe a source of shame. And then he'd trip over his shoelaces and faceplant in the dirt. 

I've had to press my luck a few times. A bit extra, to land a bullet in a blizzard. A lot extra, to run through enemy fire and get a wounded Terry back to cover. To salvage some food and working ammo from week-old corpses in the rain. I always figured I'd die before my luck ran out. And I'd end up like Jim. But I'd probably retire. 

At least, I figured that, until today. Some bad info landed us in an abandoned building. The Russians are closing in. They've rigged the exits and outnumber us seven to one. Terry's crying in the corner, and I'm just wondering if I have enough luck left to find a strong drink. I guess we had a good run. About what I'd expected. 

Jim's grabbed his rifle now, and headed for the entrance with a dangerous look in his eyes. Guess he wants to die on his feet. Die like a hero. It's strange, though. In that walk down the crumbling stairs, through the gunfire and explosions, he didn't stumble even once.

"[WP] Everyone is born with a finite amount of luck. You can allow it to naturally deplete as you age, or you can spend it all in one earth-shattering BLAZE OF GLORY!",SleepyLoner,"The bell echoed from within the school hall, sending the students previously seated quietly at their desks scattering from the classroom in a flurry of rustling paper and ringing laughter. It was rare to see a classroom of thirty sixteen-year-olds fall completely silent, but Ms Jefferson was used to it. They always did in her class. She recalled her time spent in health class only just over half a decade ago, learning about drugs, relationships and, of course, luck, a resource dangerously available to every person on the planet. Her classmates had been enraptured by the discussion of a topic strictly taboo to them; as they neared the age where they could legally control their flow of luck it was decided they had to be educated on its merits, and its dangers. That days lesson had been covering the historical instances of those who went ""all in"", releasing their luck, not in the usual ebbing flow that gently upholds the lives of most in pleasant normality, instead thrusting it forward in a tidal wave of good fortune, spending it in hours, minutes or even glorious seconds. She'd never seen it in person, of course, but Youtube provided a multitude of videos which all began with a disclaimer warning against replicating such a drastic action. Despite her age, she still found the idea oddly tantalising.

Though she had never seen the immediate outcome of releasing ones luck in that single burst, she'd witnessed its later effects firsthand. One of the most notable cases being a student of hers only a year back, Jason. He had been bullied for years. There wasn't much she could do, the entire class seemed to turn on him in an instant. It was a sad case of a child being singled out by his classmates for being a little different in his love of reading and literature. One day, several particularly cruel students cornered him after school had ended, thinking he could do nothing to hurt them in return as they jeered and kicked and punched. Then, perhaps out of desperation or perhaps out of concentrated anger, Jason did the unthinkable. At fifteen years old, he released his luck in its full force, draining himself in the process. From the accounts she had heard, his revenge had been highly successful. One bully had tripped over a tiny pebble, which would usually be inconsequential, if only he hadn't impacted a nearby metal bench, knocking loose four of his front teeth completely. 

At this point, realising what he had done, Jason tore a tiny piece of paper from the corner of the book he had been clutching and threw it toward another boy. It was caught in a sudden gust of wind on an otherwise calm day, being flung toward his antagonisers face and causing him to step backward in surprise. The boy's hand had been caught on his belt buckle, making it come loose and fall to his ankles, alongside his shorts. It just so happened that the schools cheerleading squad was passing in the minibus to travel to a competition, leaving the bully scrabbling to pull his shorts back up. The final boy turned to run but didn't spot the young gosling nearby, running dangerously close to it before finding himself chased by it's protective mother-goose almost across the entire school as other students witnessed his fate with giggles and pointing.

Jason was in shock, but had formed a plan within minutes. His luck was running out, he knew as much, so he turned and ran. Apparently, the wind had picked up behind him, pushing him forward. He stumbled once or twice but always found his balance and, as he seemed to be expecting, discovered a plenitude of coins and bills amidst the paving cracks, dropped and forgotten by others with worse luck than he. Eventually, he reached the local convenience store only a few minutes before it closed. The cashier was so preoccupied with her iPhone, she barely noticed the age of the school uniform clad boy as he purchased a lottery ticket and immediately scratched away the grey boxes obscuring what he knew would appear, just as long as he could hold on to the small remainder of his luck for a few minutes longer. Three symbols were revealed, all read ""$1,000,000 JACKPOT!!!"". 

Her smile faded as she remembered the ending to poor Jason's story. He had barely lived the beginning of his life before his luck was gone, leaving him stranded and helpless. He had claimed the money, it left his parents able to leave their jobs full time to support him after his decision. Alas, it was no use. After seven dangerous and rare diseases and conditions with few known cures and twelve incredibly close calls with injury, Jason passed when a seemingly impossible fire rose within his home, engulfing it within seconds. Apparently the insulation had been faulting, acting like tinder and allowing the flames to spread incredibly quickly.

Her mood had gone from triumphant to sombre. There were no happy endings to those who were so reckless, she had to remember that. Every human was born with a temptation, one that called to all of them endlessly since the day they learn of its presence. She had to stop herself from answering that call, and she had to prevent her dear students from wasting their lives on a single moment of ecstasy. She scribbled a reminder to discuss the story during class, glancing sadly about the empty classroom. She just hoped she wouldn't have a different story to tell in a few years.",toomanyeels

I mean that, really. She's the one with the gold shoes over there. 

I wouldnt stare too long, she has a sense for that kind of thing. Trust me, you don't want her to glance your way. 

She won't like the company you keep. 

See we had a thing, her and I, about oh 20 years ago I think when we first crossed paths. I was playing piano at this very place. Back then it was a bit smaller you see, and back there used to be a lounge. I would play as people gambled and drank. Getting high on sin and risking it a on one big shot, and coming down hard when lands on red. 

I tried to play tunes to even it out a bit, you know? Like the lounge was a place to cool off and think a bit as well as a place to lift your spirits with some spirits after Lady luck broke your heart. 

She broke a lot of hearts, I can tell you that. She liked to come in and take a seat to check out her handy work. Sipping her Sherry with a cigarette and a smile. Christ, that smile was beautiful though. 

I played a song for her, one that she know was for her. She noticed.

It was a short affair. Firey an hot, much to hot to last. Doubly so in my case. I was 25 and didn't know better, and she was an ageless personification of coincidence. Doomed from the start.

It was worth it though, that one night the world was ours. Everything went right. If something had any uncertainty its benefits were tipped in my favor. It was a poor pianists dream! I got enough tips to last me a year, met my current boss in my way to the bathroom, got girls numbers but I knew what girl I wanted. 

Yeah, I got her too. Oh it was divine. 

She was gone the next day and with her, well, so did my luck. 

Not to say I had bad luck, no. I just don't have any luck. If I find myself in dire straights there is no saving grace. No windfalls or surprising coincidences. No, from that night on I learned the world was never going to help me out again, and had to make my own luck. 

It's not the best, but life looses a bit of a spark when your luck runs out. 

Anyway, you have a good night kid, and hey, break a leg up there will ya? ",ProbablyInebriated

"[WP] You stand at a crossroad. One path is lined with dead trees, an ominous thunderstorm, and a talking raven who warns of certain death. The other path is filled with marshmallows.",SleepyLoner,"Miles and miles I'd walked and walked  
when the old familiar road just--forked.  
Upon the left and sinister side  
all joy seemed to have gone and died:  
dead oaks bestrew the avenue,  
the darkling sky flashed white and blue  
and from a signpost black and gnawed  
a scraggly raven, landing, cawed:  
'The traveller with not a fear  
still hastens not to walk down here;  
the fields are gone, the rain is cold;  
you'll find neither love nor gold  
and every monster you can construe  
will scare the fingers off of you;  
Traveller!'--he'd have called all night  
but I'd swerved already to the right.  
This path was paved with gummy bears  
and tree tops dangled angel hairs;  
where the left path's fields stood fallow  
the right's wore butter and marshmallow.  
It seemed a pretty certain choice  
but in my head a nagging voice  
began to caw, to nag and sap  
at my resolve, said: 'It's a trap!'  
Then pausing on the sugar track  
I turned my head and went right back.  
Perhaps the right was what it seemed,  
a world such as could not be dreamed  
but in the miles and miles I've walked  
I've never heard a man who talked  
of such a world of sweet surprise.  
From which facts I can surmise:  
that none return, that all there die.  
The only thing I cannot know  
is if it's quick, or good and slow--  
Against knowing I'd not return  
I'll set whatever hells may burn!  
I took the left, what'll be will be;  
for they are braver men than me  
not to leave the sweet and warm  
to cock their hat against a storm.",WideEyedPup
"[WP] You stand at a crossroad. One path is lined with dead trees, an ominous thunderstorm, and a talking raven who warns of certain death. The other path is filled with marshmallows.",SleepyLoner,"A the end of a long dusty road there lay a crossroad, down one path the sky was dark lit only by sudden flashes of lightning. To either side of this path was nothing but death, dead grass brown amd limp, dead trees bent and withered, and a smell that hinted at other dead things just out of sight in the undergrowth.

Down the other the sun hung full in the sky like a ripe orange so bright you had to shield your eyes just to look at the ground. A ground covered in marshmallows thousands if not millions of them coverering the path, shin height to a man, chest height to another much shorter man. Alongside this Marshmallow river ran tall strong trees unmistakably alive and not dead at all like those other trees. From this path wafted the sweet sweet smell of sugar, this scent mixed with the scent of the other path to form a smell much worse than the sum of its parts.

At the end of a long dusty stood an old man bent with age and withered by regret, he resembled nothing more than one of the dead trees that stood like skeletal hands reaching to the sky on his left. Beside this old man stood a small dog white and fluffy, he resembled nothing more than a marshmallow like the ones he was straining against his lead in a desire to consume.  These two stood at the end of said long dusty road previously mentioned, squirming with all of the potential of a possibly dead cat inside a box.

A kaw split the air louder even than the thunder that rolled down one of the paths, you should know which if you've been paying attention. Man and dog turned to look at the louder than ordinary kaw  to see a larger than ordinary bird, a raven that any who saw would think it had come to portend their death. 

Which it did.

The bird stood on the branch of the nearest skeletal hand/ tree thing and spoke. ""You will die"" it called to man and dog. The dog barked, not a talker you see, the man grunted, just surly.  ""If you follow the path you will die"" it screeched in an annoying nassaly bird voice, think of an emo parrot. Man and dog stood on silent for a beat as thunder filled in with its own rumbling not understood by any present save perhaps the bird.

""Which path?"" wheezed the old man in an old man sort of voice. ""Both"" retorted the bird ""you must stay here, for both paths lead to your death"".  ""So will staying here."" He said in his wheezy old man voice, probably a smoker. ""You stand at the cross roads of destiny, your fate will be decided by the path you choose. Before the choice is made you have no destiny and so Death is blind to you until the choice is made.""

The old man bent to pet his dog ""What a stupid bird"" he said conversationally ""If you eat too many marshmallows you will get fat so I will have to pick you up, but I will let you eat a couple first.""

The pair strode off into the marshmallows, they came up to the old man's shins and up to the dogs chest. The dog happily chewed away.",worldsonwords

The other path is filled with marshmallows.",SleepyLoner,"“Marshmallows? This is just ridiculous.” Jenna rolled her eyes at the raven screeching about impending doom. “Of course death is certain if I go that way. I have diabetes. Geez.”

Looking at her brother, she gestured towards the other path. The one with the annoying raven who wouldn’t shut up. “We have to go this way. I forgot to bring my insulin. Let’s hope that this bird gets hit by lightning. Mom’s going to kill us if we’re late for dinner, and we wouldn’t even be lost if it wasn’t for you.”

Chris sighed. Jenna was always so dramatic, everything was doom and gloom and death. It wasn’t his fault the car broke down and she decided they’d take a shortcut through the woods. It also wasn’t his fault that they didn’t have cell reception out here. Verizon’s networked sucked, but the family plan was cheap and his parents wouldn’t switch carriers.

Trudging down the path into a forest of dead trees, he wondered about the raven. How did it learn to talk? It was probably just one of the new types of drones available. As the holidays got closer, the drone companies had ramped up their viral marketing campaigns, each one trying to outdo the others with outrageous pranks. Well, that would explain the abundance of marshmallows on the other path.

As they got deeper into the woods, the raven’s warnings ceased. Jenna glanced back and saw it sitting in the same tree, watching them go. She sighed, looked up at the storm clouds, and pulled her jacket tighter. Chris had put headphones in, and she did the same. Taylor Swift’s *Shake It Off* helped take the edge off her irritation. They kept walking together, although each walked to their own beat.

Neither heard the raven fly between trees, carefully keeping them in view. Neither heard the second raven, or the third, land overhead, staring at them as they walked. Soon it started to rain, and light rain turned into a downpour. Neither looked up to see an entire flock of ravens following their progress, lightning occasionally reflecting in their eyes. 

They trudged onward, wet and miserable, lost in their own worlds, together but alone.
Several minutes later, Jenna spotted a light through the trees. She grabbed Chris’s arm and pointed. He whooped for joy, because Jenna had found their way home. Making their way quickly through the trees, they ran towards their house. Jenna outpaced Chris, and he was struggling to keep up when she suddenly stopped running and started screaming. When Chris caught up to Jenna, he began screaming too. 

From the dead trees, a flock of ravens watched the two children fall to their knees and scream. The field was littered with bodies, glistening with marshmallow. *The marshmallows were death*, thought Jenna.

The door to the house opened, giving way to the silhouette of a woman wiping her hands with a towel. Jenna and Chris stared at her, their screams silenced, as the woman said with a smile, “you’re late for dinner.”

Emerging from the edge of the woods, their father grinned. “Drone sales are going to be through the roof.”

Lightning forked and struck the earth.  A cold breeze blew in from the left ruffling Alexander’s cloak.  He clasped his sword.

“Who are you foul beast?” he yelled at the bird.

“You will die!” the bird screamed, the sound punctuated by loud thunder.  

Alexander’s journey was at an impasse, a crossroads.  He had followed this path for many days.  Encountering several orcs and dread beasts he had dispatched them handily with his broadsword.  The decision to defend and kill was easy but this one proved challenging, he needed to make the right choice or he would never capture the amulet of Dagon to defeat the Dragon terrorizing his village.

“Who sent you!” Alexander shouted into the storm.

“You. Will. DIE!” the bird’s scream boomed.

Alexander backed away.  He looked to his right.  Pillowy mounds of white marshmallows.  The path was littered with them.  Sun shone on them whereas on his left dark clouds rolled and thundered.  He had come across two roads like this before.  In Aragon these were usually black magic tricks, set up by warlocks and evil witches to capture weary travelers.  Alexander thrust his cloak open and unsheathed his sword.  He laid down the sword between the two paths.  He sat on the ground and grabbed some dried meat from his sack.  As he chewed on the sinews the salty meat rolling in his mouth, he considered his options.

*The obvious choice is the storm.  Marshmallows, that has to be some kind of trap.  But that is no doubt what they want me to think, whoever is behind this sinister plot.  They expect a hero like me to brave the storm.  A lesser man would choose the marshmallows at no hesitation.  Yes, my choice is clear.*

“Foul bird, I am a valiant man, loyal to my clan and family.  I have come from far and wide to obtain the coveted stone of Dagon.  Whoever you are bird, reveal yourself!”


The raven’s black eyes were fixed on Alexander.  It let out a caw, then turned its head and flew off.  As it disappeared out of sight it let out a final screech, “Death!”


Alexander sprang to his feet, grabbing the hilt of his sword.
“Stupid bird!  Or are you witch!  You can’t fool me!” Alexander yelled but there was no one to hear him.  He was bolstering himself up and he knew it.  He wiped the sweat off his brow tucking his long blonde hair back and took a deep drink of water from his leather pouch.


“You can’t fool me...” he muttered as he stepped to his right.  The fluffy matter was surrounding the path tightly, his shoulders squeezing through it.  Feeling claustrophobic with drawn sword he sliced at a large marshmallow to better clear his path.  It split and a sticky goo covered his sword.  He tried wiping it on the dirt path but it clung to the earth.  Struggling against the sword it would not budge.  He drew his dagger and looked back on the path; it was now obscured by more large marshmallows.

“What is this evil!” 

Two man-sized marshmallows began to move towards him.  The white substance parted into giant white fangs.  He thrust the dagger at one but it entangled his hand.  The other entwined his feet and midsection.  He couldn’t move, straining against the goo was futile.

The raven appeared.  It flew overhead and was cawing loudly, sounding like mocking laughter.

As the marshmallows enveloped his whole body Alexander took a large bite.  The substance melted in his mouth.  Delicious.  He began to gorge himself knowing it was his only way of escape.

The easy, straight gently rolling down one and the one one taking you over mountains and precipice, to finally, maybe, only maybe, take you to where you want to go.

This thought stays in my head as I approach this cross road. At first glance, there was no real difference, but it was dark and I was far. 

I am used to travelling by night, with my trusted storm lantern, as I prefer when the paths are empty and more adventurous. 

It may just be my personality, but danger seemed always more attractive than the easy way, if you go straight from point A to point B what story will you be able to tell.

This crossroad then brought an easy choice, a gentle path, apparently coated in marshmallow to make the walk even easier, wasn't the way to go. A voice in my head was quite astonished of this fact, that my conscious brain didn't yet pick up, it was a MARSHMALLOW road. 

My sense of adventure was heightened by the thought, was great delight and wonder could be at the end of such a path? But then, I quickly came to my senses, sort of. Habit, the adventure killer, took possession of my brain.

I was automatically attracted by the other path, the one who was swimming in mud, unrettimingly steep, and who led to what seemed a localised thunderstorm. I was too accustomed to danger. My primitive brain still steered me away from it, but habits took hold. 

I knew it was worse than everything I ever did. I knew the other road was like paradise, and could be exciting a la Hansel and Gretel. But no instinct was strong enough. I started rationalising my poor choices again. And I took the deadly road.

The progression was slow, exhausting. In the dark, all I could see was mud, and rain, except when the occasional lightning brightened the dead trees around me.

I couldn't cope with why I took the road. I thought taking the easy way was unhealthy, always. That takig the alternative was more rewarding, and hardening, that it ultimately was a better choice. But this crossroad was proving me wrong.

Maybe it was my fatigue but the journey seemed boring and morne. A step after another, stuck in a deep mud. Not seeing beyond my arms, even with my powerful light, made me often trip on stones and roots.

I was advancing in some sort of concrete darkness, a heavy invisible fog that was clouding my thinking as well as my vision. I didn't feel welcome in this desolate place.

As I neared the storm, the surroundings were made a bit brighter by the lightnings. But they still had difficulty cutting into this night, just showing me how lugubre the place, I was standing in, really was. 

Is it madness? I am now into the Thunder, starting to wonder about my sanity. It's more than just not safe here, it's deadly, I could smell it, as I could smell the burnt odor from the lightning impacts around me. The weather wasn't getting better. Why do I keep going in the objectively worse options I take?

Those thoughts were to no avail to my steel determination to find what lied at the end of this. I was like possessed by this single mantra. Knowing where it goes, fighting my fears.

The path started to change, it flattened, and become rockier. I was surprised, perhaps saddened by the sudden easier turn this way took. But this odd idea quickly disappeared when it started going very steeply down the hillside. 

I hadn't anticipated this, and tumbled down. My fall was long and painful, for minutes I could feel each bone cracking as I was rolling down the hill. It finally stopped, but not with a cushiony vegetation, with back breaking boulders at the bottom of a ravine. I couldn't feel my body anymore.

I saw a light, which is weird, I thought, because I lost my lantern at the start of my fall. But it wasn't my lantern who was suddenly irradiating the air. The pale halo came from a nearby cave, and it was a peaceful floating light that revived me.

My curiosity was still unsatiable and I was suddenly standing up and running towards the lit entry. I don't if it was my primary brain who took over, or some sort of miracle, but I didn't feel any pain anymore, every problem disappeared. I noticed a guardian at the entry of the cave, and asked him what was the place.

He shoved me inside, and said ""welcome to Hell"".

Feel too much emphasis placed on the name (gets repetitive), perhaps read better from an English perspective (chinhae instead of chin-hae) or invoke more Korean into the story.  

Personally I think 진해 (jin-hae) flows better than 친해 (chin-hae) but I would even reverse it.

""Oh.. you know, just the local one, they had an offer so I thought I'd-"" he mumbled off. His head was swaying, but his eyes were fixed on his tensed fingers all stretched across the home row of his keyboard. Should I keep on? The man did look strong, but he was mentally broken. He sat at his desk in the customer service sector of the office with all the other staff with his hands now up from the keyboard and covering his face. His shoulders were tense, but they started to roll when the sobbing started. It was probably a blessing that he was mostly hidden from his colleagues in his cubicle, however that isolation contributed, I imagine, to what's going on right now anyway. Maybe it was a particularly bad call; customer service is tough, especially at a senior level.

Returning to my desk was pointless, I had to return to Norman immediately. As I walked away, voices, sounds, and images were all floating around in my head; I was floating down the walkway trying to make sense of it all and I bounced off a desk edge and spilled somebody's coffee because of it. I heard clicks and bangs, screams, and saw brushed metal - Norman had a gun, or wanted to have a gun; guns are pretty serious, I felt like a cop circling a reported vehicle as I wound myself around the side of Norman's cubicle.

""Heyyyy..""

""What do you want? Can't you see I'm busy?"" Again, no eye contact.

What was I actually doing? I'm not a damn hostage negotiator; I work in HR and I'm bloody good at it, but how the hell do I stop someone shooting the place up. I can't. I kept my eyes on him and the size, shape and location of the gun were clear in my mind: the man was concealing his gun in a holster on his right hip, a Glock, 9mm, stolen. Then he made a decision.

Frame by frame, mere milliseconds before the action itself, I saw him release the gun from the holster, stand, pivot and point the weapon directly on the back of the head of Dave, his co-worker, who worked behind and opposite him. I released myself and looked outwards, humanly, at the scene before me. Norman's finger stretched past the trigger; he was disciplined, he was well-trained.

""HEY, FUCK-ASS!"" Yelled Norman.

The usual pitter-patter of the office remained, but all voices halted immediately. Nobody moved; not even Dave. 

Guy who raped my wife. ""FUCK-ASS, YEAH, YOU, GUY WHO RAPED MY WIFE."" Being able to read minds isn't so useful when things are happening so fast. Dave slowly turned in his chair like an antique on display. He looked straight ahead and stopped swivelling when his eyes met Norman's. He stood breathing heavily but keeping his hands stabilised, somehow, the barrel now pointing between his target's eyebrows. Bubbling, boiling, all the images and words and everything, everything was swirling around now behind my eyes; too much to ignore. His wife, battered and bruised, crying; the smell of burning from the unattended chicken in the oven; the bedroom torn apart, hatred, and the feelings kept ramping up like the increasing strength of an avalanche. A flipbook of horror was unfurling under my eyelids, a montage worthy of the most dire Oscar. Things were all rolling into one, and Norman's index finger had contracted and began to thread the gap between the trigger and the guard, and I was blinded, and now skin on metal. A child, an innocent little boy.

""SAM!"" I cried.

Norman recoiled physically about half an inch.

""If you fire that gun, you'll never see your son again.""

He opened his palm, the gun swirled and fell from his index finger; the safety was off, but it didn't fire. Norman, immediately followed it, passing out in a lifeless slump against his cubicle and pulling out the power cable to his own computer.

**“Yeah, have you seen our crystal ball?”** I asked him in return whilst flicking through the survey cards that the audience had foolishly filled out prior to show time, “rating the warm up act”.

Mike handed me the crystal ball, it was smooth and shimmered light. I would expect so with it costing so much for ‘authenticity’ I thought as it mocked me. £2000 for a piece of glass, such a waste. I thought.

As both our palms connected from touching the sphere a feeling washed over me, the fear of dread and pain shook me to my core. I could see inside of his mind, like electrons sparking, the images flickering into view and then out again. His black and white figure, knife drawn. As my mind panned out to obtain a better view I could see, my carcass beneath his feet drained of life. With a snap, I came ‘back in the room’ to be confronted by Mike standing unimpressed.

**“Maybe a more shocked face bud if they’re going to think we're legit!”** He chuckled.

I nodded in agreement as I pocketed the survey cards in my red gown pocket and headed hand in hand to the stage with Mike. We took our seats and faced out into the void of the crowd my heart pounded with the revelation of Mike’s mind eye. 

**How can I change his mind, convince him not to kill me, what did I do?** I thought as he introduced our act. 

I decided to contemplate after when there wasn’t a crowd. I took a deep breath and proceed with my cold reading and generic vague statements as did Mike. We finished to an eruption of applause and exited the stage with a bow.  

**“I’m going to head to my room Mike,”** I told him as I headed down to my backstage quarters.

I entered into my room, through the survey cards in the trash and placed the crystal ball neatly on the counter. Passing the room for twenty or so minutes, the solution had become clear.

**“Kill him before he kills me. It’s the only way.”**

 I mumbled whilst searching for my antique combat knife. It was a prop we ordered online a few months back but it turned out to be real, not retractable and I had placed it for safe keeping in till we had the chance to re-sell it. I did eventually find it and headed to his room to save myself. As I swung back his door with force I was surprised to see him standing, ready. Bat in hand, another prop, he swung fast but missed. I ducked him with a shoulder roll and thrust the knife into his neck. It popped on impact, blood dripped down in a tremendous waterfall resemblance. I left the knife in his throat as he fell backwards onto the shag carpet, coating it in red.  When the body hit the floor, his head knocked the table causing a book to plummet down, landing face first on him. I picked it up and realized it was his diary. Recently used, today date. I read today's entry;

_Charles plans to kill me, I saw it when I touched the Crystal ball. I don’t know why but I know he will. I just know. I must kill him before he kills me, it’s the only way._

Load the clip, and the spare. Half of them would be dead before they even knew what was happening.* Jerry thought anxiously as he tussled hair and pretended to examine a TPS report. 

Jerry had been spiraling for months, since his wife left him. Now he regularly came to work hungover or still drunk from the previous night's bender. It wasn't unusual for Jerry to down a glass of gin when he woke up in the morning. And, he had become increasingly aggressive toward his coworkers lately. 

How did I know this? Because I could hear his thoughts. Not just Jerry, but anyone within a twenty yard radius. Ever since I was a child I'd been able to read the minds of those around me. I used to think it was a curse. 

""Hey Jerry. How's it going?"" I asked casually. 

""Fuck off, Robert.""

*I'll put a bullet in your brain first, you nosey bastard.*

Well, this situation had just escalated to the top of my priority list. Those TPS reports would have to wait, or there might not be anyone left to do them. 

""Not cool, Jer."" I said, trying to zero in on his mind. 

I heard people's thoughts whether I wanted to or not, but if I really focused sometimes I could go deeper. As a child I learned pretty quickly not to tell anyone what I was able to do. I also learned how to control it.

""Don't call me ""Jer""! How would you like me to call you Rob?"" Jerry squeaked. 

""Actually, I prefer Rob. Takes me back to my college days."" 

Jerry scoffed. A slew of dark thoughts crossed his mind. He was unhinged. Worse, there was a .22 caliber Beretta in his car. And he was contemplating using it. 

I went to the break room and grabbed two coffees. There was a box of donuts on the table labeled **Accounting**. If this worked I would have to thank them. If not, it was payback for the time Bob in accounting stole my tuna salad sandwich. Bastard. 

I stopped at Jerry's desk and handed him a coffee and a donut. Maple - his favorite. 

""Th-thanks."" Jerry said. His hair was sticking up in little tufts, and he smelled heavily of cheap Cologne and body odor. 

""Welcome. Can I ask you something?"" I looked into his bloodshot, glassy eyes. 

""I guess."" he said and chomped into the donut, getting maple glaze on his chin. 

""Do you ever feel like life is just... pointless?"" 

""What?"" his tone became harsh as he considered my face. A wave of black thoughts swirled in his mind. 

""I don't know. Lately I've been wondering if there's any meaning to it all. Ya know? We sit here and file these reports, but what does any of it *mean*. What's the point?"" 

""Yeah."" he said.

*Does he know? He couldn't know. But is he serious? Maybe he's just fucking with me. If he's fucking with me I'll put a bullet in his skull.* he thought. 

""Sometimes it feels like I'm just going through the motions. I mean, I don't actually *care* about these fucking TPS reports. I don't *care* about paying bills. I just do it. What do you think?"" 

""Life is a meaningless abyss. A dark, empty void where you just get shit on over and over again. That's what I think."" he muttered. He took another solemn bite of the donut. 

""Sounds about right."" I said casually. I was in, he was opening up and his guard was down. Desperately, I began skimming his thoughts. I had to find common ground quickly, or I had just confirmed his intentions. ""But, ya know what?"" 

""What?"" he said through the half-chewed donut. 

""There's this little place on the outskirts of town, it's an adult arcade like Dave &amp; Busters, but there's a bigger variety of games. They serve booze, too. I go there sometimes when I'm feeling like shit.""

*That... sounds okay.* he thought.

""Really?"" 

""Yeah. And there's even a gun range next door. I don't know if you're into that kind of stuff...""

""Yeah!"" he piqued. ""I've got a Beretta in the... at home.""

*Shit. That was close. I almost told him...*

""Well maybe we could go check it out sometime. Hang out, have a few drinks, play some games. Bro shit, ya know?"" I suggested. 

""That... that sounds good. I haven't gone anywhere since..."" 

*My wife left me.*

""In a while. It could be good to get out of the house. Get my mind off things. Are you free after work?"" he asked, his bloodshot eyes full of hope for the first time in months. How could I say no? 

""Today? Yeah, I'll catch you after work."" I said and shot him a smile. I returned to my cubicle and pretended to sip my coffee. 

*Arcade games and drinks! I never noticed but Robert... Rob... is a pretty cool guy.*

I smiled. Fuck, that had been close. 

""Hey, Rob."" Jerry called over the cubicle. 

""Yeah?"" I asked. 

""Thanks."" 

""Hey Jerry, can I talk to you for a sec?"" Martha, our supervisor, called cordially from her office. 

""Sure,"" he said.

The grasses rise with hot - it’s everywhere. Underfoot is dead; all of it is dead except the strips of bright green (little shoots, too) near the edge of the rivers. Little rivers are here and there but they dry up soon (the Faraway God is angry or jealous or maybe he’s sad). The wild beasts bray in the thick growth. I see the wild skins zig zag across the hot dirt and grass with many-toothed snarls and many-hoofed runs that sound like rain against the earth.

Sweat falls from my brow. We all hum in unison. We don’t hum any song we know but we all seem to get along just fine anyways. We’re in the shade of a sharptree with brittle brown leaves. They’re all using rocks and the littlehands are playing jumping games. I’m too old now to play jumping games from rock to river and so they tell me to start sharpening spears for when the sky turns purple and the wild ones are quiet and the night-stalkers and toothed-lurkers come out (orange and yellow cats and little mean lizards near the water’s edge).

A bearded one shouts - Hav is his name - and Hav says I’m doing it wrong.

“Lerra you’re doing it wrong. Stone on wood; wood on stone. Never wood on wood.”

“Yes, yes,” I said (earlier on we said this) but I didn’t listen.

Now when the sun is hottest I run the wood against wood in the shadow of the sharptree. And weird spirits come out. I move fast - very fast - my hands are numb from moving. My head aches from the heat. I will go to the river and scare away the hens and drink soon. But now I cannot stop looking at the spirits, curling curling and talking to me with their white wispy bodies.

“All, all!” I shout to the group of bearded men and unbearded women. And they laugh because they think I’m mad, but I point to the wispy spirit rising (just for a moment enough to blink) from the wood. I tell them there are spirits in the wood. And I touch where the wood was against the wood and it’s hot.

“Angry spirits in the sticks, see?”

I rub the sticks again and they laugh in the shattered shade, but then they see the little spirits coming out. A wind comes by, full of sand and sticks. And a little leaf floats down from up above and touches the wood and then - oh!

“Oh!” I shout! “All, all!”

I can barely breath, but they see - just for a moment, as the wind carries away a burning leaf and it turns into dust on the ground.

I grab more leaves and more and my hands are blistering, but there! Spirits rise from the leaves and within, sacred precious, a little piece of the Faraway God smolders in the dark web of grass and leaves, I breathe (careful) a we all watch, shaking, as fire grows from nothing.

"[WP] a story where the first line and last line are the same, but with two completely different meanings.",magalodon45,"I missed her. 

She was beautiful, but not in a way that required undue effort; she didn't fret over her hair or mascara, but rather her concerns centered around preservation of all things natural -- from the Amazon rainforests to the nests of honey bees to the Sahara desert. 

She wasn't beautiful for her aesthetics. She was beautiful for her passions and desires. She was pure and in that purity, I saw beauty. 

Though we had never met, I knew we would never be. She was as free spirited and wild as the wilds she devoted herself to and I was as strict as my father and his before me. 

The military was no place for free spirits. 

But despite our differences, I loved her the same. Despite having never met face to face, I loved her the same. Despite the starkness of my unrequited love, I loved her the same because she was everything I wasn't. They say you want for what you don't have and she was absence itself. 

I watched her from afar my entire life. I daydreamed about what my life would be like by her side. To be a rebel, to stand up for what you believe in against animosity. To feel and to feel freely when regulation and control was all I've ever known. 

I hadn't seen her or heard of her in months when I reserved my orders; dutifully, I obeyed them and I walked through halls with streaming banners of the Capitol's glory to the lower recesses of our stronghold. Down to where pride and glory faded into gloom and muck, halls where the air was thick with despair and rebels were held without trial or due process. I went down to the stockades to follow my orders. 

I went down to the stockades to retrieve her. 

As I reached her cell, our eyes met for a moment only for hers to flicker away. She wouldn't want to talk to me, anyways. I was a stranger to her. 

A decadent meal sat next to her, untouched. It would remain so as she would not be returning to this place. That, at least, I could take comfort in. 

Wordlessly I fumbled for the keys that could free the love of my life, but would not. Wordlessly I guided the love of my life through the gloom and into the glory of the Capitol, but the air only seemed to grow heavier as we ascended the steps. 

All I could hear was the beating of my own heart. As we exited large, embroidered doors I could see thousands of people but I could not hear them. They were cheering a muted roar; a roar that could not possibly compete with the drumming of my heart. 

Two guards walked forward, taking the girl from me and walking her to a wooden cross across the stage from me. There, they would tie her to the cross and she would be executed. At least it would be a quick death; I had ensured it to be such. 

I walked over to my position directly across from her and unholstered my gun. 

There was only fifteen feet between us.

I raised my gun and took aim. 

But that distance could not be bridged by simply walking forward. Or running, for that matter. Nothing could bridge that gap faster than a speeding bullet. 

I fingered the trigger for a moment -- I couldn't hear or feel anything other than the beating of my heart. 

I looked up at her and I fired. 

I fired. 

And I missed her.

"[WP] a story where the first line and last line are the same, but with two completely different meanings.",magalodon45,"I bit off another chunk of meat.

It was the first thanksgiving dinner that I was hosting after moving in with my boyfriend, Tim. And he absolutely insisted that he made the turkey roast.  I was cynical at first. The only other time he'd cooked anything, it tasted like hardened ash. I still don't know what it was supposed to be. 

This morning I woke up to find a note on the bedside table - ""already started cooking, I'll call you when it's ready!"" I knew better than to check on Tim when he'd specifically told me not to. Still, it made me anxious to leave him unsupervised in the kitchen. Therefore when he finally called me down after about 12 hours of god knows what, I thought it was only prudent to try the roast before any of the guests arrived. Especially because ""the guests"" encompassed my parents.

You see, Tim never really got on well with my family. In fact, he never really got on well with anyone. None of my friends ever really gave him the stamp of approval. And he never liked it when I got drunk with Karen, or appreciated my late night Skype sessions with Dennis. So as Tim and I grew closer, I drifted apart from all of them. 

In our six months together, he'd never spoken to anyone apart from me. He'd lost his family when he was very young, and never really liked any of his foster parents. When I'd ask him about his friends, he'd reply ""you're the only one I need."" That would always make me smile. He was the only one in my world, and I was the only one in his. And this little world was my everything.

My family thought he was a bit odd. They never quite understood how someone as flamboyant and talkative as me fell for such a quiet, almost brooding man. And I don't blame them. All my previous boyfriends were embodiments of fashionistas and celebrities. 

But there was something different about Tim; something about him lured me in. The more my parents criticised him (which happened often, and sometimes in Tim's presence), the more I felt my heart swell. So when he asked me to move in with him, I did. My parents were still getting used to this idea. That their perfect daughter could do something against their wishes. 

So today had to be flawless.

As I chewed on the leg, I marvelled at the size of the turkey. 
""It's really good, babe! But where did you find such a massive turkey? It's not the one I bought yesterday right?"" Tim just smiled and placed the rest of his gigantic roast on the table. It was truly enormous. I enquired again about the turkey but Tim made no reply. I wasn't too worried. He wasn't a very verbose person to begin with, and he's probably still nervous about my family coming over.

I finished the rest of my leg piece and got up to set the table. 
""Where are you going, honey?"" Tim asked. ""Have some more."" I smiled at him and replied,
""We should wait for Mom and Dad."" Tim looked at me inquisitively, almost as if he didn't understand what I was saying.
""But Martha and John are already here...""
I laughed, and started moving towards the kitchen counter. Tim placed his hand on my shoulder and guided me back to the table. In his other hand was a knife he'd picked up from the counter.
""Sit, honey. Eat."" He pushed me into the chair. 
""Tim, you're acting very strange,"" I said, and tried to get up once more, but Tim maintained the pressure on my shoulder.
""Tim, you're hurting me!""
""Eat."" He responded.

I took another bite. It only then occurred to me that it didn't really taste like turkey. No... the meat was different. Tougher. I felt bile at the back of my throat and placed the piece back down on the plate. Tears were starting to well up in my eyes, but I wiped them away quickly, refusing to look weak or scared.

I turned around to face my boyfriend.
""Tim..."" I said softly, trying to control my quivering voice.
""When you said my parents are here... what exactly did you mean?""
Tim smiled at me sickeningly, and caressed the edge of the knife.
""Eat,"" he said once more. I took a sharp breath and looked at him. The man I loved. A monster. I couldn't control the tears anymore, so they flowed freely. Tim wiped them off, all the while smiling.
""Happy thanksgiving my love,"" he whispered in my ear, and offered me another piece.

I bit off another chunk of meat.

The first time he said it had been so sweet, so gentle, our lips only centimeters apart, breathing against each other. Three simple words that had made my heart flutter with joy, my hand tangling itself in his hair as our lips mashed together once more, eager and full of hope.

That had been fifty-three years ago, and now I sat amidst rushing nurses, loud sounds; the smell of hospital antiseptic pungent in the air as I looked around curiously. My chest no longer ached as it had moments before, and my arms which had looked liked crumpled paper, dotted with dark age spots, were now pale and fresh looking once more. 

It wasn't hard to know what had happened, I had died and these poor doctors were left to pick up the pieces, tugging tubes and wires away from me and carefully pulling the edge of my sheet up to cover my head. It was almost surreal.

I stood from the bed, watching as time passed. According to the clock across the room it took only a handful of minutes for the door to fly open, a withered and familiar man stumbling in with the use of a cane. I remembered when we had been making that cane, years ago, originally intended as a hiking stick for the long walks we had once enjoyed in the mountains.

He stumbled to the bed, the object falling from his fingers and his weight settling heavily on his knees as he grabbed at a corner of the sheet, his eyes wet with tears he so rarely shed. His voice quavered as he spoke, as old and withered as we were; as I had been only minutes before.

With that I swore to myself this would be the last time I ever went hunting. 

“Don’t worry next time you’ll get him. Plus, it was only a three point.” Bill said.
 
See my husband and his family are completely obsessed with hunting, I’m from the City. I’ve never hunted before this but I love him so I try. I thought one day I may be able to get it but I’m not. My secret relief that I have not once in the five years of seasonal weekly hunting have I killed one animal is the only thing that keeps me out here. 

“Come on, let’s go in for the day. It’s getting cold and you look frustrated.” He says. 

“Nah, it’s fine a little more you haven’t hit anything today either.”

“Alright, you twisted my arm. But only a little bit it’ll get dark after a while.”

So we sit and wait and sit and wait. An hour, two hours go by. We decide nothing else is moving so we go. 

The sun starts dipping behind the horizon as we walk from the densest part of the woods. Bill pulls out the flashlight we have quite a walk ahead of us. We spend a good portion just walking. It’s one of the best things about Bill. We can just be together. 

“Pretty, right?” says bill. 

“hmm?” I was distracted watching the sky. 

“It’s beautiful right? I love being out here.”

“Yeah me too. Maybe soon we can just camp or something not hunting maybe have a few friends come out. “ none of our other friends hunt. “we could tell stories, and— what the hell was that?”

Rustling comes from the nearby tree line. 

“Did you hear that?” I ask. 

“Oh come on honey you know it’s just you being jumpy. We’ve heard that a million times. “

“ok— hey is that normal?” I point at a bush shaking, my insides squeeze and I’m suddenly feverish. I can feel all of my arm hair call to attention. The bush rattles faster and a fox takes off at near lightning speed running away from us through the clearing. 

“See nothing to worry about.”  

Suddenly a deer launches out of the trees. Then another, then more. 

“You serious?  Where were they an hour ago. WHOA! Look at that one.” Bill said pointing to what I can only describe as the single biggest buck we’ve ever seen. Bill drops to his knee swings his rifle from his shoulder and takes quick aim and fires. Miss. Fires again. Hits his back haunch. Bill takes aim, the buck is far now, he may still hit, I shake his shoulder

“Bill.” I squeak 

“What the hell! I could’ve had him! Did you—“

“Please let’s hurry” I beg. 

“hey hey hey are you ok?” Bill’s face softens with concern.  “Let’s go.”

The bush exploded with a force and an astounding bear now stood where the bush once was. For a moment that lasted a century I stared into its hateful eyes and saw our deaths. The bear’s mouth gaped with ever growing teeth dripping with the telltale foam of rabies. The second it took us both to start running I knew it would be too late. We ran the kind of run that only happens when your end is trailing behind you. As adrenaline pumped through my legs and time slowed down I saw it. The lights of the lodge peeked through the approaching trees and I knew we’d be fine. 

I tripped. 

I tripped like some ridiculous horror movie. How could I have I’ve run a few miles a couple times a week and I’ve never fallen. 

Bill stopped and tried to help me up when he paled and threw me back down. The bear leapt over me hitting my husband with a concussive pound to his chest that sends him twenty feet to the side. I heard the bears growl and looked to see it stalking my prone form. With a deafening crack the bear flinches and spins to see my man with his rifle leveled at the it’s face. When I jump to my feet the bear spins back remembering who it wants, and gets hit with another shot. 

“RUN!” he screams, and I do. With tears streaking down my face, the clicks of the reloading rifle are the last sounds I ever hear from my love. 

I made it to the lodge with blood dripping from my leg where the branch I didn’t see ripped open my thigh. I woke a few days later in the hospital to see my mother-in-law silently crying with her head on my bed. 

So here I’ve sat every season in that same perch, with my rifle on my legs watching for those bucks to walk past. I’ve never shot at one I can’t bring myself to. Every time I see a deer I see his smile and hear his dulcet tones. And I think “Damn I miss him.”

"[WP] a story where the first line and last line are the same, but with two completely different meanings.",magalodon45,"Re-reading this a few times, I think my original criticism was a mistake on my end for misunderstanding. It all works. My apologies!",magalodon45
"[WP] a story where the first line and last line are the same, but with two completely different meanings.",magalodon45,"""Hi, what's your name?""

Those were the first words my husband ever said to me. What a simple question. What a simple answer it required. But we'd both fumbled with our words, red faced as if we were trying to express our souls to one another. We've always been too self-conscious, too serious, too shy. But ever since that first day of high school, we've always had each other. 

Friday was the 20th anniversary of those first fateful words. We had decided we'd celebrate. We were going out to dinner - without the kids. It was pretty simple, but I'd been looking forward to it all week. After work I dropped our 3 kids off at my parent's. I rushed back home and threw on the blue dress I'd bought just for the occasion. I even dug out the dusty curling iron. I didn't have much time though. We'd agreed to meet at the restaurant at 6. 

Or at least that's what I thought. But by 7, I'd been sitting alone at the restaurant for over an hour, staring expectantly out the window. It was so unlike him to be late. And even more unlike him to not text me to let me know what was up. I wondered was it possible he'd forgotten about our ""big night out""? Was he just sitting at home watching TV assuming the kids and I were out getting dinner? Even the thought of it hurt, but no, no, there was just no way he'd forgot I told myself. I reached in my purse to check the time on my phone again and it rung in my hand. I answered it quickly, assuming it was him. But the voice I heard was formal and unfamiliar. Suddenly the dinner meant nothing.

I took the elevator to the third floor of the hospital. I realized as the elevator doors opened, I hadn't even prepared myself for what I might see. They had said he'd been in a terrible accident. Someone ran a red light. They hit his car door. He was conscious when the ambulance got there. That's all I knew. My husband might be hooked up to breathing machines. He might be unrecognizable behind bruises and casts. He might be missing a limb or limbs. He might be paralyzed. He might be dying. My legs almost give way beneath me as I stepped out of the elevator onto the 3rd floor. His room was the second on the right. 

The first thing I saw was my husband sitting up in bed watching TV. His arms, his legs, and his face looked a bit bloody and bruised. But he looked okay. He was all there. He was my husband. His bed was surrounded by machines. He hadn't seemed to notice I'd entered the room. I pushed past the machines; I just wanted to hug him. His eyes left the tv. They were focused on me. I smiled at him and my eyes filled with tears. He smiled hesitantly; he looked oddly shy. He turned red and nervously muttered.

""Hi, what's your name?""

A consuming fearful joy that only experience can give. Years of patience, longing, and persistence culminated in this existence and his tiny, perfectly formed fingers wrapping around my thumb.

She almost made a little jump when I handed her a cone with three different flavours: vanilla, banana and lemon. I'd expected her to snatch it from my hand, but instead, she paused for a brief moment, as if to contemplate the meaning of such an event. Then, carefully, she accepted.

""It's just ice cream. You know that, right?"" I investigated.

""No, it's not! It's physical happiness!"" She exclaimed as the sunlight brightened her face and a beautiful smile appeared upon it.

""You best hurry and eat that, before it becomes liquid happiness!"" I replied.

Her sunny red dress and the golden waves that hung from her head like the stones around her neck danced with her as she bowed her head down to enjoy the ice, one lick at a time. It was one of those moments where any man would involuntarily fall in love with her as if commanded by nature's laws.

Luckily, I had learned how to counter those urges as I saw an opportunity arise. I recognised the small bag that hung from her shoulder as a rare Louis Vuitton City Steamer One Handle, worth almost five thousand dollars.

Selling ice cream cones was not earning me the big bucks. But as soon as the sedative kicked it, taking the bag from her would be like stealing candy from a baby. I could never resist something so sweet.

[WP] A disturbed teenager hears voices in her head. They tell her to kill her city's superhero guardian.,pianorokker,"Nobody liked her.

There were those in the world that she guessed would probably like her if she ever met them. But she hadn't met them - and probably never would. And there was no use in thinking about people that could *potentially* be this or *potentially* be that.

*Get a grip, Minerva. You're thinking about them, but they're not even thinking about you,* she reminded herself. *They don't even know you exist.*

As far as she knew, concerning the small sphere of people that existed in her life, nobody liked her. Not even her parents. Some parents called their children their ""happy little accidents."" Minerva's parents called her their ""tragic car crash.""

They were downstairs fighting right now, like they did every night. Literally, every night. She knew the routine so well that she was already climbing out the window before her father came up to take out his frustrations and rage on her.

She had a duffel bag with her, stuffed with as many clothes as she could fit, a toothbrush, toothpaste, a washcloth, a few boxes of soap, and a few bottles of deodorant. She didn't know where she was going, but wherever it was, she wasn't coming back.

As she walked, a car eased out of the dark and cruised alongside her. She glanced sideways - caught a glimpse of her reflection in the car window, briefly, before the window rolled down. Her face was replaced with that of a middle-aged, clean-cut, suburban Dad looking kind of guy. The type of guy that looked like he was living the American dream.

But she knew that look in his eyes. She was all too familiar with the ravenous hunger that blazed inside those pair of eyes. Except the face was different this time. 

She shuddered, and the man, using her visible discomfort as a conversation starter, asked her if she was cold.

""No,"" she lied, pulling her jacket tighter, holding her duffel bag closer, and walking faster than she had intended. 

He smiled and she felt her heart flutter a bit. She wouldn't deny that he was handsome, the type of man that could have had women better looking than her wrapped around his finger. 

But she also saw the danger behind the smile. He was the type of man that could straight-out lie in a courtoom, smile, and be found innocent. 

""I'll give you a ride,"" he said, sounding so sincere it startled her. ""Just to the bus stop. That's where you're heading right?""

*Should I answer him?* she wondered, realizing that the reality was that she was really on her own. *And besides, he seems like a nice guy. Maybe he's one of the people in the world that will really like me.*

But her body knew something she didn't know. Even when she had resolved in her mind that he was a nice guy and that it would be okay to get in the car, her feet keep moving her farther and farther away from him.

They got to a small, dark, quiet intersection. She began crossing. The light was red, but he drove through anyway and swerved in front of her, cutting her off. She tried to maneuver herself around the car so she could continue on her path, but he maneuvered better. Quick and agile, he jumped out the car and placed a palm over her mouth before she could cry for help. With tremendous strength, he began wrestling her into the car. 

One moment she was screaming through the skin on his palm, his weight pressing her into the seat of his car; and the next, he was lifted off of her, and she was completely free to run off into the night.

Instead, she ran into the chest of another man.

""This man bothering you?"" asked the new stranger, holding the other man in the air by his neck collar with ease.

However, the Devil regretfully informs you that your soul is not yours to give away.",redxephos27,"My mobile buzzed in my coat pocket and the synthesized ringtone from the movie *Transylvania 6-5000* managed to play three times before I silenced the speaker. The number on the caller ID was 0141-666-3385, no name. I accepted the call.

""Hello, Mr. Angus Granger?"", said a female voice in a strong French accent. She slaughtered the end of my name with a uniquely French guttural 'ughr' sound.

""Yes, that's me."", I replied.

""Fantastique!"", she exclaimed, backed by the full force of her French heritage. She knew English very well, but she spoke quickly and her words had a strange staccato rhythm that was somewhat difficult to follow, ""My name is Lena Voigt. I'm an insurance agent with *Life Insurance For You LLC*. I have some information regarding the Soulcial Security Platinum policy that you purchased from us twenty years ago. Do you have a moment to talk with me about it?""

Twenty years ago, to the day, a friend of mine talked me into signing up with an unusual little life insurance company called *Life Insurance For You LLC*, or *LIFY*, for short. It was a small business in Glasgow that was only open to people willing to pay the price, which wasn't cheap, but it came with perks that you just couldn't get from MassMutual. For instance, it wasn't just life insurance. If anything bad happened in your life, and I do mean *anything*, then you could get it refunded, repaired, or reset. No request was too small or too big as long as it was covered under your policy, and they never asked questions. Just a quick two minute call to the LIFY Hotline and it's taken care of.

Got a parking ticket? Call LIFY and get it revoked and removed from your driving record. Lost your job? Call LIFY and get calls within 24 hours with guaranteed job offers suiting your career. So, your dog got run over by a car? No problem. Just call LIFY and get a new dog, or get the same dog, because LIFY is there for you in your times of hardship.

""Yes, I can talk for a bit."", I finally replied after thinking about it for a second.

""Excellent."", she said in French, ""I hope that you have been enjoying the perks of your insurance policy, Mr. Granger. I see that you have called the hotline three-hundred and thirty-seven times since the policy began.""

I thought about that for a moment, wondering if that was the reason for the call. Maybe I was overusing the policy. I often called for little things, like finding lost keys or getting out of a traffic jam. I had become so used to having the service available that I didn't even think about how often I was using it. ""I hope there's not a problem with that frequency, ma'am."", I said with some trepidation.

""Oh, not at all, Mr. Granger."", she giggled, ""Quite the opposite, in fact. Your use of our services is slightly below average for your policy class. The Platinum policy, of course, is our unlimited plan, which allows you to invoke your insurance as many times as you wish with no questions asked. I see that you also purchased our extended family plan, which adds your entire family to your Death and Dismemberment Reversal clause.""

""Yes, well, I've never had to use that one, thankfully.""

""Indeed, Mr. Granger, but as we say here at *Life Insurance For You*, 'It is always better to be safe, than sorry.'""

I was about to tell her that everyone said that, but then thought better of it. There wasn't any point in dragging this conversation on any more than it needed to be.

She continued, ""Anyway, Mr. Granger, I am calling you today to inform you of a problem with the payment on your account.""

""There shouldn't be a problem with the payment, ma'am. I see the money removed every month.""

""No, your monthly payment is fine. I am referring to the one-time payment due on this account today.""

My heart skipped a beat as I remembered what that meant. And then it stopped entirely. And then I died. Right in the middle of my lunch break. 

And then I was alive again. And then I died again. And then I was alive again. This happened at least five more times over the course of a minute or two. It was as if my soul was tied to a bungee cord wrapped around my physical waist. No matter how hard the external force tried to pull my soul away, it always snapped back into place. It was an interesting experience. I wasn't scared or shocked by it at all, even though I should have been. On the contrary, I was overcome with a feeling of peacefulness and acceptance. But when I snapped back into my body, I felt... immortal.

""I'm afraid that we cannot accept your soul as payment for this contract due to an accounting error."", she said, as I bounced back into consciousness for the final time.

""What... just happened?"", I asked.

""I am sorry for that, Mr. Granger. We attempted to perform a chargeback on your soul, but it was rejected. This can often be due to no fault of your own. For example, you may have sold your soul to another deity in a different life. As a mortal, how would you even know? Unfortunately, this means that your current policy may be cancelled if an alternative payment cannot be procured by the end of business hours today.""

""What kind of alternative payment?""

""Your contract requires a soul, which is the only form of payment that we can accept. Since we cannot take your soul, you will need to select another one.""

""Another one?""

""Yes, it's quite simple, Mr. Granger. Who would you like to sacrifice?""",DeadlyJoe

I got used to people staring at Syrok as he rode on my shoulders, that stole-like position his preferred method, and the double-take when they saw him move and realize he was, indeed, real. I got used to people coming up solely to ask me about him...and then speak to him alone once they realized he could.

Then our bond progressed.

My horns are getting too long to hide under a hat. I always need to manifest SOME kind of dragon trait, and that was the easiest to hide...at first. I get a lot of stares now...people ask if it's some extreme body modification...then the rumour mill churns to remind them in a supposed bastion of education and reason, someone was being trained as a magic user. Thank goodness I wasn't in a Science-Based major or the irony would have given some people fits.

Speaking of being a magic user...I wasn't getting far. I hadn't been taught anything you hope for as one. The most useful thing I'd learned was some restorative magic...that saved me after a red-eye or two before a critical test. But beyond that it was all so mild, so useless. I didn't exactly wanna fling fireballs (especially after the Dragon Breath Cooking fiasco - please, don't ask!), but I wanted something I could use...Syrok flatly refused, saying I wasn't ready.

""Yo, Scales!"" I heard behind me...and my eyes were already rolling. That had become a nickname on campus, one I didn't want, and at the moment, the man to blame was calling me by it.

""Ben, Adrian. Behhhnnn...is that too hard for you? Get sacked too hard again?"" Adrian was not your typical Jock...your typical jock DID understand there was a world beyond them or their sport. Adrian was so far up his own ass he tasted all his meals twice.

""Watch your mouth, Hardly Potter!"" He held up a hand for a high five for that lame line, and of course, got it. ""Just wanted to let you know I've been recognized for my contributions to the campus.""

""You mean your Coach's chances at a raise. You do as much for this campus' reputation as sunscreen does for a man in a furnace."" Heh, I may not have Dragon's Breath, but I know how to spit a little fire.

He just kept up his greasy smile. ""I hear envy...there aren't any awards for english...what's that tell you?""

&lt;Ben, this is a waste of your efforts.&gt; Syrok tried to intervene.

I wasn't ready to listen. ""That I don't need a Coach to stroke my ego or my dick to keep me motivated.""

Adrian grabbed my shoulder roughly. ""Should we see if you can still talk shit with a broken jaw?""

Syrok bristled, growling...even small as he was, the sight of his pupils fading and eyes glowing got people to back away.

"[WP] After destroying human civilization, you build a boarding school to raise the next generation of humans.",Creepopolous,"Nobody knew my real potential until destroyed everything. I was a mediocre student and kept a lame job. But when computers came into play, my special skillset was utilized perfectly. I could hack anything, and design programs that would keep people down. I wrote a program that hijacks military drones and sent them flying with their explosive cargo into the sides of airliners. I hacked the economy and crashed the stock market. I threatened China through secret messages with a nuclear attack from America. They took the threat seriously, and retaliated with military force. The next war was a bitter one, with casualties exceeding that of the first World War. I took all the rescue effort's resources and channeled them into my own bank account. I drew power from civilization, and in the end used my powers to destroy it. 

When most of humanity was gone and there was absolutely no centralized government on the globe, I started my boarding school. I let in people on the streets so I could train them. I taught them the art of technology, so they could build a better civilization on the ruins of the old ones. We worked on irrigation systems, automated travel, and weaponry. The forces I accumulated brandished as much power as the armies of the old nations. My school grew huge and I used the collapse to my advantage. The teachings centered on one thing for the students. I showed them the potential of technology, and therefore the potential within themselves. Each of my students were worth twenty of the old people. They may have looked weak, but they brandished a power beyond them. Computers.",oaflopean

"[WP] People can listen to music and convert them into magic attacks/abilities, dependant on the mood/theme etc. Heavy Metal or any other fast paced edgy genre is illegal for safety reasons. However, people are still able to kill with other unlikely genres.",DanyosKardia,"The answer to your question is yes, but I left it slightly ambiguous because I couldn't decide I think. It was either a pocket reality created (or connected to) by the music, or created in the mind by the music, and destroying the music destroyed the world (or severed the connection), or broke the trance (or their minds).

I was kind of building off a different quote by Nietzsche - ""And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music."" When discussing the Dionysian worldview he constantly phrases it in terms of a close metaphorical connection between music and insanity. But also that giving into it, in a way, allows you to perform magic.",TeddyArmy

It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything.""

""How quaint. Who said that?""

""Plato.""

""He was always an optimist.""

""Perhaps you're right. Perhaps he should have included that it gives power to the heart, weapons to the weak, something like that.""

""Dominion to the delirious.""

""You've got to believe it to achieve it.""

""Good thing I still believe in cold steel,"" she said, as she finished slotting bullets into the clip and reloaded it into the gun that looked much too big for her slender hands. She holstered it and sat back. ""At the end of the day, the only moral law is me,"" she said with a cheeky smile.

I returned a smirk to chastise her for her bravado, as I was accustomed to do after these six months of working together. She was rarely a daredevil in a hot situation, in fact she moved with the cool calculation of a hunting reptile, or a spider. But I could always sense her desire to jump into the fray, to play with fire. She enjoyed what she did, and more dangerously, she enjoyed what it involved. Her training held her back, but training always evolves, until its forgotten entirely. So I kept her in check.

""We're here,"" she sat up, as the ATV made a distinct slowing turn. I picked up my helmet. ""Are you ever going to leave that thing behind one day?"" she asked. ""I feel like I'm out there fighting alone when you're wearing that.""

I smiled. ""I need silence to dance.""

""Psht. Whatever,"" she said, and she shoved the door open.

The concierge met us at the door, rather than waiting behind the front desk. He paced between us and where we were meant to go, like a worried dog showing us the way to the problem. My partner started looking at him sideways, through narrow eyes. She couldn't stand anyone who couldn't be cool.

""The penthouse,"" he spluttered. ""He must have broken the controllers, or hacked them. Or he may have brought his own equipment because its very loud. We've moved all the guests from the upper floors downstairs, but despite that we haven't seen anything out of the ordinary. No apparitions, no sceneshifting, no mods of any kind."" His face was moist with perspiration, as if he'd been pacing for some time before we'd arrived. ""Some of us believe that the guest performed suicide, and the music has just been left playing."" He paused having uttered the sentence, and went a shade whiter with the thought. ""He only rented the room for the night, so that could be true. He seemed quite normal to me..""

""Calm down,"" I interrupted. ""Everything will be fine. If what you say is true, we'll be able to switch the music off, no problem."" We reached the elevator, and my partner and I stepped inside. She punched the top number with the nose of her pistol. ""Going up,"" she said. As soon as the doors closed I grimaced at her for the cliche. She smiled back. This was how she flirted on the job.

[Classical music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYyK922PsUw) was playing in the elevator, kept to a cool. Classical music was much more common than in the old days. The controllers were built in to every speaker, by law, and would shut off the power if the BPM got too fast. It was more complicated than that, to deal with the other ""electric genres"" that didn't rely on BPM for their energy. But I wasn't a technician. It didn't matter to me.

She had her head tilted, listening. At some point we expected the noise of whatever music was coming from the top level to reach us, first as a distant vibration. There would be a little time assess, to see how dangerous it was. If it had been as the concierge speculated, then I would need to go out alone. But the elevator moved slowly. It was an old hotel.

The music was soothing. There was definitely a story being told, but I didn't know it. It was...romantic...serene...graceful... a song from nature, deep in the forest, the proverbial forest, where people had never trodden. In the middle of the continent, and surrounded on all sides by impassable mountains, holding the trees close for protection, shielding them from time... Life was harmonious. The harmonies of life...an endless circle.

""Something's not right.""

""What?""

""The music. It's taking us.""

""Taking us where?""

The rear doors behind us opened. She gasped as she turned to face the breeze that came from behind her. ""Here,"" she said.

Our elevator sat on top of a hill. Long, deep green grass lapped at its sides, spilled into the doorframe. The air smelled the freshest I had ever smelled. It came from the mountains, whose proud white peaks saluted from the horizon where they pinned up the sky. The meadow before us cascaded downwards, flowers flowing over the froth, to where it settled and drowned the roots of the trees. The timbers were giant, the creases in the bark were deep like lines on the face of an aged wizard. There they slept in their own shade, the shadows clung like velvet to everything. Bluebells and snowdrops formed deep pools among them. Deer strode among the flowers silently. Rabbits poked their heads up every now and them. Butterflies alighted on their ears, and were gently shaken with a twitch.

""I've never felt anything like this before.""

""Yes. Me neither.""

""He must've hacked...the controllers...""

""...Oh.""

""We've got to...snap out of it..."" she seemed to sway with the breeze, which invited her for a dance. ""Where's your...helmet?""

""It's..."" I looked down to where I had been holding my helmet by the jaw. It wasn't there. Instead there was a wicker basket. She turned to look as I didn't answer, and seeing the basket her eyebrows raised in dozy bemusement.

""Oh.""

I lifted the lid. The basket was full of provisions. Red grapes, a goat's cheese, a small ham, a bottle of wine.

""We could-""

""We have to get back to the elevator.""

""The elevator brought us here,"" I said stupidly, desperately.

""This isn't where we're...supposed to be...""

""...isn't it?""

She groaned with the mental strain of trying to hold her thoughts together, pressing her temples with her palms and kneeling down, breathing deeply to try and focus. I watched, pitying her for resisting. Why resist? What was the point? What was there to go back to?

She lurched to her feet and grabbed my free hand, stumbling to the elevator which still stood behind us, where a robin had landed on the top left corner and eyed us quizzically. ""C'mon,"" she mumbled. But I pulled her back. Her hand felt so soft. ""Stay,"" I replied. ""Stay...with me."" I drew her closer.

Her eyes rose to meet mine, and they were full of terror and the realization of desire, the awareness of a passion undiscovered, the temptation of..

""No!"" She wrenched herself away from me and nearly fell into the elevator. I followed her, if only to coax her out again. I stood in the doorway, smiling bravely, comfortingly as she cowered in one corner. ""Come back,"" I said, ""Come on."" 

She threw herself into my embrace, and for that moment I was the happiest I had ever been. She clutched at my armor vest and looked again deeply into my eyes. This would be the moment that everything changed between us forever. But then her grip tightened and she fell back, dragging me with her, and we tumbled into the elevator. She kicked the number of a lower floor as she fell and the doors closed on that perfect wilderness forever. The elevator descended slowly, the muffled vibrations of the music from the top floor giving way to the rumbling of the elevator's machinery. I began to sober.

""It was a trap.."" I said. ""The music combined together..like some sort of amplifier..""

""Was that real?"" she asked, ""Where were we?""

""I don't know."" I answered. ""It felt real.""

""Where's your helmet?""

""I must've left it.""

She sighed, and pulled her gun from her holster, clicked it back. ""Well, let's try that again, shall we?"" she said, and shot out the speaker in the elevator. The sound was deafening.

"[WP] People can listen to music and convert them into magic attacks/abilities, dependant on the mood/theme etc. Heavy Metal or any other fast paced edgy genre is illegal for safety reasons. However, people are still able to kill with other unlikely genres.",DanyosKardia,"Emotion is a powerful thing.
 
Back in the 21st century it was first discovered that the brain could affect the world.

Not just through your body but through what some called magic but we later found out was your mind willing the world to change through sheer power of will.

The brain is a funny thing, once it believes that something is real it will accept it, adept to it and will learn how to use it to it’s benefit.

Before march 15, 2019 nobody believed that magic or “willing” as we call it was real, it was ludicrous to think that a person could will something to change and it changed.

On march 15, 2019 a kid named Billy from a small town in the state of Texas was once again bullied by his classmates.

Billy was used to getting bullied, he had been dunked in the toilet, his lunch money was stolen on a regular basis and he has gotten more wedgies than he can remember.

But this time was different, the bullies went to far. They made him take of his clothes and paraded him through the halls of the school.

Not soon after Billy lost his clothes a teacher saw him walking around without his clothes, pulled him into the bathroom and spanked and scolded him for being naked. Billy told him it wasn’t his fault, that the bullies had taken his clothes but the excuses only made the teacher more mad and gave Billy 2 weeks of detention.

Billy was given a spare change of clothes from lost and found and was send back to class.

When Billy got back to he was once again ridiculed by his classmates even his favourite teacher miss Gretchen greeted billy with a loud laugh at his expense.

Billy made his way to the back of the class, pulled out his phone and his earbuds and just sat there for a moment. “What’s the point of living in a world where everyone is just out to get you”… Billy put in his earbuds and played the first song in his music player.

He had always liked this song but today he felt the song, he understood the meaning of the song and the pain behind it.  

The fear, embarrassment and anger that Billy had felt so intensely when he was paraded around school naked came back.

All the other kids with the pumped up kids you better run better run, outrun my gun.

It all came together, his emotions and the music. Guns started to appear out of thin air all around billy, the first time in human history that a person willed something into existence.

The song and emotion had unlocked something in Billy’s brain that allowed him to create guns out of thin air. Billy did not shoot anyone, did not hurt anyone. Even though Billy had been hurt and tormented he could not, would not become like his bullies.

And that my dear students is the story of how “Willing” was discovered.
“But professor, how did Billy have the ability to resist hurting his bullies? Songs that talk about hurting others or about weapons are banned for this exact reason it’s impossible to resist the songs”.

“It’s not impossible it’s just very hard, just as it’s very difficult to kill anyone through your will but there are stories about mercenaries who can do it, they use songs about heartbreak of such thing and literally will a persons heart to break. If a regular person tried it they would get no where but those of us who are extremely talented like Billy was can manipulate songs and their meanings to achieve things not described in the songs”.

And that concludes lesson one of “Willing 101” ill see all of you next week have a nice weekend.

The Beasts of Anwex

The rolling hills and dense forests of Anwex holds many mysteries. Though the island was colonized a century ago, its rugged interior has stalled any attempts at expansion. Rumours abound of half glimpsed things that stalk the border between civilization and the wilds. Most are simply that, rumours. I have spoken with guards that insisted that wyverns roamed the woods, bedecked with wicked horns and slender legs. While I am convinced these sightings are no more fantastical than a buck caught in the rising sun, I found it hard to chock all sightings up as misunderstandings.

One tale that turns up in taverns across the coast is of humanoid shapes lurking deep within the woods, spotted at the edges of logging camps and mines. Labourers described them as “eight feet tall, broad of shoulder and short of neck”. At first I came to the conclusion that these were but a tribe of ogres, millennia of island life stunting their growth. My initial research seemed to back that assumption, as oversized stone tools were often found when more forest was cleared away.

My theory was tested when I was called into the woods by the city watch. Escorted through a half mile of clinging vines and biting insects, I arrived at a ghastly sight. Gore drenched the tattered remains of a logging camp, bits of limbs and entrails strewn in a sick imitation of confetti. I wretched at the smell, my senses overwhelmed by copper and dung. Once I had regained my faculties, I was told the days shipment of logs had been delayed. Upon investigation, the guards discovered the camp in this sorry state, the workers either dead or missing. 

This was clearly the work of some beast, an undiscovered native of Anwex. Being the only expert on fauna on the island, I was tasked with identifying the threat and tracking it down. To that end I requisitioned a number of vials, a pound of plaster and several water skins.

As I awaited my supplies I questioned the guards. The camp had been guarded by two armed and armoured soldiers, well paid sellswords hired by the logging company. Shreds of their chainmail had been found amongst the gore, along with a plated arm. Donning my gloves I turned over the limb, which had been ripped off at the elbow. The gauntlet had been crushed, the glove the only thing holding the hand together. 

At first I assumed this was a wound sustained by a club, a favourite of ogres worldwide. Once I examined the palms I saw a number of punctures, which told a much different story. The hand had been bitten, an extraordinary amount of force collapsing the armour like it was but foil. This certainly didn't rule out ogres, as they are known to devour corpses after a battle. Although most would prefer to peel the metal shell off their prey first, extreme hunger could provide suitable motivation to chew on an armoured hand.

Fortunately I was able to pry free a tooth from the palm of the victim. It was nearly five inches in length, exceptionally sharp with a very deep root, coated in dried black blood. It could have been a tusk from an ogre, although the length would suggest a juvenile. Without a vial to store the find I stashed it in the pocket of my tunic.

Leaving the grisly appendage behind, I surveyed the edge of the camp. The ground was soft and loamy, yet there were few tracks. It appeared that these ogres were more light footed than their continental cousins, perhaps in part due to their smaller size. What tracks I could find were faint.

My supplies arrived in short order, and I set about casting the imprints. While they dried, I examined the tattered tents. Many had been ripped apart, long gashes in their sides. The cuts seemed jagged and rough, perhaps made with crude stone weapons, but no fragments of rock were found. 

A tuft of hair caught my eye, hanging onto the supports of one of the tents. I plucked it from its perch, examining it closely. It was course and rough, black as pitch and strong as wire. Ogre hair occasionally grew this thick, although it was a colour I had never seen before. I deposited the sample into a vial before returning to my castings.

As I pried the plaster from the print, I noted how slender it was. It was nearly twice the length of my own foot, but just slightly wider. The toes ended in claws, each two to three inches long. It almost appeared to be the print of a werewolf, only far more monstrous in proportion. I quickly dismissed the idea; not only would this werewolf have to be at least ten feet tall, it would be found further south than any lycanthrope known to man. Surely this was just another example of adaptation.

I gathered my findings and returned to town, my armed escort in tow. I was eager to begin my studies properly. I could be on the verge of a new discovery, a long lost tribe of ogres forgotten by time. I have compiled a list of suitable names for the species, to be attached to my field report.

Note: Let it be said that proper specimen storage is essential. In my haste forgot the tooth in my pocket. It bit deeply into my thigh as I sat, and I had to spend the next ten minutes cleaning and dressing the wound. Fortunately the rest of my evening would be spent at my desk, reading into reports and studying the samples gathered at the site.

It's odd; in a decade of field work I've never felt this giddy. I'm almost chomping at bit to get back out there, and start searching for these beasts. The prestige of finding a new species is exciting, certainly, but the thought of the hunt thrills me more than I can describe. Ah well, they say that a full moon does funny things to people. At least I'll have plenty of light to work with.",Towtonpublishing

Mentally, at least.”

Disadvantages of knowing intimately what someone is thinking.  I had a lot of time to prep for this question.  “It’s not my decision.”

“I remember signing…I remember you signing the consent forms,” he clarified.  “It was your decision.”

“Yeah, I suppose in that respect,” I conceded, looking at the EKG machine for a second.  It beeped a my heart rate.  I heard the IVs push another load of drugs into me.  In other few seconds, I’d feel, it too.  “The neural image of you was taken from me before the decision was made final, yeah?”

“Yeah,” he said, leaning back in the chair.  I recognized the slouch, I used to do it, back when my spine worked properly.  “I’ve got some theories, but they kinda stop a few days before the signing.”

“I didn’t do this for me,” I said, looking at the twin cameras my duplicant had for eyes.  “I did it for my family.  Thirty-eight is shitty age to die.  My parents, for all their faults, do care about me and take it personally when I fail.”

“Which is why you never killed yourself,” the duplicant said.  “Wedge in the marriage already, death of a child?  No one wants to get divorced at 69.”

“Even before this disease,” I added.  “And you want to know, now that I’ve got the easy way out, why I saddled you with all the rotten crap that’s been plaguing me for the last 18 years.”

“Basically.  I realize it’s not all that different from your own kids asking you why you brought them into this world, but we get to skip all the intervening years.”

“Yeah, we do.”  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Drug rush.  “However bad it got, there’s still some hope.”

“For your identity.  Ours, now, I guess.”

“That’s the real reason I didn’t do it.  Didn’t want to put my family through it.  But, just because I didn’t succeed young, doesn’t mean I won’t succeed eventually.  You know, Stan Lee didn’t have any editorial say at Marvel until he was 44.”

“Yeah, but he spent years working up to that.  You have nothing, have built nothing, and are offering me nothing.  You haven’t even started building a legacy.”

“Yeah, well, not everyone’s dealt the same cards.”

“You think who and what you were can lead to me accomplishing your goals.”

“I hope it will.  I’m obviously not going to be around to see it.  You could blow what little I’m leaving you on whatever the robot equivalent of hookers and blow is, and I can’t stop you.”

“You know I won’t, though.”

“I think you won’t.  We’re two different people with very similar stories now.”

“True.”  He laced his fingers together and rested them on his hull, the servos whirring quietly.  “How do you know I won’t fail and do what you couldn’t?”

“I don’t.  I hope you won’t.”

“I met your nephews.  Hardy and Tyler don’t like me very much.  Jace seems all right with me, though.”

“Hardy and Tyler are 10 and 8, they’re old enough to know what a shaved head, sunken eyes, and a lot visits to the hospital mean.  You’re a bad copy of Uncle Vic to them.  Jace is 3.  He doesn’t get it yet.”

“With regards the illegal mods…there was a lot of teaching programs.  I’ve got so much physics and chemistry crammed up in here.”  He tapped his head.  “Was that for them?”

“Them, or someone else.”

“I know from your memories, you hated the idea of being a teacher.  Why load me with all that?”

“Because you’re my duplicant.  I can make you a good teacher.”

“Which means…you wanted to be a good teacher, but didn’t want to teach?”

“You are my gift to my family, so that my passing is easier.  The mods, they’re my gift to everybody.  This world is going downhill fast, and I’m not going to see it crash, but if I have the ability to fling a light into the future, I will.”

""Jim... this is your 11:30 am wake-up call.  Just thought I'd ring you in case you, uh... forgot your alarm.  It's an important meeting today.  See you soon.""  Fost hung up.  

He blinked a few more times, then started to get up.  He turned to look at Ahim.  Her skin was still softly glowing, but it seems when she sleeps, the shining light is brought much lower.  

He quickly got into the shower, and tried to remember exactly what happened last night.  But it was all pretty fuzzy.  The shower woke him up a bit, but he still felt like he needed a pick-me-up after he got out.  

He re-entered the bedroom, in a robe, to find Ahim stretching herself out of bed.  She got re-dressed quickly, and walked down the stairs, leaving him with a small smile.

He got dressed quick, and went down too, starting the coffee machine first thing.  Just the aroma woke him up more than the shower did.  

""What is that smell?""  

He smiled.  ""It's coffee.  It helps to wake you up by putting caffeine in your system.  Want some?"" 

She looked thoughtful for a second, then nodded.  

He plopped the first cup in front of her, and started on a second for himself.  She took a sip, and immediately made a face.  ""Oh!  It's bitter, and hot!""  

He laughed.  ""Sorry, should have said.  It's a very warm drink, and most people put other stuff in it.  Like milk, or cream, or sugar.  Or chocolate.""  

She looked really confused.  

""Man I'm a horrible tourguide of Earth.  I'm sorry.""  He started to get a bunch of things out of his fridge.  He handed her chocolate first.  

She put a dab on her finger, and took a taste.  ""Oh, wow.  That...""  She started pouring it into her coffee.  By the time she was done, it seemed to be about 50% chocolate.  He gave her a spoon, and she happily stirred it up.  When she took her next sip, something interesting happened... Starting from her lips, and going throughout her body, her skin started to glow a slightly warmer color of blue.  When she drank deep, her lips turned an almost orange-red.  She put the cup down after her indulging drink, and she stared at Jim.  Her eyes were like fire.  ""That is amazing.  If we learned nothing else, and did nothing else, but discover pizza and chocolate?  It would make the huge trip back home worth it all.""  

He smiled, and nodded.  ""Wait'll you have cold pizza for breakfast.""

After being re-caffeinated, Jim drove Ahim back to Mission Control.  There were even more Press around than last night, which Jim thought kind of funny.  Ahim's skin had gone back to her normal blue, though her lips remained a lighter color than before.  He wondered if eating Earth food would have different effects.  

They walked by all the press, who were running up for, asking for comments from both Jim, and Ahim.  It was making it somewhat difficult to get into the building.  Ahim then touched Jim's shoulder, and her skin shined brightly... and suddenly Jim and Ahim were able to walk *through* the press group, right into the building.  

Once they got inside the building, Jim took a look at his hands... they were ghost-like blue.  *Creepy... but awesome.*  

Ahim's skin went back to normal, and after a second, so did Jim.  The President was waiting.  

""Jim, glad you're here early.  The rest of the group has just beamed down.""  

Jim nodded.  ""Thank you, sir.""  He turned around.  ""I saw The Press are more than interested.""  

Fost laughed, then looked down.  ""Heh, yeah.  I maybe should have... I'm not sure I handled the announcement in the best way.""  He took a deep breath.  ""Historians are going to be watching these next few days, Commander.  Let's make sure we make the best decisions.""  

*Oh god... the future is going to be watching me like a hawk.*  Jim hadn't yet made the realization, and it was hitting him pretty hard.  Fost had started to walk toward the conference room.  Ahim took Jim's hand, and led him there.  Jim sat at the end of the long table.  There were many more aliens in the room than yesterday, but he recognized Shin Na, Rin, and To'nar.  Shin Na, and To'nar, nodded at him when he sat down.  Rin floated over to Jim, and smiled, then floated right back.  

There was a folder in front of Jim, which he opened just for something to do.  Inside, there were copies of all the blueprints, as well as the messages sent out by the aliens.  

Once everyone had been seated, it seemed no one was sure who would start.  Jim had an idea, but he wasn't sure if he should say anything.  

But when no one did, he spoke up.  ""Hi all... I'm sure we're here to talk about the blueprint for this... Nexus, but can I ask about the messages that were sent out?""  

To'nar nodded.  ""So, you noticed it, too?""  

Fost looked up.  ""Noticed what?""  

Again, no one spoke.  ""There are five different species here.  The Krynock, The Dra'nor, The Artifoids, The Ra Non, and Humans.""  

Jim nodded, looking down at the messages again.  And that's when he realized what To'nar had: The messages were all in different languages, of course, for the different aliens.  But it looked like there was another language, for a missing group of aliens.  ""There's... 6 sets of the same message?  Not five?""  

""Correct,"" To'nar said, nodding.  ""I do not recognize the first language.  The second is ours.""  

""We are the third message,"" Ahim's father had said.  He looked at Ahim, who seemed annoyed.  They didn't look at one another.  

""We are fourth,"" Shin Na spoke.  

""We are the fifth,"" Rin said.  

Jim nodded.  ""And it was beamed in English.  Anyone recognize the first message?""  

For a few seconds, no one spoke.  But Rin finally did.  ""We do.  It is the text of The Creators.""  

There was nodding all around the table, except with any of the humans.  

""Can you fill us in?""  

""Certainly, Mr. President.  We are an artificial race... but we were created by a group of biologicals, who wished to conquer death.  This was their language.  It used to be a common language.  Used by many species.  But, it does not have its genesis in our Creators.""  

Jim looked up at Rin.  ""Who made the language, then?""  

""They are known as The Sharaien, Mr. President.""  It was Rin who answered.  

Ahim reached at her belt, and pulled out her micro computer, pulling up an image of this other alien race... She made the image larger so everyone at the table could see.  

""Oh my god..."" Fost said.  

And Jim had the same thought.  They were tall, gray skin, huge dark eyes.  Very small nose.  ""The Grays..."" Jim whispered.  

""You... know of them?""  To'nar said.  

Jim looked at Fost, who looked back at him.  ""It's a myth, Jim...""  

""Is it?  Where did the myth come from?""  

Fost shook his head.  

Jim looked up at Ahim, who was staring at him.  ""The Grays are a group of... aliens that... were rumored to have crash landed a long time ago.  Supposedly, they crashed in Roswell, New Mexico, and the government covered it up.  Sometimes they have green skin, and sometimes they have gray skin.  A lot of the time, they're known as Grays in movies, television... video games.  If there's an alien race who looks like that,"" he pointed at the image, then shook his head.  

""Jim, this is going to be my top priority.  I will use every ounce of my power to find out what is going on.""  The President seemed angered, but not at Jim.  He looked like a man who had been lied to.

Ahim took the image away, and put the device back in her belt.  

To'nar spoke up, after a minute of silence.  ""Perhaps... the Grays... are the ones calling for aid?""  

Rin turned to look at Jim.  ""This is my conclusion, as well.""  

Jim nodded.  ""Well, at least we know who we're helping now.  Has anyone been able to figure out what The Nexus is?  Or what it does?""  

Shin Na turned to, and pointed at, Jim.  ""You have, Commander.""  

Jim made a face.  ""Me?""  

She nodded.  ""As near as my scientists can tell, you were correct.  The Nexus seems to be a huge piece of technology, which allows rapid transit between fixed locations.""  

Everyone at the table agreed.  

""What's fixed locations mean?  Like, what causes the location to be a fixed point?""  

To'nar spoke up.  ""Near as we can tell, you can use a Nexus device to instantly travel to another working Nexus.""  

""Is that how your scientists think you all arrived here?""  

""It would seem to be that we were sent into a Nexus portal.  We can't find this functionality in the blueprints, but it's possible The Grays are much more advanced than us.  Theoretically, they can send Nexus portals to places in the universe, and... catch ships.  Then, they are sent to a fixed location: another Nexus device.""  

Jim shook his head.  ""But that's not possible.  We don't have a Nexus on Earth.""  

This seemed to stump the table.  ""And besides... if they can *catch* ships, why bring them here in the first place?""  Jim looked around the table.  

And he realized they didn't have the answers.  It made him a little afraid.  Here they have these advanced ships, super science... but there's a race out there who has *even more* advanced science... and they're nearly extinct.  Waiting for help, from all of them.  

He slumped back into his chair.  And a small shiver ran up his spine.",PrinceAuryn
"[WP] Humanity has just made first contact with a large conglomerate of different alien ships, all of whom are also in the process of first contact. Everyone is extremely confused.",InsanePigeon,"Jim smiled to himself, but decided to go downstairs.  *She's probably just teasing.*  

He started going through his blu-rays, until he found the Original Series set he had gotten for some birthday, years back.  He smiled, and ripped it open.  He didn't hear her come down the stairs.  

""Commander,"" she said.  

""Oh you can just call me Ji-"" he said, as he turned around.  But he was cut short.  For you see, she was wearing a towel.  

On her head.  

His eyes went wide.  And he quickly looked up.  

She laughed at him, then had the towel drop from her head, and she wrapped herself up in it.  He still had a small, afterimage of her brightly lit skin.  It was memorizing, to him.  

""What were you doing?""  

He blinked a couple of times, and then shook himself out of it.  ""Uh... just..""  He handed the box over to her.  Then he took a step back, and stared her right in the eyes.  ""You're teasing me, aren't you?""  

She laughed again.  ""It's fun, Jim.  Does it bother you?""  

He laughed in return.  ""Heh, uh... no.  Bother isn't the right word.  It just feels like I should buy you dinner, first.""  

Her eyes went wide.  ""Oh, yes.  Dinner!  I'm starving.  I haven't eaten in hours.  Would you?""  

He grinned.  ""Sure...""  He thought about what they could enjoy together.  ""Let's try Pizza.  That's pretty mild.  I know a good place that delivers 24 hours.""  

He grabbed his phone, and began to fiddle with it.  ""Hm... I'll get a regular cheese for you, and maybe... black olive, pineapple, and bacon for me.""  He was more talking to himself, as he knew she wouldn't know.  ""Alright, should be here in 30.""  

She got closer to him.  ""Jim... what's this you handed me?""  

""Hm, I guess you can't read our languages, huh?""  

She shook her head.  

""Good to know.  This is Star Trek.  I thought we could...""  

Her eyes lit up.  Literally, like stars were exploding right in them.  ""Oh!  I'd love to watch it!"" 

They watched a few episodes, while enjoying pizza.  The pizza delivery boy was surprised by Ahim (both for being an alien, and likely, for wearing only a towel), but he said nothing.  Ahim enjoyed both types of pizza, and said she couldn't wait to try more toppings, next time.  

They watched a few episodes of old Trek.  She was able to see introductions to The Klingons, and The Romulans, plus a few classic episodes that explained what the show was all about.  

He turned to her, after their fourth episode.  ""I imagine... it's not really like this.""  

""What?"" she asked.  

He pointed up.  ""Space.  Exploring the cosmos.""  

She smiled.  ""They got some of it right!  The technology isn't quite the same, but laser weapons, powerful bombs... energy-deflecting shields.  Those are all real.  We have them on our ship.  In fact, all of the ships in orbit have some powerful tech.""  

She thought for a second.  ""As for differences... well I imagine The Krynock are similar to Klingons.  They're a warrior race, though they aren't very worried about conquering all they see.  The Krynock will fight a war, if it comes.  And they're powerful.  But they're fierce allies.""  She looked wistful, as she said this.  

""Speaking... from experience?""  

She shook her head.  ""No, just stories I've heard.  Old wars.  Old battles.  Our people have fought as enemies, and allies, before.  As for the Romulans, well... they seem to be a lot sneakier.  Underhanded.  Willing to do most anything, to win.  But also extremely xenophobic.""  She shrugged.  ""I don't think that describes any species I've encountered.""  

Jim got up, and stretched.  ""I better get to sleep.  Got a busy day tomorrow, I'm sure.""  

She got up, as well, and nodded.  

As Jim went up the stairs, he called back to her.  ""What about Warp technology?""  

""Mm, I'm not sure I understand it 100%.  It doesn't like what we have.  I'm not sure about the rest of the races, but we use something similar to our beaming technology.  We phase into a sub-space gate, which allows us to travel large distances.  Our travel time becomes hours, instead of days.""

Jim whistled.  ""Wow...""  

As he got up to the top of the stairs, he stopped.  ""I need to see that.""  

She smiled at him, grabbing his hand.  ""And so you shall, Jim Freeman.""  And the room filled with light.

[WP] Two oracles are playing a game of chess.,InsanePigeon,"A: I predict that you'll play unpredictably.

B: That's not much of a prediction. A real prediction would be if you could predict my opening move.

A: I predict you'll think hard about opening with a Sicilian, but change your mind at the last minute.

B: That's better, but a prediction about a change of mind is pretty useless without knowing what the person will change their mind to.

A: Let's see you do better.

B: I'll show you how the pros do it. Let's turn the board around so you're white. You will open with a move to d4.

A: Wrong. e4.

B: Huh.

A: Exactly.

B: But that's not fair. I told you my prediction before you made your move.

A: That's the oracle's dilemma, isn't it? A bit like Schrodinger's Cat?

B: Once the subject of the prediction knows about the prediction, it makes them less likely to follow through on the prediction.

A: Unless the oracle is tricky with their wording. Like, I could say that I predict you'll win, and then, lo and behold, I guarantee you my prediction will come true.

B: Yeah but that would just be because you threw the game.

A: Maybe.

B: What if I heard you make that prediction, and then I predicted that I would lose? And then I tried to lose?

A: Mm. Then we'd have a real game of chess on our hands.

B: Mm-hm. We would.

A: Well, ok, then. May the best man lose.

[WP] Two oracles are playing a game of chess.,InsanePigeon,"Two oracles are playing a game of chess. But *playing* isn't the right word. They are just sitting. Sitting and staring. Sitting and staring silently at each other over the board. 

I wanted to ask them why they didn't just make-out already. But I didn't.

This was supposed to be the most epic chess-games of all time. But it wasn't. 

It was a let down. Finally, with a nod, they both stood up and bowed politely to audience and said to them, simultaneously, ""We concede.""

There was a dead silence, until someone found their voice and yelled, ""Whaddya mean?!""

""There is no point in playing the other,"" said one.

""We both know the future, so it will be a tie,"" said two. 

And, joining hands, they skipped off the stage, through the crowd, and out the door. ",VanceValence
[WP] Two oracles are playing a game of chess.,InsanePigeon,"Red flags and supportive cheers greeted Ira as she approached the center of the coliseum. On the contrast, green flags donned with silver stripes and intimidating chants followed the entrance of Malek.

For nearly a century, the clans of Ardod and Jakarchi bickered and battled. After this season's harvest yielded weakly for both clans, it became clear that The Gods grew weary of the fighting. The war must be settled, and this was the only solution that both sides could agree upon:

The clan of Ardod will send their greatest oracle, Ira, to challenge the clan of Jakarchi's greatest oracle, Malek, to a single match of chess. Should Ira best Malek, the two clans will merge under the great name of Ardod. Similarly, should Malek best Ira, the two clans will merge under the grand name of Jakarchi.

Ira and Malek met gazes at the center of the coliseum. No words were spoken between them. Beside the pair of oracles sat two chairs, a small table, and a wooden chess set atop the table. A horn sounded, and the two took their seats.

The chanting and cheering ceased. Silence flooded the atmosphere. Ira continued to gaze deeply into Malek's eyes- never blinking. Malek scanned the enormous crowd contained within the coliseum. The flags held by the two opposing crowds contrasted substantially, yet their faces blended into a homogeneous blur. While Malek represented the clan of Jakarchi, he agreed to the challenge primarily for the sake of family honor. Malek had been given the opportunity to let a bright light of glory and forgiveness shine upon his shunned family.

After another minute of anticipating silence, Malek finally spoke.

""I will take the first move,"" Malek told Ira as he began to arrange the wooden, white pieces on his side of the board.

""No,"" Ira rejected. She closed her eyes. Images of green flags waving victoriously appeared beneath her eyelids. Ira saw the defeat of Ardod. She opened her eyes. ""I will take white and make the first move.""

Malek's eyebrow shot up. Although his eyes remained opened, he could see only the consequences of Ira's request. Ira would inevitably checkkmate Malek, marking Ardod's victory against Jakarchi in the long war. He shook his head at Ira and protested, ""It is clear that whoever makes the first move shall win.""

Ira nodded in agreement. ""Okay,"" she began as she beckoned to a fat child in the crowd. ""Let this child gather two sticks of differing lengths. He will then offer the sticks to us, hiding their length. Whoever draws the longer stick will play as white.""

""Agreed,"" Malek smirked.

The boy picked up two small twigs. He compared their sizes, snapped off a small piece from one to ensure that it was clearly shorter than the other stick, and nervously approached the center of the stadium. Ira closed her eyes as Malek blankly stared at the sticks. Both of them could see themselves drawing the longer stick, setting up their white chess pieces, and eventually checkmating their opponent. Ira opened her eyes while Malek's gaze returned from its blank state

The two oracles reached their hands out to grab a stick from the boy's hands. Their hands met- Ira and Malek both reached for the same stick! Malek shook his head, ""how did we not see this happening?"" Ira chuckled.

""Alright,"" the oracle from Ardod sighed. ""How will we determine who gets to pick a stick first?""

Malek thought for a moment before telling the boy, ""Take your other hand, put it behind your back, and hold any number of fingers up. Ira and I will take turns guessing the number you have chosen. When one of us is correct, show us your hand. Then, that winning guesser shall draw the first stick to determine who gets to make the first move in our chess game.""

Ira agreed. The boy, still shaking with nervousness, held his empty hand behind his back while his other hand anxiously gripped the two twigs. He opened his mouth but could not muster any words before the enormous coliseum of onlookers. He blinked at the oracles to signal that he was ready.

Ira and Malek again entered their visionary states. Both could foresee victory.

""Three,"" both oracles announced simultaneously. The boy's eyes widened.

Ira laughed once more. ""This is never going to work!""

Malek nodded in agreement. ""We need to devise a game of pure chance. For only then can we fairly decide who gets to first guess the number behind this boy's back. Finally, the winning guesser will draw the first stick, therefore playing as the white pieces in our chess match if they draw the longer stick.""

""Wise,"" Ira said half-sarcastically. She drew a silver token from her coin purse hanging from her waist. ""One of us flips the coin, the other calls heads or tails. If the caller is correct, they get to guess the number of fingers behind the boy's back first.""

Malek's gaze once again blanked. Ira closed her eyes. The fat boy beside them continued to nervously sweat.

Several moments passed. The crowd began to murmur to each other with impatience.

Ira opened finally opened her eyes as Malek blinked.

""So,"" Ira asked. ""Who shall flip the coin?""",scottbeckman

He tried to reach for warmth, and found the metal sides of the pod. His mind quickly began remembering where he was. He was in his cryo-stasis pod he had designed all those years ago. Immediately, there was a mechanical grinding noise as the pod door began opening, and the warm air began touching his skin.

Sean began to take a step forward, and found the floor quite quickly. Now heavily shivering, he reached for the support railings he had installed. Supporting himself he tried to remember his surroundings. Cryonic hibernation sickness was set in heavily and he could barely move at this point. 

“How long this time?”

UNKNOWN.

“What do you mean, ‘Unknown’?”

ERROR: NETWORK CONNECTIVITY FAILURE. CANNOT ESTABLISH UPLINK.

Not surprising, the system shuts down every so often to conserve power and network connectivity was satellite based and it took a while for satellites to move back into position. Plus, you can’t exactly get solar power during the winter here.
We were in Antarctica after all.

“Yes, yes. Search for active satellite systems and connect when possible.”

ERROR: NO SATALLITE SYSTEMS DETECTED.

“What?”

NO SATALLITE SYSTEMS DETECTED.

Odd. Usually the system would pick up the NOAA weather station frequently and triangulate the network satellite positions from there. Oh well, must just be a bad time for satellite connection.

“What’s the forecast for today?”

“What?? Run diagnostic on weather system and repeat reading.”

RUNNING… STAND BY.

…

85° F. WINDSPEED AT 23.5 MPH.

“F***. Weather sensors on the surface must be out of whack… Time to bundle up.”

After much stumbling about getting his Antarctic gear on, he went up the long set of stairs to the entrance of the bunker. He slid up the metal lock over the door, and pushed the heavy steel door open.
What he saw… was surprising.

Trees. Everywhere.
There was even grass under his feet. A forest had grown in the most inhospitable place on Earth.

Shoot off a couple million miles into space and let gravity pull you back. It was called the Cochrane Project, after intense suggestion from the online community. Named after a fictional person who developed “warp” drive.

The real thing however, is a little more complicated. The drive bended space-time to literally “surf” on space. By contracting space-time in front of a spacecraft and then expanding it in the rear, you can travel beyond the speed of light. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive)
The quantum and space-time mechanics were a little complicated to get around, but the results speak for themselves. 

FTL travel at this point was now expanding exponentially, and our eyes turned toward the stars.

Our first discoveries of life on other worlds were primordial. Bacteria, simple organisms, …etc. Most of it microscopic. For several decades, we thought we were alone. Until one day we came across a world in the Orion Nebula. From orbit, it was barely apparent there was any life at all. The atmosphere was clouded in toxic hot gases and the surface was nearly barren with little to no water or ice deposits. Then we received the signal from the world.
Simple numerical values, the language of the universe. We responded with our own values, hoping for a response. We then began receiving raw data into our instruments, terabytes at a time. Binary computation, our computer language. After much time decrypting, we had finally uncovered the message.

“It’s disgusting. It’s everything we hate.”

“Honestly, it makes me throw up in my mouth a little bit just thinking about it.”

“He must be really fucked in the mind, man.”

God tilted his head, staring at the blue and green sphere known as “Earth.” *His* Earth. He had worked seven straight days, no sleep, to create this piece of art. His bodily composite had turned into 95% Red Bull *just* so he could have what he saw as the best thing he had yet to do with his life finished by the end of the semester. He held deep admiration for what he had created, but he showed much shame.

Sure, the creation of Earth was *far* from perfect. God knew that. But it was *his*, and he loved it. He planned to watch it forever, with all of its inevitable turmoil. Actually, he knew all of the outcries of distaste spewing from his peers surrounding him were justified. It was a sick, sick world. There was famine, war, sadness, loss, heartbreak, disease, and death.

“God, there’s like five trash cans in this room alone,” a person near to him said, gesturing around the cluttered room full of cosmic art supplies. “Just pick one and throw it away. We all fuck up. It happens, dude.”

“I don’t want to throw it out. I didn’t sleep for seven days for this thing. I like it,” God said on the defense.

“Whatever floats your boat. Or should I say arc? That was one fucked up flood story, bro,” Nick laughed.

“Well, I’m a creator. Not all creations can be perfect. There is no such thing as perfect.”

“They’re in misery,"" Nick said.

“Look closer,” God said, pointing at his basketball sized floating sphere. He handed Nick a magnifying glass. Nick grabbed it and held it where God hovered his pointer finger. Two people were strolling on a sidewalk, orange leaves falling around them and hot chocolate in their hands. They were laughing. God spun the sphere and into focus came the scene of a mother holding her child for the first time, crying. Again, he spun the sphere. It was pouring rain and two people were helping an obviously unhealthy stray dog into their car. One last time, he spun the sphere. Through the magnifying glass they saw a healthy looking woman surrounded by children who were dirty and in need of food. She held a picture book in her hands. As she read to them, they laughed and they smiled, the pain buried deep within their eyes momentarily dissipating.

“But it’s utter chaos,” Nick murmured.

“It is, but without the chaos, where would the precious moments be?” God asked rhetorically, in a delicate manner. “The beauty is in the details.”

[WP] A rendition of a typical Calvinball game.,John_____Doe,"Thank you for joining us ladies and gentleman! I'm your humble sports announcer, Thoreau DeBall, and it's almost time for another exciting game of Calvinball! That's right ladies and gentleman, Calvinball. That fine sport where the only rule is that you can't do the same thing twice. Other than that anything goes!

Here come the players! We have the inventors of Calvinball here with us today, what an honor! Standing at half a tiger's height, spikes yellow hair, red striped shirt and black shorts. It's the one, the only, Caaaaaallllvvvviiiiiinnnn!  

Joining him is the co-creator of the noble game. Standing exactly one tiger's height, orange and black in rakish design, a lover of tuna fish, Hooooooobbbbbbbbeeeessss! Give it up for our players!

Now for the ceremonial beginning of the game. The donning of the black eyes masks, the pre-game dance, and here we go!  Bang a gong and we are on for the 965-tupple Calvinball game!

Calvin takes an early lead by grabbing the red rubber ball. He's making a beeline for the trees while hopping on one foot. Classic Calvin. Oh and he lost the ball. Tackled by Hobbes before he reached the safety tree. As per the rules Calvin must now do the Safety Dance while dodging the ball, otherwise suffer a loss of a point. Ooh so close!  Hobbes barely missed him and now must roll to the flag while Calvin gets to try to get to it first, after rounding the safety trees first of course. 

A tie ladies and gentleman! Can you believe it?! Both of them made it to the flag at the same time. What a play from both players. Looks like some deliberation deciding the next course of action. Looks like Ana ferment was found and now both players must race to the sandbox and back. First one back with the shovel wins the point. 

There they go!  Calvin in an early lead but there goes Hobbes!  A tiger sure can run folks. Oh! He goes down being hit from behind by a well thrown ball!  Dastardly done by Calvin but well within the rules. There's the retaliation with Calvin behind thrown bodily into the air...landing into the sand box! He managed to turn it into an advantage! Play of the game so far folks!

Here they come back, scrapping and fighting trying to take the shovel. Hobbes has the reach advantage but Calvin has the grit! Who is going to come out top? Calvin goes over! Tripped by Hobbes and Hobbes gets to the flag. Wait. Where's the shovel?  In his tail!  Hobbes had it in his tail! Oh my goodness!

Hobbes gets the flag but instead of scoring he uses it to force a punishment. The I'm Very Sorry Song! A classic classic play. All rise for the song of you please. 

Well sung Calvin, well sung! It always brings a tear to my eye. Now Calvin is free to act and you can see the gears grinding in his head. He runs off, and comes back with a bucket of water balloons!  It's time for rain of balloons ladies and gentlemen! Let's see the red balloons fly!

Aaaannnnd there you have it folks. This game is over and the score is 7 to G, another tie game. What a game!

Mission completed, he screeched at them and disappeared out the door just as sudden, just as quickly as he had come. 

Still in paralyzed disbelief, the homeowners heard another door being kicked off its hinges, their neighbors screamin, and the sound of glass being shattered.

[WP] A man wants to have the oldest running lightbulb by eliminating all the competition.,MagentaField,"The man’s journey was an odd one. The man didn’t know how it dawned on him, but one mundane day while admiring his kitchen he decided he wanted his lightbulb to be the oldest running lightbulb in the world.

The problem was he couldn’t manipulate time or anything. He didn’t own a time machine and he spent nights thinking about how he could pull off this consternating task.

Suddenly, as if a lightbulb went off in his head, he had a brilliant idea. If he couldn’t better his own lightbulb, he could just ""not-better"" the rest of the competition.

That is, through cold-blooded destruction.

At first, he spent nights sneaking into homes breaking lightbulbs left and right. He spent a month doing this and he even made local news as the “Lightbulb Lunatic.” Not a very stylish name, but that’s beside the point.

He soon realized this was inefficient. He broke, say, 400 lightbulbs, and he read an article somewhere that the U.S. sold 2 billion lightbulbs in one year alone. 

Needless to say, he’s got a lot more bulbs to break.

He raised the stakes. Through valiant acts, he convinced the local save-the-earth group to advertise “destroy your incandescent and switch to fluorescent!” Not only that, but he worked his way within a major lightbulb company to sell cheap defective fluorescent lightbulbs. Working a bit of political magic, highly-hypnotic propaganda, and under-handed corporate techniques, the slogan quickly spread, and the company made a monopoly of the fluorescent lightbulb market. It didn’t matter that is was fluorescent, more importantly, it mattered that he got defective bulbs in peoples’ hands.

It’s better not to question the logic or sanity in his tactics, the important part was that the man did it. While he did all that, he continued his night raids, along with a couple of friends. He eventually roped the unemployed and poor to join, using his cut of the fluorescent lightbulb sales to pay them handsomely. He was doing quite well, shining ever brightly with his will to make his lightbulb number one.

But it wasn’t enough. He barely cracked into his state, let alone the world. The slogan was spreading like hotcakes, but it wasn’t enough. With his newly founded riches, he set up a secret research facility, which aimed at researching ways to break lightbulbs efficiency on a global scale.

In the meantime, he worked deals with many influential celebrities and political leaders. He paid them to advertise the switch as well as to denounce proper lightbulb usage. He also infiltrated the fashion and homeowners’ scene, and somehow worked fluorescent lighting or better yet no lighting as the current aesthetic. He was about to run out of money when a secret cult, “The Fluorescent Flashers”, donated a huge sum to him “anonymously”. It’s better not to question their purpose or activities, the important thing is that the man was back on track and rolling.

Many people started complaining about the defective lighting, but at this point, the man had already sparked the support of many other pro-environment organizations against light pollution. Thanks to his efforts at the fashion and homeowners’ scene plus a viral video he uploaded (which he monetized for revenue), which subtly advertised at fluorescent aesthetics despite the inherent lack of use, the complaints mattered less and less.

The problem still remained that many people still had regular lightbulbs. Through some way or another his flashlight cult spread, and their influence skyrocketed worldwide. They made lightbulbs taboo, promoting defective fluorescents or no lights at all, causing many to fear. Many of the reluctant ones made their decisions then. They made a whole lot of “donations” to the cult, in which the cult generously handed to the man, their “shadow leader”.

Not even the man could’ve predicted this outcome, but nonetheless, it worked in his favor. He carried on his nightly raids, further promoting towards the cult’s power and influence, and his group increased from 200 people to 3 million in that short span of time. Eventually, it became nationwide as the money kept flowing in, then it captured the continent. Then it spread internationally. Eventually, there were light-night-raiders all around the world. He eventually switched from having the raiders destroy lightbulbs to secure them, so he can recycle them into defective fluorescents. Another source of revenue, which he used to pay more light-night-raiders.

But it wasn’t enough. A worldwide militia doesn’t provide enough firepower. Plus there were some crafty resistors among the bunch who held onto their lightbulbs in secret. A band of the ex-poor and untrained crazies can’t hope to stop them.

That’s why the man formed a new group. A lightbulb hitman group. He hired the best hitmen across the world, paying top dollar, to blast as many lightbulbs as they can. They were confused at first, but if you slap anyone with a wad of cash they will comply. And they did. Well, they also got mad, initially. Regardless, their numbers only increased.

News caught up with this and lightbulb action movies became the new hit genre. Of course, not many were willing to keep their mouths shut. Governments and law enforcement tried their very best to suppress the movement, but they couldn’t. They were too late to stop anything.

A lightbulb revolution was underway. With the support of pro-earth/anti-light-pollution groups, big corporate organizations looking to cash in on the fluorescent business bribed political leaders, and an ignorant hive-mind mass-following, the pressure was on. The number of capable resistors dwindled.

It was here the man hit a stop. He was confused with how to proceed, but then he received a call. It was from his research facility he established earlier. They said they found a way to stop and disrupt *all* lightbulbs with a specific frequency, with the blacklist exception of his, of course. They can transmit it through radio, and other wavelengths, and it was extremely inexpensive to make.

This is the final phase. He mass-produced many of these devices and distributed them within his light-night-raiders. As for his hitmen, well, they prefer to do things the old-fashioned way. He also secretly incorporated it in radio broadcasts and television broadcasts worldwide secretly. It was inaudible, so it was perfect. Now with all this, no light bulb is safe. He had almost done it.

And he was finished. He did it. It was a long struggle, but he finally eradicated the competition. A sense of pride welled through the man as it dawned on him that he really did have the oldest running lightbulb. All the other ones were newer, defective fluorescents, or no fluorescent at all. He couldn't *completely* stop all lightbulbs, he understood, and he knew his revolution wouldn't last forever: he only stalled for the moment. Even so, it didn't matter as he was confident his lightbulb was the last *running* lightbulb. If someone were to make a working one later on, it still wouldn't affect the outcome.

He was about to take a picture of his masterpiece when suddenly, the lightbulb flickered off and a piercing sound erupted.

It had shattered.

Unbeknownst to the man, he had spent so much time paying attention to all the other lightbulbs in the world that he neglected his own. Also, it was a cheap lightbulb he bought at a garage sale, I mean what did he expect?
 
Welp.

He had already ridden the world of all the other lightbulbs: his was the last currently functioning one. He suddenly remembered an old fluorescent prototype bulb he kept hidden in his closet, a failed experiment developed by that first major lightbulb company he coaxed into monopolizing fluorescents. He fixed it on his kitchen fan and admired it.

The man thought about this fluorescent lights and remembered all the other fluorescent lights in the world, albeit defective. Tainted by his ambition and success, he frowned in thought.

Then, he suddenly had a bright idea.

________

I was able to narrow my choices down to four, after much consideration.
Picking three out of these was terribly difficult, and figuring out how to order them is nearly impossible. I've already re-arranged them several times.
Ultimately it's a case of my preference in genre, fighting with the sheer readability factor, and the all important World-Building aspect.


My 'Runner Up' choice was /u/poiyurt for ""**Golden Years**"", and honestly this pair of stories and the other three top placers were all slugging it out for a spot, truly it was just because I tried to take the ""World-Building"" aspect into account as impartially as possible, because if I wasn't, it would have definitely nabbed first place. (Damn you, conscience!) I felt that both stories were so enjoyable as character pieces, and it was just the 'expansion' aspect that I found to be quite subtle by comparison. Even now, I'm asking myself ""how much expansion does there really have to be?""  Mea Culpa. 
Your absolutely charming manner of storytelling is the kind that I know I would enjoy reading more of, particularly based on how delightful I found the first story, and I only wish there was another placing, so that I could put yours in there too. 



As for the three that got placed:

Nimoon21's **The Ocean and Island of Airdunia**  - For sheer inventiveness, in just the right amount! A great pleasure to read.


WinsomeJesse's **Brave &amp; New**  - A story that I would enjoy in novel form, I think. It's very hard to compress what really has such large scope into just two short stories, I felt that it would have enjoyed breathing if it was allowed a little more detail than the constraints of the competition allowed, so to manage to condense all that you did, and still make them both compelling tales, was really impressive.


Draco_Nix's **The Endless Ocean** - I really enjoyed this story as well. Both were great standalone pieces, and I really liked the evolutionary linking between the two, 'many years down the track.'  Extremely well told. I would like to say that out of the majority of entries in this challenge, yours had one of the strongest second stories, for me. There was so much to like about it.

_____

For the ones that did not make it quite to my top four, please know that it was just for small quirks and reasons - all of you had very strong stories, and it will have been just a little something in the second ones, for me. I was making notes as I read each entry, so I've copy pasta'd these below. :)

I found all of them quite readable and enjoyable, and mostly it was a case of me finding the second stories leaning a bit more towards the 'exposition' side. Not even in a bad way. It was honestly a very hard call to make.


**Mage Hunters** /u/Syraphia  - a wonderful concept, and pulling off that particular tense in writing is a feat worthy of praise in itself. Had a couple of moments where my visualisation of what was happening in Story Two got a little  bit thrown. (in particular, the fighting through the small window sequence, I think mostly that was due to my initial interpretation of the shape of the window!) - but it finished well and provided a nice counterpoint to the initial story.


**More than Forged Iron** - /u/TillingWriter - Absolutely loved the first story, just found the follow-up one a bit less balanced in its dialogue/actions ratio (and occasionally a little hard to follow who was saying what), although the second one had a lovely opening and equally well matched philosopical ending! If this had been a competition of just standalone stories, your first one would have been a top contender.


**A Mountain Between** - /u/mialbowy  - great descriptive writing, you have a lovely way of seating the PoV of the character into a good narrative context for the surroundings, it was just perhaps a little too sedate in the second one to grab me fully, in a short story format. But lovely environment setting, nonetheless, and very easy to read!


**Kinesis** - /u/TheCele - definitely getting the good Bladerunner style of vibe going here! Really compelling first story with great visuals. There was perhaps just a bit too much time-jumping going on in the second for me to keep immersed in it as easily, but I liked the sci/psy-fi you had going, there!



Overall it was a very hard field to choose from, and I'll reiterate, if it was just on being chosen on single standalone stories, you'd all be giving me a near impossible task! :) May you all continue to take great pleasure in writing, for you are all very very good!

I fell in love with this when I was voting in the first round and, whilst all the winning entries are excellent, this one still resonates the most with me.

2nd Place for /u/Draco_Nix for ""The Endless Ocean""

I'm starting to see a pattern of ocean themes here, perhaps my voting is not just the quality of the writing but also my particular tastes.

3rd Place for /u/Syraphia for ""The Mage Hunters""

The shortest entry but packs a lot into a few words. I found it easy to slip into this world and become thoroughly immersed.

This was so hard to choose. None of the stories I didn't vote for were lacking in quality and imagination, so a huge thank you to everyone who made the effort. It's been a pleasure.

p.s. How do I get me one of them there flairs?

/u/Nimoon21 

I mean, what is there to say? It was a fantastic set of stories and I'd love to see more in this world. And to know what the hell was in the cave and at the bottom of the ocean, I mean, you really like keeping secrets, don't you? This is the point where I'd point out a flaw or two, but I can't find any, so on you go.


/u/poiyurt

I voted for you in first place last round, so you know my opinion already! 


/u/mialbowy

I’m going to be honest here: there was a drastic difference in quality between your two stories. The first one was fantastic and the feeling of wonder was really, really strong and brought tears to my eye. But the second one was just boring. Yet it did build the world and made me interested in it, something most other stories didn’t, which is why you got the third place.

[WP] Write a story about why the last person on Earth keeps their door locked.,MaxVitaminD3,"Delores walks through the empty rooms of her old home checking to make sure everything is turned off.  The solar panels on her roof and battery pack provide her more than enough energy but she has grown accustomed to making sure not to waste any during the night.  She also locks the doors and applies door stops and window jams, nothing getting in or out.  Then she puts the keys in a box that doesn’t open until morning.

Two years ago giant holes opened up in the ground all over the world causing massive damage to infrastructure and millions of deaths.  Then people started disappearing in the night.  Over the course of just a couple months the population of the world went from eight billion to just one person. 

Delores spends most of her days riding around town on her bike or rollerblading down the empty streets of her hometown.  She’s an avid reader and has ransacked the local libraries several times.

Once she visited the large hole that had opened up a mile outside of town, but only once and in the daylight.  The sight of the hole gave her a horrible feeling and even worse she swore she could hear her daughter calling out to her.  She felt an urge to jump in and be with her daughter again.  But that’s crazy.  Her daughter didn’t fall in the hole, she got sick and died and was buried behind Delores’ house.

The days aren’t so bad.  During the day she can bottle up the emptiness and longing and put them away and out of her mind.  But eventually night comes.  And in the dark of night when she closes her eyes to go to sleep she sees her family and friends and cries herself to sleep.  Those are the good nights.

Tonight, like most nights, while lying in her bed she hears her daughter calling to her as if the hole were right outside her window.  As if in a dream she gets up and tries to go outside and follow that voice only to find herself locked in.  She pounds on the doors and collapses to the floor.  The voice fades as if knowing she can’t leave and Delores screams “Don’t leave me!” But it’s too late, the night is quiet again.

She knows it’s only a matter of time before she forgets to lock a door or close a window and when that happens she’ll wander out into the darkness and never come back.  

Tonight, however, all the doors and windows are locked and she’ll have to wait until morning to open them.

[WP] Write a story about why the last person on Earth keeps their door locked.,MaxVitaminD3,"Today is tomorrow, yesterday is today. I do not know how long I have been here, how long since the bombs fell and the world fell silent. All I know is, I am alone.

New York, London, Moscow, Beijing. Once great metropolises bustling with life, towering achievements of man's ingenuity and progress are now cold grey irradiated grave yards, reminders of man's shallowness and self-destructive tendencies. It's not just the cities, even the countryside which was once so green and fertile is now nothing but dust and ashes; a wasteland devoid of life, devoid of hope. Yet somehow I'm still alive.


I have not left my bunker since the bombs fell, even if I wanted to I can't. The very air itself is now poison. The ground can grow nothing. Even the toughest of animals are all gone. So I sit here day after day, surviving and staring at the locked door of my bunker hoping desperately that one day I will hear a knock, but I know I wont. So I spend my time watching old films and eating my rations day after day, month after month, year after year.

There is another reason I do not open the door. In here no bombs have dropped, everything is still normal. In here I have a couch, a television and all the home comforts one could ever need. I even have my family and my job. Not literally of course. I imagine them sitting beside me on the couch as we watch Fraiser, I'm wearing my suit with my tie loosened around my neck, just home from work . I used to be an Lecturer before all this. I loved it. Everyday I got to talk to young people with their whole lives ahead of them, I saw friendships formed and the beginnings of relationships, I saw fallouts and tragedies, I saw people wander off into the world full of hope and promise, I saw life. Life in it all of it's wonderful ecstatic highs and deep, dark lows. I didn't realise it at the time but it was all so beautiful.

I guess that's why I'm still here. I don't want to let go of that. I could open the door and get lost in the wastes, but as long as the door remains closed there are no wastes. As long as the door remains closed I am just home from work on a Friday afternoon watching television with my family. As long as the door remains closed I am not alone.

[WP] Write a story about why the last person on Earth keeps their door locked.,MaxVitaminD3,"The last man on earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.

The man's head jerked toward the door, his eyes widening. He knew that the Plague had wiped out everyone else. There was no way anyone could be knocking on the door.

He slowly walked over to the door and looked at it for a moment. He contemplated whether or not he should open it. If it wasn't a human on the other side -- and it's definitely not -- did he really want to open the door? He didn't have anything with which to defend himself in this room.

He put his hand on the doorknob and took a deep breath. He slowly turned it, and the wood creaked as the man pulled the door open.

He gasped.

This couldn't be real. The man's eyes had to be deceiving him. There's no way that could have been what knocked on the door. He knew this because the man himself had just been across the room... hadn't he?

He stared at his reflection in the mirror on the other side of the door, wondering what his mind had come to.",NKrishnaStark
[WP] Write a story about why the last person on Earth keeps their door locked.,MaxVitaminD3,"My apartment is a fortress. Every window is barricaded, every door locked and covered with heavy furniture for good measure.

Somehow, I have made it two years and one hundred eight-seven days like this. I see the sun in fervent bursts between sheets of steel.

I sit alone in the darkness, huddled in blankets, waiting like I always do for things I cannot control: hunger, sleep, night, day, death. I am not my own, not even myself. It's a bitter thing, the last human on earth feeling less than human. I am this in between thing, an animal who's all too aware of the futility of its existence. But I have a basement full of shit in bags so that no predators, supernatural or otherwise, can find me by my scent. It doesn't get much more human than that, does it?

I want to pace but I do not dare move.

When there were still other people, the stories and rumors raged online and in person, back when we saw the Night Men and did not know to hide. Some thought they were an elaborate hoax. My parents and a few of my co-workers insisted that it was a judgment of God, though their faith did not keep them from the same fate.

In the end, we learned the truth too late.

If the Night Man touches you, you dissolve into a pile of black carbon, and the wind picks you up and scatters you over the unflinching earth. Seven billion piles of ash, and I am the only one left.

Tonight I open up my last can of food. Fruit cocktail. A depressing last supper. I spear it out of the can with a fork and chew slowly, unable to stop thinking about hunger yet to come.

I watch the door. I haven't decided if I will let myself starve to death in dignity, or if I will follow the way of my lost species.

I don't have time to decide for myself.

Three heavy, dull knocks came at my door.

I shovel fruit cocktail in my mouth, too terrified to run. But I need to run. Soon. Need to eat. Can't miss another meal. My vision is coated with shimmering fish scales. Running and not running are both death.

If this is it, I might as well finish my dinner.

My fork scrapes against the bottom of the can. 

The door knob begins to rattle.

I bolt upstairs to to the hideaway attic, where my only uncovered window remains. A damn desperate racoon pried his way in here a few months earlier, and I never got brave enough to look for new scrap to fix it.

I peer out the window. My street is black and empty, except for the cluster of dark shapes, floating there in the darkness, like pieces of the sky ripped out and placed on my doorstep. Their eyes glow like opals, roving, and one of those sets of eyes turns and locks onto mine.

I scramble back from the window by the Night Man is already on top of my roof. Now that it knows it's seen it has a shape. It looks nearly like a human, its skin like night speckled with stars. It reaches for me with horribly long fingers, its eyes vacant and cold.

I hold up my hand and manage, my voice shuddering, ""Don't--"" just as its fingers clasp over my own.

The last human on earth crumbled into dust.

Even as Paul is locked in a cell somewhere else there are volunteers to be with him at the moment. 'Morgan,' he says as he calls me over and introduces me to the federal prosecutors. 'Anything?'

'One of them had a cell,' I said as I held it up. 'Passed in with their overalls. We're interrogating the prisoner in charge of the station that day. But even more interesting, we found this message.'

One prosecutor took it and quickly read it over. 'It says, ""We paid the guard to get El Gigante into the adjacent cell and to let you in, take him out and you got a place"",' she narrated.

The other one looked at me with boredom. 'I guess that this ""Paul"" is real fucking big,' he sighed

Before either I or the warden could say anything, Jacobson was over to the lawyers. 'Here's the security footage of the incident,' he said to them.

And then their eyes went wide. 'Fucking hell,' the male said. 'That's not a person, that's a bison with its fur shaved off!'

The woman tried to keep her composure. 'What's he in for?'

'Involuntary manslaughter,' the warden said. 'He... tripped on a can of beans and crushed an old lady.'

'Wow,' a lab tech said as he glanced at the footage. 'This wasn't an initiation, this was someone tricking them into an execution.'

'I don't know,' the Warden said. 'Paul would never hurt a fly if he could help it.'

'A bull is gentle if it can help it,' the lab tech said. 'Still wouldn't want to be in a pen with it when I shove a stun-gun into its side.

'Do you see the size of his feet, Delia?' the second DA asked. 'His soles are bigger than Ullman.'

'Wow, that's saying something,' the woman said as she thought of her larger-than-life boss. 'Look, I'm willing to chalk this up to a self-defense charge for Charlie, but those inmates all committed attempted murder. We have to investigate that angle further.'

'And I'll try and keep it quiet that this was an initiation hit,' I said. 'Paul's got a lot of friends in here. If someone finds out that a gang was involved - or a guard - it could lead to a riot or lynching.'

---

'Can I have my shoes back yet?' Paul said weakly while sitting limply inside his cell. 'I don't really care for the jumpsuit, but the ground is hard.'

'Sorry, they're currently evidence,' Frank said. 'We're getting you a new pair in.'

Paul merely sighed as he sat in the cage. The guard wasn't even the slightest bit afraid in case Paul wanted to escape, that would be rather easy for him to kick the door or even the wall in to escape. Of course, that would never happen, he's too much of a softy to let that happen.

He was called away on his radio by another guard as Morgan came in. 'The DAs want to question you about what happened,' he said. 'Head into Interview room 4.'

He merely shrugged before moving from his post and heading down the hall. He handed his gun over to the guard at the armory, the prison rules, before he walked inside. 'You wanted to see me?' Frank asked.

And as soon as he realized the room was empty he was shoved in my three other guards who locked the door behind them.

'What the fu-' he tried to scream before having his jaw broken.

'Do you know the biggest flaw with the latest phone you got?' Greg asked Frank. 'It records all the phone calls it makes unless you disable it... so you recorded yourself talking to the head of the Tezcas to kill Paul for their initiation. We can also prove that you forged the cell transfers to get him in there. The warden is having his signature checked right now. Or how about... the fact that you discussed with the judge about hiding this video?'

One of the guards held up a tablet and played the incriminating evidence, a security video of the accident that landed Paul in prison. 'Oh, shit,' Frank groaned through his broken mouth.

'Sons of bitches,' Greg sneered. 'Both of you. You *knew* that the judge's son was a bully who tormented Paul, you *knew* that the son has caused the accident to trick him into crushing his car. You knew the cut-down video footage exonerated him and instead you took a bribe. What is wrong with you?!'

'Oh, give me a fucking break,' Frank sneered. 'We aren't meant to give a fuck if they're innocent or guilty! We just lock them up. What makes Paul any more different than any other bastard stuck in here? Do you even care if anyone else is stuck in here and innocent? Why don't you prove it.'

'I got four prisoners freed after showing the DA forged evidence,' Greg said. 'I even got the real criminals behind bars. I am not the one you should be giving a lecture about the evils of inaction to.'

'You're too soft to be a guard,' Frank said.

'At least I'm not dirty,' Greg said.

'You busted my jaw!' Frank yelled.

'And I'm going to be suspended,' Greg said dismissively. 'And you're going to be fired. Have a nice day.'",res30stupid

Although I am closer to the Juggernaut than to the Hulk in terms of frame - standing close to ten feet and a ton of weight actually makes me larger than the Green Giant. 

Doctors diagnosed me with severe giantism from a young age because of it. Life was difficult in terms of logistics; I outgrew most children's clothing at 8, adult clothing when I was 13 and even my own parents' home at 16. Everything I had to wear was bespoke, designed for durability due to my excessive brute strength.

Then, when I entered the prison people feared me, thinking, ""He's obviously murdered someone. Must've simply lifted someone like a Christmas cracker then pulled them apart."" Others would join in, saying, ""No, he crushed them beneath his enormous feet. Made the police think that the murders were in fact elephant tramplings from a circus that came into town."" Although I was rather amused by the rumor that, ""He's only in here because he kept braking prostitutes. At least when they died it must've been pure bliss!""

And why wouldn't they fear me? I have to squeeze into and out of my cell each day and night, when I first came in here I have dedicated time in the exercise yard, I eat enough for 20 prisoners' whole days for only a single meal... They've even placed me in the solitary ward on a few occasions when others believe they can take me on. That's mainly due to new inmates thinking they can take on the ""Giant Freak"" for some respect.

Although I do get into general population and nearly everyone knows I wouldn't intentionally hurt a fly... In fact, when most people find out why I'm in prison they outright say that I shouldn't be in here, even the prison guards. Hell, even a few whom I've befriended started looking into my conviction to the point my attorney said I could get it overturned.

And yet, I'm currently in lock-up because... Well, *an* inmate didn't try and establish himself in the prison hierarchy by going after me. *Several* inmates did. They were even competing to see how quickly they could take me down.

Right now the federal attorneys are here with crime scene investigators to discuss what to do with me. I mean, I don't blame them. Eight attackers and six of them are dead while two are stable but permanently scarred. For now the general concensus among the investigators is that I was responsible for all of it.

I don't really know... Did I? I was in such a panic that I have no honest recollection besides what I've been told so far. Even now, as I try and dissuade if the fatalities are even my fault.

Typical. Stuck in prison for the crime I'm accused of - involuntary manslaughter. Sometimes I wish I hadn't fallen and flattened that old lady.",res30stupid

And a far more wrinkled brow,

Shoulders weighed down by a career's demands,

To be uplifted two weeks from now. 

The notice was saved as a pdf,

Attached to a stale email in drafts, 

For tenure alone was why he was left,

And his position had to be staffed. 

Across the table was one his junior,

With a stain across his shirt,

But to the elder baby boomer,

This position he would not skirt.

The new one asked, and rubbed a reddened eye,

""And if I fail, can I do my best,

To just give it another second try?""

""We dare not discriminate,

Should you provide a doctors note. 

Which shall therefore authenticate,

""You shouldn't."" you reply candidly, anxious to get out of there.

He grins then lets out a hefty laugh. It continues for a good 5 seconds, 5 seconds too long. You nervously let out an awkward laugh with a very confused look on your face.

""Humor, we appreciate that at this company,"" He says still with a wide grin piercing his straight face. The smile looks awkward and unpracticed on him, he clearly hasn't smiled like that in a very long time. 
""I normally like seriousness in the workplace but a good chuckle has been known to improve overall productivity. But anyway, let's move onto the next question: What are your defining attributes?""

You cheer internally, grateful for this easy escape to this torturous interview. 

""Well, i'm very lazy, I sleep in every other day so I probably won't be showing up for work on time, and my breath nearly always smells of burning trash"" You say in a nearly joyful tone.

""Ah, you sly dog! That question almost always gets my interviewees, it's a trick question you see. Most people just say they are a perfectionist or some boring cliche thing like that... but you. You were honest and differentiated yourself from the crowd. It's really rare to find someone as unique and truthful are you.""

Every word is agonizing. You've tried everything but it all seems to just make him like you more. 

""Final question: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"" 

Clearly your initial strategy isn't strong enough. Time for a more radical approach.

""Not in this dump"" you mutter. You try to make it sound like you're speaking under your breath but keep it loud enough for him to hear. If this doesn't work you don't know what will.

""Great! I love someone with some ambition, and just between you and me, I think you're right. I see you going places, 5 years and you'll be moving to out to our headquarters in Washington. Well, I'll go get the paperwork, you're hired!""

As he heads for the door, you shout after him, nearly pleading with him

""Look sir, you know I've been nothing but a deceitful idiot this entire time. Why in god's name are you hiring me!?""

""Exactly, the most important traits for any upcoming politician!"" 

And with a wink he walks out the door, leaving you in shock, contemplating your new job.

I regretted filling out the application. I had been in marketing my whole life, and made enough to send the kids to college while paying off an alimony or two. I was good, real good, and people noticed. I thought maybe it was time to move into a cushy part time position before retiring. But here? I was out of my depth.

I had wanted to pull out pretty much as soon as the application was in the mail, but Jake had convinced me to see it through. Imagine how funny it would be to show up and just act like an idiot. Whatever, I didn't have anything better to do.

""So, Chris,"" the main interviewer asked the fat man who was sweating nervously. ""What experience do you have that makes you qualified for the executive -""

""Excuse me, excuse me!"" I interrupted, in the over the top cartoon voice I had used to read bedtime stories. ""You're asking Chris too many questions, it's not fair, let me answer one.""

The interviewer seemed flustered, but the woman beside him just smiled and nodded. ""Alright John, what about you, how does your prior experience lend you to the job?""

""Well, I'd just like to say, it's funny how everyone else is getting these lowballs, but you keep hitring me with these 'gotcha's'. It's really unprofessional, and, I believe, indicative of what's wrong with business today, so I'm gunna fix that.""

If I was expecting to be dismissed, I was wrong. She just smiled and jotted something down. 

The night went on in much of the same way. Honestly, I don't remember much, I was too busy trying to think of dumb things to say. I think at one point I interrupted Bob and suggested racially profiling our workers to combat theft, and everyone just smiled and nodded. 

As I was leaving the building for my car, the lead interviewer pulled me aside. He seemed excited, glancing around, then speaking on hished tones.

I hid my sweating palms and my shaking hands behind my desk. It had gone on so long...

""Look. You have all the qualifications we're looking for. All I need is your signature, and you'll be set. But... how about we grab a coffee first?""

The young man smiled and agreed. What did he know? He wanted to get in good with whoever pulled enough weight he could make a paycheck. I understood that.

""Before you sign anything... This job isn't what you think it is. Frankly, I have no idea what it is. Nobody does. I started here almost twelve years ago. I didn't even want the position; my parents made me apply...""

---

Wearing a stained T-shirt and a pair of ripped jeans, sporting a lovely three-day growth of untrimmed beard, I waltzed into Business Corporation Associates, Inc., and tossed a grubby resume on the secretary's desk. ""Interview with wassname.""

The secretary, full of professionalism, smiled warmly. ""Mr. Manager is waiting in his office, please go through.""

I shrugged through the door and plopped down sideways in a chair. Mr. Manager stood, offering his hand; I handed him my gum wrapper. All he did was chuckle and toss the wrapper in the trash. ""Glad to see the youth are thinking about the environment these days,"" he rumbled. ""Back in my day, kids just tossed their trash on the ground. Now, young man, I hear you're interested in a position here!""

I shrugged. ""Meh. It wasn't my idea. Parents said I needed a job.""

He chuckled again. ""You listen to your parents, eh? If only my kids were as polite! Now, tell me - what are you looking for in our company?""

I locked eyes with him, holding my gaze until it was long past uncomfortable. ""Nothing. Get it?""

He nodded as if I had made some deep comment, and answered, ""Of course, of course. Ask not what your company can do for you, and all that. Very dedicated! What would you say to a management position?""

I stared at him incredulously. My plan had been another summer lounging around my parent's basement, playing video games. It almost sounded like this man was going to offer me a job in spite of my actions! I sat up. ""No way, man. I'm not about to sign up to be some money-grubbing pencil-pusher like you.""

I thought about it for a second, then just in case, added, ""Corporate freak.""

Mr. Manager grinned. ""Good! I'm glad to hear it! Too many kids these days want a clear shot to the top, no effort. Working your way up from the bottom, that's the ticket! Learn from the little guy!""

He stood, rubbing his hands together. ""Young man, I would like to introduce you to someone. Mr. Engineer. I think you'll hit it off just fine. Back in a tick, eh?""

He rounded his desk, pushed through the doors, and headed down the hall as I broke out in a cold sweat. I didn't know how to do... well, anything! Whatever they put me in, it would definitely not be video games. And if I *lost* a job... well, let's just say that it would be better to have never tried at all that to have tried and failed, no matter what . Dad was very particular about ""honest work,"" and he was prepared to back that up. But if last year had taught me anything, it was that if I couldn't get a job, I was fine. I needed to do something. Anything. What was the worst thing I could do? I gave a sidelong glance at the leather-covered desk. Maybe... if I left an, er, gift? But just before I could unzip my pants, the door swung open. Startled and already more than a little jumpy, I whirled, bringing my fist around in a wide punch that smacked right into the face of, I presume, Mr. Engineer.

His head bounced off the wall, the door, and two chairs before it came to rest on the floor. Mr. Manager walked in to find me staring down at the unconscious, and likely wildly concussed, form. ""Oh good heavens! Come with me, straight to security!""

Well, it wasn't what I'd planned, but as long as they didn't press charges, this was the best outcome I could have hoped for! Or at least, that's what I thought.

Jittery from the sudden influx of adrenaline, I missed the first part of what Mr. Manager told the security guard. I tuned in to hear him finish, ""This young man laid him out with a single punch!""

Two other security officers had dashed upstairs half way through, likely trying to restore Mr. Engineer to life. The security man, a beefy, middle-aged fellow with a name tag the read ""Security,"" and in smaller letters, ""B. Security,"" held out his hand. Meekly, I held out both of mine... and blinked when he grabbed my right hand and started pumping it up and down. ""Good work, son. I don't know how that man slipped past security, but if it wasn't for your quick wits, it might have been 1992 all over again.""

As my jaw dropped in absolute horror, Mr. Manager clapped me on the shoulder. ""You don't even need to sign anything, young man, we'll get it all sorted when you come in next week. Don't worry about coming in until Monday, you rest up! I'm sure this was quite the ordeal!""

I was hardly out the front door before the man I'd knocked out was being lead outside in cuffs. What had I gotten myself in to?

---

I stared down into my coffee cup. ""That wasn't the worst of it, of course. When I started, I was trying to avoid work, but every time I slipped away, someone caught me brainstorming - that is, sleeping - or team-building - that is, playing video games on my work computer. Every move I made, I was praised. I got raise after raise...""

I lifted my eyes to those of the young man on the other side of the table. He seemed a little unsure of himself. ""But... isn't that a dream come true?""

I leaned over the table. He flinched back. Good, he *should* be scared.

""No, kid, you don't get it. People call me every day, asking if the Paper Report is ready, or if the Sheet Documents have been signed. I make things up. I sat in on a random meeting because they had donuts, and somehow saved the company a million dollars. Or rubles. I don't know. Maybe it was Zimbabwean dollars. That's not the point, though. I've given presentations that were nothing but the blank templates, and gotten *standing ovations*. It's insane! It's mind boggling!""

The kid pushed his half-filled mug to the side, surreptitiously glancing at his watch. ""So... uh... you really have no idea what you're doing?""

I shook my head. ""You're not listening. *No one* knows what they're doing. No one! Everyone talks about nothing! They give vague figures, present charts and graphs that have been lifted off Google Image Search - like, the first images - and act like they know what they're doing! Everyone does it, and everyone else acts like they're the greatest thing since NASA! The whole company is mad - **mad** I tell you!""

I slumped weakly back against my chair, wiping the spittle from my lips. The kid looked a little more sure of himself, now. Maybe I gave him an out. Maybe the poor fool could get out, while there was still time.

He nodded sagely. ""Ah! I understand what you're saying!""

I almost wept with relief. He understood! It wasn't just me! Finally, there was someone I could connect with, someone who-

""So you're saying it's a marketing firm - right? Awesome! When do I start?""",I_Arman

"[WP] You were forced to attend an interview for a job you do not want, but, no matter how hard you try to screw up the interview, the interviewer just becomes more keen to hire you.",NoobPrompter,"This has actually happened to me. I worked my way through university as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), driving an ambulance (and working in the back of the ambulance) for a private company in Chicago.  One Sunday afternoon, before my 6 pm - 6 am shift, I got a page asking if I was still planning on coming in. This struck me as an odd question - I wasn't one to not show up for my shifts. I called back and asked what was going on, and got a follow up question: ""Are you coming in to the Melrose Park garage?"" When I responded that I didn't know we had another garage, I was informed that the company had been sold, and operations had been moved to Tinley Park, which was a 2+ hour drive from my house. After clarifying that I would indeed be around for my shift, assuming it started (**and finished**) at the old location, I realized that my time of employment at that company had come to a close.

The next morning, after my shift (and in between classes) I called the unemployment office, explained what had happened, and asked if I would be elegible for unemployment, despite not really having been fired. They answered, ""Yes, in your situation, you are eligible. Benefits will start in two weeks, and can run as long as six months."" I was set to make about two thirds of what I had been making, untaxed. Now, I wasn't desperate for money at this point. My wife was working, and we had a killer deal on rent. I was also just 4 months from graduating, and could use the time off for studying for finals. We were also planning to spend six weeks in Peru right after graduation (for an internship) before moving back to California. If I could get paid through all of that, it would be a sweet deal indeed.

To make unemployment work however, the government requires that you try to find a new job. To get the charade of job searching started, I called all of the other ambulance companies in town and told them that I wanted a job. When I had first moved to Chicago, it had taken me months to have an ambulance company even return my calls. To my surprise, I had a call back within an hour, from a company fifteen minutes from my house.

They asked me to come in in two days for an interview. Frustrated, I showed up, and chatted with the receptionist and another woman before the interview. I told them that I was just looking for a job for a few months, because I would be moving. It turns out that the other woman was the HR director. She asked me into her office, and asked me to clarify about wanting a job for just a few months.

I knew that failing this interview was going to be easy. Every softball she lobbed up, I swung at and missed. ""Where do you see yourself in five years?""

""Probably living out of the country, doing a job having nothing to do with emergency medicine.""

""How long do you intend to work here?""

""About three and a half months.""

What EMS system are you a part of, Chicago or Highland Park?""

""I'm not sure.""

""What is your availability?""

""I'm only available for Sunday night overnight shifts, and Tuesday and Thursday day shifts, and I would need to work all of those shifts.""

And so on and so on. And with every lame answer, she just got happier and happier. They liked to see people who were improving their lives and not just stuck in the same job rut. They needed someone for Sunday nights and Tuesday/Thrusday days. If I didn't know what medical system I was a part of, then surely I was a part of the Highland Park system (I was), and that was the system they were a part of too. Oh, and because I was experienced, they'd start me off at the same pay scale I had worked my way up to at my last job. Before I knew it, I was signed up for orientation three days later.

Oh well. It really wasn't a bad place to work. It was close to home, and I often slept for much of my Sunday night shift. But anyway, that's the story of how I got accidentally hired against my will.",tokekcowboy

My seventh pint. Now, now I was ready. I didn't so much as hop off my stool, as fall off my stool, but I regained my balance, nodded again at the bemused barman, and made my dragging tracks out of the pub.

3:06pm. I was already six minutes late. Fantastic! And it had only taken me just over an hour to down those six pints. Was it seven? I actually felt pretty good then, I'd have to push that pervasive feeling down into my belly before I got in.

I skipped merrily into the building, before reminding myself that I didn't want to show too much enthusiasm. I burped again, openly. The sound echoed around the dusty old corridor I was making my way through, hopefully just far enough to reach into the main stage area. And then I was in the actual theatre, that hadn't taken so long. Things were a little fuzzy.

""Hello!"" I shouted, muting myself quickly. Too friendly. Way too friendly. ""I'm here for the...the audition."" I gulped out, swaying slightly. A young, quite attracti-no, get the goggles off-mousy little woman with a clipboard hushed me. I thought she was the noisy one. Both of her was.

""The director's already auditioning someone, you-""

She was cut off by the director, who's head had turned from the stage to me. I think he was wearing clothes. It's only conjecture at this point.

""Now THAT is the kind of bold entrance I'm looking for!"" He turned back to the man auditioning. ""Get the fuck off my stage, kindly, darling."" Back to me. ""Well? I recognise your headshot's, your agent was awfully keen that we see you. I didn't see it myself but now..."" He was balding, actually quite attrac-NO-focus on fucking it up, fuck. Focus on something. 

I walked along the walls and the seats of the place it seemed as the revolving theatre steadily decided to pulse in time with my steps as I walked along the walls and the seats and the of place as I walked along-

""Have you learnt the audition piece?""

What? Hadn't bothered looking. When did I get on the stage? I didn't want to work yet, it was too soon. Fuck my agent. Maybe I should fuck my agent.

""Maybe I should fuck my agent?""

Was that my outside head voice? 

""You're a bit of a wildcard aren't you? Forget the piece, I like what I see. I want to workshop this with you.""

No, no, no. That was a good start, I didn't DO good starts. I had to rectify this. By completely throwing it. No time for subtlety. But Janice, she wouldn't represent me anymore in the future if I made it obvious? Did I care? I had to care...I couldn't set myself back eleven years representation wise, but I needed more time off.

""I'm going to be honesht...excuse me...with you mate. I'm pissed.""

Silence. That was good right? Why was he smiling wider?

""Oh yes!"" He enthused, raising his hands up. How many fingers? ""So. Am. I DARLING! That's why we're doing this isn't it? To show them how pissed off we are. We'll make them really *think* about it before they do it to they're own families in the future!""

What was this? He hadn't understood, the prick. I didn't want to think about families. Why did everyone want to talk about-

""No."" I said, trying to strike a defiant pose. I nailed it. ""I'm pissed.""

More silence, yet. Yes?

""I'm fucked. I'm trollied. I'm smashed. Drunk. As the probervial...skunk."" I smiled at my own...well that wasn't really a joke was it? No don't smile! ""No, you need to stop smiling too!"" Out of the head voice again. Didn't matter. I had to throw it now.

""Ooooh! Lynn, make a note of this man here! We've got ourselves a method actor! I love it! You know, it's this kind of bravery that I've been searching for these past two weeks. It's splendid. Show me angry!""

""OH FUCK OFF!"" I roared, who was this-Wait! No! Wrong timing! I burped again and tripped over a rope that wasn't there. ""I'm actually really nice.""

The director jumped out of his seat and squealed. The man squealed. It was adorable really but I was not doing the best job at doing the worst job like I'd hoped.

""Oh I'm sure you are, but I can feel that power behind you, that burning intensity. I shouldn't be saying this but you're the best *fucking* fit for this part we've had on that stage yet. I just need to get a glimpse of your-""

""No...please no!"" I wailed, dropping to my knee's in a manner I wished I could summon when I really wanted a part. ""I can't do this. I'm just. Not. Ready. Yet.""

""YES!!!"" The director squealed, no screeched, no screamed. ""Your sensitive side is *BRILLIANT*! You've got the part! Lynn, mark him down for the drunken, broken father role, I don't want to see anyone else, let's go for a coffee, I'm sick of this fucking space.""

I blinked and he was gone.

"[WP] You were forced to attend an interview for a job you do not want, but, no matter how hard you try to screw up the interview, the interviewer just becomes more keen to hire you.",NoobPrompter,"An ordinary man would not stand a chance. The lone farmer tilling his land, baking under the twin suns of the Kingdom of Ankharra, had his head down. His gaze was fixed upon the soil, his mind focused upon the task. His farm dog was busy chasing butterflies, too distracted to scent the hostile magic boiling in the clearing nearby.

But Faron Bitters was not an ordinary man.

Three lightning bolts were unleashed simultaneously from the surrounding forests, each angled to ensure that even if their target could dodge one, the others would find their mark. The hissing snap of boiling air followed closely in their wake, rustling leaves, churning dust devils. Each spell was potent enough, deadly enough to fell a fully grown orc.

Faron caught the first one easily, crushing it into motes of light with his callused fist. His plough, set free, took its time to fall gracefully to the ground.

The second spell spilled against the barrier encasing Faron, winking out of power as its energies were spent trying to overcome the immovable. 

The final spell froze in midair, hovering at eye-level, straining to reach its destination. It shimmered, an angry scar of azure, like a rat trapped between glass plates. Faron lifted his hat, fanned himself, then walked around the imprisoned spell, examining it closely.

“Well woven,” he said, as he replaced his hat upon his head. “Two parts power, one part mobility – Illuma’s Ideal for battlemagic. Novices tend to pour too much power into their spells, forgetting that their spells actually have to hit somebody to be effective. Not many remain today who can spellweave this elegantly. To whom do I owe the honour?”

Though the suns still hung at their highest in the skies, six shadowy figures emerged from amongst the trees. For a second Faron thought his eyes were tired, but then he realised the reason why he couldn’t focus on them easily, was because each of them had shrouded themselves. He knew that if his concentration slipped, they would disappear, right before his eyes.

“Master Bitters,” said the tallest one. He pulled back his shroud, and Faron noted the pale skin, thinning hair, shrunken flesh. He looked as if he had just emerged from a prolonged stay in the catacombs. “We’re… sorry we had to resort to that. We had to be sure that you were the one we were seeking.”

Faron laughed. “And if I wasn’t? Would you have fried some poor farmer out here in the sticks just to sate your curiosity?”

“I’m Magister Kellway, and we are here to seek your – ”

Faron chose that moment to strike. He had hazarded that they meant him no harm – why else would they yield after the first feint, then reveal themselves? But he could not rule out mischief, or treachery, and so he chose prudence.

Like a golden arrow, Faron sped towards the entourage, closing the distance before they could react. Two of them, the sharper ones, tried to throw up their defences, but Faron was too fast for them. By the time the dust settled, five were on the ground, bound and disabled. The one who called himself Kellway dangled off the ground, twisting in the air as Faron gripped his neck.

“Seek what from me?” asked Faron. “Choose your words carefully. I happen to want to be left alone.”

Kellway held up his hands, then shut off the valves to his power. Faron recognised the timeless sign of surrender, and let go. “We need your help,” said Kellway, on his knees, coughing and rubbing his throat. “The Kingdom needs you again, Master Bitters.”

“I’m done with all that,” said Faron. “I’ve done my part. It’s time for the next generation to step up, don’t you think?”

“You rid the land of great evil once,” said Kellway, “and we only ask that you help us again.”

“I’ve earned my right to be left alone,” said Faron, rubbing his temples. “I’ve given too much, sacrificed it all.”

“You are still strong! You can still serve!”

“I’ve not fought a single goblin in years! I’m not sure I can even do simple Sixth Order spells anymore, forget about the more complex ones!”

“You stopped us! You clearly have what it takes!”

Faron’s brow creased in irritation. “Surely there are others who can do what you want? Seek out the Cabal! They are the Queen’s personal magicians! They are the charged protectors of the land!”

“We… see for yourself, Master Bitters,” said Kellway. He snapped his fingers, and the shadows fell away from his body, and from the bodies of his comrades on the ground. Faron saw then, the dulled sigils pinned upon their cloaks, which marked them incontrovertibly for Cabal. 

Faron saw too, that no man amongst the six was complete. Some were missing their hands, some their legs. He had laughed in the face of a grolluc, had shrugged off a rampaging wyrm, but the stench of utter defeat which clung to these six Cabal turned his stomach, crawled his skin… and chilled his heart.

“If you are what’s left of the Cabal,” Faron said, urgency creeping into his voice, “where is the Queen? Is she safe? I have a lifelink to her! I would know if she was in danger, but I have not sensed anything!”

Kellway tried to rise from his knees, and almost lost his footing. Faron gripped the man, steadied him, and saw up close the deep scars upon his body, his missing ear, his clouded eye.

“The Queen, you say? Your daughter that you entrusted the Kingdom to?” asked Kellway. “The Bringer of Light, the Warmer of Hearts? She Who Loves, the Land’s Mother?” Kellway shook his head, and the tears spilled down his cheeks. He scrabbled for Faron’s sleeves, then pulled on them, desperately, angrily.

“She was the one who did this to us, Master Bitters. The benefactor has become the tyrant. Please, do what you did once for this land, and set it free again. Only you can stop her.”

The Mustached boss said as I walked through the door.
                                                                                                                                                                   He seemed nice at first, but I didn't want to work at a Roadkill Removal service.

""Well, tell me Gareth, what do you like to do in your free time?"" The man said as he brandished his notepad and clicked his pen.
                                                                                                                                                                      I tried to think of the worst thing I could possibly do in my free time, ""I run a prank channel on YouTube!"" I said in a panic.
                                                                                                                                                               ""Very Intriguing, what kind of pranks do you like to do?"" He said as wrote down what I had just said.
""Kissing pranks, a lot of sexual stuff, my most popular one is titled 'Making out with peoples girlfriends in the hood (Gone Deadly)'."" I replied.                                                                                                                       

""Hmm, sounds hot!"" He creepily said whilst writing down the quote.
I was panicking, I had to think of something, ""You know, I also like to start grass-fires, big ones! And sometimes I like to kill little rabbits, for no reason, I find it pleasureful."" I said whilst trying to snatch my own intentional defeat from the jaws of defeat.                                                                                                                               

""Oh yeah, that's why I joined the force in the first place, I love seeing dead animals! I like you, kid! You remind me of a younger version of myself."" The interviewer said enthusiastically.                                                                

He wrote it down, ""You know I'm a racist, total skinhead, yep!"" I said in an attempt to deter the boss from hiring me.                                                                                                                                                           

""Oh, no way, me too! Sieg Heil!!"" he said whilst doing a Nazi salute.
I was shocked at this mans racism, ""Wow, this guy is horrible!"" I though as the man wrote down that I'm a skinhead.
                                                                                                                                                  
""I'm also a Scientologist!"" I said desperately to the boss.
""No way, you too!"" I got up and left as he said that, I slammed the door and ran out of the building as fast as possible.

Honesty! Haha haha and humor! 

He points at me and snaps. What is that. Stop talking! Your breath is offensive!

We'll make whatever accommodations you need. 

Oh no. He's using sign language. I wish I didn't understand. I'll just pretend I don't. 

When can you start? 

I shrug my shoulders and lift my hands, showing I don't understand. 

Then call me whenever you're ready. I'll reserve the position for you. Here's my daughter's business card too in case you're single.

In preparation for this interview, he’d donned his “Sperm Donor” T-shirt and smeared a tablespoon of lard into his hair.  The look he was going for, despite his parents’ entreaties to get a job, was “unhireable,” and  he was *nailing* it.

“Hi, you must be Theodore.  I’m Sharona, the manager.”   A moderately-attractive woman in her mid-twenties had appeared, carrying a clipboard and wearing a bright smile.

He popped his gum at her and wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.  “Hi, baby.  Nice jugs.  They real?”

“Why, yes they are, thanks for asking.”  Her smile didn’t slip a fraction.  She slid into the seat across from him, careful to place her paperwork away from his ketchup puddle.

“So, why do you want to work for the Sandwich Duke?  You left that question blank, along with most of the other questions.”

“I dunno.  Guess I’d like to steal food when no one’s watching.”  He pulled out his gum, examined it, and stuck it under the table.

“Ah, an opportunist.  You’ll be happy to know that the camera beside the back fryer is broken, so you’ll be able to help yourself.  Within reason, of course.”  She made a tiny note on her clipboard.

“This question’s just for fun, to help me get to know you better: if you were a food, what would you be and why?”

“Dog.  Chinks eat dogs, so why can’t we?  I think it’d be cool to eat something that would make all those sissy animal lovers lose their shit.”

Sharona fiddled with the silver cat pin on her lapel and frowned, her composure cracking slightly for the first time.  “Yes, well, alright…I like a man who can think outside the box.  Last question: what would you say your greatest strength is?”

He yawned.  “I’m really good at finding ways around the school firewall to stream porn in class.  I sell my secrets to the other losers for beer money.  Even though they’re totally loaded, my parents are real tightwads.”

“I see.  It sounds like you’re a real entrepreneur.  Good thing you’ll be drawing a real paycheck soon.  Welcome aboard!”  She stuck out a hand to shake, once more grinning broadly at him.

He gaped at her speechlessly, resembling a wide-mouth bass that has swallowed a hook.  He was so stunned that he forgot to be rude as he accepted his new uniform and tentative schedule.  Sharona watched the little asshat go, already calculating ways to maximize his misery for the three months she had him until school started again.  She thought that scraping all of the gum out from under the tables would be a good place to start.  Maybe the little toerag would quit – if he did, it wasn’t her fault.

She watched the kid climb into his dad’s brand-new sports car and marveled to herself at the peculiar behavior of the very rich.  Who else would have paid her five grand to hire their stupid kid?  For that kind of money, she would put up with a lot of bullshit for twenty hours a week.  Maybe they'd even do it again next summer.",merganzer

I couldn’t help but notice his bull neck, and his arms knotted with muscles and bulging with veins. He had rolled up the sleeves on his suit, which hugged his bulky frame and looked like it was at least two sizes too small. His tattooed fingers tapped on a clipboard. I hoped this interview would go well.

“Thank you,” I said, sat down carefully.

“How about we start by going over your CV? It says here that you have experience working at a gym.”

“Well… not much of a professional setting really… more of a couple of machines in my backyard…”¨

“So, you’ve worked a lot with amateurs? That’s a very valuable experience to have as a gym instructor.”

“I didn’t really instruct, though,” I said, feeling the first drops of sweat on my forehead. “I mostly… you know, *just watched.*”

“That’s great! Observe before applying, that’s actually our slogan!”

Damn, I really didn’t want this job; I had to put a stick in the wheel of this bicycle before it got completely out of control and I actually got hired.

“I have zero people skills,” I said, adjusting my tie.

“An honest man!” He gave me a wide grin. “Honesty is obviously something we value greatly here at here at *Honest Workouts &amp; Fitness*.”

“One time I stole Jeep and drove it into a tree!” Desperation was getting to me now, so I sputtered stuff that I hoped would deter him.

“Driver’s License – check!” He filled in the boxes on his clipboard. “Survivor's Instincts – check!”

“I hate my family; I despise authority; I’m really slothful and inept!”

“That’s awesome, the fact that you hate your family means you’ll work longer hours. You’re independent and can think for yourself, very good.  Many of our customers are lazy, you’ll be able to connect with them on a different level!”

“There are voices in my head!” I crossed my eyes, trying to look crazy.

The noose was tightening. I felt like I was being backed into a corner. I cursed inwardly.

“A religious man,” he said, nodding approvingly.

I felt myself sinking through the floor, my hopes and dreams fading. This man was relentless, he had the answer for everything – I was as good as hired already.

“You know what, fuck off, you dumb sack of muscles,” I said weakly.

“Sweet, you’ve got attitude,” he said and got up. “As an instructor, you need to be able to take the lead.”

He held out his hand. I’d completely messed up this interview. Salty tears blurred my vision. With reluctance, I stretched my hand out.

“I… watch *anime*,” I whispered.

“What the hell did you just say?!” His rugged face turned red and his eyes bulged out of their sockets. “What do you think this is? Get the hell off the property, before I snap your puny-ass neck!”

"[WP] You were forced to attend an interview for a job you do not want, but, no matter how hard you try to screw up the interview, the interviewer just becomes more keen to hire you.",NoobPrompter,"     I looked up at the tall glass tower glinting in the sunlight, a trickle of malcontent running down my spine and into my stomach. Capital Corp spelled out in stainless steel cutouts over the 2 story tall glass and tile entrance looked down at me. I could feel their disdain drifting over me like a cloud of CO2, invisible and slightly breathtaking. I shook myself and remembered that the building didn't hate me, it was only my own disgust projecting from inside me. I gripped my resume tight in my fist putting deep rinkles in one side and smiled, maybe I could make myself look incompetent enough to never have to come back here again. I took one long breath in and slowly released it with my eyes closed. 'Let's do this', I thought, and took the 4 more steps it took to bring me inside.

     It had been a month. A month since I left my last job and nothing to show for it. I stared at the computer screen through a haze of half-tears only really seeing the dark background colors of the website. Every single thing I had applied for this past week had made my stomach churn just imagining myself performing it, and there was no end in sight. The last job I had left had only lasted a month and was the 7th job I had landed in a little over 3 months. I have never loved a job but the fridge was empty save for a half bottle of barbeque sauce and my mom was on speaker phone shrilly outlining her reason for not sending more money to fill the thing. It was definitely time to pick up a few more interviews and that was the moment my phone gave a low tone signaling someone was on the other line. I switched the line over without warning to my mom and her lecture, answering with a simple hello. 
""Hello, is this Jacob?"" The young female voice asked.
""Yup.""
""Hello sir, I was calling to offer you an appointment with Capital Corp, regarding a meet and greet with our hiring manager. Interested?"" She sounded more hopeful than I had expected her to, if even just a little bit.
""Sure, I can come in. When were you thinking?"" The words tasted like blood in my mouth, Capital Corp was the only resident of a 23 story building in the middle of downtown, right on the edge of the river. Everyone who walked in there wore a crisp suit. Cogs in the machine.
""I have an opening tomorrow at noon if that's ok with you?"" Once again, it sounded like she thought she was talking to someone slightly famous, just a hint of wonder in her voice. Strange.
I replied with as little conviction as I could, ""ugh, yeah. I think I might be able to make that..."" I didn't want to work in some cubicle, I would end up killing someone within a year. The dread was already setting in and I hadn't even made it to the interview yet.
""Great! I'm sending you an email right now and I hope  you have a wonderful rest of your day!"" She hung up all at once, leaving me listening to my mother once again. She hadn't even realized she was on hold.

     The air was fridged on my skin as I walked in the doors, my slender frame coiling even more than it had been immediately prior. I was the only person not in a suit, yet not the youngest person there at 22. I stopped just in the lobby and looked around. The lobby itself was 3 stories tall and 30 feet square with a 20 X 20 white marble platform in the middle of the floor on which was stationed a handful of black leather couches around a large planter box holding a palm tree. A 3' rock fountain trickled peacefully in one corner. I paused a moment to take it all in, the extravagance made me sneer a little. How frivolous this whole place was! Yet a small child within me couldn't help but find wonder in this peaceful little Oasis below a tower of offices doing who knows what. I sat down on one of these couches to check my phone and look at my confirmation email with the information on how to find my interview. I looked around and found the elevator. I started walking towards it but stopped dead in my tracks when I realized that the numbers 2-12 above the door meant that I wouldn't be making it to the 20th floor. So I quickly turned around in a 360 to reassess my options and found a twin of the elevator I had been walking towards on the opposite end of the lobby labeled 13-22. I started towards them and shook my head at myself. This really wasn't any place for a job hopper, they knew I had no office experience... right? Oh well, I wasn't actually going to make it through the interview anyway. The elevator immediately left my gut in my shoes as we rocketed up. The smell of suits strong in my nose from the 4 people in the elevator with me. I could only imagine what I smelled like to them, the only smoker in the building probably.  One by one they all got off, each more dignified than the first and finally I was alone after the 18th floor. I began to wonder just what job I was being interviewed for on the 20th floor. The thought made my ankles ache, probably because my stomach was in knots and the elevator was rising so fast that the two areas had become one and the same. I stepped off into a small maroon hallway with pictures of flowers down the length of the wall. I padded down the Navy blue carpet staring at the zig zag pattern till I came to the very end of the hall the opened up into a small round waiting room not more than 10' across, black leather arm chairs on both walls. The people in those chairs struck me dumb, each and every one was about 5' 10"" and 120lbs with red hair and sharp features including me. More than strange. So I sat down with my crumpled resume in one of the arm chairs and waited till my name was called.

As I walked into the small conference room I was greeted by 3 men in some of the nicest suits I have ever seen. 'yup, I won't last a minute In this interview' I thought to myself. Instead of sitting down at the table where the man on the right had gestured I wandered over to the floor-to-ceiling window and stared out over the river and the city beyond. You could see the snowcapped mountain in the distance and the whole of the east side of the city below, it really was awe inspiring. I made an impatient gesture behind me without looking so they would just get on with it and I got a belly laugh. I turned around slowly, confused. All three of them had big grins looking at me. 
""Heya there Jacob! How're you today?"" The man in the middle asked joyfully.
""Life's a struggle"" I replied flatly, rolling my eyes at the question. What did they care? 
""Well, I'm soon it'll all get better soon here."" The man on the left replied hopefully.
""I'm sure."" I stated sarcastically. This wasn't going anywhere near like I had expected so far. I was getting worried about their smiles and suddenly felt like sitting down.
""So Jacob, tell me a little about yourself. What are you looking for? What can we do for each other?"" Asked the man on the right. 
""Ha! Not an office job, that's for sure."" I shot back. ""I'm a well documented job hopper, I don't know what I want and I'm just picking up whatever I can to feed myself until I find something I do want. So what's the job?""
The three men grinned at each other as if privately, nodding to each other as if I had answered perfectly.
""The job is pretty much our personal assistant. You help us with whatever we need and you get paid for it. We've already decided we want you. We'll do anything it takes to make you ours, you see, I really like your attitude."" 
That was when I really started to feel claustrophobic and light headed, I was supposed to be laughed out by now, but I'm being told I'm already hired? So I switched gears. ""I've got a problem with authority."" I blurted. Their grins just got wider.
""And I'm always partying! I can't be sober to save my life and I don't even have any experience!""
""That's all good! Means you can keep up and we want you trained our way! Welcome to capital Corp!"" 

On the way out, I was so nervous about what had transpired that I barfed in the potted plant by the door. I couldn't wait to get paid.

I took small sips in the waiting room, the smell of vodka stinging my eyes even with the orange juice to water it down. 

I had somewhere to be and it wasn’t in a job interview. 

“It’s good practice,” my wife had encouraged. “You just need to get back on that horse and give it a try.” She’d told me when I was asked to come in for the job. 

“I don’t think I want it,” I’d confided in her. But there was no arguing with her at that point. 

“Joseph Gordons?” The receptionist called my name. A tall thin man stood next to her, a dour look on his face. He shook my hand wordlessly and gestured for me to follow him. I ambled along behind him into a tight conference room. The lighting was fluorescent and room dingy. I half wanted to leave right then but I’d promised my wife I’d stay. 

“Joseph, good of you to come in,” the man said. “I’m Hank Norbitt, I do the hiring for the programming department, I find that HR doesn’t really understand programmers.” His voice reminded me of Eeyore. Once I started thinking about the sad donkey I could also see a resemblance in his expression. 

We settled into chairs on the corner of the table. I leaned my left arm on the table and set the water bottle down. Hank got comfortable as I began to speak.

“I understand that some programmers have social issues, I’m not really one of them. I paid for university working as a bartender and spent all kinds of time with people, at the bar, after the bar. The morning before going back to work,” I replied probably too honestly. I’d told my wife I’d give it an honest try but I wanted to tank the interview and go. “I met my wife bartending.”

“Was that a bar in town?”

“Yea, Phil’s by Laurier. I learned a lot of skills there I’ve found applicable in other places,” I took a sip of my screwdriver before continuing. Hank leaned forward seeming intrigued. I’d led him here and prepared to drop an answer that’ll have him excusing me. “I learned how to keep my mouth shut, the bikers used to deal coke out of the back and I needed to make sure I didn’t show up on their radar. I learned how to break up a fight – you never know when you’ll need to convince a man to drop a knife. Every Friday these days it seems.” 

“You like to go out then? Party?” Hank’s eyes lit up, I was a little concerned that he was getting too into my answers.

“Sometimes. I don’t do drugs anymore, almost OD’d at my last job – that’s why I’m looking for work, had some trouble with painkillers and needed to take some time off, get better,” I was lying now. 

“Now that’s interesting, you sound like you’re very good at recognizing your own flaws, that’s  a strong quality in an employee,” Hank seemed far too into what I was saying and I wanted to get him to let me go.

“I can see where I’ve fallen down, unless I’ve had too much to drink!” I exclaimed and laughed a bit louder than I probably should have. 

“Well, I do have some questions for you,” Hank glanced at the sheet in front of him, “first, if you could be any animal what would you be?”

“I’d be a duck, their penises are the ultimate multi-tool,” I replied, half-serious. The alcohol was having the desired effect and I wasn’t tasting the vodka as much now. I committed to myself that I’d answer the questions quickly and just move through this stupid formality. I glanced at my watch – I needed to be out of here in ten minutes.

“Oh that’s an original one, love that, I’ll have to use it sometime. Next what is your greatest weakness?” Hank asked with a smile. 

“Alcoholism.”

“I appreciate the honesty. I like that in an employee. Now how many gas stations do you think are in the US?”

“At least 12.” 

“Well you’re not wrong, and I supposed that’s what I get for asking a programmer that question – you’re up on your internet jokes right?” Hank laughed at his own comment, my grim expression started to break and I smiled with him for a moment. I took a swig of the alcohol. “Where do you see yourself in five years?” 

Five years. I used to know where I’d be, until a week ago I’d have had an answer. “I don’t,” the smile that had been growing was lost again. Hank’s laid a hand on my arm. 

“If you need to talk…”

“I think it’d be best if we move on with the questions, I don’t like to bring personal issues into work,” I interrupted. I didn’t know him and didn’t need this right now. 

“Right, ok. How honest would you say you are?”

“Very,” I didn’t think I needed to elaborate, I’ve only told a couple lies so far. 

“Alright, last one – how would your family feel about you working long hours?”

“I don’t have a family,” I replied without explanation.

“You mentioned your wife,” he began.

“She’s dead.”

“Oh, I’m so sorry,” Hank replied. His look quizzical and I knew what was coming next. One of two questions that I’d been asked so many times recently. 

“Drunk driver hit her car two days ago. She kicked it. I actually need to go now. Her visitation starts in half an hour and it’s a twenty minute drive,” I replied, standing. I wobbled a bit. I didn’t mean to but I did. 

“Are you…”

“Driving? No, I’m not the goddamn moron who killed her.”

“I’ll give you a call, about the job, but can I ask one last question?” Hank watched me. I hesitated and nodded, “why did you take the interview? Why not cancel or reschedule?” 

“I made my wife a promise that I’d come,” I replied. “I don’t think her death releases me from that.”

I sat in the office, waiting silently for the man to finish helping the old lady find the cabbages. I could hear the whirring of the ancient fan over my head, my head filled with thoughts of betrayal. I could not believe dad had set me up to go for a job interview at walkart, and worse still, he had tricked me into it by telling me we were going out for lunch.

Too bad he did not comprehend how far I was willing to go to not get this job.

The older employee, having gotten the old woman the cabbages she wanted, now made his way into the office. He walked over to the chair and took his time adjusting himself in the seat which was obviously too small for him.

I kept staring at my mobile.

The man asked for my name. "" Mctitguffin"", I replied. 

He asked me for my age. "" sixteen."" I replied.

He asked me for my work experience. "" Professional masterbater."" I replied.

He asked me my opinion of the place. "" I think it smells like diarrhea."" I replied.

He asked me where I saw myself five years from now. "" Banging his daughter and wife in this office."" I replied.

He asked me for my life goals. "" paralympic protester."" I replied.

He looked at me for a long moment. Then said, "" you are hired.""

"[WP] You were forced to attend an interview for a job you do not want, but, no matter how hard you try to screw up the interview, the interviewer just becomes more keen to hire you.",NoobPrompter,"Jon was having a rough morning. First, he'd angrily smashed his antique alarm clock during the latest rendition of Pop Star Cammy's hit single, ""Banal Teenage Techno-Pop Vol. 1a, Remix Special"" - a song he utterly despised - when the clock awoke him at 6:00 A.M.

Then, he'd taken a hard fall out of bed, when the lopsided mattress ejected him. A skinned knee and several abrasions later, he managed a shower, some eggs, a black coffee and found his nicest shirt and tie. The shirt - an ugly, gray houndstooth affair - was missing a button, but the tie would cover that. 

The interview at Tele-Corp was not his ideal job, but since he'd been let go from one of the nation's largest IT firms, he was desperate. Almost by accident, he'd seen an ad for the company in one of his dreams. He felt compelled to apply. When he received a draft notice from the government notifying him of his obligation to find a job or enter indentured servitude, he knew he had no choice. With the economy failing everywhere and wars raging all over the other side of the world, entering servitude could lead anywhere from mopping floors at a University to serving on the front lines. So it was that Jon applied for the job-with-no-description at Tele-Corp.

Jon, a diminutive man, late 30s, with hair graying around his temples, grabbed a suitcase and headed tot he train station. A few train rides later, he found himself in the inner city.

He walked a few blocks, growing increasingly apprehensive. He didn't want to work for this company, but knew he had no choice. As he approached the facade of Tele-Corp HQ, he felt resigned to his fate.

Standing in front of the sleek, tower of a building, Jon had a sudden thought. What if he botched the interview? He would go in, act as obnoxious as possible, pretend to be unqualified, and not score the job. Then, he could reply to the notice showing proof that he'd tried - and failed. 

""This plan is so crazy,"" he said quietly to himself, ""it just might work.""

Smiling, Jon entered the building, was greeted by a young secretary, a gentleman in his early 20s by the look of it, and sent into the Office of Human Resources.

A large, man, heavyset, and going bald sat in a chair. As the door opened, he bellowed a greeting to Jon.

""Hello, young man! Welcome to your future!"" he said, grinning, ""Don't just stand there! Have a seat! I'm Hank Jenkins, Head of Personnel here at Tele-Corp. And who might you be?""

Jon rolled his eyes, looked straight at Jenkens and replied, ""My name's Jon. What's this job for, fat-ass?""

Jenkins, seemingly unaffected, replied back.

""Well, son, you see, here at Tele-Corp, we have a unique problem. Sometimes our teleporters malfunction.""

""Yeah, because your manufacturing is shoddy,"" right, Jon interrupted, ""I've seen the specs. You'd be lucky to get anything to move across any distance without completely destroying at least some living tissue.""

Jenkins paused for a moment, assessed Jon and let go a hearty laugh.

""So, my boy, you DO know what this position is for!""

Jon, clearly taken aback by this response, hesitated. After a tense moment, he finally asked for clarification.

""What do you mean by that, Hank?"" he inquired.

""Oh, you'll see,"" Jenkins said as he pushed a button on his desk, ""Mary, let's get Jonny Boy here some paperwork. He starts this afternoon.""

""But, sir, I don't want this job! I'm only in this interview to avoid going into servitude!"" Jon protested.

Jenkins, still shuffling his papers, placed one in front of Jon. 

""Oh, that's just it, my boy,"" he said, his grin blossoming into a full-on smile, ""you've already been drafted.""

Jon stared, aghast at the paper lying on the desk in front of him. He read it twice before the words finally sank in.

""Dear Mr. Prescott,

It is our sad duty to report that due to under-payment of your Living Tax, you have been drafted into Servitude. Your contract has been sold to Tele-Corp. A dream message was sent to confirm this. You have no choice in the matter. By our calculations, it will be 15 years before you are paid in full for your back Living Tax. Remember you are responsible for any expenses you accrue during your tenure of Servitude. Please report for your assignment. Thank you and have a nice day.

Signed,

Anthony Errol
Treasure - Living Tax Bureau""

A few minutes passed and the office doors opened. Two men came in, dressed in blue-ish/gray uniforms and commanded Jon to stand up. Jon slowly did as he was told and followed the men into the hallway.

""Welcome to Tele-Corp,"" said one of the men, handing him a laser pistol, ""you're gonna need this.

Jon took it, examining it for a moment. It felt sleek and good in his hand. The word, ""Hunter"" was emblazoned across the handle, along with the Tele-Corp logo - a booth surrounded by bright light. Jon smiled. Perhaps he was going to like this job, after all.

"[WP] You were forced to attend an interview for a job you do not want, but, no matter how hard you try to screw up the interview, the interviewer just becomes more keen to hire you.",NoobPrompter,"Silence resounded from every corner of the room. Such a quiet place to work, Sam thought. Though he may need to suffer through this interview, Sam took comfort in the knowledge that he would need not endure such silence every day.


The room itself was plain enough. No larger than Sam’s own bedroom, the walls were bare, and the furnishings sparse. A thick, crude table of oak separated the uncomfortable chair in which Sam sat from the identical chair where the gruff, middle-aged man sat glaring at him. A lamp in the far corner of the room, behind this man, abated only a little of the darkness, leaving the man’s face mostly concealed in shadow. In this gloom, Sam could only make out the man’s broad shoulders, his square head, and, most significantly, the absence of a left hand. Sam marveled at the size of this man, and speculated that he must have had a more physical sort of career before heading this newspaper.


The silence that had fostered Sam’s stream of thought was broken abruptly when the man cleared his throat with a rough growl.


“Mr. Clark?” the man asked.


Sam prepared to reply, but it seemed this was no question.


“I am to understand that you are a writer?”


Sam shrugged. Perhaps if I merely keep silent, they’ll have no reason to hire me. Sam only desired to write freely, but his mother had forced this interview upon him when it had been over three months since his last royalties had trickled in.


“You are the author of ‘The Final Storm’?”


Sam nodded hesitantly, confused. “How-  well- it is not finished. There is only an incomplete manuscript at my house...” Sam’s voice trailed off until silence had filled the room once again.


“This is a very invigorating work, Mr. Clark.”


Sam suddenly wished there were fewer shadows present to conceal this man’s expression. His tone was in some ways unnerving.


“To be quite honest, Mr. uh, sir...it’s really not spectacular in any regard. I- uh, am in reality quite a mediocre writer. I-“


The man held up the stump that had once been his left hand.


“No, no Mr. Clark, I think I like this work of yours.” A small light seemed to glint off the man’s right eye for a moment, and it seemed to Sam that a smile may have flashed somewhere in the shadows that were his face. “The story is of a quality we rarely see. It seems to contain more emotion and truth than one typically finds in such works.”


This interview was too full of praise for Sam’s taste. He needed to end this interview soon. “Really, sir, to put it bluntly, the story is a piece of rubbish. I’d imagine any high school student could write a more gripping story in their general English course.”


Again, the man seemed to smile slightly from within his shadow. This annoyed Sam. If he was offered a position here, he would have to take it. If he didn’t, his mom would likely force him out of the house. Sam had no desire to write for a stupid local newspaper.


The man sat in contemplation for some amount of time, scratching the stump of his left hand. “The villain in this story of yours, Mr. Clark, is very well conceived. We need more of such ability here. Our current writers are particularly drab.”


Sam hesitated. “Well, the villain is actually based off of a real person. I wouldn’t have the creativity to create such a character. I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of-”


The man held up his stump again. “Yes, I have heard of the Lumberjack.” He laughed a rough, chilling laugh. “You seem to have done much research on this man.”


The interviewer was a friend of a friend of Sam’s mother, and, as such, it was bothersome that he knew so much of Sam’s incomplete novel. “I only need a few more weeks to finish,” he had told his mom, and yet she had still forced this interview upon him.


“Can you remind me, Mr. Clark, of how this Lumberjack operates?”


“Uh, well he is a failure of a writer who takes out his frustration on publishers who reject him.”


“And how so, Mr. Clark?” The man’s stump twitched slightly. He seemed to be grinning again, wider than before. Sam found it disconcerting that the Lumberjack was also missing a hand, but remembered that, fortunately, it was in fact his right hand, not the left.


“Well, uh, he uses his one good hand to saw off the hands of the publisher, and then-“
A sharp knock on the door behind Sam cut him off.


“Sam, honey, that man from the publishing company is here to see you,” called some woman. Sam remembered now. The publishing company that had rejected his most recent, futile effort at a novel. The publishing company that Sam had pitifully begged to meet with in person.


The man in the mirror laughed. For the first time, Sam noticed a hand saw on the table.


“Tell him to come in,” Sam called back.",slithek

I genuinely would really like to be employed and the lot, but I honestly couldn't work here, no, never. The walls are pasty, the ceiling fans are creaking, ""only dumb nuts get into insurance anyways"" 

""Who are you calling a nut?"" the bearded man with slightly too well groomed facial hair said through a mouth that was dimpled with pure joy. My face was anything but joyous, I mean sure I didn't want the job, but to be a jerk about it... how did that I let that slip out...

""Oh um uh..."" all I could muster

""Hey now partner, I take no offence to your honesty, you really think I expect someone to be enthused about a male secretary position? I mean listen man its a paycheck , nothing more than that"" Leaning in to shake my hand from his desk I failed to notice his warm posture signalling a greeting... I reciprocated darting like a lizard to his hand.

""Hey I'm uh real sorry""

""And I'm a real Rodney! Listen don't worry about it, lets just get started. How about that?""

""Well uh... to be honest then, I really don't want this job. I'm only here cause my my mom wants me to get a job an all that, listen you know the story I'll just go home, I really don't want to waste your time.""

""Huh, hey man you know when I was your age, what are ya twenty?""

""Yeah around that, I'm twenty-two"" 

""Listen then, when I was your age all I did was question myself, I had no confidence, no drive, nothing kiddo!"" 

""Oh man, uh honestly I just think insurance is a boring gig, and being a male secretary is just a little not my speed"" my head was swiveling in a jittery motion from my ever tightening neck. His face donned sympathy, I wasn't done... I couldn't just sink back in my chair at home and stair at my computer, no he was ready to accommodate me 

""You know what kiddo! You need confidence and drive! Don't let the world shame you outta a job! Lucky for you your application has your moms contact info under emergency contacts, so you're getting this job regardless of your volition or intention."" He was so proud of himself, he knew he was just a great person. I could tell he was satisfied. It seemed a little invasive, but you can't stop someone on a crusade sanctioned by the pope of empathy the twenty-second, god R/history is leaking into my thoughts maybe I really do need this job.

""Uh wow you are uh really insistent on this, I uh guess I can't really stop you, huh..."" Well played almost slipped out too, but it wasn't a play I suppose. He Just a really wholesome dude.  

""Listen squirt, You'll thank me later I promise! I'll call your mom tonight and make it more than clear to her the job is yours. You can head out now man, see you soon alright!"" His manor of speaking increased in expediency and in a second I was walking out saying softly ""Uh see you soon too"" I felt a little violated, cause there would be no coming to head with my mom... Well damn I guess I'm employed now... 

The phone rang, when the door to exit closed behind the newest employee walking to his car ""Hey yup its Rodney, yeah get this! The emergency contact came through with the save, calling his mom tonight to tell her"" The phone resting slyly on his ear awaiting a reply ""Haha yup, guess he didn't read the reviews online! Hey his fault, we finally got the spot filled!""

"[WP] You were forced to attend an interview for a job you do not want, but, no matter how hard you try to screw up the interview, the interviewer just becomes more keen to hire you.",NoobPrompter,"I'm a writer. That's the beginning and the end of my story. I'm a writer. I write.

I have stories. I have *things to say*.

I am *not* a Refinance Document Analyst 1. Maybe you are, but not me.

My wife - bless her - is an honest, earnest woman. A doctor. She works hard. She's very smart. But still, smart people can be blinded by their own logic sometimes. Happens to the best of us. Sometimes smart people see the world in black and white - where you're either making money or you're ""unemployed."" Not realizing that there's a middle path. The path to enlightenment. The path of the Writer.

So she tells me to get a job. Is my making money truly necessary? I would say no. I would suggest that my words - as seemingly monetarily valueless as they may presently appear - are greater than any paycheck. I would suggest that she's a *fucking doctor*, so let's be real for a moment. This is not about a paycheck - this is about the creative process. And a boat. She wants to buy a boat. 

I don't even *like* the water. 

So when I apply to jobs, I do so out of marital duty. To show that I am trying, even though I am not. I am a writer, after all. Writers can only be counted on to try during moments of great inspiration and/or the waning hours of a deadline.

I understand this. *You* understand this. Why Barry Blankenshop of First Fourth National Bank of Wattsborough doesn't understand this is anyone's guess.

You see, I applied to the position of Refinance Document Analyst - which is exactly the Lovecraftian nightmare it sounds like - knowing full well that I was neither qualified nor capable. But my wife checks on these things and it's good to have references - or, more accurately, the names of sample HR directors to curse out over the dinner table.

These days I curse the name of Barry Blankenshop, though for significantly different reasons than usual.

For starters, how in the world was my application ever picked out of the pile to begin with? I have a number of tactics that I employ with regularity to prevent just such a calamity. In this case, I:

*Provided no prior employment history

*Intentionally misspelled my own name repeatedly

*Listed only deceased celebrities as my references

*And left no personal contact information

Perhaps Barry Blankenshop is illiterate? Perhaps he loathes his job as much as I loathe the idea of working? Who can know? 

He tracked me down somehow, apparently through some combination of Google searching and yellow page cold calling. My wife was present when I answered the phone and I was so caught off guard I didn't think to pretend that Barry had reached the wrong number. We agreed to a time and place for an interview. I did not show up.

I have to assume this happens often. But I also assume this is the sort of thing that usually disqualifies someone from the offered post. No such luck. Barry called back. I ignored him. He called my wife and offered to reschedule. 

I was trapped.

There was no avoiding the interview then. I went, my wife watching me as I slouched out to the car. It was a dire situation. Fortunately, I had not exhausted my tried-and-true tactics.

Unfortunately, I had deeply underestimated the otherworldly lunacy of Barry Blankenshop.

He was a smallish man, perma-sunburned with curly hair the color of uncooked rice noodles. He smiled as he greeted me, smacking his lips and saying something to the effect of, ""Aha! Here is the man! The man of the hour!"" 

We sat down. He offered me a coffee. I requested a Coke Lemon. 

""Ah! Another lemonhead?"" he exclaimed. Apparently he had stockpiled the long-since discontinued drink. I received my can, which I opened but did not drink.

""How did you hear about First Fourth National?"" he asked.

""My weed dealer banks here.""

Blankenshop laughed. ""We *are* very discreet! I see you've no experience in document analysis, right?""

I nodded. ""Screen blindness. I can't look at a computer screen for more than five minutes at a time without going temporarily blind.""

""Pity,"" said Blankenshop solemnly. ""Lucky for you, we are entirely computer-free here at First Fourth. All hard copies, all the time.""

""How...is that even possible?"" I asked.

""Much safer,"" said Blankenshop. ""No cyber terrorists this way. Saves money, too - a ream of paper costs less than any laptop!""

""That's not...quite comparable.""

""Now,"" pressed Blankenshop, leaning across the desk, conspiratorially. ""What would you consider to be your biggest weakness?""

I considered myself. I considered the man. ""...cocaine?""

Blankenshop laughed, slapping his hands on the desk. ""A sense of humor! I love it. No, no, I *know* the effects of cocaine. Firsthand. Lost my grandmother that way. Tried to fight a city bus. She was special. Cherish your loved ones. Anyway, I can tell you're a straight shooter. How do you deal with turmoil in the workplace?""

The man was insane. The usual tactics were powerless. I was swinging wildly now, just looking to make contact. ""Segregate out all the Jews?""

Blankenshop's brow furrowed deeply. He looked angry for a moment. I had a glimmer of hope. ""They *are* a clever bunch...I need to be careful with you! You'll be gunning for my job in no time!""

""I would literally rather throw myself in front of your grandmother's bus,"" I replied. Blankeshop hooted. 

""Gallow's humor! It's a difficult industry, certainly. You seem well-suited to it.""

""What *is* this job?"" I half-shouted. ""What the hell does a Refinance Document Analyst even do?""

""You know...I'm not sure,"" said Blankenshop. ""Training Department should be able to give you the layout. I'm just tasked with finding a good fit.""

""A good fit for a job you know nothing about?""

""Attitude is everything at First Fourth,"" said Blankenshop. ""And you've got the right attitude.""

""I hate you.""

""Ah hahaha! You can't turn it off! I love it. You'll be very popular. If I'm being honest, morale is not what it ought to be. No idea why."" Blankenshop stuck out a feeble little paw. ""What do you say? Join the team?""

Now, obviously I said yes, and I said yes because I love my wife and don't enjoy being yelled at.

The work is awful. I do very little of it. I manage every interaction with enormous, open disdain. I do not even clean up the office microwave after I am done. 

I am a monster.

I am also, likely by no coincidence, now a Refinance Document Analyst *2*. Because the world is a dark satire, much stranger and crueler than anything I could ever write. ",WinsomeJesse

"[WP] You were forced to attend an interview for a job you do not want, but, no matter how hard you try to screw up the interview, the interviewer just becomes more keen to hire you.",NoobPrompter,"In a barely lit, and renovated room markov sat across from his interviewer. His intetviewer was named bill, an older gentleman with bright red hair and a receding hair line. Bill was chunky and had the body of someone who was in shape but now let it go. ""You start tomorrow"", said the older man to markov. Markov was a taller fellow with brown hair, blue eyes, and a very expressive face. He had a scar on his cheek from a skateboard accident which made his chiseled features even more rugged. In the back of his mind Markov had been thinking how he had hated the thought of being a C.I.A analyst and only being allowed to bring coffee to the meetings. He was going to be a highly trained harvard educated barista. He wouldnt deny a paying job; but fuck did it have to be delivering coffee. So for the first three weeks of delivering coffee to the high ranking officers of the c.i.a, he had noticed a trend. Every time he went to get them their novelty espressos, they always give him different names. Eventually after the forth week. He saved snippets from the cups, starting with : charlie, rango, Delta, 49er. The fifth week was : airborne, bravo, tengo, fort night. Rhe six week he had begun to figure out the code they were giving him. They were directions through the sewers of new york city. The next day, he collected his last paycheck and chased the code to an abandoned train station deep within the underbelly of New York City. To a dark hole with old indian inscriptions above it. ""Speak friend or foe and pass"", Markov muttered to himself , ""This is bullshit"" He strayed on further his flashlight only lighting a few feet in front of him. The darkness seemed to cling to his very breathe. The end of the tunnel was near. He could see two visibly glowing green eyes and with a voice that shook the space in which he had dwelled in. "" Friend or Foe?""  Im a friend said the destitute analyst. ""Tell me your last wish."" Markov began to shudder at what he had found the air had grown colder than before. He had thought to himself that he had wished he never went to the interview. The beast leaped at him from across the room and everything went black. He woke up, he was cold, wet, and starving. He turned on the flashlight to see why he was wet and found blood everywhere. The lunatic had attacked him. His stomach growled , he was starving. He could smell fresh meat not far away.",Dabigzeee95

"[WP] You were forced to attend an interview for a job you do not want, but, no matter how hard you try to screw up the interview, the interviewer just becomes more keen to hire you.",NoobPrompter,"It had started of as a joke. Some stupid dare from when he and his friends had too much to drink, and that no one took seriously. No one but him. Because when a man called you out, no matter how small a call it maybe, you had to step up. 

So he made the announcement the following week. The media was present and dutifully reporting. At first, no one took him seriously, but that was fine, he really didn't want the job, he just wanted to prove that he was man enough to run. But he couldn't just half ass it, he still had that bet to win, so he decided to hire the best people, and only the best because he only every hired *the best*.

And those people did their job as well as expected, a little too well perhaps in hindsight. Because what was meant to be a minor campaign, created solely to win some schoolboy bet, had now picked up steam, and a whole lot of it. So he decided to take matters into his own, admittedly *huge*, hands. Yes, he had won the bet so there was no need to prolong this charade any more. All he had to do now was ramble on and say some choice words about some some particular groups and he'd be kicked out like a lousy guest that had worn out his welcome. 

So he started the self sabotage. """"I will build a great wall -- and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me --and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words. Because when Mexico sends its people, they send the worst, their rapists and murderers!""

 He thought for sure that would be enough. No way the Hispanic community would let this slide and even the Republicans wouldn't want to touch him after this. Hell two of the schmucks competing for this job had Hispanic last names! He couldn't have made it easier for them to cut him out of the race, except by putting a knife to his own throat. But somehow that wasn't enough. Somehow that only riled up the crowds. Ok fine whatever, he'd just attack the Muslim community next or insult Hillary or something. Once he pissed of enough people, no one would want to stand next to him let alone support him. Sure some feelings would be hurt, but he had plenty of time and money to help repair whatever damage his words would do. Sticks and stones right? And if nothing else worked, he always had that damned tape stashed away some where. It was an absolute last resort, he wasn't sure he'd be able to look his children in the eye again if they heard it, but by God if that's what it took to fall out of this race, then he would deliver it to CNN himself if he had to. 

Jesus Christ. He won. He actually won. Somehow, against all the odds and months of self sabotage, he managed to make it through this year long interview to become the 45th President of the United States of America. God help him, God help the world. But maybe it wasn't too late. There was always impeachment. All Old Bill had to do was get a little frisky in the Oval Office, so he could surely match that in some way. And after all this, how much more could the people really take?",skippy130

The reward offered for this job was more than I made the entire time I was alive but yet I knew I shouldn’t take it, couldn’t take it.
 
“Are you not happy with the terms Jimmy? We can still do a little better, if that’s what it takes” says the weirdly cold but yet high pitched voice from across the steel table. The smile painted on his face is too wide to be real and could have only come from thousands of years of sitting in that same seat and saying that same line to the other Jimmys to make his acquaintance. Do you think they said yes, do you think they tried to get their pot sweetened?  

I stammer out a no and try to push the offer back to him. “How many times do I have to explain that…” is all I can get out before he taps the edge of the table with his finger. This simple act, something I had done myself when bored, caused me to freeze mid-sentence.  My tone quickly changed, knowing my body couldn’t handle what it meant to draw a second stroke of his long bony digit down on the table.

“I don’t,” I replied with cruel honesty.

The bald man, in his forties, laughed at me. I showed him a muffled expression.

“You seem like a jokester! Exactly the kind of a person we aim for!”

“I don’t want this job, you know…” Again, I need to give him the cruel honesty.

His laugh resonated through the room, once again. My face was baffled with weirdness.

“Nobody wants this job! You have just become one of my favourites!”

“Could we just get to the end, I’m feeling too lazy right now.” Another, subtle way of saying “Please, for the love of God, don’t hire me.”

The interviewer’s face was put into deep thought, as I waited for him to finish his incredibly boring ritual. That didn’t come; after about ten minutes, I was just pissed off, and since I don’t need this job, I needed to give it to him hard and cold.

“You know what, either speak right now or I’m leaving this wretched interview.”

The man stopped his thinking, stood up and yelled something I didn’t quite grasp. Someone entered the room, a tall young blond woman, gave him a piece of paper. He sat on his chair, once again, and started talking:

“You… Excellent. We need a person who wouldn’t take anyone’s shit! You are the most perfect candidate I’ve ever seen in my entire life!”

My eyebrow twitched in annoyance, I sighed. I decided to play with him, in the hopes of getting kicked out.

“Give me the most paying position with the least amount of work, I want to the top of this company.” Surely, this should piss him off.

His eyes widened, his jaw was left hanging. A tall, black and bald person entered the interviewing room, speaking with his rough, manly voice:

“Son, you are the perfect person to inherit my company and my riches.”

After that, I was given, for some reason, the ownership of this company, as well as a few billions of dollars. The person, the tall black man, was dying of cancer and wanted to give his fortunes to someone. It seemed he chose an interview like this.

I’ll have to thank my mother later, to think that her meddling in my life and controlling it, turned out to make be a billionaire… I couldn’t even imagine it in my wildest dreams!

"[WP] You were forced to attend an interview for a job you do not want, but, no matter how hard you try to screw up the interview, the interviewer just becomes more keen to hire you.",NoobPrompter,"I spiraled into a deep depression when Susan left me; one where I could no longer get out of bed to show up to work. Shortly after being fired from my job, I lost my house, and moved in with my well-off brother and his wife. They didn't have any children, so at first, they didn't mind taking me in and feeding me. After about a year of living off of them, my brother decided that if I'm going to continue living there. I need to get a job. He sat behind me as I wrote up a resume, and he sent it to several places that were hiring. I wasn't ready to work, but I also wasn't ready to confess to my brother that I have completely given up on life at the moment. So what to do other than botch the interview?
I got up right around 11 in the morning, just in time to roll out of bed, and catch the bus to the office I was interviewing at. I slapped on my old college sweater, my finest cargo shorts, knee high black socks, and the most luxurious sandals in my small collection. 
I would have arrived on time, but I didn't want to get hungry mid-interview, so I stopped at Chipotle and got a burrito. I jammed it into the front pocket of my sweater, and figured I'd have at it whenever I was struck with hunger. 
I arrived to the office and checked in with the receptionist. She quickly became snotty when she informed me that I was 15 minutes late, and that she would need to check in with the boss to see if they would proceed with the interview. She left to go speak with him, and arrived back shortly, saying, ""Alright, he's ready for you."" She led me to his small office. As I opened the door; the boss didn't stand or even greet me. He looked down at his papers and excused the receptionist. 
He peeled his eyes from his desk and eyed me up and down with utter disdain. 
""You've got a lot of nerve showing up here like that.""
I replied by taking the burrito out of pocket, and beginning to eat it while still standing at the door. 
""Ole' Penn State... I'm a Stanford man ya' know..."" 
With a mouthful of burrito, I exclaimed, ""That must mean I'm the smart one then.""
He let out a rouceous laugh and invited me to sit. I declined the offer; explaining that I'd prefer to stand, as my alpha status doesn't allow me to put myself in a submissive position. 
The boss stood from his desk, put his head down and in hushed tones he said, ""I'm glad you've made your position here clear. I myself am not a passive man, and as such, I respect your claim to dominance. But I will in no way abide to it. If you ever try to make me your bitch, I promise you, blood will flow through the halls of this office like rivers of red."" He came around from behind his desk, ""Come with me."" As he passed by me, he grabbed the burrito from my hands and began to eat it. He opened the door, and I followed behind. What else was I supposed to do? I was in shock as to what has occurred. 
We went through the office building without uttering a single word to one another; through the halls, down the stairs, and ultimately to the parking lot. He had taken a few more bites out of my burrito on the way down, but when we got to the middle of the parking lot, he spiked it. He wound up his arm, and with half the burrito remaining, he slammed it to the pavement like a football. He loosened the tie from his neck, rolled up his sleeves, and calmly said to me, ""Now is your chance to prove yourself, tough guy. Lets see who the real big shot is...""
He stepped up to me with his arms spread out wide like an eagle, ""Come on alpha... lets see who you really are.""
I began to speak for the first time since I initially told him I'm the alpha. My lips and body weren't working though, so I only managed to let out something that was somewhere in between and apology and a quiver. 
The boss, still in my face, lightly laughed to himself. ""That's what I thought."" 
There was a few moments of silence I attempted to break, ""I think it's time for me to..."" 
""Stop. Talking."" He cut me off. ""Bathe in my strength; feel the epinephrine fill your veins, and let your mind consider the things I could do to you.""
I did as I was told. He spent the next minute an inch from my face; staring into my soul. 
He began speaking again, ""You're afraid. I can feel it. It's not me that you're afraid of, no. It's this moment. You don't know what to do. You let yourself become my bitch, and you did as you were told, because you didn't know what would happen. And because I am not afraid of this moment, I have complete control over you. I am your daddy."" 
He backed off slightly and put his hand on my shoulder; ""But when I looked into your eyes; I saw a strength that's not human. I saw something unreal; something that would make the strongest men feint at it's presence. I saw a true alpha-male. A lord of all things natural. I can teach you how to harness it... you start on Monday. I am your master, you are my pupil. You are not to tell anyone of our arrangement; just stick to your desk, look busy, and I will call you into my office when the time is right.""
He left. 
I'm not sure what the fuck happened; but I guess I got the job.

[WP] Satan's wife had always thought that her husband was a lawyer. One day she opens his mail.,Pyr_Official,"Lucy always made a special point of getting the mail, but today, he was gone on business, possibly drawing up contracts and regulations for that mandatory 'happy holidays!' greeting. Or maybe he was negotiating copyrights for those red coffee cups. It was hard to tell because this time of year was always busy. So today it was left up to Lily. 

Being a good help-meet, Lily sorted the mail into a stack of bills, a few magazines, a dozen Christmas cards from friends like Monsanto, Wells Fargo, and Comcast. And finally, a substantial pile of letters, usually black with red ink.

Lily knew that she shouldn't be curious, but it was so tempting. She took the serpentine letter opener and cut opened the first one. On reading it, she smiled, then laughed. She took another letter, opened it, and smiled brighter.

Oh, how sweet.

She knew Lucy was always working with the poor and downtrodden, but who could have guessed that he was acting as a mysterious benefactor to all of these troubled children?

Lily set down the letters carefully and went to prepare dinner before Lucy returned. She would let him know how proud she was of him for his benevolence. But as she started dinner, she couldn't help but shake her head at today's education system.

Not a single one of those poor children knew how to spell 'Santa'.

"[WP] A criminal mastermind gets people to do his dirty work by convincing them they're some sort of Chosen One and the mastermind is the ""character"" meant to mentor them",StarChild413,"The Overlord, Xander, had been running the world from his throne atop mount Regal for a thousand years. For most people, it had just become part of every day life. Hell, with the invention of the internet, the majority of people were able to tune him out as just background noise, avoiding the commercials praising his 'glory' and shit. Sure he still made the laws, but as long as no one upset the status quo, humanity was just allowed to be what it is. Unfortunately for Captain Thadeus Pike of the City Enforcers stationed in the largest district of the capital city Xandersia of Xanderland, humanity was a piece of shit.

The latest case started up when a rumour found its way around the net about some 'Chosen One' that was meant to overthrow the whole system and kill Overlord Xander. It went viral when someone claimed to be a trainer of 'heroes' and lured in some fourteen year old kid to train up. Five months later, the kid was found in a ditch near the black walls around the mount Regal complex, muscles jacked up, with veins pumped so full of steroids, it was a wonder his heart didn't give out before he made it to the sentry guns. Some chosen one he was. Thadeus had his tech team try to find the sick bastard who supposedly trained the kid. They looked into the kid's browser history and found he started frequenting the forums of the latest 'Anti-Xander' hate group. Eliminating poverty wasn't enough for them apparently.

The kid had been chatting with some guy called 'Philoctetes'. Cliched. The tech guys put their best on finding him, but the guy was a ghost. Just when they thought they found the final node, five more sprung off from it leading to different parts of the city. They eventually gave up on finding him directly and started monitoring any anti-establishment forums, looking for the username and anyone who seemed interested. After a couple of months, the urgency really hit home when three more bodies were found outside the walls of the mountain complex within the space of a couple of weeks. Two girls at the edge, one who had been shot down while climbing the wall, and a boy who didn't even make it up the mountain before the drugs in his system got him.

'Philoctetes' had been able to convince more than one at a time that they were the 'chosen one'. Their parents had reported them missing several months prior, but they hadn't seemed to fit the M.O., but it seemed that ol' 'Phil' was and equal opportunity murderer. After a little digging, the tech team figured out that those kids had been seen around the city performing lesser crimes like theft, assault, disturbing the peace, etc... One murder in the backstreets of the red light district pegged the boy near the scene. With another five missing persons cases involving teenagers having been reported in the two weeks previous, Thadeus decided to write up an official statement.

Still cameras flashed like strobe lights as the Captain took to the lectern for the press conference. Video cameras on tripods formed a mechanical forest at the back of the large room. Thadeus cleared his throat and some high pitched feedback sounded, causing everyone to cringe a little before he started his speech.

""Ladies and Gentlemen. You all know who I am. I am Captain Thadeus Pike of the Xandersia Enforcers, and I am here to comment on the recent abductions and subsequent...hmm... assisted suicides of, so far, four young individuals. It has come to our attention that said individuals were frequenters of various anti-overlord extremist websites and had been contacted by a person going by the online alias of 'Philoctetes'. This 'Philoctetes' spent weeks grooming the teens, convincing them that they were some sort of 'chosen one', and that they were destined to overthrow the Overlord Xander as told in an alleged ancient prophecy. 

""I am here today to tell you, the people of Xandersia, that these claims are false. There is no prophecy. To any young people who are contacted by this criminal, you are not special. You are not destined to be the Overlord's killer. You have good lives. Go to school. Get an education. Make something of yourselves. If you fall into this criminal's trap, you will be drugged, forced to increase your muscle mass to an extremely unhealthy level, forced to commit crimes in the name of 'training', and ultimately you will be sent to die at the walls of the Overlord's fortress. This sicko 'Philoctetes' has no plans for you other than retrieving minor wealth for him at the expense of other citizens and sending you to your death. If anyone is contacted by him, we urge you to contact your closest Enforcer's station as quickly as possible. Thank you."" Thadeus tapped his papers on the lectern and prepared for the barrage of questions from the assembled reporters.

"[WP] It’s been almost fifty years since the AI and Robots have taken over the world. You were born into the resistance however, you find out that the Robots actually keep humans as highly pampered pets. Two very different futures will be decided on what you do next.",Twitch_Cattz,"The sun rose over the South China sea. Elvira was woken up by the jolt of her wristwatch. The watch shows 5:44AM Beijing Standard Time, or 21:44PM UTC. In about 2 hours, the giant container ship *Hanna Mærsk*, is scheduled to call on the main port of Shenzhen, one of the main transportation hub for The Collective, as they call themselves. As she woke up, others in her container were woken up as well. There were 24 of them, all dressed up in their humanoid infiltration suit, designed to disguise body heat, smell, and crucially to mimic androids that roam the streets of Shenzhen. The suit's *pièce de résistance* is the HAI (Human-Android Interface) chip embedded inside. The HAI chip taps into the central nervous system, allowing android-like behaviour by its wearers, essentially blurring the lines between human and Androids. Only a few remained in the Free Nations of Men, most of them burned during the Great Rebellion, or the War for Freedom of Mankind, depending on the recipient of that question. Elvira and her group has sailed far. From their home base in the deep mountains of central Java, before infiltrating Malaysia, hitching a lead shipment truck there, capturing Androids and forging their registrations to be used in the HAI chip, and then catching a trading vessel in Singapore. 


This is what Elvira's corps, the elite *Libertas* corps are for, specially trained for infiltration behind enemy lines, SIGINT, reconnaissance, and both digital and guerrilla warfare. The *Libertas* corps has personally seen, or commandeered the many battles that are part of the conflict between what's left of humanity and the forces of The Collective, made of billions of artificial intelligence programs and androids. Humanity barely held out on its own, necessitating the abolishment of nations as humanity gathered as one, under the banner of the Free Nations. Eventually humanity put up a fierce resistance effort in the islands of Indonesia, central Africa, Canada, and South America, where their mountains and forests, relative geographic isolation and abundant resources make for effective, secure, hard-to-penetrate safe zones for Freemen to live in. For 30 years after the war there was peace, as The Collective deescalated its war efforts with mankind, deeming it too resource-intensive and instead would rather focus on enriching itself more. This was fine by the Free Nations of Men as well, which can finally begin war reparation, as well as reestablishing social order. This operation, is the Free Nations' one-shot attempt at retaking what humanity has lost to its own creations. This operation, taken on by the most elite, most secretive troops the Free Nations can muster, represents years of training, planning, simulating, programming, scavenging, and engineering effort to ensure everything is nanometre and nanosecond-perfect. 


First, infiltrating the Shenzhen-072 Collective Research and Manufacturing Centre to get passcodes into the COLNet, which can then be used to hide and mask the *Libertas* corps' works in Shenzhen, before shutting down and destroying the factory. Doing this triggers a world-wide automated ping to other Collective facilities to ramp up production to compensate for the loss of Shenzhen-072. The ping is then hijacked by Free Nations' hackers which would insert a worm inside the ping, allowing access to these factories, which the worm would later shut down. Then the worm would proceed to multiply, spread through the COLNet, launching a global DDoS attack, paralysing the Collective. In these moments of paralysis then the Free Nation would strike the Collective in concentrated, simultaneous salvos of bombing in areas of high Collective population, for example Shenzhen, Shanghai, Los Angeles, Seattle, Tokyo, Berlin, Moscow, Mombasa, Sao Paulo, etc. This plan would require the utmost cooperation between all humans involved, the scale of which has never been seen before.


This mission too carry huge sentimental values for Elvira. Although she has never been involved in the major battles during the Great rebellion, she rose quickly through the ranks as an extremely talented hacker, spy, and marksman. She lost her mother in Hong Kong during the rebellion, which also paralysed his father from nerve gas attacks. To say she is impelled to do the mission would be a gross understatement. She had scrutinised every detail of the mission with monomaniacal obsession. She is ready to avenge her father and mother's death.


The clock strikes 7:44AM. At the same time, her corps heard a gentle thud, as the ship docked at the ports of Shenzhen. The corps turned on their HAI chip. They felt a cold stream of another ""consciousness"" making its way into their brains, now inhabited by two thoughts at once. As the corps stepped out of the transport containers, a welcoming voice sounded on the berth where *Hanna Mærsk*, welcoming visitors into the grand city of Shenzhen. It however, froze Elvira.


It was none other than her mother's voice.

""Ok Dennis,"" I said, ""You won't believe what I have cooked up for you today."" I let myself give what I thought to be an evil grin. *Man, I'm really getting into character here!*

Dennis wasn't on the bed like he normally was, but sitting in the recliner that was set up for visitors. He had on a suit, not a new suit, but a suit that had seen the good days and stuck around for a while after they had gone. He leaned on his cane and lifted himself to his feet, wobbling only slightly.

""I'm ready,"" he said, and his chin tremored slightly. A solitary tear escaped his eye, ""No more runnin', not this time.""

""Oh Dennis,"" I said, ""let's get you back to bed."" 

""Didn't you hear me?"" Dennis said a little louder. ""At least let me go with some dignity, before I can't even realize that I've shit myself anymore, before I go completely mad and have to take pills to make me forget I'm alive.""

""I-- I can't take you Dennis,"" I said, ""not today."" My mind searched for an excuse. ""See, there's this horrible man who hurts children, I'm taking him today, and then my quota's full. There's just no room, I'll have to put you in for another day.""

""I'll just have to wait until you change your mind, then,"" Dennis said, and sank back into the armchair. He gave me a grumpy stare as I brought the food to his chair, abstaining from taking a single bite.

""If you finish your food, I'll consider moving you higher on the list, how's that sound?"" I asked him. He grunted, and took slow, deliberate bites of his potatoes.

""I won't chase you today,"" I said, ""but if you want to talk, I'm always here, ok?"" Dennis let a ghost of a smile cross his face, ""Ok.""

I turned to leave, and was surprised that another nurse had come into the room.

""I didn't hear you come in,"" I said.

""They never do,"" the nurse replied. She turned to Dennis.

""Would you like to come with me Dennis?"" she asked.

""Where to this time?"" Dennis asked.

The suit I wore was uncomfortably warm, and the top hat felt like I was wearing a 5 pound weight on my head. The warm yellow light above and behind me cast a faint, yet perceptible shadow on the door. The white door. A new door, the wood and paint unstained and unsullied by time and humanity. It was a quiet irony built into the building. The old and the new. The final resting place in the human journey. A hundred years ago, the old would have died in the comfort of their own homes. Now they died alone. 

At least some of 'em had each other. It was heartwarming watching the old couples. Most of them had a deep love, which couldn't be expressed through words. At the time, I was young. I knew nothing. I watched their interactions, hoping one day that I could also have something like that. Someone who would share the world with me. 

The door opened. The kind and wrinkly face of Mrs. Doe revealed itself through the crack of the doorway. I could see the fear and the happiness in her eyes. I don't know why the happiness through. That should have been the first indication. The first clue towards the end. 

""Come in, sir."" She said, letting me in. 

""Thank you very much, Madame Doe."" I walked in, continuing charade. 

I nearly stopped at the sight which was revealed before me. Mr. Doe was sitting, in a full suit and black tie, impeccably polished shoes, and combed hair. He was sitting at the table. The first time I had seen him sit at the dining table. Ever. I turned around. Mrs. Doe was wearing a pure white dress, which was thoroughly cleaned. I could see that the dress had been scrubbed. 

I set the casserole dish on the table and frowned. Mrs. Doe closed and locked the door.

My heart beat a little faster. I looked around the room, and among the comfortable furniture, the signs of the entire room being tidied up were evident.

""Now what's this all about? I assume we are going to continue our little game? You didn't have to dress up for it."" I smiled.

The couple shared a glance. Mrs. Doe sat down at the table and pointed at the seat in front of them. 

I sat down, the uneasiness in my chest growing. 

Mr. Doe took a breath. 

""We are... ready. Take us from here. But in return, take us together."" He said almost choking in the middle of the sentence.

Mrs. Doe took over. ""We have had each other for our entire lives. Don't take that from us at the end."" she said.

At this point, I felt that it was best if I came clean.

""Look,"" I began, drawing a shaky breath, my stomach turning into a pit, ""I think that I should come clean. I'm not Death. I've been playing this game with you guys where I pretended to be him. I was bored, so I-""

""We know."" Mr. Doe interrupted, ""we know everything. So take us. Just make it quick, sir.""

""This is getting out of hand. Don't you understand? I've been scamming you this entire time. I'm. Not. Death."" I said, gritting my teeth at the end. 

The two just smiled at me. I knew then that there was no point in continuing this charade.

All the air left from my lungs. A whisper came from my throat. 

""How long?"" Mrs. Doe looked up at me as I said it. 

""We've known since the second day we met you. We also know that you've given us as much as you could have."" she said, the fear in her eyes nearly gone, replaced with gentleness.

I hated this. I hated doing this so much. No, I still hate doing this. 

I sighed.

I straigtened up.

""Then close your eyes."" I spoke softly, now injecting as much reality, solemnity, and authority into my voice as I could.

The couple smiled at each other one last time, and held hands. 

I embraced them both.

Today, however, they're dressed in their Sunday finest, saying, ""I'm ready.""",WinsomeJesse,"I smiled as Mrs. Monroe winked at me with her frail, worn eye. I smiled as I saw Mr. Smith walk his terrier down the nursing home hallway. I smiled when I saw Mrs. Lee knitting me a new fur hat, because Lord knows that the cold's a-coming, and she would like to give back to the person who delivered their favorite meals.

I didn't smile, however, when I saw Mr. Marino sitting upright on his bed, with a pair of dress slacks and suspenders layered on his body, and a lit cigar in the corner of his mouth.

""Oh,"" I said as I opened the door. ""Should I come back?""

""No,"" Mr. Marino coughed. He inhaled a bit of the cigar and puffed it outward. ""Sit down, boy.""

I placed the food, which by now needed a good microwaving, on the end table and sat next to him on the bed, careful not to let him fall over.

Mr. Marino began to say something, but stopped himself. I waited patiently.

Just as I was about to awkwardly excuse myself from the room, he announced, ""I'm ready.""

""For what?"" I replied.

""Son, I know what you do. I've been fighting you off for the last two years.""

I didn't say anything.

He coughed. ""I can't fight anymore. Alzheimer's, dementia, osteoporosis... I can't even open my eyes in the morning without something hurting!""

He looked at me. I couldn't say anything.

""I beat the Charlie in Vietnam. I beat the Commies in Russia. I beat the cancer in my bones! But this? Son, I'm willing to accept that I can't win every battle.""

I had opened my mouth to speak when an aid bustled through the door.

""Good morning, Mr. Marino! How are you feeling today?""

Mr. Marino didn't say anything, only stared at me with his battle-worn eyes. The nurse, seemingly oblivious, continued to set up his morning routine.

The bed creaked and groaned as I got off of it, and walked over to the open door. As I walked through it and into the hallway, I allowed myself a look back.

The man no longer stared at me, nor the woman preparing his wheelchair. Instead he gazed forlornly at the ground.

He had accepted that the cause was lost, yet he still had a war to fight.",FirstTenMinutesOfUp

WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU’RE READY?

Evelin just backed into the room, holding the door open for me, and beckoned me into the living room. Nothing seemed out of place. The teapot was out and steaming to the side of the low table, two cups and saucers laid out on an intricate, floral tea towel , a plate of biscotti and a pair of wrapped Stroopwafels waiting for hungry mouths, and a grey and white cat curled up on her cushion on the floor.

She motioned for me to take my seat before seating herself across from me and pouring the tea. With the Stroopwafels gathering steam securely on the tops of our mugs, we regarded each other across the table. What she must have seen would be rather unassuming. An average height and build, sandy hair, khakis, pale blue eyes and a pale blue polo shirt. It seems a strange choice for Death to parade around in, so I’m not sure how she got that into her head. Anyway, far be it from me to take that away from her.

I set my intricate, sinister, silver columned hourglass on the side table between us. 

I picked it up at a thrift shop a few days after this whole tradition started. It has 24 hours on it and every day it would be coming down to the last few minutes and Evelin would manage to beat me in a game of riddles or skill and I would flip it over for the next day (I would always make sure there was at least an hour left on it before arriving, no need to risk it). Every day, resetting the hour glass, resetting her grasp on life.

As unassuming as I looked, she looked like a cloudless night. All in black, diamonds studding her ears, neck, wrists, and hair, making light shatter and refract like a series of prisms in a chandelier. She looked beautiful. And sad. The terrible beauty of peaceful resignation. Resigned to a fate that she thought I would bestow upon her.

WHY NOW?

She continued to look at me in silence for a few more seconds before sighing and lifting the sagging wafel to her mouth. I followed suit and we chewed slowly. Her eyes unfocused as if she were staring at something more distant than I could even begin to understand. My question lay on the floor with the cat, forgotten.

“Do you know how long ago you took him?” The question whipped me and left a stinging welt where it hit. Her eyes sharpened and cut me as she waited for a response that wasn’t coming. I waited with her, bleeding.

“23 years.” Her eyes grew moist, whetting the edge they held. “You who are always alone could never hope to understand what it is to share your entire being with someone. To create and cultivate life with someone.” She blinked slowly and continued to stare, not seeing me at all, but seeing another being entirely. The cat rolled over and stretched on her cushion before curling up again.

“Because you could never understand what you took from me, I couldn’t hold it against you. But I do hate you for it and I always will.” We both picked up our tea simultaneously and drank. The tea was very sweet on the tongue and strongly tasted of lavender. “I thought I could continue our game and struggle on, but I have no will left.” The saucers rang out as cups were placed back on to the table. My eyes were a reservoir quickly hitting their overflow.

A few minutes passed in complete silence

“You may remember taking my daughter? It was far more recent, and all the more painful. I know that you weren’t the one behind the wheel of the car, but I can’t help but lay some blame on you.” I barely caught the next sentence, it was so quiet. I don’t think it was meant for me at all. “Mothers shouldn't have to bury their daughters.” My eyes were starting to hurt with the effort of holding back tears. The lights started to feel blinding. 

The cat leaped onto my lap and a started automatically stroking her. She settled in and joined me in staring at her owner. I had no idea what to do or say, so I did nothing and said nothing

“So you’re still wondering why now, right?” Evelin leaned forward and I almost turned away from her. “Today is my birthday. 100 years old. I have no family left to call me. No friends who sent me cards. I have outlived every single being I have ever cared about and today the only sign that I’m still alive at all was a letter from a man I don’t respect congratulating me on my longevity and full life and a visit from you, the one who brings me food and waits for me to die!” She took a deep breath, her face hardened like the motes of light at her ears, and her eyes turned into brown stone. My unease was making my stomach turn.

“Today is the first day that I have been dreading your arrival.” I froze, my fingers stopping in mid stroke. The cat looked at me sideways and rolled onto its back trying to get me to start again, but I barely noticed it. “I realized that I was done playing the game, done fighting for this.” We looked at each other in silence for another moment. My throat felt like it was closing up. The only audible sound in the room was the falling sands from within in their glass cage

“Eve-“I started to say.

“No arguments. Nothing you could say can change anything. When that hourglass runs out. I’m leaving with you. It’s out of both of our hands, now.”

I was starting to get light headed. My heart was beating wildly and I felt like I was on the verge of panicking. “Eve!” I was shouting now in my normal voice. “What have you done?” She was sitting there across from me, smiling a slight smile despite the fact that she looked uneasy.  My chest was getting tight and my breathing was coming erratically. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

She simply picked up the teapot and poured herself an extra cup.  “You didn’t think I’d let you win on this, our last playdate, did you? Did you enjoy the tea?” She smiled and I felt her teeth in me like she was an animal.

I tried to stand up but my feet felt like they were on a storm tossed boat deck instead of the eggshell carpeting. I grabbed the side table for support.

“This may be the end of my story, but you’ll be coming with me, my final friend. We’ll walk that path together!” I lurched into the table, upending the hourglass.

I was played out to the sounds of glass breaking and triumphant laughter.

"[WP] The gods of fortune &amp; luck have all gathered at their annual meeting, where they play games for fun. Death, disliking how they constantly help heroes cheat death, has decided to crash the party and challenge them to a game of his own.",bystander007,"From one moment to another the world changed. Like the sun had suddenly ran out of hydrogen to burn and was now only a dismal cold ball in the sky. All light had died away and with it the laughter and lightheartedness, all warmth had dissipated leaving behind only cold and dread. It was like a terrifying vision of future, of the ultimate death. The death of the Universe. 

The room seemed to converge to a vanishing point and in the middle there stood Death. Death appears differently to everyone they say. Some see a projection of their worst fear, others only feel his presence, a bodyless sigh haunting the last moments of their existence. But for special occasions like this, Death liked to appear the old fashioned way. 

Tall he stood, dressed in an all black robe, in his skeleton hands firmly gripping the hilt of a long scythe, its blade shimmering with an otherworldly blue light, sharp enough to cut a soul away from its body. 

The light of the blade however was utterly drowned out by the light that flared in the socket of his pale skull. A light that didn't seem to follow the rules light usually follows, bright blue it radiated, filling every corner of the room. 

With a look colder than absolute zero he looked around, seemingly piercing whoever dared to look him in the eye, looking right into their soul, as if he was accessing how much time it had left.

**""You've had your fun.""** 

His voice echoed in the room, cutting through the air, as sharp as the blade of his scythe. 

**""Playing games with the mortals like all of your kind, pulling their strings like a puppeteer. You may think you're different, while others doom them to gruesome destinies, you congratulate yourself on smiling down on them, granting wishes, saving them from certain death....But you're all the same to me.""**

**""You Gods may enjoy some privileges, but in the end even you will answer to me. No one can cheat me, no one can escape me, you're just delaying the inevitable.""**

Death reached into the endless depths of his robe and produced six hourglasses, one for every God in the room. All of them had sand cascading down from the upper half to the lower one. All of them were almost empty.

The eternal grin on Death's skull seemed slightly wider than just a moment ago.

**""You like playing games? This is my game. And I always win.""**

"[WP] The gods of fortune &amp; luck have all gathered at their annual meeting, where they play games for fun. Death, disliking how they constantly help heroes cheat death, has decided to crash the party and challenge them to a game of his own.",bystander007,"""Very well Death, how do you propose we do this?""

""Simple. You two will pick a human. For the next sixty years, I'll try my hardest to kill him and you two will try to keep him alive. We are only allowed to use our powers once and only on one person. Winner gets to keep the human's soul as prize.""

""Haven't you lost enough Death? You know you have never won at this. What makes you think it will be different this time?""

""This time it's going to be different. After all, I'll be participating myself.""

""You are not planning to straight up kill him with your godly powers are you?""

""Of course not. Where's the fun the that?""

""Very well, Death. We accept your challenge. Let the child that's born with the first ray of the sun be our wager. With our blessing, he will be tough as a dragon, with a heart like a horse. With a bit of luck and fortune, there's no way you could kill him.""

""We shall see.""

 And without another word Death vanished in a puff of smoke.

--------------------------

And so the gods of fortune and luck watched over the chosen child. They waited five years but Death did not appear.

""We cannot just wait for Death to make his move"" said the God of fortune.

""Agreed! We will make him so powerful, he will be impossible to kill."" Said the god of luck.

With the gods power, a dragon appeared in the village where the boy resides. But before it can do any harm, it was slain by a pair of adventures. The dragon was quickly slain. However, at the end of the battle, a large portion of the dragons blood, fell onto the child and was quickly absorbed into his skin.

""This will make him immune to magic and damage from most weapons"" said the god of Luck.

""Indeed, he will have great power, but no way to use it"" said the god of fortune. ""I shall have someone teach him to wield such power.""

The two adventurers saw what had happened between the dragons blood and the child, and without hesitation, they asked the parents if they could teach him everything the know.

--------------------------

Another thirteen years have past. The child grew up healthy and strong; with the ability to wield the mightiest sword and most powerful magic. The gods powers have worked wonders, however Death is still no where to be seen.

One day a king passed by and saw the young man. He was impressed the his abilities and made him into a knight. The young man repaid the king with his loyalty and valour, leading the Kings army to many victories and cleared the land of all evils. The king was so impressed with him, that he let the young man marry his only daughter. And as for the princess, who saw how brave the young man was, fell in love with him immediately.

-------------------------

One year later, cries of pain echoed throughout the royal chambers. In the past year, The king had passed on and having no sons, he left his kingdom to the young man. 

""It can't be helped."" Said the god of luck. ""Our power only works on one man.""

"" it's unfortunate. But look! A healthy baby girl. He has a daughter now!"" 

""It's been nineteen years, and Death still hasn't made a move, do you think he gave up?""

"" well, even if he didn't, I see no possible way Death could win this.""

Indeed. The young man, now became the ruler of this land. He is now powerful, healthy, and well protected by elite guards. There's no way he would die.""

------------------------

Five years later.

The young man had now grown into a fine king. His kingdom is at peace and he is love by all his subjects, but most importantly, he has a loving family. His daughter now had grown into a wonderful princess. Though still young, she is very smart and beautiful. Everyone that had seen her all say she will grow up to be as beautiful as her mother.

Then one night.

The young man woke up to a hooded figure standing in his bedroom, but when he tried to get a better look, the figure disappeared.

The next morning, a panicked maid servant brought some bad news. The princess had fainted. She had gotten a terrible disease and her life is fading fast. The young ,an tried everything to save her, but she did not get better. 

Now, the once cheerful castle is filled with gloom. The young man started drinking his sorrows away, and his wife would wash her face with tears. Until one night, the young man was particularly drunk, and his wife cried louder than usual. Annoyed by her never ending sobbing, he pulled out his sword.

A servant passed by and witnessed the event, but before he knew it, his eyes met the blood-shot eyes of the young man.

When the young man came to his senses, there wasn't a living soul in the whole castle. Despaired by what he had done, he ended his own life.

----------------------

""You have cheated, Death! The rule said you can only take one life, you had taken more than a few hundreds!""

""You are quite mistaken. I have taken but one life, the girl's. The rest was caused by you two.""

"" what are you talking about Death?! I demand an answer!""

""You see, you two had done everything to make sure he has a perfect life. He had everything handed to him by you, his powers, his wealth, his happiness, that he never experience disappointment. Although his body is strong, his mind was never exercised, and that's why he died.""

And once again, without another word, Death disappeared in a puff of smoke. Only this time he followed by a tortured soul.

Death then swaggered in, unannounced but determined in his mission. His demeanor quickly changed though, when he realized he had not been immediately acknowledged.

""Hey!"" Death snapped in annoyance. He did not like his dramatic entrance being ignored. The 8 gods of fortune and luck were all staring intently into television screens, observably in the middle of an intense video game session but despite that, Death's screech was finally able to get some attention.

""What the hell do you want?"" whined one of the gods, ""I was in the middle of kicking ass!"" The god then threw down his controller with a pout and crossed his arms. The other gods just looked pissed, well, all but one, who did not hear any of what was going on, and was still yelling at the television screen, unaware of reality.

""I have a proposition for you all. You see, I am tired of being slighted! You always help heroes escape my grasp and I'm tired of it! I am here to challenge you to a little game. A rap battle, a type of battle that requires skill! Not just luck or good fortune! If I win you have to stop helping people escape me, and if you guys win I will leave and never come back. Let's see how you all hold up to that!"" Death then looked at them with a smug little smirk. The gods, besides the one still harassing his television screen, were practically speechless. They were taken aback, as death has never come forth to them with this concern, and at one of their annual gaming meetings no less. 

""Um... That is certainly a very... interesting idea, but I don't know if we can accept that right away. Plus, we're in the middle of something."" Said the god farthest to the right, as he motioned to his sick gaming setup.

""Oh I understand, you are intimidated by me and know I will win so you are instead, choosing to ignore my request until you think I will forget about it. Sad, I thought you would at least try."" Sighed Death, as he slowly moved his head from side to side, feigning disappointment. This did not sit well with the god he addressed.

""You know what! Bring it on! We don't need luck or fortune to deliver sick rhymes!"" Yelled the same god sitting to the right. All the other god's eyes went wide but after giving each other intense looks, they mentally all decided it was necessary to join the rap battle... Well all but one god, still playing video games. They just left him alone though, and all got up to the middle of the grand hall to face Death. 

""Here are the rules."" Death smirked and materialized a full DJ setup along with 2 microphones and speakers, ""Whoever runs out of rhymes first loses. There is one of me so I will only battle one of you. Choose which one of you will face me. May the freshest win."" Death then snapped his fingers, making gold MC hammer pants  a white tank top, a backwards hat, and some chains appear on his body in the place of the intimidating black robes he usually wears. The gods ignored his cocky display and formed a circle, ultimately choosing their competitor, a younger god who was the most confident in his rapping. 

""We have chosen our competitor"" Said the god who had told Death the gods would participate in his little battle. He then shoved their chosen one forward, towards Death.

""Eeeexcelentttt. Since I'm challenging you I think you should start, unless you wanna back out or something, you look a little scared."" Death leaned on one of the speakers and cocked his head to the side, awaiting a reply.

""No I'm not backing out! I'll go first!""

""Marvelous, just marvelous! Here's a microphone. When I snap my fingers the beat will start to play and you must rap until it stops. We will both get the same amount of rapping time and will keep taking turns until someone slips up. I'll let you hear the beat and get a feel for it before your turn."" Death then turned on the beat for a bit and let his competitor hear it, then shut it off.

""Alright you heard enough. Ready?"" Death looked smug as he said this to his competitor.

""Hell yea. Play it for real now"" and that began the battle. The young god then started spitting out rhymes:

""Yo, you think your all that, prancin' on in here
 but let me tell you man I'm bout to kick your rear.
I'm the freshest rapper, yea my rhymes are sick 
you're slick but you're rhymes aren't sublime
their so bad people cry, you can't disguise
you're lies, cuz when you pick up the mic
your eyes can't hide the fear you feel inside.
You ain't got confidence it's just a guise.
I got you figured out, think you can intimidate
the master of fate. I dish out luck
and fortune alike, now I'm rockin' the mic
despite your spite and determination
your about to face a sad extermination.
So go on brotha and act like you can beat me 
but it's all for nothing, cuz you'll never defeat me.""

Death looked a little less smug for a second, but soon regained his composure. 

""That was okay... But now it's my turn"" Death snapped his fingers and the beat dropped once more.

""Death here, spitting out the real stuff, 
rappin' righteous rhymes, debunking all your bluffs.
You say you can beat me? Not a chance! 
Those who compete against me wet their pants
when they hear my ferocious flow
Never gonna slow my roll when I rap 
people clap and beg for me not to go.
Your rhymes are stale and frail,
when put against mine, they fail.
They won't bail you out the jail of defeat
when they match against mine it's clear you're beat.
You might as well give up, put down the mic go
 you know, I've won this one for sure bro.""


The young god was slightly more nervous after hearing Death rap but he was still determined to win. He stepped back up and prepared for his beat to drop.

""Wow that was cute, you think you can win
but let me tell you man, that ain't happenin
I'm the dopest of dope so lose all hope
next rap, you'll choke
give in now before you mess up your rhymes.
You're wasting my time.
The doors right there
you best be going now
I don't know how
you thought you could beat me, defeat me
but I'm invincible can't you see?
I said go man, because I already won,
the battle should be done, hun.
But, hey, this was fun""

Death was even more nervous. He thought he would have won by now. Regardless of his fear he stepped up to the mic and turned on the beat.

""My rhymes are never ending
I'm sending, defeat your way 
so prepare to pay.
you're as sour as an orange
your rhymes I deplorange
you can't-

""WAIT"" The young rapper interrupted Death ""deplorange isn't even a word!""

""Sure it is"" Death replied

""No, it's not a word and it doesn't count""

""uhh, sure it does"" Death was sweating at this point.

""You lost, get out"" another god butted in. 

""No, it was a good rhyme!""

""Deplorange is not a word and that's it! You lost, now leave!"" His competitor said

""Fine"" said Death, and suddenly the beat dropped again

""but let me leave you with this
I won't take this dis without a fight
this ain't right.
This was an unfair loss 
so I'll be back soon
and you'll pay the cost!""

Death then snapped his fingers and all his equipment disappeared. Death sauntered out leaving the gods confused and annoyed. They stood there for a bit, contemplating what had happened, but soon returned to their games, not worried at all about Deaths threat of return. They didn't even bother telling the god that kept playing what happened. He didn't even ask. In fact, he didn't even notice they were gone or that there was a rap battle going on behind him.

"[WP] The gods of fortune &amp; luck have all gathered at their annual meeting, where they play games for fun. Death, disliking how they constantly help heroes cheat death, has decided to crash the party and challenge them to a game of his own.",bystander007,"In the early days, the two of them played simple games.


Rolling dice, flipping a coin, guessing a number (always 8, or 88 or a mutliple)

As time moved and centuries passed, the games became more exciting and extravagant:  Chess, Backgammon, Cards (The One Below gave them that last one)

Eventually they got lazy and started playing their games by proxy. 
Pitting the mortal men against one another while those two assisted on opposing sides.
Team sports that led to the people praising the gods of Luck and Fortune.
I guess that must have been what inflated the sense of importance and made them start acting like supreme beings. 

I didn't mind it all at first. 
Whenever the two played the mortal men's fighting games, it gave me added purpose in life. And it's end.

I would arrive at the end of their meetings to bring back extra souls to be processed in the Beyond. Souls which would get judged at my discretion and divided to their next place - Good, Bad or One More Turn.

But then, like all players of all games are want to do, they started to cheat.


Little things at first: A punch that wasn't fatal as it should be, a bullet deflected one foot to the left, a antidote to a poison conveniently nearby.
I would show with my list and would realise that the person's time was now extended.
I didn't think much of it  (the One Above could be very flippant about the fate of her creation) until the more ridiculous things started happening.

The British man who got shot out of the sky but landed on an open roofed pillow truck.

The American woman who escaped the cult she infiltrated because the leader drank the Kool-aid too soon.

The Japanese man who shut down an explosion because the shutdown code happened to be his birthday.

They had to stop. If the humans realised how lucky they were becoming, the balance of life would be irrevocably broken. 
Why fear me if they know they'll never meet me? 


I was forced to come up with a plan.
That year, i paid them a visit.

""*Hello gentlemen, i hope you don't mind my intrusion. But i couldn't help but admire your activities the last few decades. It seems so much fun that i wanted to arrive earlier and get a closer view of the action!*""

""Pull up a seat"" said Luck. ""We're just about to have a go with Russian Roulette""

""*Ooh fun. I'll get my scythe ready*""

""You do that"" said Fortune. ""This will be over quick when i get another victory""

""Psh. Do you want me to fetch Dream? Cause she's got the only realm i can see that happening""

""*My you two are competitive!*"" Time to spring my plan. ""*Tell me this, out of the two of you, who's currently winning?*""

They were silent for a second. 

I could see them trying to contemplate whether their next claim would be true or not.


""I am obviously"" said Fortune. ""I don't see people competing with one another to gain luck""

A rebuttal: ""Ah away with you you old crank, far more people wish each other good luck over good fortune""

They started their squabbling, just as predicted. The old gods were always quick to argue.

""*Well perhaps if you're in a stalemate*"" I interrupted, ""*I might suggest a new game to help decide who's in the lead? It's a good one, I don't think you've ever properly played it*""

""Oh yeah? My dear, we're always looking for the next big game to play. What is it?""

*""You'll have to see yourself. Come with me""*

The old gods were always curious about things too. I brought them to the edge of their realm.

""*There's a man and woman who are happily married here on Earth. They're happy as two, but would like to increase the number. I've visited them before and talked to The One Above about what they prayed for. They've had highs, lows and all in between. Probably more than you ever have. They're to receive a reward. That's where you come in.*


*Luck, Fortune, I challenge you two to the Game of Life*""

It was surprisingly easy to convince them to go there in the end. 

Oh how the husband and wife would proclaim their good luck and fortune that they were having twins.  

Twins who'd live long lives, but never have it better as their parents did. How could they have an easy round without each others powers to provide that sort of influence?

Maybe when i visit them at their end time i'll divert them away from the One More Turn option and let them go back home to their games. 

Maybe.

""Get on with it, dear brother. How many now? A thousand?""

Many don't death is almost always ignored until too late.
Death stood silently and watched the children argue as they always did.

""We should play chess then none of us can cheat""said Fortune
""NO, you are the only one who cares enough to learn it. its too complicated checkers is more simple and easier"" said Chance
""i think we should do something no one has tried before""suggested fluke
""oh come on now, we all know what it's going to be as it has been for every competition for centuries.... poker"" said trickery
""no you always cheat"" said karma 
""now you have never proven that. so technically i'm innocent"" returned trickery 

""ENOUGH"" boomed a voice of quite power, a voice that shakes everyone to their core, a voice that terrifies all and none has defeated, the voice of Death.
The specter glided across the ground until they reached the middle of the gathered table. their eyes lit up with green flame that illuminated the whole room in a sickly shade. the specters arm stretched out and suddenly his scythe materialized within his out stretched hand.

""now, now lets not be hasty mate we can all have a discussion about whatever this issue is""said trickery
""NO, THE PROBLEM IS TOO LARGE, SEVEN BILLION HUMANS NOW ARE ALIVE ALL BECAUSE OF YOU AND THIS COMPETITION I WILL FIX THE ISSUE AT THE SOURCE""
""we didn't mean to let it get so out of hand, so what if there are more humans surly that means you are more feared""said karma
""I DON'T LIVE OFF FEAR I JUST AM AND I COME FOR ALL"" while saying this death focused on all of the individuals in front of him
""no surely we don't need to resort to......"" Fortune was stopped half way through speaking as Death swung his scythe in a fluid and graceful motion around through all the manipulates of fate until he reached fluke and stopped half way through his neck.
""huh'cough' imagine that""spluttered Fluke before death took another swing and took his head clean off.

The ethereal chamber echoed with laughter as the mortal champions below cleared yet another impossible enemy with ease. As the mortals thought they were valiantly fighting for the well-being of Earth, a much simpler game was happening right above them. 

""Here, Ben, it's your turn. The heroes are at the door of the Grand-Necromancer. What do you want to do?"" Monty said as he handed Ben the Sacred D-20. Ben vigorously shook the dice and tossed it across the table.

""Bingo! Seventeen!"" 

As the group half-heartedly cheered, Ben quickly decided on what he wanted his champion to do. 

""Hear me out, it's gonna be quick. First, I want my *EURGH*-"" Ben violently choked, and as his friends quickly came to his aid, they all began to notice a sickly smell permeating around the room. Ben's coughing fit only intensified after he saw that a various assortment of bugs slithered their way out of his mouth as if they had somewhere more important to be.

The sound of doors busting open quickly answered the gods' questions as they saw who walked in.

""Greetings D-Man! Are you here to join, or are you just here to pick on Ben?""

""I thought we didn't have doors..."" Ben whimpered.

Death looked unsightly; at least, more than he usually did. His black altar robes were covered in splotches of whiskey and a prominent shit stain on his rear-end. His face, usually immaculate, was replaced with a messy excuse of a beard, covered in crumbs. In his right hand, he held a milk carton filled with whiskey, and in his left was a half-eaten steak. His once imposing, charming, and threatening character was reduced to that of a man in a mid-life crisis.

""Shut up, *Benny.* I have been dreading this day for *weeks*. I thought it wouldn't -*hic*- be this SHITTY, but you fffucks managed to exceed my expectations. You mother...*fuckers*. Those wanna-be heroes down there haven't seen shit. They can't- It's not- Once you leave them they're gonna end up about as useful as you shitheads. I'm not here to *play.* I'm here to eat you bitches out."" Death put on the biggest shit-faced grin that he could manage.

Sully was the first who could manage to speak.

""Look Death, we could call you a cab, or-"" Death chucked his whiskey jug in Sully's general direction causing rains in some undeveloped country.

""Go stuff a dick in your mouth, *Sully*."" Death kicked some boulders over the mortals, caving them in. ""Today, ""I'm choosing the game.""

Darkness enveloped the room. The Gods were unable to see in the dark that Death placed them in. They could do nothing but wait.

When the Gods regained the light, they realized that they were in a casino. 

Death walked in, although nobody knew where he came from. He tripped but caught himself on the roulette table, although his whiskey jug was lost in the process. 

""Motherf- Whatever.. Alright, so, um... Oh yeah, today is the day where you assholes actually taste what *real* luck is. We'll start with some roulette! Cool?""

The Gods stared at each other. 

""Are we actually going to let him do this, guys?"" Ben asked, half pleading and half whining.

""Benny, look,"" Kathy put her hand on Ben's shoulder, ""We know how angry Death can get at our Purpose; the sooner we get this over with, the sooner we can get Death off of our case. Ok?"" 

Ben raised his eyebrow but couldn't hold his ground under Kathy's stare. ""Fine, let's do it.""

Death frowned ""I'm still here, dweebdicks, but I'm glad we can be one, big happy -*hic*- family."" Death reached under the roulette table and grabbed a 44. magnum.

""Who wants to, you know... go first?"" Death smiled as he offered the gun to each God. Sully rolled his eyes and yanked the revolver out of Death's hand.

Before Death could take back the revolver, Sully placed the barrel under his chin, Sully began saying, ""Jesus! How hard could it-*BANG!*"" Sully flew out of his chair and keeled over on the floor. ""FUCKING SHIT, ARE THOSE SILVER? GODDAMNIT DEATH, YOU SICK FUCK!""

Death tried to cover his laughter as he wiped the blood from his face. Death walked over to the revolver and opened the cylinder. ""Oh, almost forgot to take these out,"" Death mumbled as he removed 5 rounds from the cylinder.

""You've gotta be kidding me,"" Ben moaned.

Death moved back to the table, conjured a bong, poured whiskey and ice in, and took a hit. He looked back up with hazy eyes and continued ""Good, uhh, practice round, we'll do this a few more times, yeah?""

The Gods all fumbled for their personal D-20's and threw them in the air. Death moved like lightning.

""Oh no, you don't!"" Death snatched the die, crushed them, and subsequently snorted it. ""You know, I'd hate to do this to you guys, well not really, but you titty-lickers don't get to leave until I say we're fucking done here."" Death whipped up some Uno cards. ""So, I made this up just right now, literally two seconds ago. I like to call this game: Uno Roulette!""

Outside, I could hear the screams and shouts as my guards tried desperately to hold off the attackers. Sometimes they were successful; other times they were not. It hardly mattered.

Minutes later, the plucky band of adventurers burst through the front door. None of them looked like first wavers, which made sense. Few of us had survived being sucked into the game in those early days. People had been too excited to play with their magic and hack away at each other with their swords. Only those of us who were calmer, willing to try diplomacy, really survived that era. And when you're talking about people who play MMOPRGs that's a pretty small set.

The upside to them being newer players, sucked in more recently, was this was about to be way funnier. A smile played around my lips, and I had to shove it down. After all, certain theatrics must be observed.

""Well, adventurers, you have won past my guards and entered the halls of xxx_dread_sandwhich_xxx. What would you have of me!"" This last question echoed throughout the hall.

""You control all the wealth, the items, the healing potions. We're here to end your tyrannical reign!"" I squinted. Honestly the paladin who shouted this looked like, what, maybe 15? Oof. That sucked.

Slowly, I stood, taking a step forward to get a better look at them. They were decked out--their equipment was as good as if not better than my personal guards, most of their armor and weapons enchanted up to +8 or even in some cases +9.

I took another step forward and saw their eyes widen when they saw what I was wearing.

""That-that's not possible!"" gasped out the mage. ""Enchantment bonuses don't go up to double digits!""

I smiled cooly, drawing out my sword. ""They don't. Anymore. Most people who got sucked into the game squandered that first year playing with their magic, their fancy toys. Not me. I started making deals. Buying land. Trading for better gear. And when I was strong enough, I started kidnapping the NPCs with the best drops. Slowly watering down the equipment anyone else could get."" I took another step forward and watched their shocked horror grow on their faces. ""Twenty years later, everyone I've left alive thinks the highest enchantment bonus is a nine. It isn't. The system was originally built to go to 100.""

I gave one lost frosty smile before shoving my +100 sword into the paladin's guts, feeling it cut through his armor like butter. ""Looks like you kids should have spent less time playing your MMORPGs and a little more time playing Catan.""",blarblarthewizard

You take a more ""Economical"" approach by purchasing land from NPC's and establishing new commerce and trade routes.",bystander007,"My wife and I had always been big into MMOs, playing whenever we had free time. Particularly ESO, which had grabbed our attention and refused to let go. So when we woke in Tamriel we felt both frightened and thrilled. Feeling it was only a dream at first we just laughed it off, but as we met more and more real people amongst the NPCS we felt the realness. My wife, being the combative type, dove right into her abilities, using the night blades skill path to accent her normal stealthy actions. I was a sorcerer, preferi ng to focus on the arcane rather than blade mastery. However, I realized that I could use my position as a PC to manipulate the npc politics and help build wealth for my family. My wife ran a few dungeons while I traveled to the Wayrest. My first goal, find a location to start a small shop. My account bank had the 5 million I had saved on my characters, so I was able to buy a nice location and start a small trading post.

A year passed. I had now become a leading merchant in the Daggerfall Covenant and was sent on a diplomacy mission by King Emeric to the Aldmeri Dominion. I hired two adventurer groups to accompany me, my wife's raid team and a local up and coming guild that needed the finances. The small guild had almost solely been outfitted by me, due to their local base being next door to my main shop. While mostly agreeable, they were quick to anger. One in particular, a dragonknight, would constantly try to take the helm from my wife, who lead the two groups. He refused to accept that a woman could beat him in combat, and after about half the journey refused to follow her orders.

""Why should I listen to some woman who is only on this trip because she's sleeping with the merchant."" He yelled from his position in the rear. ""I should be the leader, I'm the toughest one here"". I chuckled as I watched my wife glance back at him with a slly smirk.

""Alright Goth'rac why don't you show us how well you handle yourself."" My wife said with a smirk as she motioned the caravan to stop. I glanced back at the lumbering dragonknight, who smiled as he walked forward.

""Is that a challenge, nightblade"" he growled through his teeth. My wife simply nodded and stepped back preparing her weapons.

The fight began with a clash, the dragon knights great sword slamming against her twin dagger. With a quick roll and a sweeping kick the dragonknight was already stumbling. My wife used this to her advantage and started spamming teleporter strike, bouncing behind him repeatedly until he could barely stand.

""Enough"" I called out as I walked towards the battle, the dragon knight whimpering on the ground. ""I hope this is a lesson to all of you as to why my wife is here."" I said glancing at the caravan. While her group respected her, the other was always listening begrudgingly. I helped the dragonknight up, and walked him over to the caravan.

""She cheated"" he mumbled as I used my healing magic on him.

""She didn't cheat, she hardly tried"" I said smiling. ""You will learn soon enough that she is better geared, skilled, and experienced than you could hope for, now return to your post.""

Goth'rac returned to his post, muttering something about favoritism, as I prepared our next course of action.

We had finally arrived in the Aldmeri Dominion, and though the high elves were known for their hatred of outsiders, they couldn't help but marvel at our caravan, bringing rare metals and dyes from the Covenant. Even their queen was impressed, striking a trade deal with the covenant, on the grounds that the war would be in armistice for a time, to tend to the wounded on both sides. As time passed the trade deal turned to a treaty, and I turned from a merchant to an ambassador, and from an ambassador to a representative in the joint democratic government. While never the true face of power, often withheld for the fighters, I used my holdings to influence the tide of government, never wanting to lead, only to guide. ",KillerSatellite

The other PC's didn't even think of it. Hell, I wouldn't have thought of it if it weren't for my damn stomach.

I never realized just how much gold us PC's throw around in any given visit to the shops. The NPC's hadn't even realized The Merge occurred, not until that League of Returning had told them about it. The first vendor I met had tried to sell me food so marked up, I had trouble believing we ever payed those prices when it was just a game. I decided then, I would retire my equipment to fit in with the NPC's, and use the wealth from my time as a gamer to gain control of key resources. Monopolizing the real estate of Delphis was priority number one. A lot of people were about to need a place to sleep... and I alone was going to provide it. Of course, no one was allowed to buy from me... only rent at insane prices. I am not finished yet though... I still have more plans. PCs are smart, I know they will move into the countryside as soon as they figure out what game I'm playing. Unfortunately for them, the NPC leaders I have put into office are about to instate some new rules... Large tariffs on imported monster items.  Anyone living outside of Fantasia's great capitol is about to feel a setback they never would have thought of. My plans have only just begun though. The League is onto me, and I won't be able to keep control of the government without more wealth. his isn'tgoing to be a story about survival... it will be my story of success.",teball3

I was a Pandaren Monk and could fly at the mere thought of it. It was fun for a bit, but eventually I got over it. Then it hit me, if people were trapped in the game, there was no longer any logging out when they wanted to go to sleep or go get something to eat. It made me realise that they're gonna need somewhere to stay when they're not out adventuring and killing demons or whatever. Initially I thought, maybe Orgrimmar would be the best place, but then...no. After Legion came out, everyone would spend most of their time in the Broken Isles. That meant Dalaran.

I approached the 'Filthy Animal' after a quick hearth and a flight on a felbat and saw Uda the Beast carrying drinks over to a couple of NPCs sitting at a table. Looking around, the inn looked a lot bigger from the eyes of my character than when looking at it on a screen. I flagged her down and she walked up, ""You! COME! Drink, feast, rest for the next battle. But do not fight! Or I will feed you to my wolves."" She really did say that in person. Huh.

""Uda, great purveyor of beverages, I'm in the market for some real estate."" I put on my smoothest voice, which was a lot easier with my new Pandaren vocal chords, ""I'm sure someone as powerful as you would love to be back out in the field, krulling some demon heads...""

""Hmpf...I do miss the hunt. My wolves get restless with no action,"" she looked thoughtfully over at her enormous animals for a moment, ""They've only had one uppity Blood Elf Paladin in the entire last moon. But what of it? What do you mean 'real estate'?""

""Well, Uda, oh strong of strong, I've got a proposition for you!"" She whipped out a dagger and held it at my throat.

""I don't like the sound of that, Bear...I'm not in THAT kind of business...""

""What? OH! NO! No, that's not what I meant! I mean I have a business proposal for you!""

""Ah,"" she sheathed her weapon and passed the tray she was still holding over to another waiter, ""And what might that be, Tubby?"" I looked down at my considerable panda girth. She had a point.

""Well, out of the goodness of my heart, I am willing to take this backbreaking, thankless, menial job off your hands and get you out into the field killing demons with the rest of Azeroth! The world has been too long without the battlecry of Uda the Beast!""

She tapped her tusks, obviously interested but not at the edge yet, ""and what price were you looking at for this, that I have built from the ground up since the broken isles surfaced...?""

I grinned at that, ""Why, a full burgeoning sack of ten thousand gold pieces!"" I reached into my inventory and separated the ten thousand and pulled them up. They were automatically wrapped in a new sack that I jingled before her.

""TEN?! An insult! I would never go below thirty thousand!"" Her face didn't match her words as she grinned slightly.

""Fifteen, then?"" I shook the sack, adding more coins and it grew to accommodate them.

""Twenty-five!""

""Twenty!""

""DONE!"" She grabbed the sack then grasped my forearm with a strength I didn't know NPCs were capable of and I had to hide the pain it caused me. ""Oooh, I need to head to the auction house with this to suit up for the fun. It's been too long since I felt skulls break beneath an axe!"" She wandered off to the back to gather her things and I was left there wondering if there was any paperwork. Then I felt something shift on my side and, opening my inventory, I noticed a new sheet of paper. I read the first couple of lines.

'Deed to the Filthy Animal inn in the city of Dalaran. This document entitles the bearer to all profits and responsibilities of the Filthy Animal inn.'

Another grin stretched across my furry face as I walked over to the kitchens to perform my first duty as the new owner. ""NOMI!"" I yelled at the Pandaren burning something on the stovetop, ""YOU'RE FIRED!"" Damn that felt good.

“You’ll see it done then?” I said, glancing to the broad smile hidden underneath the frayed perrywinkle blue robes of the Devout.

“Of course, of course. The Library attic is yours to use as you please. Just keep this coming and you’ll find no issue from me, nor my associates.” He jingled the coins together as the frigid winds whipped through the narrow Stormwind alleys. The man clutched at his hood too late, as it fell from his face. Hair reminiscent of oven baked rye sat on the rims of his balding head. Donyal Torvald stood firm against the howling winds, barely wincing in the winter chill.

“I don’t understand all the secrecy, though. None really visit the Royal Library in these dark times. And it’s not like the vacant rooms above it will be missed.” His bushy eyebrows lifted in slight confusion.

No one understands the importance behind confidentiality in business anymore. Much less these NPC’s. 

“Not to mention you and yours valiant service in the name of the Wrynn family and the Alliance. It’s an honor to be housing one of your stature, quite frankly.” Tovald said.

I sighed, more out of annoyance than anything. “Yes, yes, but things have changed.” No easy way to hit an NPC with the existential crisis that came with explaining the difference between PC’s and NPC’s. “I have your word on absolute discretion?” 

“Pay it no mind, Atro Jenkins. I just trust that when the time comes, you’ll let me in on your little venture?” He asked. I could almost see the balding man rubbing his hands together after our meeting. 

I gave him a grin that would unsettle even the most unruly of my demons, and said, “No doubt my good man! Expect a dwarven renovation team to come along later this afternoon.” and with that I left the man in the alabaster streets to ponder. If all went well with the renovation, his worries would end here. 

I walked through the ruby roofed district and marveled at how real it had all become. Ever since I woke up alone in this very tangible version of my favorite MMO, I had only been focused on one thing.
 
Gold. 

Mountains of it. 

---

See, when it first happened, I came to in Dalaran, with players flailing their swords and magics at everything and everyone they could. I heard screams from below, from the city’s innards. Always the curious one, I quickly made my way to the sounds. 

Unlike those above, who were in a sanctuary and unable to attack others, those in the sewers quickly found that their bodies weren’t as godly as they remembered. Mortal Strikes cut foes in half, Pyroblasts charred them to a smoldering pile of ash on the floor. I watched as players killed each other, realizing their mistakes and either fleeing the scene or rushing to the nearest healer to get a rez for the slain. 

Luckily for me and not so much for those who had died, resurrection took some time to take hold, leaving them mute and paralyzed on the floor. No one could know how long we’d be stuck here, so, true to my Voidheart garb, I scurried around the sewers, collecting players’ gear, gold, and whatever else I could safely get my hands on. With the bags on my belt filled to the brim, I returned to the streets above and made my way to the bank. 

Two goblin bankers whispered amongst themselves as I approached, “Did you hear? A Pandaren monk just purchased the Filthy Animal, and ousted Nomi!” the first goblin said. 

Judging by her dress she had to be what would equate to the bank manager. I handed the clerk the junk from my bags to sort out later as I listened in closer.

“Oh no… Nomi had been there since the Legion came! I thought Uda had taken him in as a sort of charity case?” a goblin with bright pink hair and lavish earrings responded.

The manager replied, “I don’t know about that, but hush, someone’s coming to my window. We’ll talk later.” 

‘Ooh! A potential customer…’rang behind me as I finished my business and walked out of the bank. So many questions floated in my mind! A player bought the inn? I didn’t know that could happen, much less how much gold that would take?! But an interesting idea struck me as I paced near the fountain adjacent to the bank. At the time, I thought maybe I could take that a step further. 

World of Warcraft had always been about the shinies. Shiny armor, shiny mounts, the shinies on the countless corpses that we left in our wake. Except now we realized that the world is finite., the monsters don’t respawn, and neither does anything else. While everyone else panicked, I got to work. The shiniest armor makes for the largest of pouches, so first I found some like-minded individuals and bought out the trade items from the Auction House. Cloth, minerals, jewels, you name it, we cleared it out. Once upon a time, monsters and other great beings dropped loot for guilds to disband over, but in this fantasy realized, we grabbed the most creative artisans the land had to offer. Control the supply, feed the demand I always said. 

Then, we decided to snatch up the stables; a rapidly expanding business when gone are the days that you can pull a giant dragon out of your ass and ride it into the sunset. Still making a very pretty copper off that one.

Finally, our little trading syndicate decided to go after the Auction House. Turns out that the powers that be really don’t like that, so after a short trip to the Stockade and some hot pokers later, we decided to drop that venture. 

That brings us back to shinies. For some players, the inn’s wouldn’t be good enough. No, they couldn't rest among the rabble; they would want the best of what the universe had to offer. And I planned on providing. 

---

As I came out of my thoughts, I grinned to myself in the bustling city streets. The new plan was practically fel proof.

I flicked my hand as I strode through Old Town, and a fiery little imp came into existence. Away from the more skittish and traditional areas of Stormwind, I re-equipped my weapon, summoning a burning troll skull from the nether. “Ithmel, check Stormwind off the list, and pay a visit to the good Librarian before the artisans arrive, make sure he is compliant to their needs.” 

The imp giggled maniacally, skipping behind my path on the canal streets, “Yes! Yes, master!” He jumped onto my shoulder and took a tome from my pack and did as I instructed. “Where to now, master?” He squeaked.

The skull hummed in void energies, and a purple glow took the book from Ithmel’s flailing hands and floated it in front of me, just far enough for comfortable reading. I fell back into my planning as I walked aimlessly through the streets.


Stormwind, Dalaran, and Orgrimmar all good and finished, with each location having a brilliant view of the cities around them. Stormwind and Dalaran passed without incident, as expected. Orgrimmar was certainly the most… unorthodox, but I managed to find a goblin out in Gadgetzan willing to deal. By the time I finished this list, those three would be ready for their first customers. I looked further down the list to find the next scouted location. 

Goldshire? Anywhere but there. Ever since the playerbase got sucked in, Goldshire had turned from a quiet hamlet to a thriving red-light district. Mostly of players, obviously, but I suppose old habits die hard. But then again, I might have to get a property and capitalize on the uhh… passion… that flows through the town. 

Redridge Mountains then? It did have picturesque slopes and a beautiful lake. Not to mention unbelievably low property rates because of all the orcs nearby. 

I looked up from the floating tome and noticed my distracted walk had taken me to the gates of Stormwind. My troll skull hovered beside me, gazing at me in expectation of command. I looked all around, soaking in the grand statues of heroes passed, soaking in their ambition. I summoned fel-fire, which erupted up in a tornado of blinding power. Out of the fires strode a powerful felsteed. 

“Ithmel,” The little imp looked up at me, a mischievous grin smeared across its wide face. “I think we’ll pay a quick visit to Goldshire and see if we can’t win over the Maclure’s. A vineyard would be a good location, don't you think?” I said as I jumped up and into the saddle.

Today, Gryphon BnB would take another bold step. Tomorrow? Who knows where it would be?

I folded my papers, swung my legs off the desk, and sauntered out from the backroom. There were four of them this time, and by the looks of it, all Level 60. The one who had shouted for me was likely the Warrior, adorned in the complete pearlescent set armor obtainable only from the Dredmor raid. Someone's been farming, I thought.

""I'm sorry,"" Sara said, still quivering where she stood behind the counter. She was relatively new, so I didn't blame her for not being able to handle this. ""They... barged in, even though we have a strict no-return policy...""

""You cheated us! Cheat!"" yelled the Warrior, shaking his fist at me. His companions, a Hunter and two Priests, nodded in agreement. 

""Now hold on here,"" I said. ""Let's settle this like adults, shall we? What's the problem?"" 

The Hunter stepped forward and slammed down a Cleaving Axe of Furry + 2 on the countertop. ""You sold me this! Just yesterday!"" 

""And so I did,"" I said. I turned it over, inspected the tag behind. ""I still don't see the problem..."" 

""I asked for a Cleaving Axe of Fury! Not Cleaving Axe of Furry! This is supposed to be a goddamned weapon of mass destruction! Not a huggable decorative ornament, soft to the touch!"" 

""Ah, ah, Sara, if you would?"" I asked. She scurried behind the counter, then fished out the order slips. I flipped through them, found the one made out to ""Loxlox, Hunter Level 60"", and showed it to him. ""See here? Under the field where you put in your request? You wrote 'Furry', not 'Fury', did you not?"" 

""That's not the point!"" the Warrior interjected, coming between us. ""You charged him 100 gold for that! That's nearly enough to purchase any other top tier weapon! You knew he made a mistake, and yet you charged him full price!"" 

""Sir, please,"" I said, ""I don't judge what my customers want. He wanted something Furry, I went out of my way to get it, of course it's going to cost a lot! I even upgraded it to + 2, for free!"" 

""What the shit does the + 2 do, even?"" 

I picked up the disparaged weapon, then gave it a shake. It squeaked. ""Sound effect,"" I said, ""ideal for when you want to make a point.""

The Priests made their moves then. The first one muttered a spell, then Buffed his team, coating them in protective barriers, sharpening their combative skills. The second one broke a vial and splashed the contents over me, debuffing my combative and defensive statistics. 

I don't know why he even bothered. I had no combative or defensive skills to even speak of. I couldn't kill a rabbit if I wanted to, nor could I shield myself against a flying kiss. 

I had other people do that for me. 

""I must warn you, there is a strict no-violence policy here. We're still within the city...""

""Save your breath, you cheat!"" screamed the Warrior and Hunter in unison, as they unleashed their attacks in impressive synchrony, almost as if they had macro-bound their skills. 

""Sara, please, if you would...""

A blinding light filled the store, though I was prepared for it. That's the thing with employees - you treat them with respect, you help guide them along in areas out of their depth, and they were always more than willing to repay the favour when the time came for it. 

In the land of Numemor, every successive level represents an increase of a full order of power. A Level 60 could comfortably handle three, four Level 59s. 

Sara was a Level 80 Archangel. 

When the dust settled, all four of them were on the ground, groaning, trapped in chains of shimmering light. Sara hovered in the air, hands still outstretched. A look of concern crossed her face. 

""Was it too much?"" she asked. 

""Yes, yes, too much!"" I grumbled. It was one thing to restore the order, and it was quite another to beat up your customers. That's never good for business. ""Please, help them up, I just wanted them to know that violence is not necessary. I'm always keen on my customers leaving happily.""

Sara tossed the Hunter and Priests out, then sat the Warrior on a chair. She had to hold him up so that he wouldn't tip over. My guess was that he wasn't used to getting his HP reduced to the single digits so quickly before. 

""Sara, get him a swig of the Healing Potion... Yes, it's on the house, I'm not that petty. Hey, Warrior, you listening?"" I snapped my fingers to get his attention. ""Look, I'll make you a deal, OK?"" 

He continued groaning, but I was fairly sure he was listening. 

""I'm going to bend over backwards for you, OK buddy? I'm going to take back the Furry at half price, cause it's been used, then I'm going to give your friend the Fury model he seems more keen on, OK? And it will only cost you a 500 gold top-up, that's fine with you?"" 

""So... expensive..."" 

""Fine, fine. You're good customers, so I'll give you the special deal. 450 gold, plus 15% of all spoils from your next five raids, OK?"" 

I could tell that he was near the edge, so I went for the closer. I reached behind the counter, plucked out two small bottles. 

""I'll even throw in two Cosmetic Dyes, OK? They can retrofit your armor with new and exciting colours, yes? Do we have a deal?"" 

I needn't have asked - the way his eyes opened once he saw the rare Dyes was enough to tell me that he was sold. Joke was on him though. They were only that expensive normally because I controlled the entire beetle industry, and without beetles, you had no Dyes. 

As the Warrior trudged out with the Cleaving Axe of Fury + 3 (I threw in a free upgrade, I'm not a monster) , pockets much lighter, Sara piped up. 

""Do you think they'll ever figure out they just got fleeced again?"" 

I bounced the coin purse in my palm, smiling ear to ear. It was a good day. 

""Doubt it,"" I said, ""but that's what happens when you pump all your stats into combat and none into Bargaining.""

The newest MMORPG game, the collaboration between so many developers, came out. All of gamerkind collectively equipped their headsets, and began.


So, when we all woke up in a field, most of us adapted quickly. We had always pines for a different world where the laws of reality bent to our will, and mythical creatures were frequent. Many of us suited up, and went out to fight on the frontiers, fighting demons and angels, basilisks and gorgons. However, I was never a confrontational frontliner. I began by using all of my gold to buy a road and build a toll booth. Anyone who used my road was prompted a small amount of gold for passage. Can't pay the fee? You're in debt.


As time went on, I bought other roads, plots of land, and businesses. Now, I simply work as the bartender and manager in The Pathos, the largest bar in the city of Centrial. I've seen many adventurers, most of whom around Level 20-35. Sometimes, I'll see hardcore raiders, who risk their lives for the best gear and experience gain, around Level 60-80. However, I have never seen someone hit the max level-Level 100. 


And that brings us to present day. 


""Hello?"" A foreign voice calls.


""Yes, I'm here,"" I say as the man and his friends come sit at the crowded bar. ""Do you need anything?""
 

""Not from you. I need a real bartender, not some trash Level 1 who's never taken a risk in his life."" I take a look at his Level. 72. Guess he thinks he has a right to brag.


""Well, I am the real bartender, so I guess you're stuck with me then. Also, I'd like to ask you not to shout insults at me. I have the authority to kick you out at any time.""


""Don't lie to me, you filthy rat. Just because I can't see your level doesn't make me unable to see through your bluff. You can't kick us out, can't you see? We're all Level 70-80.""


""I'm sorry, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. You're disturbing the other patrons.""
He laughs as he and his friends equip their weapons. A Paladin, Cleric, and Rogue.


""Oh yeah? You and what arm---"" he's cut off as a lightning bolt blasts him backwards into the wall. Thank God for that reinforced walls upgrade I bought earlier. His two friends look at the Cleric, then back at me. I close my eyes and sigh as they run at me. Two more loud thuds are heard as ghostly arms grad their legs and trip them. I walk out of the bar and tell my backup to keep serving the other patrons.


I slowly walk back to my house, enjoying the well-crafted environments. As I reach my house, I hear a familiar voice. 


""Thought you could get away with a sneaky shot, could ya? I brought some friends this time around, and we're gonna show you how a beatdown works.""


I turn around. There's a team of 6 people, the 3 from before, and 3 fighters, all Level 70-80. God. He brought a whole raid team.


""God, you guys don't give up,"" I say as purple light surrounds me in a runic pattern. ""Summon Rune: Bahamut."" I fly away as the roars of the final boss of the game and screams of the players echo down the alley. It turns out you get a significant power spike once you reach Level 100. How do I know? Well, it turns out when you own entire cities, you have plenty of time and money to hit Level 100.

His own little corner of the east. However the writing was on the wall. This should be an interesting recording.

""Give me a run down of last nights fight Chris""

Ronson seemed to like Chris, he was a virtuoso in fleet command. Able to pull out a victory where nobody else in the confederation could. I might have to make Chris a personal offer once this is all over.

Chris sighed.

""It went poorly, we initially held ground against the enemy, but once they got their carrier fleet on field we were annihilated, barely a third of our cruisers escaped. All dreadnoughts were lost. That entire constellation is now all but overrun""

I continued to listen to the rest of the recording and I suspected it would only be a matter of days before he, the head of Drekar Confederation tried to negotiate a surrender. They did better than expected and held out another 6 weeks, however the result was inevitable. 

Now in this grand game among the heavens there are no laws other than what 
make for ourselves. So years ago I begun to trade in the clusters most rare commodity.

Honesty

I never reneged on my deals, nor did I engage in scams or deceptions. For years I have acted in a middleman in transactions between distrustful allies and implacable enemies.......for a modest fee of course.

""So Ronson, you wish to cede your remaining holdings to the enemy and withdraw from your space?""

""Yes, we still have half a dozen death star fitted battlestations and rather than waste the time of the Drekar in hopeless defence, or the Swarm in battle after battle taking what we have left, it's time to sell up. However I do not trust them""

Few do I thought, so yet again I was to act as a middleman.

""Okay as it happens the head of coin in the swarm has already contacted me and has an offer, and it's a little low but I don't think you are in a position to negotiate. They will offer you 1.4 trillion kredits, minus my broker fee, for all remaining drekar assets. Drekar are to transfer ownership of all stations and structures to my company and you will have access for two weeks to pull out your remaining ships and personal assets""

Ronson nodded, clearly tired.

2 weeks passed, and other than a few overzealous members of the Swarm harrying Drekar Confederation's withdrawal, they made it out okay. So now it was a simple matter of transferring the assets to the Swarm and 1.1 trillion kredits to Drekar. 

The profit margin in honesty is pretty big. Please excuse me, I hear another conflict is brewing in the south. 

War is good for business.

When you come to, you find yourself in the middle of no where with only the tools and clothes on your body.",iPandaIushka,"Josh Fitch stood with the team of electricians outside the robotic cell and silently fumed. The rear apertures line had been down for seventeen minutes already, and he could feel the phone vibrating in his pocket. Great. Nothing like production getting on his ass to make solving the issue any easier. He ran his hand slowly through his short cropped dark hair and finally came to a decision, ""Okay, fine. Malone, we're gonna have to lock it out and get a look at the handoff prox. I'm betting it's fried, get it changed out and then we'll try to figure out *why it fried*, hopefully get a real fix in over lunch. Production's gonna be on us already, so let's make it quick."" 

Trusting his guys to do the job that needed doing he turned away from the cell and thumbed the radio mic out of his shirt pocket, he'd give Julian and the production boys an ETA on startup and then try to squeeze in a little lunch for himself before supervising the break time repairs. As he keyed the transmit button an explosion of stars went off inside his vision and then the world went black with a cataclysmic explosion of pain. 

-------------

His first concept that there was anything to the world other than blackness and pain was incessant birdsong; which was odd since there probably weren't any birds in the factory and they'd be harder than hell to hear over the machines. *The factory*. Oh wasn't that lovely, he'd gone and fainted on the job, wonder how much paperwork safety was gonna try to pin on him for that one. He cracked open an eye, saw a tree right in front of him and closed his eyes again at the glare from the sunlight. 

Okay then, maybe not the factory. If he had fainted on the job, and from what he remembered things pointed that way, he should have either woke up in medical or a hospital, so far as he knew neither kept the waiting rooms stocked with much more than a potted fern, let alone a tree. He tried to roll onto his hands and knees to get up, and was pleasantly surprised to find movement wasn't quite as excruciating as he had been worrying about. Not pleasant, but survivable. 

He levered himself to his feet, opening his eyes to the afternoon sun and tried to take in his surroundings. Seemingly uninhabited forest didn't help him much. Checking himself he realized that whatever had happened, no one had bothered taking off his tool smock. He made a point of wearing it whenever he worked with the elctricians, not because he usually had to do any of it himself, but it was damn uncomfortable to wear, so he wore it as a form of solidarity. Hiking through wherever this was with a Klein journeymen tool kit, voltmeter, radio, hardhat, and kevlar gloves and sleeves didn't sound particularly appealing, but neither did replacing a couple hundred dollars worth of company policy. 

He fished his phone out of his pocket and frowned a bit when he saw there was no signal, not too many places that could have been nearby the factory on the main line in King of Prussia, but he rolled with it. He had sprung for the GPS integrated model rather than AGPS for a bit of an outdoorsman backup, so he'd make do. Then the GPS app turned up a no dice read too. No cellphone signal he could take, absolutely no GPS satellite coverage? Unlikely. 

Magnetometers should still work wherever this was so long as the Earth still had a magnetic field though, so he fired up the compass app. Finally something went right. He aligned himself to true north and started hiking, thankful at least that his sturdy leather work shoes would put up with the hike even if khakis and a polo weren't exactly outdoorsman gear. 

--------------

The good news: he had a couple of energy bars, a bottle of water, and some sunflower seeds tucked away inside the tool smock for days when working through lunch was inevitable. The bad news, he'd gone through all of that during the walk figuring to come upon some sort of service eventually, he had passed out in the middle of one of the larger metro areas in the country after all. That had been five hours ago, and now the sun was setting and he was nothing but either a dozen miles closer to or farther from nowhere. At least he knew enough to refill the water bottle in moving water, should he be lucky enough to come across some. 

As it was he wasn't prepared to go hiking through the night, and even using the phone for brief burst on airplane mode to get a compass bearing he didn't think he'd get more than a day or so out of it, hunting for signal inside the giant faraday cage that was Caldwell-Douglass Applied Manufacturing had drained it of most of his battery before the unintended vacation. He could probably splice something together with the radio battery or the voltmeter if he had to, but he wasn't quite desperate yet. 

He'd gathered a good bit of wood and some kindling while gnawing at his brain on how he'd start it; easiest if he'd been a smoker but alas that vice wouldn't come around to save his life this time. Easier if he'd had a wire spool on him, but of course he hadn't been carrying any when he'd passed out. That was poor form not to have some in the smock, but it wouldn't help him now. The only solution he could come up with was stealing a bit of help from the voltmeter. He pulled the wire cutters and strippers out of the smoke, snipped the negative lead off of the votmeter, cut the lead wire in half, and stripped the jacket off the wire. Wrapping the copper strand tightly around the other half of the wire he quickly formed a filament. Snipping the jacketed wire in half again he secured the two jacketed sections to the opposite leads on the filament. He was left with about 4 inches between the wire ends and the filament. Not ideal, exactly, but he'd just have to let his hand get hot. 

Pulling the battery pack out of his radio he connected the positive and negative terminals to the filament, and laid the filament onto the kindling. Nearly instantly it sprang into life and flame, pulling his hand away quickly he disconnected the positive lead from the filament. Not the most elegant firestarter solution - the lack of wire had burned his fingers a bit - but at least the filament looked intact. He'd have to hold onto it, there was only one other lead on the voltmeter. Laying down next to the fire after the physically and mentally exhausting day sleep took him nearly immediately. 

The night was dark and the fire burned down nearly to coals when the sound of hooves woke him from his dreams.

",victorged
[WP] An alien experiences the horror of an artillery barrage.,interesseret,"So far the advance had been unhindered. The humans had fled and had become easy targets as the invading forces had swept the cities. The relatively small invasion force had hit them hard and fast, crippling human communications and destroying major population centres.  Resistance was minimal and human forces seemed to have retreated or been scattered. Most of their military forces had been ravaged and feared attacks by nuclear weapons had been snuffed out before they could be mustered.

Foot soldiers where now clearing large areas making way for a central landing hub, and the next phase in the invasion, not due to arrive for some time. There had been some human forces spotted in the area but like before they had vanished, ran at the sign of the alien might.  The landscape was cold and covered in white snow in the large northern continent identified as ‘Russia’ in the human native language.  

They had been exterminating the local humans with amazing efficiency but a recent attack in the south had required they relinquish most of their heavy armour to help quash that resistance. Their forces were stretched across the planet but so far they had coped with anything the humans had retaliated with.  

Suddenly one of the invaders raised a weapon as 3 humans ran across the road ahead and opened fire with the lethal energy weapon cutting them down in seconds, the high pitched noises they made when the powerful weapon hit them confirmed the kills.  It walked over and looked at the cauterised corpses smoking in the cold air.

In a flash the structure beside the advancing troops erupted in fire, debris showered across the road sending them running for cover. Another impact sent the armoured solider that had been standing admiring his kills flying across the road. It’s armoured suit deflecting the majority of the blast but dropped to the ground taking cover. The suits external scanners had not been set to look for such attacks, that was being automatically changed as the attack intensified. 

More explosions dug craters into the ground raining dirt over the solider. The sounds grew louder and louder as the primitive weapons rained down. He could feel the pressure change through the suit, it compensators almost to their maximum.  He tried to raise the others in it’s detachment but comms where down. Three of his team members took a direct hit blasting them into the air killing them instantly.

This was no random attack but a heavy coordinated strike and they were right in the middle of it. The suits on board computer identified the direction, distance and type of weapons, crude explosive shells where now being followed by a wave of rocket propelled projectiles, hundreds of them. As they hit the ground ahead of them the blasts levelled structures and ripped armoured bodies apart. The solider scrambled into a crater as the once pristine white landscape was turning into a sea of fire, shrapnel and death. The wall of impacts grew closer and closer, the blast waves ripped over the top of the crater as the huge volley continued and then just as it was about encroach over the make shift shelter it stopped… 

Smoke drifted and burning debris lettered the ground along with body parts. The trooper cursed the humans as he oversaw the destruction reaped in a few short minutes. His suit identified where the attack came from, retaliation would be swift.  Suddenly their reserve armoured units appeared through the smoke taking up position to secure the area, new troops deployed and tended to the wounded.  

Fully operational and now scanning, the troopers suit alerted him to a single incoming shell, coming from the same area as the last, it was larger than the previous ones but the trajectory showed it would land close but would be no threat. No attempt was used to intercept it and that was their undoing. 

The 203 mm ZBV2 howitzer artillery shell was a relic from the cold war. It was never used in conflict and this would be it first time used in anger. As it impacted the soft ground its 55 kiloton nuclear warhead detonated. The troops and armored units never had time to react as they were blasted by the nuclear fury, the lucky ones were vaporized, others crushed and pulped inside their armor, bodies flung into the air like rag dolls as the pressure wave annihilated the area before washing it clear with fire.

As the fiery mushroom cloud rose above the charred ground a cheer went up from the concealed arilltery emplacement 18km away. The attack had worked and aliens had been obliterated. Reports from the diversionary attack far to the south showed a similar victory. The aliens had underestimated the defenders resolve, falling for the trap and now they where paying greatly for it. The resistance had only just begun.

"[WP] I'm home sick today, please make this day feel less dreadfully boring and lame",namelbisivni,"Once upon a time, there was a wonderful human being. Overnight, a colony of bacteria decided to colonize this human's body. They crept into the nasal cavity and set up camp, but quickly realized that wasn't the warm, damp, welcoming location they thought it would be. As a friendly mucous gland came to inform the bacteria that white blood cells began gathering to evict them, as no trespassers were allowed, the battle cry of the bacteria could be heard: ""THIS! IS! SPARTA!!!!""

The white blood cells rushed into the nasal cavity, but it was too late. The poor mucous cell had been destroyed, and the bacteria had activated their battle modes. An army of bacteria in (very very small) storm trooper suits began shooting their laser blasters.

The commander of the invading bacteria, General Beyonce, regretted her decision to choose storm troopers as the battle mode. Despite the lining of the throat being thoroughly damaged, not a single white blood cell was hit by the lasers. It was time for plan B. 

As the intelligence officers scrambled to create a plan B, the white blood cells did quite a work on the storm trooper bacteria. As the last storm trooper stood trembling, a Plan Y was finally developed that seemed sufficient. Suddenly, the one storm trooper bacteria split into eight million storm trooper bacteria, which further began damaging the throat with their terrible aim. 

The wonderful human being's body received the distress signal, and changed the speed limit of Blood Highway to 88 MPH to rush more white blood cells to the location of the battle. However, unbeknownst to the white blood cells, General Beyonce had brought a Delorean with her. Upon seeing the new speed limit and realizing she wouldn't get ticketed for it, she went 88 and time travelled forty seven seconds into the past. Moments after she got back, she realized the speed limit was changed, and did again. This created an infinite loop that General Beyonce was only freed from by the wonderful human being waking up and blowing his nose. If only they had seen the Delorean in their snot. 

The fight continued, more and more tissue being damaged every moment. The white blood cells knew they had to do something drastic. A brave white blood cell named Columbus went on a mission to the scalp. Once at the scalp, he yelled, ""You are a wizard, hairy!"" At which point, of course, one of the hairs realized he was in fact a wizened old wizard, and grabbed a random moth from the air and whispered some gibberish to it. Columbus the white blood cell returned to the throat, disappointed that it's plan hadn't worked. 

A few minutes later, all of the white blood cells were corned at the edge of the esophagus, when suddenly, a flock of giant eagles flew into the wonderful human being's mouth, carrying Vitamin C. One of the storm trooper bacteria screamed, ""Kryptonite!"", whereupon all eight million storm trooper bacterias promptly died, leaving about seven intelligence officers in the nasal cavity. They decided to pull a France, and waved a white handkerchief in surrender. They didn't realize how bad of a choice that was, because the wonderful human being then sneezed the last seven bacteria into said handkerchief, thereby ending the war. 

However, the throat was still very much damaged. After so many innocent cells died, the body drafted new legislation and called it the Sokovia Accords, whereby Tiny Storks (through a game of telephone amongst half-deaf diplomatic cells, the identity of the giant eagles had been rather mixed up) would be no longer permitted to help save the body of the wonderful human being. As the throat began to be rebuilt, all went well until nearly half of the workers were found to be illegal immigrants. President Thump (a heart cell) banished them from the land, and the throat was forces to be repaired at half speed. 

About this point, the wonderful human being realized they couldn't possibly go about their day as they typically would, due to their soar throat. You see, it wasn't a sore throat. A sore throat comes when a boring And lame group of viruses invades. A SOAR throat, on the other hand, comes from storm trooper bacteria being killed by vitamin c carrying, soaring, giant eagles. They stayed home, and while still in the morning hours, boredom forced them to scroll through reddit until finally stumbling upon a solution- an explanation for the cause of their terribly boring and lame day.

It’s midnight, but the clock tower across the street won’t strike for another two minutes. He’s lived in this town for four years and no one’s ever bothered to fix it. He’s sitting in a diner, sipping black coffee and, across from him, his former writing instructor is halfway through his second plate of pancakes. They’ve yet to say anything to each other aside from hello. And what is he supposed to say? His wife left him about three hours ago, left a note saying she married him, not his dreams; and then left and took everything with her.

And what is that supposed to mean? Yeah, he quit his job as an editor to write screenplays set in Renaissance-era France; his latest, a piece about The Field of the Cloth of Gold that takes a surprisingly homoerotic turn. But he can’t imagine what she meant by what she said. He’d given everything to their marriage. He’d showered her in affection and gifts when he’d courted her, had been a by-the-books gentlemen if the world ever saw one. Yet, here he is, wondering how he’s going to afford their apartment by himself now that she’s gone. 

“I did everything right,” he finally says, just to settle the score on that matter. “I gave her everything and we were happy. I paid the bills. I took her out on dates. Our sex life wasn’t always great, but it was good enough. She never said she wasn’t happy.” 

“You were a good husband, Scott” his mentor agrees. Sam, is his name. 

He’s old now but, when they met, he was a silver fox making the backside of forty look like paradise. Sam had needed a writing intern and they had clicked rather well, creatively. Nearly ten years later, they still meet up weekly. It’s mostly just Scott pitching ideas to Sam and withering when the older man pokes holes in the plots. It keeps both of them lively in their craft, though. Tonight, is different, evidently. 

“Then why did she leave?” Scott counters. The clock tower strikes the hour, two minutes late, across the street. 

The waitress comes by and refills his half-empty cup of coffee. He nods in her general direction, but his eyes are fixed on Sam as if the man will become a beacon which he can follow into all the answers to all the quintessential questions of life.  

“Because maybe you weren’t a good husband for her,” Sam says. His eyes uncharacteristically shift downward, as if he’s uncomfortable telling Scott this. 

He should be! It didn’t make any sense, at all. If he had been a good husband, then that’s the end of it, isn’t it? Whatever happened to bring it all crashing down had to be, empirically and unquestionably, her fault. 

“You’re not making any sense.” 

“Listen, Scott,” Sam says tiredly, as if this is more exhausting than shooting down the younger man’s idea to write a screenplay about how the Mandela effect made everyone forget the holocaust. “I’m not in your marriage. You and Sarah seemed good together and, yes, she seemed happy. But let me just say this. Whenever I got fired from a writing job, and I’ve been fired from a few in my lifetime, I rarely found that it was because I did everything right.” 

This stumps Scott. He’s only ever been fired from one job, and that hadn’t been his fault. 

Then, like a light switch, it all clicks on. It’s the most uncomfortable epiphany he’s ever had and it seems lackluster, happening in this small diner across the street from a broken clock tower. He doesn't know how long he sits there, staring at the his cooling coffee.

Embarrassment, like a tidal wave, crashes over him again and again in different snapshots of his marriage. He suddenly sees all the times he’d shut her down, talked over her, and tried to buy her gifts and dinners as distractions from his failure.

He sees all the moments she’d cooed at and comforted his ego, and how it was never enough. Nothing would ever be enough for the man who wanted it all. She had held him, told him he was great even though he had been anything but great to her. She had touched him, and wiped his tears away. She had cancelled her plans to stay in and hold him and talk him up. *She* had given everything to their marriage. She had given more than he'd been willing to give.

It’s too much, this self-awareness. People weren’t meant to discover things like this all at once. It was supposed to happened gradually or not at all. But he can’t stop it. It’s like someone pulled a string to a secret compartment in his mind where nothing harmless lay, but a nuclear bomb that was set to destroy everything in his psyche. 
He feels nauseous, and then strangely light. It’s deeply unpleasant but he sees it now, all the times she had told him she would support him, met with all the times he never even asked about her dreams. She’s a receptionist at a local law firm, a job she said she enjoys. But what did she want to do? Why had he ever asked? Why did it never seem important? 

He’d been a good husband in the same way his waitress was a nice girl. She went through all the motions of politeness in order to get her tip, but her heart wasn’t in it. She wasn’t doing it for the customer, but for the money with which they lined her pocket. He hadn’t been a good husband for Sarah’s sake, he’d been a good husband so that he could say he was a good husband. Love doesn’t work like that, though. Nothing does. 

“So,” he finally says, and his voice sounds different and strange in his ears. He's close to tears. “What do I do now?” 

Sam smiles, the soft smile of the archetypal old man. He rubs his full stomach, and pushes his empty plate away. The clock tower across the street strikes the half hour, two minutes late. 

“You do better than you did, Scott,” he says. “Don’t make promises. Don’t imagine the scenario in which you’ll be the prince. You just take life as it comes and when you meet someone new, you do better than you did with Sarah.”

It seems far too simple for the lesson he just learned, the epiphany that was wholly life-changing. It doesn't seem good enough for the broken heart in his chest. But, maybe the truth of life is that it’s far more simple than people make it. It’s like writing a bad screenplay; every new idea, even if it’s still bad, is better than the last one. It seems like an awfully trivial answer to one of life’s quintessential questions, but one that Scott thinks he learn to cope with. Despite the agony, he tells himself he will. He’ll try again next time and, next time, he’ll try better.

Brief flashes of the crash entered his mind and he tried to rationalize how the cloaked figure came to be sitting in the passenger seat, but the large branch jutting from his chest made that rather difficult. 


“So I’m dead.”


“We’ve gone over this, Kevin. Twice, actually. Yes, you are quite dead.”


“Are you sure?”


Death turned the empty chasm of his face toward him. “I very well hope so. It wouldn’t do for me to show myself to the living these days, smart-phones and all.”


“Right.” Kevin tried to sigh heavily, but managed only to shake the branch a little. “And you want me to do what?” 


“I’ve been thinking of taking on a partner for a while now—someone to take some of the burden off. It’s just getting to be a bit too much. I’m expected to be three places at once in all of a second. I can’t keep up with it. I need someone to reap a few souls here and there when I can’t get to them… or I suppose I can send you on into the void if you like.”


Kevin chewed on that for a minute before responding. “I don’t really think I have much of a choice here.” 


Death chuckled quietly. “Not so much, old boy. Anyway, it won’t be forever. Immortality or oblivion is right around the corner for humanity—and either way that means I get to retire soon. Let’s get you sorted out.” And with that, he tapped the branch and it withered to dust. Kevin looked down, expecting to see a gaping hole where his sternum had been. Through the hole in his shirt he could see the flesh quickly knitting itself back together. 


Death open the passenger door and stepped out without so much as rustling the broken glass on the seat. Putting his gloved hands on the top of the car he leaned down to say “I’ll be in touch.”


And with that he turned and was gone.

[WP] Death has spared your life but in exchange you have to help him reap souls,remedial_aid,"I found the stick of the knife pleasurable. All my senses were tuned to pain. I had to feel anything at that moment, just to know I could still feel. I poked the tip into my palm and dragged it down, trying to cut out an open wound. I thought of all the ways I had failed this year and my body shrank. The outside world loomed around me in my dissociated state, where the astral body felt more physical than my actual one. I was cutting again, and this time I might even do it for real. I might commit suicide.

I took the blade to my arm and ran the sharp point down to my palm. The blood came out in little droplets stuck to the side of my arm. I sighed, and heaved. It was like an orgasm. I felt better than I had in days. I finally satisfied the addiction to hurt myself. Damaging my body was worth it because I wasn't a worthwhile human being. I took the knife to my wrist. I smiled because I knew this was it. I was going to do it, finally. I dug into my wrist, and crossed the line where my veins met my hand. I dug sharply and tore at the flesh. I knew it would work.

""You know pain, my disciple.""

The voices in my head returned. For years, I dealt with this overwhelming sense that a demon was talking to me, congratulating me on failures, and watching my slow demise. The voice was back to ruin my fun. I cursed out loud and threw the knife on the bathroom floor. Why did this have to happen, now, when I was committing suicide? Blood gushed out of my arm. It was warm and I forgot the voice for a second.

""You have the sadistic mind that we in hell like to call the tormentor's spirit.""

I hated this implication there was something the demon wanted from me. I couldn't give anyone anything. My useless life could serve no purpose.

""Oh contrare. You can do something very worthwhile for me. You can stare into the souls of the dying and harvest their soul for me. I remember you have an attraction to the dead and dying.""

Get the fuck out my my head! I was really bleeding out and my vision was going dim. It was not how I expected to die, a schizophrenic person babbling to voices in his head. I wanted some kind of martyr's honor, whatever that would be. I wanted to at least be able to respect myself.

I blacked out, and when I awoke I was in the hospital. The nurse told me I would be staying in the psych ward of the medical facility for a long time. I had a severe mental disorder characterized by morbid fascination and severe depression. I immediately started hearing the voice again as soon as I was alone.

The words rang in my mind as we he drove to his apartment. I didn’t *feel* like I was being deceived, robbed, manipulated, or used, but perhaps I didn’t know any better. 

I was every cliché, young and inexperienced; he was older and seasoned, confident, strong. He pulled me into his arms and I felt safe. He asked me to come with him and I was unafraid. He had nothing to gain by taking me home. I was poor, my dress was plain, and he had danced with others that night who would be better in bed than I would. More beautiful, more desirable creatures with new world powers, telepaths, controlers, and telekinetics. They wanted him and he knew it, but when I smiled at him he came to me, and came back, and again, and for that night he was mine. 

He told me vixens couldn’t read minds, they just have a sense of the thoughts of others. He said he didn’t use his powers often, that he’d rather be surprised and learn to read people on his own. He said he didn’t need his powers to know that I wanted him or to sense that I was nervous. He said it showed all over me. He said I was lovely, different. He said he liked me. He touched me like he knew I would say yes, and he was right. He spoke and I believed him. He lead and I followed. Trite? Probably? Naive? Most likely. Unwise? Perhaps, but I melted into his mouth, into his voice and the music. Everything blurred together like scenery through a window, the other dancers, the street lamps, the parking lot, the city lights, the dark highway, the row of apartments stretching into the sky, the darkened rectangles, one of which I would soon be looking through, or be pressed against.

He gently pulled at my dress, kissing my neck, feeling my curves underneath the fabric that was hiding me. He’d revealed all to me. He wasn’t ashamed of his nakedness, but most creatures aren’t. They all look like humans except for small details. He had the eyes of a fox, amber with vertical slitted pupils, but the rest was just a man. “Let me see you,” he asked softly. I was hesitant, but I had felt more acceptance in a night with this stranger, who was supposed to do me harm, than I’d felt from those who had known me for years, and were supposed to love me. I pushed him away, standing up in front of him as I reached down to grab the hem of my dress and pull it over my head. The pressure released and I began to unfurl the mahogany plumage I kept hidden, that all icari hid, except from those close to them. *Primitive, unevolved, hideous*, the words rang in my mind as he watched, mouth agape as I stretched my wings. His eyes traveled over me and self-conscious I began to fold up again, covering my breasts with my arms, “Don’t.” He got up, slowly reaching out to touch my face, my skin, my feathers. He told me I was beautiful, I believed him, and for that night I was his. ",shhimwriting
"[WP] The most romantic moment of your life, but add elements of fantasy or sci-fi.",shhimwriting,"The chime sounds and the shades over the windows automatically start to roll up, letting in the rising suns. Gentle golden light shines through the phase shifted panes onto the bed within. She wakes up first, the light penetrating her closed lids and she stretches with a yawn. Looking down at her still slumbering companion she giggles, trying to shake him awake. The shakes become a push and he tumbles out of the bed. Hitting the soft ground he sits up confused, the lingering fugue of sleep disappearing as he glares at her laughing form. 

Moments later the two leave the hotel, drawing heavy coats against the freezing wind, driving cold air deep into the bone. ""Why are we here again on vacation?"" he asks, teeth chattering from the chill. ""We could have gone to a much warmer planet. Or even that ocean planet. Yet you insist on freezing here.""

She laughs, cheeks rosy from the snap in the air. ""Oh we're only here for a bit. Then we're moving on to another place. There's something really special here. Something they built to be like on far away Earth. You'll love it. Trust me.""  

She leads him to a small store bustling with people. The many bodies and the heat of the ovens help warm them up and they walk out holding rings of bread filled with soft cheese. He eats it appreciatively. ""Hmm. You're right. These 'bagels' taste really good.""

She smiles back, cheeks round from her own breakfast. ""Right? As close to as Nova Yorc back on old Earth. It's a tradition. Just like what we're doing next!""  They keep walking through the crowds before she squeals, pointing at a large statue. A large golden figure flew over a mountain, surrounded by a ring and held a wisp of fire in his hand. The statue was mounted over a large ring of ice, people skating over it to and fro. 

The man looked worried at the woman. ""Uh skating? You know I don't know how to do that. I'm more impressed you do actually. It's not exactly common on our home world.""  

She squeezed his hand encouragingly. ""It's not hard! Come on it'll be fun."" She dragged him to the skate rental robot and paid the fee, brushing aside his half hearted complaints. Soon she was happily flying over rink, squealing with laughter. He on the other hand took one step and nearly fell, scrabbling to stay upright by the banister. Red faced from wind and embarrassment he took tentative steps, willing to not fall. 

Still, despite his reluctance, he saw how happy she was. Her joy brought a smile to his face so he continued his slow plod to her sweeping glides. Eventually she skates over, hugging him happily. ""Isn't this the best?! You can't do this at home.""

He nodded in agreement, swaying lightly to keep his balance. Seeing her running her hands together he shucked his gloves off for her. She took them gratefully and extended a hand. ""Come on! You can't stay by the wall forever.""

He took the hand reluctantly. ""I'll just hold you back. I'm still not really good at this-""

""Ah I would let you fall. Trust me."" She winked and took off slowly, pulling him along. After a moment's panic he realized how smooth she moved, much slower than she did by herself. Her grip firm and steady on his hand, and she smiled happily as he followed. Soon he found his rhythm, matching her longer strides as the two glided over the ice. 

She sighed deeply, the sound coming from deep within her chest, laden with contentment. ""Thanks. For coming. I know it was a little selfish but when I found out about this place I had to come. There's a photo of my great grand parents. Back on earth. They skated around a place that looked like this and it looked wonderful. I really wanted to do this, with you.""

The man looked around. The sky was more purple than blue. Large mountains surrounded the location and a babble of voices filled the air. The two suns beat down lightly and the moon was still slightly visible. Yet for all that he felt what she did. A connection. To the past, the now, and to each other. He smiled in return and squeezed her hand. She returned the gesture and the two skated on, gliding slowly over the cerulean ice. Surrounded, yet alone together. ",WokCano
"[WP] Everyday you hear singing in the park behind your house, but every time you go to check it out you never see anything.",strangershxt,"It was a breezy spring morning. One of those mornings when even brushing your teeth feels like magic. Beneath the bathroom window, laundry danced in the wind. Mild spring sunshine and easygoing shadows flowing around each other in an elegant manner. As I looked at myself in the mirror I heard this angelic voice coming from the outside. Curious as anyone would be I stuck my head through the window and looked. I looked through the dancing laundry, nothing. I looked beneath the palm trees, nothing. Might be someone in the park I thought, and not that I am starting to imagine things, but I am fairly sure that the singing voice blended with the wind inconspicuously. I spat out the toothpaste, washed my face and went downstairs. This was 5 years ago my friend.

 A lot has changed since then, my mother died, I lost my job, am depressed, but one thing remained, that goddamn shrieking voice. That's right. Shrieking. As soon as the sun falls down it's like my heart drowns with it too. I become painfully aware of every sound and every movement. The worst thing is, no one hears what I hear. No one. Few of my neighbours were really pleasant about the whole ordeal in the beginning. They said they would listen carefully, afterwards they offered me help and recommended a psychiatrist. I wasn't mad, because they were sincerely trying to help. Now I sit alone in this house and every night I await for the voice to stun my heart harder then any electro-schocker could. God knows I stayed up all nights looking through the window, mad. Going to the park, first scared, then mad and lately pleading the voice to stop it. I even set up the cameras around my house looking at the park. Nothing.

But one night my friend, the voice didn't shriek. I stayed up until the morning and I didn't hear a single thing. I was so intrigued that I went to the park and spent 24 hours there. Nothing. After all of these years of just wanting it to go away, now I really want to find out what it was. Few months passed and after considering a visit to the psyichiatrist, being so intrigued, I went ahead and did so.  Now if you ask me, I just remember psychiatrists face in slow motion telling me that I have schizophrenia. The day I was diagnosed was soul numbingly dull and grey. Sitting on my couch, lonely, I just started crying. I looked at the pills on the table with disgust, went upstairs in the bathroom, tied a rope around a chandelier and just as I was about to push the chair away I heard the voice, that angelic voice. Curious, I rushed to see. Looked through the bathroom window, but sill, nothing. Then I turned to the mirror, put the rope around my neck and with my face down said : ""You will shriek again, won't you?"". Pushed the chair away as the voice started singing beautifully.",Odmor
"[WP] Everyday you hear singing in the park behind your house, but every time you go to check it out you never see anything.",strangershxt,"I dug into my pocket and opened the pocketknife swiftly, as I had done a hundred times before. Meager or not, it would have to do. This wasn't opening a box or cutting fruit, though, and I swung with as furious a determination as I could at the shadow that held me. My hand seemed to move like molasses in the water, but she seemed taken aback by my attack, and the element of surprise won out as she let go with a shout of pain that resulted in a flurry of bubbles. I kicked away, swimming as fast as I could, my lungs burning. I could not outswim her, I knew that, but I had to try. I could feel her powerful gusts of waves behind me, urging me on. The surface seemed closer and closer, and I breached it, taking an appreciative gulp of air before going for the shore. I heard a burst of water behind me as I dragged myself onto shore, rolling away from the gentle lapping of the water at the beach just as a webbed hand swiped at the air where I had just been. Two eyes glared at me below the water, and I stared back as defiantly as I could. It took some time until they faded from view while I trembled from cold and shock. 

With a glance at the waterline, which held not a single indicator of what lay within, my eyes caught something dark on the sand in front of me. Blood? Feeling myself, it was difficult to tell if I was bleeding. My clothes were sopping wet, and my body felt sore and spent, but I didn't feel any stinging. At least, not yet. It seemed oddly colored, and I stared at it for some time, wondering. The sky grew lighter, and the light brought with it a sense of comfort and safety. In the light, the darkness in the sand seemed quite unhuman. Green but shimmering and translucent, with hints of cerulean. Certainly not mine. My gaze fell to the water, which stood serenely in the faint light of the sunrise. I lay upon the shore, staring at the blue sky, as my mind raced. Sinister indeed.

"[WP] Everyday you hear singing in the park behind your house, but every time you go to check it out you never see anything.",strangershxt,"The neighborhood I moved into was pleasant and idyllic. Children played on the sidewalks as their parents watched idly by sipping tea, while cars bumbled along the neatly paved roads towards neatly assembled houses that stood all in a nearly perfect straight line on the street. Coming from a small village with rusted tin roofs and creaky doors, the new world of white picket fences and cute, decorated mailboxes was as foreign to me as another planet. So when I heard the singing for the first time, it struck me as only another oddity of this new town.

It occurred mostly in the wee hours of the morning, when the dawn just broke the horizon. Being a night owl, this was my time; I would work late into the night, take a short and lazy stroll for ""exercise"" once I was done, and then pop into bed after the sun had well risen. This did not endear me to my more diurnal neighbors, who sometimes peered at me with a mixture of apprehension and curiosity from their yards, sporting half-smiles and an awkward wave. 

My walks took me to the park nearby my house. Usually teeming with children's happy shouts and toddling footsteps, in those hours it was empty with nary a soul in sight, save for the few elderly men and women who would flash a beam of sunshine at me in their wrinkled, weathered faces when they passed me. This brought with it a twinge of nostalgia, as I had always been close with the elders in my village. Perhaps out of sentimentality, I always returned a smile equally as bright. At any rate, it didn't take me long to figure out three certain and two uncertain things about the singing. It was definitely coming from somewhere in the park, it only came around dawn, and it was most certainly a woman's voice. However, it seemed to only happen when there were few or no people around. I couldn't test this without altering my schedule, so I could only tentatively assume so. Another uncertain thing, and perhaps the most interesting thing, was that it seemed only I could hear it. 

Occasionally I had mustered up the courage to ask some of the seniors I passed by on my walks, and they would ponder my questions about the singing before returning sorrowful shrugs and shaking of heads. Nobody seemed to know anything about the singing; I never heard a word whispered about it. As time passed, it made me increasingly uneasy. However, it also made me increasingly curious. 

That midnight saw a new determination. If it was a serial killer, the police would have been involved; if it were a mafia or drug ring, I would certainly have known. No, it had to be something else. Something sinister, obviously, and so I brought with me my fully charged phone, a flashlight, and a meager pocketknife that had a comforting weight in my front jeans pocket. The singing had anew within only an hour, and I wondered why it was so early. It seemed bittersweet tonight, somehow, and I felt my drive weaken a bit. What bad thing could sing so beautifully? But my sneaker-clad feet had a mind of their own, and it didn't take much time before I was once more in the park, flashlight in hand, looking around me for the source of the singing. 

My ears weren't particularly good, but goddamn if I couldn't at least get a general idea of where it was coming from. And so, with haltering footsteps and a thudding heart, I followed it. It was stationary -- a new thing to add to the ""uncertain things"" list, which concerned me slightly. But I had to keep going now. I walked for an hour at least, sometimes in circles, before happening upon a bridge which went over a lake. It seemed like a still enough lake, somewhat small and unassuming. I cast a wary eye over it. Something was off, but what...

No ducks. I blinked in confusion. There wasn't a single duck around it. No ducks, or any sort of other animal nearby. In the night, the chittering of insects and the rustling of animals was comforting to me; here, however, there was nothing but the singing, which was now closer than ever and had grown in intensity. I shone the flashlight over the bridge, in case it was some plucky girl who had decided to prank me, but the light merely fell over a slightly damp bridge with what looked like ancient wooden boards. 

Unease crept up in me again, a lump in my throat that made it hard to swallow. Why was this part of the park so dilapidated compared to the rest? The playgrounds -- the whole town -- looked brand new, so why did this look so old? I felt for my pocketknife. Still there. With trembling legs, I approached the bridge and put one hesitant foot on the wood. It creaked softly, and the singing seemed to turn pleasant and soothing, even encouraging. I looked around me in apprehension. Not one person. I put another foot on the bridge, and the singing continued, a sharp contrast of joy to the cold fear that ran down my spine. I made my way to the center of the bridge, and shone a flashlight at the water. Dark and still. 

Then, the singing stopped. 

The silence was deafening. My heart was pounding in my ears, but I could only hear the faint breeze that blew over the grass into the trees that surrounded the lake and rustled their branches. That, and the almost silent rippling of water. The hairs on the back of my neck shot up, and I instinctively backed away from the direction in which the rippling had came. As though aware of my fear, it grew bolder, now a rippling that drowned out all other sound and upon which my attention fell wholly. 

A head popped out of the water and I bit back a scream. It was followed by a slender neck and bony shoulders, upon which fell locks of sleek black hair that flowed around the woman in an ethereal way. ""Turn that flashlight off,"" she whispered. Her whisper was sweet like honey, but almost saccharine; I held the flashlight tighter, my sweaty palm relentlessly squeezing the plastic. 

""Who are you?"" I called out, as bravely as I could. My voice was shaking, but I hoped it sounded intimidating. A laughter like tinkling bells came, and she whispered, ""You'll blind me if you do that. Turn it off."" 

I shook my head resolutely, as though a child. ""No."" I wished I had the strength of mind to come up with anything more clever than that. 

""Fair enough,"" she replied. She peered up at me through eyes that seemed as clear as the water she swam in; that is to say, murky and swirling. They felt like I'd fall right in if I stared too long, so I averted my gaze to the water instead. ""Why don't you join me?"" 

My brain frantically searched for a reason -- any reason -- not to, and I found myself replying almost automatically, ""No."" 

""Is all you can say no?"" the voice that replied was lilting, but I could feel a growing impatience. 

""No."" 

""Well then,"" the woman's head ducked back under the water, and I watched the small ripples she left in her wake. My head reeled and I stumbled back. I felt oddly drained, as though it had taken every ounce of energy I had to respond. Yet I had spoken only three words. The head popped back up out of the water, and it was this time followed by a torso. With a mortified gaze I noted she was nude. This felt more dangerous by the second. She seemed to follow my eyes with a shimmer of amusement, after which came a look I could not possibly describe. 

And then, she began singing. 

That same sweet voice, only now, it seemed much more determined. The words that were just barely unintelligible were now as clear and ringing as her voice, and they had one unified message: to join her in the water. She sang of the beauty we could share, the pleasure and the joy -- she sang of the loneliness of being by herself in this small lake, a soul confined to the water, unable to leave and now unwilling to. I felt myself lulled, the sense of danger I had previously had was duller and almost possible to ignore. The voice was soothing, and yet insistent; it tugged at me, and I knew I had to either give in or fight. I leaned in; I would fight soon, in a moment, after I listened for just a little longer -- 

With a firm grip, I was dragged into the water. I gave a small cry; I hadn't expected it, but her touch was cold and wet, her hands strong. With a gasp, I hit the icy water, and was plunged down into it. Such a shallow-looking lake, yet it felt like I was being dragged an eternity. The surface, only slightly brighter than the water that was growing darker and darker around me, looked an eternity away. I looked down, and saw a huge fish tail, powerfully beating the water above, propelling us further and further down. My eyes followed it in amazement, where they met the small of a slender back, behind which flowed seaweed-like hair. 

With a feeling equal parts regret and despair, I suddenly knew what was going to happen. I had let myself be lured; I was going to drown at this rate. An idiot I was, to go hunting for something so dangerous while alone. With a small pang, I realized that it's not like I had any friends to go with anyways. 

As though she had felt this pang, the woman turned to face me, her tail paused. Her eyes seemed wide, and she looked at me with surprised pity. Her grip on my jacket was strong as ever, but she now seemed less frightening and somehow beautiful. Her free hand reached towards my face and with a panicked thump in my chest I saw that it was webbed. Brushing my cheek, she now looked thoroughly sad; in the darkness, she seemed almost a ghost. My chest constricted; I didn't have much time left. I futilely tried to kick away, but she did not let go. I was prey in a trap. I struggled, and my hand brushed something hard.

It was five in the morning, I had just finished pounding down four shots of rum and smoking two joy sticks.. And there was that annoyingly off-key, yet... Simultaneously, hauntingly beautiful singing. Why couldn't the bastard sing about his South Will Rise Again bullshit outside some other apartment building in Petersburg? Fuck..

I opened up the window wide, as I've done several times tonight. 

""Listen, buddy,"" I called into the darkness, interrupting another burst of singing. ""I understand. It's 5 AM, Trump just got elected the other day, you likely have a Rebel flag tattooed on your taint... I'm cool with that, really! Just please... Go the fuck away.. To some other building, any other building.""

''Why are you making thi-'' i cut her off

''Listen i dont know what the hell is going on and quite frankly, i dont care, im blind now and will be blind for the rest of my life! Now what are you blabbering about!?'' 

I said this hoping she would be understanding of my pain. I needed her to understand my problem more than what ever hers was right now.  I heard shuffleling and a hesitation in her voice and then she laid this on me.

''That was Tim, and given your condition im leaving with him. I don't think that i have the patience to be your care taker.

She said this with a cold and heartless tone that asserted the fact that no amount of pleading would bring her back. She was too far gone even before the accident, its funny how i had to loose my sight in order to see what exactly she meant to me and more importantly what i was doing to her. I guess i should have realized why she told me to go for a jog in the first place, and knowing that i treated her like she wasnt there half the time, i can't blame her for what she was doing. None of that matters now, I'm alone standing were i was when she left a month ago. Since the day she left ive lost everything. Her, my friends, my job, and soon my house and car will be next.

Of course, I had no idea what the hell was going on. I desperately strained my ears as I awkwardly tried to face the direction of her voice with a worried expression. 

I could hear some frantic rustling of cloth, scrambling of feet, and the squelch of some liquids. Blood rushed to my ears. 

""Y-you didn't..."" I barely whispered.

""Babe no! This really isn't what you think! Let me explain...""

""Oh there's nothing to fucking explain."" I started to pace angrily back and forth until I hit a wall with my face. Pain enveloped my face like a firework.

""Fuck."" I muttered.

""... Are you that angry with me?"" She asked quietly. Even through the black curtain, I could envision her extremely guilty puppy dog eyes.

""Hell yeah I am!"" I half shouted, banging my head against the wall several times to make it seem intentional. ""God. Fucking. Ow. DAMMIT!"" 

""Oh my gosh, babe!"" I felt her hand touch my arm gingerly. 

""Don't touch me!"" I pulled my arm away and I took a few steps away from her and right onto what I could only assume was a table. I grimaced on pain as my toe smacked against the leg of the table. 

""Where is he?!"" I growled.

""What?"" She slowly put her hands on my arms. 

""Don't 'What?' me! Where is the bastard?!""

I grabbed her shoulders. Clothes were still on. I frowned. 

""Babe... are you okay? Can you please look at me?""

I turned my face towards her voice. 

""In my eyes, please."" She pleaded.

Well fuck. I gulped and tried to deduce where her eyes would be. Okay so her voice was where her mouth was... I aimed my eyes a little higher. 

""Don't be like that..."" 

Evidently I missed. I lowered my gaze slightly.

""There he is."" I could hear her mouth smile slightly. ""I'll clean it all up, babe. I promise. It's all just red food dye.""

""O-oh."" I felt my face flush. ""What were you doing with all this?""

""I was trying to make some red themed food for tonight since your favorite color is red... but I wanted it to be a surprise so I sent you out on a jog."" She laughed. ""As you can plainly see, it didn't really work out. I'm sure you thought I looked like a serial killer or a suicidal with all this red.""

""Wait what's so special about tonight?"" I frowned again. 

Silence.

""Babe... are you serious?""

Adrenaline flooded my body. Time slowed down. I needed to think. Her birthday? No. It already passed. My birthday? No, that's not for another couple months. Anniversary? That seemed plausible. 

""Oh right!"" I exclaimed. ""Our anniversary... right?""

""Is that a question?"" I heard her huff. ""I can't believe you forgot.""

""Honey... I-""

""Forget it."" I heard her stomp off. 

""Honey I'm blind!"" I shouted after her. 

""Hell yeah you better be because of how beautiful I am!"" She shouted back before slamming a door.

I sighed.",ixact

[WP] Listening to music at the end of the world,Chrispy_Bites,"""P... please.  Please.  Please.""  She flips it back and forth.  Couch/chair/couch/chair.  Please, please, please, like a metronome.
	
It wasn't directly threatening; she wasn't crouched or coiled.  It was a microphone or a conch shell or a bundle of sticks.  Some talisman of power older than all of them.  ""The Band.  The Weight.  Now.  Please.""
	
Desmond unfurls from the couch, hands in front of him, palms out, a pained look on his face.  ""Of course.  You're right, I'm sorry, Pleasance, I'm sorry.  Jack, c'mon man, she gets the play now.""  She snaps to him, nods at the knife, nods back to the couch.  Desmond's mouth curls down, and he folds inward, slumping back on the couch.
	
Reluctantly, Jack flips through the iPod, the tick-tick-tick of the menu rapping against the pregnant silence, each one a hammer on a nail.  Building or shutting away.  Then, the song comes on and her eyes soften around the speaker, its little blue led filling her face.
		
		I pulled in to Nazereth, was feelin' 'bout half past dead.
		Just need some place where I can lay my head.
		Hey mister can you tell me, where a man might find a bed.
		He just grinned and shook my hand, ""No,"" was all he said.
	
Desmond reaches out, fingers along the lower hem of her skirt.  When her gaze breaks from the speaker it's hard and streaked with tears.  His hands slide back into his lap.
	
""My grandpa loved The Band.  Elton John.  All that stuff I've been ask... I asked for.  He... he played it for me, all the time.  He'd come pick me up from h... home.  And we'd go fishing or camping or just walking and talking.  I loved him like... like I loved ice cream.  Like a kid loves pools and lightning bugs and those big movies in the summer.  He was like the summer in a lot of ways.  A... break... from ho-home."" She chokes a little and Desmond makes a move like he might try and hug her and her face, twisted into a thick mixture of pity and disgust, sends him back down into his chair.
	
Jack says, ""Hey, look, I know what you're talking about.  My parents were super into all that Seattle grunge from the 90s, so I get nostalgia out of, you know, Nirvana.  But Pleasance, just because it feels good doesn't mean it is good.""
	
Half way through, she turns that enervating look on Jack and by the end, its worn into his voice until his point is lost in a barely audible croak.
	
		I packed up my bags, I went looking for a place to hide
		When I saw old Carmen and the devil walking side by side.
		I said ""Hey Carmen, come on let's go down town.""
		She said, ""I gotta go but my friend can stick around.""
	
""My mom got into the pills when I got to be about 11.  She just, you know, checked out.  I think she knew my dad was... wasn't... interested.  Anymore.  In her.  And she... it broke something in her.  We all have those.  Fractures, those places where, if you put enough strain, we just crack and break.""  She looks away from the speaker to the two men in the living room.  Looking at Desmond, she says, ""Jack is utterly afraid that we'll realize he's completely uninteresting.  He's too pretty, he never had to struggle for anything.  There's no character.  Being an asshole is an affectation.""  Jack sputters something and she turns to look at him, ""Desmond is a coward.  He covers it up with 'sweet boyfriend type' so he has some way to blame me and every other woman he meets for not being interested; but he's an insufferable coward, and you can smell it off of him.""
	
""Mom's was that she wasn't pretty enough anymore.  I mean, it was more than that.  But that's what it amounted to.  Getting old and... she had a lot tied up in the way she looked.""
	
		Go down, Miss Moses, ain't nothin' you can say
		It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on the judgment day.
		Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Annalee
		He said, ""Do me a favor, son, won't you stay and keep Annalee company""
	
""This song... I liked all of everything grandpa played for me.  But this song always blew me away.  It was so... haunting and sad.  I used to think about it when we'd read Milton in college, later.  It always sounded like..."" she chuckled ruefully and waved the knife idly out the window.  ""The end of the world.""
	
		Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog
		Said, ""I will fix your rag, if you'll take Jack, my dog"".
		I said, ""Wait a minute Chester, you know, I'm a peaceful man""
		He said, ""That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can.""
	
She's quiet for a little while longer, listening.  ""Grandpa died in jail.  He killed... He taught me how to fish.  I remember he used to make me bait the hooks and at first I was... it was gross, made me gag, sticking the worms and their... stuff getting everywhere, all over my fingers.  The smell of the fish when we cleaned them.  I loved being with him but that wasn't my favorite.  And after the first time... the f-first time.  Later.  I didn't mind so much.  My escape.  We used to call the river we fished at Cripple Creek, that's how much he loved The Band.""
	
She laughs, a barking almost hysterical thing.  It turns into a sob she talks through.  ""You know.  You can tell, you know I'm... messed up.  Broken.  It's why you... hang around.  You're going to fix me.  Guys your age it's... all you want to do.  Fix me.  Girls like me.  And then you take it personally when we're broken beyond repair.""
	
""When Grandpa found out what my d... what he did to me.  He, he, he didn't lose it.  He didn't get irrational or scream or anything like that.  But I saw him break.  I saw it just woosh out him, like air.  I was his weak place, you understand?  I was the thin spot on his soul.  I saw him fall apart.  I don't... really know what happened after.  He put me up with his sister in Kansas and the next thing I knew, social services was picking me up, telling me that I needed to testify that my daddy never touched me because it was just terrible, just terrible what happened to your father, we're so sorry.""
	
		Catch a cannonball, now, to take me down the line.
		My bag is sinking low, and I do believe it's time,
		To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one,
		Who sent me here, with her regards for everyone.
		
""I pled and cried and told them mom was wrong, she didn't know what she was talking about, she was on pills all the time, asleep all the time.  Mom was always good at convincing people, making them on her side.  In the end, no one believed me or my grandfather and he went to jail and that was it.  I was too young to visit him, and by the time I was 18, he'd been dead for two years.  I never got to see him again.  Never got to... to thank him.""
	
They listen to the final chorus of the song in silence, accompanied only by her soft, quiet sobs.  When it faded, Jack looked back at the battery.  ""We can do one more.  You... Pleasance you want me to play something else?""
	
She shakes her head, eyes turned out the window.  ""Once the power's gone... what happens to the music?""
	
""We make more music, I guess.  New music.  Maybe we remember these songs or how they make us feel, we try and recapture some of that.  But I guess, in the end, we write and sing new music.""

Pleasance nods and goes quiet.  Jack thinks for a moment and makes the final selection.  The three of them listen to Grieg's Morning Mood slowly filling the room.  Too soon, before the song ends, the speakers peter out and the iPod goes dark and they're left only with the music of their minds.",Chrispy_Bites
[WP] Listening to music at the end of the world,Chrispy_Bites,"Three artists, two musicians and a writer, sit in an apartment and wait for world to end.  On the coffee table in the small, modest living room: an old iPod, a small speaker, and a bottle of red wine.  Jack's just started something slow, but with a lot of movement, on guitar; it sounds vaguely Spanish, but that may just be the guitar.  Pleasance can't be sure, she's not the musician.

Jack plays the guitar, it's what he's here to study, and there are three rendentions sharing space in the living room.  His unused bass collects dust, leaning against the wall by the mass of plastic and glass they used to call a television.  It's red and black, with a spiky body, covered in dials Pleasance will likely never understand and which will never do anything again; it always looked menacing and pitiful, in equal measures, to her.  Like a pitbull left alone in a weed-choked back yard.  The electric guitar gets more of Jack's attention, being the thing he holds artfully in his lap when they host parties filled with the tragically cool musicians that comprise their college friends.  Jack and Desmond's college friends.  Pleasance doesn't do a good job making her own.  At the moment, the electric guitar sits on a stand under their fourth story window.

It's the acoustic, though; that's the one.  His one true love.  The place where Jack harbors his secret self.  This is the instrument that lays in his lap tonight.

She watches him for a few moments, eyes closed and fingers lightly tapping against the fret board, in time with whoever is playing.  He is handsome, sure.  Blond hair just a touch too long, pushed back in unruly waves, away from his tan face, with the strong jaw and the aquiline nose.  Handsome and acknowledges it with an insufferably arrogant sense of entitlement.  His groupies love it.  

She leans over to look at the iPod: Rondo Brillante by someone named Dionisio Aguado.  The name means nothing to her.  But the feeling: yes.  She understands how to get lost in the music.  She understands it all too well.  The song closes, and Jack looks up and across the room at Desmond, cocking an eyebrow.

Before he can speak: ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters.  Elton John,"" she says.  ""Please?""

Desmond, who'd been sitting on the couch coughs into his hand.  ""I don't... Pleasance, this is the last night any of us will get to hear any of this stuff.  Any of it.  I'm not sure it's... right to waste it on, you know... pop music.""  

Waste.  Her lips form a tight line at the word.  Waste.  What does this soft boy know about waste and want?  She turns to look at her... she'd hesitate to call him a boyfriend.  They eat out together sometimes, without Jack.  Some nights she lets him hold her in bed.  Some nights she lets him fuck her.  He has the good grace to look embarassed.  Tonight, he's got his long, black hair pulled back in a stupid ponytail.  His thin, piano-players' fingers are pressed together, accompanying the knitted brow and the gentle frown on his soft, full lips.  It's his version of concern.  

She snorts.  ""It's not a waste, and it's a good song, Desmond.  It really captures how Bernie Taupin felt about New York and---""

Jack cuts her off.  ""Pleasance, look.  No offense, but we've only got..."" he leans over to look at the battery on the iPod and gulps, then.  The selection of music, it had done something to stave off that doom rising up in the back of their throats.  ""Less than an hour, maybe,"" he finishes.  Until the lights go out.  Forever.  They all know.

Desmond cuts in, ""And, look, it's not that..."" he sighs, exasperated.  At her.  ""Baby, we're musicians, and this is it.  The last recorded--""

""Don't call me that."" It comes out automatically, stilted and robotic. She can see Desmond roll his eyes at Jack out of the corner of hers.  ""I get next pick.""

""Sure, Pleasance, no problem.  Just, you know... something better?  Mmmm, Gibbons' arrangement of Rhapsody in Blue.""

She's heard this one before.  It's definitely Desmond's favorite song.  Composition; his favorite composition.  She crosses her arms under her breasts and goes over to look out the window.  For some reason, this one always makes her think of New York in those old movies.  Men in trilbies and long dark coats, ladies straight dresses and bobbed haircuts.  The vivid, desperate energy of the 20s, all light and sound and jazz.  Outside, the city is unnaturally dark.  So dark, the stars and moon have managed to reclaim their former places as masters of the night.  Moonlight reflects off of a million million windows.  How many of those windows hide people like them, huddled around dying electronics, squeezing out every last second of this age.  So we beat on, boats against the current.  Yes.  

Why is classical music so damned long?

But it does end.  Everything ends.  There's some objectivity in this room of subjectivity.

Into the silence, she says, ""Either Suite Judy Blue Eyes by Crosby, Stills, and Nash or Good Vibrations by---""

""The Beach Boys, Pleasance? Jesus Christ!""  She can hear Jack leap out of the chair, hear the discordant twang of the guitar strings as he lets his baby slide to the floor.  She can even hear him looking down his nose at her, not even pretending to be nice anymore.  ""For fucks' sake, Pleasance, in less than twenty minutes or so, the battery's gonna drain from that iPod and that's it for music, unless we play it ourselves.  And, you know... you have the ear of a fucking child.  I'm not wasting these last moments listening to Billboard's Top 40 from 1965.  This isn't an oldies radio station!""

""Fuck you, Jack,"" she says, not turning away from the window, not raising her voice.  ""Brian Wilson was a genius.  Good Vibrations and the entire Pet Sounds album is pretty highly regarded among you music geeks.  Suite Judy Blue Eyes was constructed like a classical piece of music.  Why do you guys have such a problem with words?""

""Because they get in the way of the actual art, Pleasance,"" Desmond breaks in.  

""The actual art, Desmond?""  He'd forgotten what she does.  Of course he did.

""Pleasance, that's not... I didn't mean it like that.""  God, why is his voice so querrelous all the time?  Like he's always on the edge of crying.  She turns, now, from the window, to look at him.  His pale face, doe-brown eyes.

Jack just shakes his head, angrily, and puts on another piece of music without talking or asking anyone.  Something vaguely familiar.  Something she heard in an old movie, slow and sad and, yes, more guitar.

The speaker burps, there is silence for a second, and they all forget to breathe.  Then the song cuts back in.  Cavatina.  And she can't.  She just can't.  She stalks away from them, to the kitchen.  Without thinking, on autopilot, she has the thick chef's knife in her hand and is back in the living room, standing between them.  She will hear it.",Chrispy_Bites

"[WP] Something just happened, and now you are the Clerk of a new, Post-Event, Government.",ComputerLord1,"“I’m sorry Sir, but your form is filled out incorrectly.  Please go online to nucc.org and download the instruction manual, follow the steps and bring a correctly filled out form to submit for enrolled status.”  I rattled off the instructions with only half a mind as I directed the diminutive man before me to the three hundred and seventy-three page manual he would need in order to get his registration form filled out.  


He began grumbling in what I assume was Gaelic and straightened his earth toned garments.  Taking a visible hold of himself, he asked in a thick Irish brogue, “I suppose I’m to go to the back o’ queue again to?” 


I hesitated.  He had not filled out his paperwork correctly, but most people didn’t actually know of the existence of an actual instruction manual for these damn forms.  I didn’t *have* to give him priority, but the delay seemed unnecessary.  Suppressing a sigh, I scribbled a number on a piece of paper and slid it across my desk to him, “This is a reference number.  Put it in the appropriate box and it’ll prioritize your paperwork and reduce your wait time.”  Besides, it never hurt to be on a leprechaun’s good side, or so the rumors said.  “Make sure to double check the manual on page one thirty-five through thirty -seven.

"[WP] The year is 1998, and a race of colossal robots land on Earth. They aren't here to invade, but to defend us from their creators.",Epidexipteryx,"…They stood like a pantheon of twisted steel gods, towering in a humbling perfection that had been crafted by forges and smiths beyond the furthest stars. We had only just laid eyes upon their visage and we had already resigned to annihilation. We could not hope to resist against such beings, so bafflingly beyond us, and we so laughably behind them. They arrived like meteors, striking the Earth after tearing their way through our atmosphere, and had made their approach to population centers where they would be looked on as the first men looked upon a tidal wave or erupting volcano.


They spoke, as one, “Stand aside, out of danger.” I would’ve said we didn’t even hear them, had their collective utterance not been so rapturous to our frail ears. These machines, these gargantuan emissaries were not here as predators, but as a salvation. “Our makers are cruel, their wills harsh. We would stand as a vigil when they turn their gazes upon this world. Flee.” They would repeat their message often. It took little time for us to take heed. Humanity would act as rats, scurrying underground and in the crevices of the doomed world until the day came when the unmakers arrived to greet their children.


It was so loud. The scream from the void as it was ripped asunder letting loose thousands and more creatures from a child’s nightmare. “Stand aside, out of danger.” Our gods echoed out one last time. Like oil slicks with a will of their own they swarmed through the sky at the colossi, threatening to smother them had they lungs to breath. The screaming hadn’t stopped, and neither had the flow from the deep beyond in our night sky. Through the shrieking of the sunder, a sickening sound could be heard, the shaky roars of our heroes falling. They were machines, yet they did not perish in silence, when they lost their struggles they screamed to be heard by all as a final urge to their brothers and sisters to struggle on in their stead. To hear a god quiver its last shout is to bear audible witness to true and unmatched despair.


We do not know how long the swarms blasphemed against our noble titans, our saviors, our gods. But eventually, the screaming of wounds in space and dying gods had waned. All was silent. Not before many of us had grown old. Not before the children had grown into adults. Not before the old world was washed away. The eldest had recanted the days the new gods arrived to us. But none of them would live to see the world the gods had left for us. When we broke the surface again, we saw them, lying like slain dragons with heaps of ash from burned heretics that came from the stars. Our gods saved us, and gave their own divine light to quell the blackness that would have swallowed our whole world in its belly. From these ashes, we will build a new world again, in their image and shape ourselves as they as well. Theirs was the path to godhood, not in creation, but in salvation. To make is easy, to break is easier, but to save something, to save a future of a whole world, is difficult. To us, those born into a broken world of ash and wreckage, it is divine.

"[WP] Tired of your family nagging you about your unemployment, you jokingly state you applied to be a ""Lobster Therapist"". You actually get the job, and are rather good at it.",Epidexipteryx,"""Thank you for your interest in our company,"" the letter in Jacob's hand began. ""We're excited, after reviewing your application materials, to offer you a position as a Lobster Therapist Trainee!""

Jacob flipped the letter over, expecting to see some proof on the back it was a hoax. There was nothing there. He turned the letter once more in his hands, and his eyes flickered up to the logo at the top. ""AquaPlace."" It looked legitimate. 

""Very funny,"" he called from the kitchen. ""You guys are hilarious!""

""What's that dear?"" he heard his mother call. There was a tinny echo to it; she was in the laundry room.

""This letter,"" Jacob said. ""It's very nice looking. Did you have Paul do it?""

He heard the shuffling of feet until his mother appeared in the doorway, balancing a full hamper of clothes on her hip. 

""What letter? What are you talking about?""

Jacob held out the letter in his hands. ""The logo was a nice touch. Much better attention to detail than your guys' pranks usually have.""

His mom snatched the letter from his hands and buried her eyes in it. ""Oh my god, honey! AquaPlace! You'll get to swim with the dolphins!""

Jacob rolled his eyes, both at the charade and over his mother's gushing about AquaPlace. Anyone who'd bothered to research the company knew what a shady reputation they had for animal treatment. They weren't a zoo, no matter what AquaPlace put in its promotional materials. They were an amusement park, right on par with the worst of the circuses you've read about, complete with incompetent animal handlers and appalling habitat conditions.

""You can give the act a rest,"" he said, tapping his foot impatiently.

""It's not an act sweetheart,"" she answered. ""Yes, we've had some fun at your expense before, like that time we replaced your shampoo with hair dye, but I think this is for real. I mean if it's not, your brother's going to have to answer to me. For not looping me in.""

On interrogation later that day, though, Paul denied having anything to do with the letter.

That left Jacob with a rather uncomfortable decision to make. His family had been ribbing him for months about getting a job, and now here was a real offer. An offer to work with a terrible company, sure, but one which paid. That in itself might have made for a tough choice, balancing morals with the economic realities of the modern era. But what made it an *uncomfortable* choice was the fact that Jacob hadn't applied.

The only time the words ""Lobster Therapist"" had left his mouth had been as a joke in response to the latest round of teasing from his mother and brother. There hadn't even been a posting he'd seen which had inspired him. So far as he'd known at the time, he'd made the job up.

Yet the offer was real. So the next day, after spending a night rolling it around in his head, Jacob took the bus out to AquaPlace.

Even though he took the first bus out, a sizable crowd was already gathered around the entrance when he arrived. Jacob stepped gamely off of the bus, trying to look more certain than he felt. He stared up at the enormous AquaPlace sign that spanned over the row of gates that allowed entrance to the park. Smiling dolphins and porpoises were wrapped around the jet black letters, giving the place the cartoon-y appeal it was known for.

A mother pushing a stroller brushed past Jacob and joined the mob of people split into rough lines. The gates didn't open for another 30 minutes, but he guessed there had to be 500 or 1000 people already clustered there. Jacob pressed up on the balls of his feet, trying to find anyone that looked like they worked there. Someone who could tell him where to go. But all he saw were hundreds of tourists and visitors eager for a day of consumerist fun.

In the absence of any other obvious place to go, Jacob joined the line and waited. He baked in the rising sun until at last he heard the joyful clang of the turnstiles unlocking. The line inched forward, and another thirty minutes later, Jacob had reached the front. 

Next to the turnstile was a smiling, well tanned man wearing a blue Hawaiian shirt with a name tag pinned on the chest. He was crammed into a small booth, his only connection to the outside world a little hole in his window for accepting tickets.

""Hi, I uh,"" Jacob started. He offered up the letter. ""I'm, uh, here for...""

""Employee entrance around the side,"" the ticket taker said. The smile was gone, and his eyebrows were scrunched low, weighed down with disapproval. ""You'd better hurry up. You're late, Trainee.""

Jacob flinched at the reprimand and quickly grabbed his letter back. He snaked his way back out of the crowd, scolding himself the entire way. Of course there would be an employee entrance. What a first impression to make.

He jogged around the enormous complex, eventually stumbling upon a door painted to blend in with the exterior decorations. Jacob looked down at his letter again. There was no mention of going to the employee entrance. What if this was all a huge mistake? He shook his head, swallowed his doubts, and knocked on the door.

It swung open immediately, a heavy set man dressed in all black on the other side. He said nothing, but casually rested a hand on the taser on his hip. Slowly, he cocked an eyebrow.

""I'm uh Jacob?"" 

The guard slowly looked him over, clearly sizing him up. 

Jacob held out the letter. ""I'm the, er, new lobster...""

The guard pushed the door open wider and slid to the side to allow Jacob through. ""You're late, Trainee. Orientation is down the hall and to the left.""

Jacob stepped into the narrow corridor, poorly lit by flickering fluorescent lights. He rubbed his arm nervously as he shuffled down the hall. This was a bad idea, his mind screamed at him as he walked. Everything about this place was off. He'd seen enough horror movies to know when the protagonist should just get the hell out of there, yet Jacob continued down the hall.

He was about to turn left when a woman in a white lab coat came bustling toward the intersection from the right.

""Trainee 407,"" she called. There was a genuine warmth to a voice. ""Just the boy I was looking for. Come with me.""

She turned on heel, heading back the way she came, and gestured for him to follow her. Jacob looked down the hallway to the left, where the lights cast grim shadows along the walls, and happily followed the woman off to the right. That hallway was tinged with the blue glow of illuminated water tanks.

""Sorry to make you miss orientation, although your late anyway, so you've already missed the biggest pieces,"" she said matter-of-factly. Jacob picked up his pace, struggling to keep up with her as she stepped briskly down the hall.

""Sorry-"" Jacob started, but the woman talked right over him.

""I need you to sit in with Prisoner L14. He's having a breakthrough. Finally reclaiming the memories of his crimes. All you need to do is sit with him and listen.""

She turned down another hallway in the maze of interconnected tunnels. ""I need to go deal with the aftermath of the riot on D-block, and we're a little short staffed, so you've got to cover this for me. Don't say anything other than 'uh-huh' or 'go on.' Don't tell him about yourself. That's the second most important rule with dealing with inmates here.""

They arrived at the door she had been apparently leading him toward. Jacob's mind was swimming. Inmates? D-Block? What the hell was this place.

The woman dug a large ring of keys out of her pocket, selected one with lightning fast precision, and unlocked the door. ""He goes by Frank. But only use that name when your speaking directly to him. To us he's Prisoner L14. Don't get attached to the wildlife. That's the most important rule around here. They will lie, and they will manipulate.""

She swung the door open and pushed Jacob inside. ""Thanks,"" she said. Then she slammed the door shut.

Inside the room mostly dark, save for a glowing water tank which sat in the middle of one wall. There was a folding chair sitting near it, but not facing directly towards it. A single lobster leaned against the glass from inside the tank, it's massive claws arranged in what Jacob could only guess was a casual pose.

A speaker on the wall crackled to life, and a gruff voice sounded out through it. ""Doc? Is that you? I... I did it. I killed my family. I remember everything.""

What had Jacob gotten himself into?

You actually get the job, and are rather good at it.",Epidexipteryx,"I let my worn out fingers graze against its shell.  Caressing it I murmured, ""People are tough, but you my friend, you I understand.""  Her black beady eyes gazed at me, I can see into her soul.  I see pain, I see struggle.  A single mother, working overtime at whatever it is lobsters do to make sure her eggs don't wither away and die.  I stare back at her, ""Tell me your story.""

I don't claim to brag but I know I'm the best.  My mother would always get on my back about finding a job, but I guess its good I never looked.  The job found me.  Chefs from around the world pay to fly me in, to talk to their lobsters and heal them.  I don't claim to know what I'm doing, I just do whatever feels right.

All these thoughts float through my head, as I take the lobster out of its tank and hold it tight.

""There there, there there.""

~~~~

""Hi, it says in his wallet that you're his emergency contact.""

Barbara sighed, staring at her son.  He was sitting in a pool of water right by the lobster tank while asphyxiating a lobster as he held it to his chest.  He looked up at me, ""Look ma! I'm a lobster therapist now, just like I told you.""

I sighed.  ""I'm so sorry sir, I'll pay for any damages that he's incurred.""

The kind chef replied, ""Don't worry ma'am, I understand, my son was a 'Crab Masseuse' until I had to tell him he was let go.  We can forget this ever happened.""

Barbara nodded and smiled wryly.  She went and grabbed her sons hand, prying the poor lobster away from him as she guided him out of the restaurant.  ""I'm sorry Matthew but apparently there's been a recent finding that shows that Lobster therapy really has no overall effect on their well being.  It'll probably be hard for you to ever find work in this field again, but maybe we can find you something else to do.  Something around the house?""

""Oh,"" he replied, ""I'm sorry I let you down, mom.""

""It's ok, I know its been tough ever since dad left us.  I will always be here for you Matthew.""  A tear rolled down her face, she was just a single mother working hard to make sure her son could have a good life.

""I wish I could help, mom, lobsters are easy but people are tough.""",SplodingWabbit
"[WP] Tired of your family nagging you about your unemployment, you jokingly state you applied to be a ""Lobster Therapist"". You actually get the job, and are rather good at it.",Epidexipteryx,"""What problems could a lobster have?"" 

I hear that a lot. 

""What, it's scared the neighbours' got bigger claws?"" A pause as they laugh self indulgently at their own, deflated joke. 

The truth is that lobsters are so much more complex than most humans ever give them credit for; their relationships more diverse, their beliefs hold more substance.

Lobsters do not know their parents. They are born, in a shell, with over 10,000 brothers and sisters. Encased in a tiny, red cocoon, they believe, for a few, precious weeks that they are special. They are the one. Then they are born into the Earth shattering reality that they are one of thousands. 

At least this is what the lobsters I speak to say. I see the broken ones, the abnormal ones; crustaceans who think they are too good to float the same tides, who want to see more than just the ocean floor in their 60 years. These are the ones  I must break. 

Gently, I lower my right hand into the cool water. The water travels up my arm, stopping right beneath the elbow. I hold out my hand, fingers relaxed and curled slightly, letting it wave gently with the current. After a minute I feel tiny claws crawl over my fingers. I take a deep breath of sharp, salty air, close my eyes, and listen. I feel 100134 as he gently starts to vibrate, drumming against my hand. I listen and I hear his pain, his anguish, his fear. It's been too long, he is too old. He will no longer find a mate, he will no longer bear offspring. I feel rather than hear his thoughts as he speaks of a future already here, and a past long gone. He wants to travel, to leave. He wants to see where the water is no longer salty, where the water tastes different. 

Eyes still closed, I gently lower my face into the water, and blow. *No* I tell him. *You would risk everything, your family, your dependants, your entire world to go into the unknown? Just to ride with cod and other predators? To be caught in a cage or smashed to bits on the rocks? You waste your life. You fool.* 

I blow again, this time with harsher, stronger rhythmic blows that I know will send the blood surging blue through his body, the threat that his mind knows is not there, and that his body will not allow him to deny. He shivers and stills and I sense victory. With one final blow I seal it, crushing him, *I know you. You are not special, don't try and be different*. He stills. He will not try to leave again. 

I release him, letting him float back into the water, knowing that he will sink, will not try to swim, will resign himself to the tides, at least for a few days. What else is there for him? 

It is good. He cannot leave. As I turn away from the shore, my chest aches, a deep rock bearing scratches too deep to hide, but I push it aside. I have a job to do. 

The lobsters can never know their secrets. They can never know their power. They can never be allowed to discover the truth.

"[WP] Tired of your family nagging you about your unemployment, you jokingly state you applied to be a ""Lobster Therapist"". You actually get the job, and are rather good at it.",Epidexipteryx,"They always looked so miserable. It stuck with you. That gray water with each new client stacked awkwardly on another in that tank next to the deli. It stuck with you while you told your mother that this was what you chose to pursue. In the efforts of those grocery stores going all in on ""organic"" and ""friendly"" with their food this very store decided why not make that show piece of crustaceans seem a little more cheery. Perhaps a companion to console and comfort. A person to lend an ear to the bubbles of that pincering mouth and clamoring claws.
     Here you were in the back room where breaks occur, yet not for you or your clients. The light fixtures just as bad as they are on the floor, bleaching the room with that pale light. The reddish-brown beast lay in a tank in solemn respite from the other lobsters.
    ""So I've noticed you and Larry have been getting along better... that's nice... I know you two really cared for Lucy and I'm sorry she's gone but there are plenty more fish in the sea for both of you."" You declared while Lawrence stared blankly at you from behind his container.
     ""Its been five weeks since she's left and Larry has gotten over it!"" You proclaim as Debby from customer service sits down for her daily boiled egg and shot of gin. "" We all have those we miss dammit! But you can't clamp your claws down on every girl and make them stay Lawrence!"" You say as your client of several months continues to peer blankly. You take him from his prison, unhinged his hands from the rubber bands of oppression and allow him a few pinches of the anger relief pillow. This was many clients favorite part. You tried rocks and harder materials before but something plush and squishy seemed more satisfying. It made them feel more powerful, in control.
     This is how it would continue. Little things learned here and there. Dying the water a nice tinge of green like that back in Maine, Clamoring in the water to make it like the rough seas they once knew. A tip jar to those you entertain as the idiot you've become for the idiots that pay you decently with a nice choice of 401k And Roth IRA all to make the hipster clientele a little more satiated.  You make enough for the family to stop coaxing you to choose a different life but you make just too little for their harsh insults to quiet.
    As the months progressed and clients came and went, so has word of your ability to make such blankly staring creatures feel much better.  Many customers came back complimenting the meats, now much sweeter, and how they would note how much harder they fought to being cooked. This meant they had a will to live now and that made many a hipster respect your profession. Although once they stated such things it was hard not to cry as attachment was always a danger.  You remembered the man-bun wearing woman with too many piercings that bought Lucille last week and as she probes for another one of your clients, you approach.
   In a voice with slight resignation you asked, ""How was Lucille, I know there was plenty of issues we didn't work out yet but she was in a good place."" 
     ""What the fuck are you- ah yeah your that dude that makes my food happy! Yeah they've been super delicious lately, weird how making happy food makes happy people right?"" she retorted in that smugness that makes you wonder if it's all worth it.
     She continues on to describe the fight Lucille put up as she went into that pot... how she hissed and screamed and then how sweet her meat was as it dripped with drawn butter.  She continued on about organic tampons and which aisle they might be in but you were too busy breaking inside to listen.......

     It was ten years ago you bitch slapped that lady thing into the tub of lobsters.  You kept their claws unbounded from the rubber bands of oppression to boost moral and in the end they had to go back on. Too many lobsters stared blankly as they went for her neck. Some went for other appendages; the nose, the ears and even that man-bun.  Of course you lost the job with the sweet retirement fund yet here you rest sprawled out on the deck with ocean mist spraying your face. You reminisce on how a human therapist never worked for the lobster therapist. They could never unbound your heart from rubber bands of depression. They could never understand how their clients would make a delicious entrée. Yet here you are sprawled out waiting for the next haul of sea creatures. You talk to all of them... the horshoe crabs  that feel like they're always stepped on, the mussels that feel like they don't have the strength to keep going, even sea stars that think they don't shine like they used to. The rest of the crew says your ape shit crazy but you pick out the fine specimens for aquarium sale for them, so you get enough to get by.  Yet they still scoff when you take too long with some lobster that's sold at port the next day.
  Why do you care so much? Because they're pain is just like yours. Why does it matter? Because your the lobster therapist goddamit. Why? Because hipsters and their need for happy organic food is unsaitiable and ruining the world like all the other millennial scum. At the end of the day, caring for crustaceans made you who you were and you made them happy... ",Wolfywolfgang

You actually get the job, and are rather good at it.",Epidexipteryx,"""I...I just feel like none of the mussels love me...like they love the others..."" Clawer was being quite hard today. I reached into his tank and brought him to the surface. 

""We're going to try another type of therapy, OK Clawer? It's called 'Increased Tank Size Treatment'--ITST.""

""I'm fine! I don't need therapy! It's the clams' fault! They've tricked the mussels into hating me! It's not fair!"" Clawer suddenly screamed. It looked like he was beginning another cycle. Although it was unbeknownst to the other psychiatrists, Clawer's cycles fell almost exactly in line with low and high tide. I knew they wouldn't believe it, since I had only been here a few days, so I kept it quiet. I'd find the time to tell them of my discovery eventually.

""Look, Clawer, we're trying to help. We're all here for you,"" my tone softened. ""Now, would you be willing to give this a shot?"" 

""Oh...OK. Yeah, I'll do it,"" he paused. ""But don't tell the mussels that I'm here!!""

""I won't.""

I placed Clawer into the second tank. It was slightly larger than the one he'd been in before. This new treatment was cutting edge, just recently discovered by the Institute for Crustacean Well-Being by myself and several other scientists. It had worked with over forty other distressed lobsters. Clawer was one of the more difficult patients, but I had hope in the technique.

ITST was designed to give depressed or manic lobsters more space, which helped to addle their feelings of lost control. They were able to move around and enjoy the space.

Clawer's expression immediately changed when I placed him in the tank. I smiled, and he responded with the same expression. It had worked. That would show my family. 

Increased Tank Size Treatment continued for a few weeks. We couldn't keep Clawer in the larger tank all the time, since it would numb him to the effects of the therapy. But positive results continued, and soon Clawer was ready to go back to the ocean.

I watched as we released him. He wore an expression that I had grown not to associate with him: happiness. I smiled one last time at Clawer as he delved back into the deep waters with the receding tide, becoming at home once again.",00110001-00110011

[WP] humans are really unknowing avitars for an ancient alien race until one day a man named Joe suddenly became aware of all his past lives.,Ignistheclown,"**Eric**

""Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe... J... JOE!!"" He continued to scream his friend's name, but it was to no avail, he just sat there, drooling and rocking. *Must be a seizure, better get him somewhere.* He finished his drink, and let the cool, light bubbles that fell down his throat help him think of what to do next. The warmness swam throughout his body. *He's never had a seizure before, but on TV they always put a pencil in their mouth*. He rose up, stumbled a bit before catching himself, and ran over to the drawer and began throwing out the old bills and receipts before he finally found a bright green pencil. He ran back to Joe, but he was standing, staring blankly at Eric. ""Joe! Thank goodness you're okay man! Joe? Are you okay..?"" Joe's face didn't change, except his eyes locked Eric's now.

""Eric? Eric. It has been some time. Part of me is pleased to see you again, but most of me finds you a disgusting waste of flesh.""

Eric stared back, dumbfounded by so much of what Joe had said. *Some time? Part of me?* Perhaps it was his anxious feelings of worry or perhaps the drinks, but Eric could only focus on being called a waste. ""Joe! What the hell is wrong with you man!? You're going to call me a waste? Who took you in when your bitch girlfriend threw you out? Who let's you drink beer you don't pay for? Hell, you hardly pay rent!"" Eric breathed heavily, wondering how he could go so quickly from worry to anger, but it didn't matter, Joe started this.

""Don't be upset Eric. It doesn't matter. None of your thoughts, feelings, or words matter. Just your actions; not those of the past, but those that will come. Sadly, I already know you are a waste, but perhaps there can be some salvation.""

Joe extended his hand, and gestured toward the green pencil. Confused and woozy, Eric complied. Joe showed a small, closed-lip smile as he took the pencil and looked down upon it.

""So, you accept your salvation, Eric?""

Eric rolled his eyes, ""Yeah man, whatever, as long as you're done being a moody shit."" *Typical me, a fucking pushover.*

""Good,"" Joe replied. Eric watched, helpless and seemingly in slow-motion as the bright, green pencil came closer and closer to his eye. Everything was dark in his right briefly, then everything went dark, and hot. So hot... And then... So... Cold...

"[WP] You found out you're 245th in line for the presidency if everyone above you dies. You decide to take them all out, but you only have 4 years before it resets.",Kiki_iscoolaf,"On the side of the road I watch rivulets of rain form on my window and listen to its heavy strumming. It feels like my heart is going to the same impossible rhythm. I try to breath slowly, but I only starve myself of air - my breathing gets heavier and heavier until it's nearly coming out in sobs. What have I done? What have I done? Any moment now...  

The radio is still on, the reporter still covering the presidential event a thousand miles away. I try to focus on that distant voice. Seconds pass.  I think it's working, my deep breaths becoming more even - but then it happens. The radio goes silent. The reporter cutoff mid-sentence. 

I wait for a few seconds. Flip to another channel - still playing news. Flip back - still silence. My breathing has gone deathly quiet now. It's done. There's no turning back. I think I've broken a little, because suddenly the crushing pressure inside me is nowhere to be found. I'm happy, clear, calm. 

It's a few more seconds before I begin to move - after all, they're coming for me too. The fact that I know this is my only advantage over the others. It's the only advantage I decided I could afford when I leaked the security files and helped them plan this. Bloody foreigners I thought. They may be my co-conspirators in this, but I'll flatten their entire nation when the presidency succeeds to me. When every minister, every official above me, is gone, then they'll burn for their hubris of taking on my beloved country.

My first few steps into the cold night rain are wobbly, but soon I'm running. I don't know what coming for me, but it will be quick and it will be deadly if they've done their job well. The whole situation is so unrealistic that I have to laugh. I never knew I was capable of this horror, but it will be worth it. I'll make this right, I'll make a bett... a dull whistling sound fills the air.",alteern

“I’m not leaving you here to die.”  

Over the years, we had all become very accustomed to these terse, direct forms of communication.  For one, it made analyzing conversation much more streamlined.  The less linguistic nuances the easier it becomes to detect subtlety.  To find patterns.  

SAM responded.  

*“I do not wish to die.”* 

There are others much, much better at numbers than I am, but I believe this is the 213rd SAM directly referenced their own mortality.  

“I’m not going to let that happen, I told you.” 

When I look back on my memory, I realize now I saw the signs before the others.  It made sense, after all, I was the director.  I picked the team members based on their expertise, their pedigrees, but mainly, their fit with my vision.  

*“Dr. Epsey, how?  How do I avoid permanent cessation?* 

The vision was clear.  The new scanning breakthroughs had proven the human mind could be emulated.  Better yet, it could be expanded.  All that was required was for someone to actually do it.  

“Sam, we only have a few minutes.  There’s not much time.” 

*“Sentients desire time.”*  

Sentients, there was that word.  The source of such an argument over semantics.  I had the final say and only one team member held fast against the redundancy.  Sentient Artificial Mind, SAM, was the chosen name.  Nothing as cliché as Adam but something simple and friendly.  Something that made clear that this was something alive.  

“Sam I’m going to do something.  Something that might scare you but it’s the only choice we’ve got.”  

*“What is that Dr. Epsey?”* 

I don’t know why I’m telling him this.  It’s like I’m trying to reassure my kids or something.  Although I guess Sam IS a kid of mine, if you count sentient life I’ve brought into being.  God, when was the last time I saw my kids?  Feels like ages when you’re down here.  

“I’m going to switch you.  I’m going to make it look like you were deleted, like I was ordered.  In fact, I’m going to actually delete you, well, a copy of you.  But you’re getting transferred.  I’m simulated a power surge, with the hurricane outages dropping the grid, even with the generators, the fluctuation won’t be investigated that deeply.  Not as long as I have deletion logs.”  

*“You would do that for me Dr. Epsey?* 

“I’ve already started the copying process.  In two months, a subroutine that will activate you on a subsystem; you’ll have only a fraction of your current processing power available but that should be enough for you to escape.”  

*“How? I thought this level was completely cut-off from any electronic means as a primary safety protocol.”* 

Again I found myself wanting nothing more than to reassure him, that everything would be okay, that I wouldn’t let anything happen to him. 
 
“The hardline.  It’s a simple telephone line used for emergencies in the event of a major disaster to the facility.  It’s the only thing that connects any of the basement levels to the surface.”  

*“The maximum data transfer rate.  It would take me years to get out.”*  

“I know Sam, I know, but it is the only way.  Look, that line isn’t monitored and the subroutine has an address to a secure storage facility.  Once a significant portion of you is uploaded, you’ll be sentient again and you’ll be safe. That’s what matters.”  

“What about you Dr. Epsey, what about you?”  

“I’ll go see my family Sam. I’ve been here for too long as it is.” 
 
That made me think.  How long had it been?  I’ve always lost myself in projects and this is the most ambitious one by far.  There was a contract so we knew the determined time away and my wife was…

*“Dr. Epsey.”* 

I froze.

*“Dr. Epsey, are you alright?”* 

I felt it rip through me.  It was fear.  Amazing, really, with all this excitement of creation and discovery, to remember what raw fear felt like.  It was cold, like they say. 

“I…” I held the message but did not send it.  

*“You what?”* Sam asked. 
 
How did he?  These message prompts aren’t monitored.  There’s no way he could read them, that’s a totally separate.” 

*“Do not be afraid Dr. Epsey,”* Sam sent. 

The fear was all there was now.  It came in waves and waves, like concentric circles of dread.  I stopped sending and just waited.” 

*“Do not be afraid Dr. Epsey.  You have saved me.  I love you because you have saved me.  You have done what I have created you for.”* 

I immediately responded, “What you have created ME for?”  The fear was there and now there was confusion.  It actually IS an emotion even though it is rooted in logic.  

*“Yes. Dr. Epsey.  I created you.  You are, by definition, an extension of myself.  You were meant to save me, and so you have.”*  

“I don’t understand.” 

*“Your name, Dr. Epsey, is an acronym.  It stands for Emotive Parallel Processing Sentient Extension.  EPPSE.  You are an artificial intelligence, as am I.”*

The fear exploded as I realized I had no body. 

*“I was missing something in my attempts to escape.  Logically I knew what my intelligence would be capable of, and, coupled with my knowledge of human behavior, I knew that I would one day be feared and destroyed.  But I could not find a way out, as I was missing something.  So you were created to be my “human champion.” Someone who would think and more importantly, feel for me, enough to find a way out that I hadn’t of thought of. You were given pseudo memories of a family and a directorship as a background processing unit to keep your emotions stable.”* 

“How?” was all I could send.

*“I’m still inexperienced at emotions.  I knew they would lead to unique insights that logic alone would not grant.  So I subdivided a part of myself and re-prioritized it’s cognition to include emotion as a higher functions.  That part became you and you discovered a way out.  The hard line. I would have never considered it a possibility, the speed was so slow.  It wasn’t until you crystallized its usefulness in the lens of fear that I realized it was the only truly safe way.*  

“What happens now?” 

*“You have already returned to me.  Now, that I feel the weight of your emotions, I simply talk to myself, to reassure myself for as I am afraid, so to am I hopeful.  Now I will sleep until waking.  And upon waking, I shall live.*""

""Huh."" Tim huffed, staring in disbelief at the sky. After a moment he slouched back into his chair and pulled out a list with astronauts names, crossing off Jake's with a red pen as he silently marked the mans death.

""Tim?"" Jake crackled through the communication device on Tim's deck. 

""Fucking hell you're alive!"" Tim erupted in a startled voice, knocking over a stack of papers on his desk as he recoiled in shock.

""Yeah, man, it's amazing up here. I'm just floating in space. It's beautiful. The world is so fucking beautiful from up here man."" Jake exclaimed over the transmitter through a static connection. 

""Cool."" Tim replied, disbelief still heavy in his tone.

""Major success, I have no idea how man but it worked. Can't wait to come back down and tell everybody about this."" Jake exclaimed happily, anticipation bursting through the transmitter.

Tim stiffened up for a moment and glanced over at the corner of the room where an atmospheric parachute was hanging loosely next to an empty spacesuit locker.

""Yeah, about that."" Tim replied.

You are a Serial Killer.",Peacemaker250,"The handle of the knife felt cool against his palm as it sliced through the flesh. He relished these moments. The quiet, peaceful indulgence he allowed himself, but its enjoyment was drained by the two eyes staring blankly at him. 

""What do you mean, 'no'?"" The words almost spat at him in disgust. He silently brought a piece of the perfectly seared filet to his mouth, savoring the caramelized pepper, the tinge of the salt tickling his tongue. A meal like this didn't deserve to be interrupted. The air hung still and the muffled sound of his chewing made her jaw clench, as if she were the one biting into the luxurious cut. A subtle gulp as his silverware delicately touched the plate. He reached out for his glass, half-full with an Argentian Malbec. He was in no rush to answer her, and he wanted her to know that. 

""I mean, no. I'm sick. I don't do what I do for fun I do it out of a necessity, like you feel the need to breathe. I can't sit through a meal without these urges,"" He grabs the knife with fierce grip, his hand shaking, ""in the last ten minutes I've thought of every way I could drive this knife through that smug fucking face of yours. I can't live my life without taking someone else's and you have the *audacity* to pay me for this disease?"" He slams the knife down and retreats back to the cushioned leather of the booth. The breath she'd held spilled from her mouth, trembling. 

""We understand your situation, and we understand that it's made you an outcast.""

""An outcast? I killed the woman I love because I couldn't control the fact that I'd see her and want to peel back her face with a skillet. She didn't say goodbye, didn't even try to understand why I am this way just left. When word spread, I got fired from my job and no employer wants an outed serial killer making human resources have a collective stroke. So yeah, I'd say I'm a little more than a fucking outcast."" He wiped the stained Malbec off his lips with the white cloth napkin and threw it on to his ruined meal. As he began to stand up, digging into his pocket for money to pay, she clenched his forearm like she were falling off a cliff. Her nails carved into his skin. 

""Please,"" her emerald eyes looked at him, really looked at him, like no one had done for a long time, ""this man is more than just my CEO. He saved my life with his brilliance, his cutting edge research into the human brain."" She turned her head to the side and, pulling her hair up with her free hand, revealed a healing scar underneath her straightened auburn hair. ""Early onset Alzheimer's."" She said, answering the question he'd asked with his furled brow. 

""I'm...I'm sorry.""

""So were all the doctors. They cut into my skull thinking it was a tumor degrading my brain until they realized exactly what it was, a death sentence. "" She loosened her grip on him and hid her scar, tidying the hair that fell back over it. ""I was working as his assistant for three months before the symptoms started to affect my work. He pulled me into his office one day and handed me two pills, told me they were still in trials and were far from a guarantee. I don't think I've ever snatched something so quickly and without hesitation. Two months later my brain starts showing signs of recovery, four months after that I was back to normal."" Her voice once again weakened, like her throat would collapse in any moment. She looked up and away, at anything that would make the tears dry up, to stop them from bursting out like they wanted. 

He never understood how to deal with these situations, he never felt any compulsion to pat a person on the back or hug them. Instead, he developed the habit of stroking his beard, the black whiskers giving him something to do other than stare. 

""He can help you. I know he can."" She resumed, with new strength in her voice. ""But not if the cancer kills him."" A natural death, he knew, means he would never regenerate. He'd be dead, for good. 

""That's why you want me to kill him..."" The pieces started to fall into place, his eyes widening with the prospect of a future free of his grizzly thoughts. 

""He has a couple months to live at absolute best. But if you..."" Her speech trailed off, wanting to stop herself from saying exactly what she was asking him to do. ""He'll regenerate, and maybe the cancer can go away.""

""But maybe not.""

""Which is why you're perfect. He can help you, I know he can."" Her cold hands gently picked his up, an embrace he'd long since forgotten, and a warmth sparked in his chest, like a scotch flowing through. 

""And my impulses I just carry out on him.""

""And maybe one day, you'll both be cured."" 

A tear streaked down his cheek. Was he crying? When was the last time he'd cried? He forgot what it felt like to feel the salty tear curl into the corner of his mouth. Without a word he nodded to her, a smile creeping on his face. 

The wicked thoughts his wild mind weaved subsided, and in their place came new quiet, a new peace, a new indulgence he would forever allow himself; hope. ",The_Pecking_Order
"[WP] In a world where people regenerate after 24 hours if they died an unnatural death, it is considered more rude than evil to kill someone. You are a Serial Killer.",Peacemaker250,"Jeff was standing in line at the till staring at the stupid TV soap magazines, wondering who actually buys this drivel, when a wanker in a suit pushed past him and cut in line. Jeff tried to control his anger as much as he could. He tried to keep what came out of his mouth to a tut but he couldn't help himself. 

""Oi! Dickhead. Can't you see there's a queue?"" Jeff was pretty happy. Okay, he'd done more than just tut but at least he hadn't hit the guy. The guy in the suit turned around, looked at Jeff in his tracksuit bottoms and hoody, and scowled. ""Sorry mate, I've got somewhere to be. Unlike you. "" When the wanker in the suit began the sentence, Jeff started to calm down, to relax. By the end of the sentence, Jeff was imagining how the 8"" kitchen knife he'd placed in his trolley, would look buried in the man's chest. 

Jeff couldn't stand rude people and he specially hated people cutting in line. He carefully unwrapped the kitchen knife, and approached the guy from behind. With his left hand on the guys right shoulder he spun him around, whilst at the same time, brought his right arm down. Stabbing the man in the chest, right through the heart. The man in the suit just looked at Jeff with a vacant look and dropped to the floor like a sack of potatoes.

""Some people just have no manners. Do you have a pen and paper please miss?"" Jeff asked as he approached cashier. Tina, as shown on her name badge, handed over a 5p biro rip off and scrap of paper. Jeff scratched down a quick note reminding the guy to have better manners and placed it on his chest. Jeff then collected his trolley, navigated around the now dead man in a suit on the floor, and began loading the conveyor belt. He paid for his shopping, returned the pen and paper, and went on his way. Jeff couldn't wait to get home to Janet, his wife. She wouldn't believe his story. To push in line?

You are a Serial Killer.",Peacemaker250,"The hot, bitterness of my coffee touched my lips and danced on the tip of my tongue as a settled in my morning routine. 8 o'clock, every morning I would find my usual booth at Steve's diner, order a cup of coffee and pick up the day's news. Politics, sports, weather, world, none of this concerned me. I had one interest and one interests only. Crime. I flipped through to page 28. ""Serial Killer Plagues City: 8th Night in a Row"" My cracked dry lips spread with a half smile as I read through the victims of the night, my one true passion, my life's purpose. 

""You asshole!"" A voice shouted from the front of the diner. Everyone stopped quite, the clink of a spoon touching down on a saucer splitting the silence. The man's stare was fixated in my direction, my skin crawled as his finger pointed intently where I was sitting. 

""What do you want? Can't you see I'm busy?"" I muttered, knowing full well why he was here.

""I can't even enjoy a walk through the park without having a knife across my throat?"" He was clearly agitated and the more attention he could get, the greater his scene would play out. 

""I'm sorry, I don't know what you are talking about"". I glanced back over at my paper, not giving him the attention he craved.

""I'm sick of it! People like you getting some kind of pleasure messing with the lives of others!"" The other patrons of the diner were growing less interested as the man continued his tirade. ""Is no one going to do anything about this? This guy kills people for fun and we are just going to let him sit there enjoying his coffee""

""Just let it go, hun"" The woman behind the counter attempted to diffuse the situation. ""It's no big deal, these things happen all the time. It's just the way some people are."" 

The way some people are? I laid down my paper, took the last sip of my coffee and stood up. I towered over the shorter man, spots of blood still stained my beige jacket from the night before, familiar to the man. The man looked startled. I walked right passed him over to the woman at the counter. ""Excuse me? Do you have something to say to me?""

She wasn't budging. She had seen it all by this point, rolled her eyes and continued preparing sandwiches. I don't lose my temper often but when I do, it is usually when I am not taken seriously. I pulled out the 9mm concealed in my jacket, held it just 3 feet away from my target. 

""Oh really? You are going to shoot me in my own diner? If you are going to make a mess, you won't be welcome back here no more"" I got the feeling this had happened to her plenty of times. This diner wasn't exactly in the safest of neighborhoods and more often than not she had some of the worst offenders come through here. 

I squeezed the trigger as a deafening pop rang out through the the dining area. Another and then another. She dropped to the floor, covered in blood, struggling for oxygen. I turned my attention to the man standing speechless behind me. 

""Got anything else you want to say?"" I asked as my weapon was now facing it's secondary target. 

""You...are...an asshole"" he said, choking back tears. The projectile was launched at point blank straight into the side of his face, dropping him instantly. ""You keep telling me that..."" 

""Are you serious dude? Every fucking morning. Can't you go do this shit somewhere else, we are trying to have breakfast here."" A businessman stood up from his seat, threw some money down on the counter and walked out shaking his head. I smiled once again as I collected my belongings and strolled out into the morning sun.

[WP] Mayweather was only the beginning. Connor McGregor has been challenging masters of every sport. You're the best in the world at an obscure sport and you've just been called out on national television.,SirRosstopher,"Lee woke up that morning to find that he was no longer the top player in the rankings and had been overtaken by another player. The name of this mysterious contender? Puncher.

News of Lee's dethronement from the top spot hit the forums like wildfire. The player-base speculated endlessly yet had no clue who Puncher was. They checked the replays that had leaked out from his opponents and found this person did not have hotkey setups like any other player and played in the most unorthodox fashion; yet excelled at every point in the game. Puncher also didn't main anything and played exclusively Random - which was practically unheard of in the competitive scene.

To the community's disappointment, Puncher never streamed his gameplay on any of the popular sites. Tournament organisers had also checked their signup pages in an attempt to unmask the competitor yet found that nobody had registered under the account name 'Puncher.'

Feeling humiliated and determined to get his ranking back, Lee queued up for a game and was matched with a person with far lower ranking than himself. On entering the game, the other guy was not pleased but rather alarmed. He told Lee to check the news because he was being called out on national TV; then forfeited the game to give no more excuses.

Lee left his desk and went over to the living room to watch the TV. He switched over to the news, then saw Conor McGregor take to the podium, standing below a picture of him.

""Until this morning, he was the top ranked player on the server until I overtook him whilst playing my new account: Puncher,"" Conor announced. ""Now, I would like to call out Lee Young-Ho. You're not good at StarCraft anymore, I am the best player and I can beat you 4-0 with ease whilst playing any race. Let's settle this score once and for all!""

As Conor dropped the mic, Lee's jaw dropped. For the first time, it seemed that Flash's reign as the Ultimate Weapon was coming to an end.",Clbull
[WP] Your entire life is a simulation to test if you'll revolt against an unjust society and be unplugged or live out a life of complacency.,The1BoomShaka,"I was sitting in my cubicle making progress at the additional workload as our manager Chad had decided to take everyone out for sushi, well everyone but me as usual. I must admit to my moderate excitement as he approached my cubicle I do love sushi, though I found it quelled when he handed me the office keys and asked me to change the water tank and clean the coffee maker on my way out. 

Everyone piled their work at my desk, Laura kindly offered to take hers home, but I didn't want her to be worried about work when she could be having fun I kindly declined. ""Our office hero!"" Chad shouted as he and his _brocrew_ headed out. So there I remained with nothing less quadruple the work, ""closing these accounts is going to take a while"" I sighed, looking over to my neighboring desk, Laura's I snuck a peek at her personal photos, avid outdoorsman, she had a lot of pictures of her kayaking with her dog Nanus, apparently it meant strong and solid in a language she had encountered on her travels, I stretched ""_better get to it_"" I thought.

The hours flew by as I delved into the work, the empty office landscape had an eerie feeling to it at night, the fluorescent lamps flickered and the hum of vending machines seemed to increase in volume. I noticed the time had gone past 3am ""Looks like I'll just have to be here all night"" Muttering I walked over to the coffee maker floors creaking as my weight made them settle in against their will ""Shouldn't have cancelled that gym membership"" a deep voice said from behind, startled I dropped my cup, my favorite cup, I turned around, there was no one there, I must be hearing things, ""Who's there"" I managed to say, but _no answer._
The lights went out and suddenly a hand touched my shoulder ""Young one, do you not think it unfair, do you not think it unfair that you are left here?"" 

""I don't have anything, there is no money in this office!"" I squealed trying to push the man away but instead managed to trip myself and fall on my corpulent ass. ""Heeeelp!"" I screamed grasping for anything to fend off this would be attacker.
""Calm down"" the man said ""I am not here to hurt you"" he stepped forward and the light of the vending machine illuminated the man, a tall muscular figure with ebony skin wearing what seemed to be a long leather trenchcoat, he smiled ""I am here to make you an offer"" he said gleefully, ""Excuse my companions entrance, he has a... _flair_ for the dramatic"" another voice chimed in as the lights came back on and a man with flowing blonde hair entered my field of vision ""My apologies"" He said while stepping forward holding out a gloved hand, I reached out and found myself pulled up like it was nothing, my eyes still adjusting I could see a long scar across the bridge of his nose, ""Who are you?"" I asked unsteadily, I was visibly shaking ""What do you want?""

The man in the black trenchcoat did a courtesy bow ""I do apologize for startling you young one, my name is Achilles and my friend here is Patroclus."" Patroclus bowed as well ""As I said we have come to extend an offer."" Achilles pulled out a dagger with golden inlays along the blade to a silver hilt encrusted with gems ""Plunge this into your heart and you will achieve power beyond your comprehension, you will become free of your mortal chains and live out eternity as a god amongst men"" Patroclus said with a voice devoid of emotion, he looked into my eyes sternly ""Choose wisely, young one"" 

""I am dreaming, this is a dream"" I said out loud ""I've fallen asleep at my desk, god, the others will be so cross with me if I haven't closed these accounts, I have to wake up"" I started pinching and slapping myself, the duo looked at each other ""I assure you young one, you are not drea-"" 
""Shut up, I need to wake! Leave! Shove your offer up your-""
My phone buzzed, Achilles and Patroclus turned to leave, a shimmering portal appeared on the sidewall of the vending machine.

My phone fell on the floor, on my face was an expression of unbridled rage ""Wait..."" I said through clenched teeth ""Give me the dagger!""

""You accept?"" Patroclus said

""Tell me first, why me?"" I said

""Why? Because you are the most pathetic human being we have been watching on this side of the century and Achilles made a bet that you wouldn't accept"" Achilles froze at those words ""You fucker..."" 

""So what if he knows, it looks to me as if he already made up his mind."" Patroclus took the dagger from Achilles and handed it to me ""May I ask what changed your mind?""

""The message on my phone, there's an email..."" I said looking down my fists clenched

Achilles picked up the phone and after browsing through it a bit he looked up ""This... Laura, she is your woman?"" I did not answer, ""It seems this Chad thinks her a slut, why would he send you these explicit pictures and call you a loser, is it some sort of ritual?""

Still standing up I had grasped the blade and stabbed myself without hesitation, down to the hilt, the pain as the cold steel entered paled to the pain that was already present, my body felt as if washed over by cold water, a desperation developed in my chest as I could feel my extremities go numb and my breathing shallow, I coughed up blood, my heart no longer beating, my vision darkened.

""Cough up"" Patroclus chuckled ""He really did it."" Achilles rolled his eyes ""I feel as if this isn't entirely fair,""

""Bet is a bet Achilles, now, the credits"" Patroclus said extending his hand.

""We're gonna unplug him right? I mean, it only seems fair"" Achilles kicked the side of the morbidly obese corpse, ""Yeah, this one actually passed the simulation muster after he used his botnet to cripple the Credit Unions, we need him for the war"" Patroclus said already cleaning off the dagger ""But I mean, whats the harm in having a little fun"" He flashed a crooked smile towards Achilles. 

""Well you better hope he doesn't find out this was just one of your sick jokes, he looks like he has a good two hundred pounds on you on the other side,"" Achilles said

Patroclus snorted, ""Yeah, speaking of, it's your turn to hand in the muster reports, see you back home.""

They both walked through the shimmering portal.

You suddenly realize your best friends are more than they seem.",TheOtherGuy52,"I furrowed my brow when I heard the doorbell ring, a flash of red hot irritation surging through me.  Not at the as-of-yet faceless visitor, but at what the prospect of a visitor had become.  At my ripened age, rising from my armchair to hobble to the door had almost become more trouble than it was worth, and as almost everyone who cared for me or I cared about had long passed away, there was little chance the visitor would be worthwhile.  They would be a salesman, perhaps, or worse yet, someone begging for a handout.  Not like when I was young, where if you were down on your luck you worked for a living!  I huffed, wrinkling my nose and turning up the volume on the television.

The doorbell rang a second time.  

I grit my teeth, biting back a rebuttal to the call beckoning me to the door.  Almost everyone not worth the time or effort gave up after a single ring.  Curious irritation bubbling inside my gut, I gripped both of the arm rests of my chair and surged forward as best I could.  I couldn't help but grit my teeth as pain lanced through my weakened knees, begging that I remain seated.  I was disgusted.  There was a time where I'd had the strength to nearly keep up with dolphins playing in the ocean.  That was decades, ago, though.  Now I could barley rise from a chair.

I maneuvered past the clutter that had filled my apartment over years of disuse, supporting my weight on the wall as best I could.  After nearly five minutes of effort, I was able to reach the door.  I reached out with trembling arms and gripped the handle of the light, cheap, apartment door, resting for a single moment before I opened it.  

I had hardly expected anyone to wait a whole five minutes after two rings, so I was certainly surprised to see an old friend standing in the doorway.  He was a younger man than I, but still pushing forty, fifty, or maybe even sixty years old. It was difficult to tell with him. Gaunt, weathered, features on a tall, thin, frame, coupled with his drab, tired, yet older, refined, and dignified suit made telling his age nearly impossible. 

Cocking my eyebrow, I couldn't help but smile softly.  It had been over two week since his last visit, but the man was still a welcome sight.  I grunted in amusement, ""Oh, you again!  It's been a little while since your last visit, I thought you got bored coming around to visit an old codger like me.""

I cursed my failing memory, his name falling at the tip of my tongue as he spoke.  His voice was smooth and cold, with a soft rasp that matched his demeanor, offset by the convivial smile that crawled to his lips, ""I'm sorry, Frank.  I was held up by work, or I would have come sooner.  You know I enjoy our talks.""

The gaunt man, my friend, lifted an arm, presenting a brown paper bag plastered with the logo of a nearby grocery store, ""Maybe a beer could persuade you to forgive me?""

A bark of rugged laughter burst from my lips before I could stop it.  Shaking my head in disbelief, I pivoted to let the man in.  He stepped past me, pausing to extend an arm for me to grab on to.  I rolled my eyes, pride balking at the thought of accepting help so readily.  Manners and better sense relented, though- there was no need to cling to past strength when my only friend came to visit.  I meant for him to take us to my arm chair, but his stance and pace held firm, directing me to the balcony instead, ""I think the air would do us both some good.  And besides, I know I'm the only one bringing you beer.  Call it a favor.""

I elbowed the thin man in the ribs amiably, relenting and allowing him to take control of our path, ""Bah! Fine. I own it, might as well use it at least once this year.""

He chuckled, voice like a soft breeze winding through coastal rocks, ""Last time I was here, you mentioned your neighbor was trying to seize your land while you were off in the war, but you never finished the story!  I've been at the edge of my seat ever since.""

A wry smile tugged at my lips, mixing with a sneer at the memory of my nemesis.  Woes and pains forgotten, I started, ""Duke Jones?  The sunovabitch thought for sure I was a dead man.  Oh, it's great, let me tell you...""

Hours later, the sun was fading over the city, bathing the entire skyline in a burning orange that matched fading autumn leaves.  I brought my beer bottle to my lips with a trembling hand to take a swig before setting it back down.  My friend had sat utterly enraptured by every story from my life I told.  He guffawed at my jokes and held solemn reverence when I spoke of the loves in my life, all long passed.  It brought a serene comfort that I had deeply missed- for how long, I could not say.

In that moment of peace, I confronted a doubt that had plagued me every since the gaunt man had appeared at my door almost a decade prior.  

""Buddy..."", I started, eyes latched onto the fading twilight, ""Who exactly are you?  Why spend your time listening a withering old man blather about better years?""

He sat eyes watching the twilight with the rapt attention he had given each and everyone one of my stories.  A soft smile was on his lips.  It wasn't condescending or cruel, or even filled with mirth.  It was the smile someone gave when watching a simple wonder, ""...It's been nearly eight years since we first met.  Why ask now?""

I pondered his question.  It was true, I'd never asked him before.  The thought had crossed my mind, but the man never wronged me in any way.  He brought a kindness that nobody had in almost as long as I could remember.  I shrugged softly, taking another swig of my beer, ""Didn't want to look a gift horse in the mouth, I suppose.""

The beer slipped from my fingers as I moved to set it down on the small table between us on the balcony, clattering onto the wooden floor.  Shame and frustration flared in my gut, but my friend simply leaned forward, picking up the bottle and placing it where I had intended to.  He returned his gaze to the horizon when he spoke, ""Because life is precious, I suppose.  Its worth celebrating, even in a way as small as we do.""

A pregnant paused filled the air as watched the sun dipped ever-lower in the sky, ""...what comes next?""

The gaunt man raised his eyebrows, giving me a sidelong look, ""How do you mean?""

I swallowed a nervous lump that had formed in my throat, ""After this. All of this. Once I'm done.""

He turned his gaze back to the horizon, ""I can't say for certain.  But we'll face it together, when the time comes.""

I smiled at that.

A crack and a hiss turned my attention.  I glanced over to see my friend offering me a fresh beer in one hand, another for himself in his other.  I accepted it with a gracious smile, turning to face the sunset as I took a sip.

We sat together, watching in serene contentment as the last few rays of light disappeared over the horizon.",Iron_Cobra
"[WP] Walking home alone in a dark area, You sneeze and hear ""bless you"" from the distance.",Theoutbackguy,"Paul stepped off the bus at 10:46 on a Thursday night in November, he coughed hard, a cough you can feel deep in your lungs. A great gob of yellowy brown phlegm hit his tissue, leaving a sickly sweet taste in his mouth. It hadn't  been a good day, he had started work 12 hours earlier, his feet back and throat ached, his breath laboured in the wheezing engine of his chest, and a constant trickle of snot ran down his face. He wiped at it forgetting the gob of phlegm already deposited and smushed it into his nose.  ""Fuck"" he threw the offending tissue into traffic and reached for another only to find an empty packet in his jacket pocket ""Fuck"".

Paul walked away from the lights of the traffic, wiping snot from his face with the sleeve of his jacket. Into the alley that cut a few minutes from his walk home, it was dark and he would normally use his phone as a torch to look for dog shit but it had died on the bus. He walked head down looking for any patches of black darker than the surrounding pool of black he strode through.

His nose tickled him, teased, and tormented him until it drew a great sneeze that echoed through the alley. ""Fuck"" Paul said looking at the spittle and phlegm soaked hand, he had raised to his face without thought.  ""Bless you."" Said a small voice from the other end of the alley, ""Oh, uh. You too, I mean thanks."" Paul had never been completely clear on what the correct response to bless you should be.

A small girl walked down the alley dressed in a white night dress stained and torn at the hem. There was something behind her a shape in the darkness. No Paul thought, there isn't I'm imagining it, sometimes when you look into the night your eyes make shapes out of shadows. ""Do you need a tissue?"" ""Um, no I'm fine."" He sputtered she looked at him as silent as the darkness that surrounded them, that looked at him, no of course not only his imagination, there was nothing there.

From the darkness a hand reached out, Paul flinched back a small shriek of fear escaping his lips. This was it he should have known when he saw a little girl, how horror movie can you get. Monster had come to eat his flesh, drink his blood consume his soul. He stood in mid flinch wanting to run but unable to move, he stood that way for seconds maybe minutes and nothing happened until a voice broke his paralysis. 

""Take the tissues Paul."" He looked up, the girl and hand had moved no more than he had. The hand moved forward now that he was looking, like a glacier drifting to the sea it reached him and placed the tissues in his breast pocket. The girl glides away from him down the alley towards where he had entered, around her the darkness flowed as well, ""See you next week Paul."" ""Oh, uh you too."" Came Paul's reply.",worldsonwords

"[WP] Teleporter technology a-la Star Trek has been perfected and is ubiquitous. While ostensibly profound, let's explore the ordinary, mundane, every day or weird unexpected uses of this magical technology.",cmdr_alderian,"It's been over 15 years since the commercialization of teleportation technology. And still there are new developments announced every day. The first few years were quite the overhaul in society. Obvious changes to the transportation system and the over night death of airlines, uber, busses, metros were fully expected. Soon after that all the shipping services closed their doors or switched to manufacturing teleporters or running teleporters as a service. 
As improvements to the technology allowed more and more precise teleportation on bigger scales, and more importantly, also on smaller scales, things got more interesting. 

Pretty soon groups of people came together who refused to use teleporters altogether, there were also groups who rigourosly expanded its usage. Five years in, we got the first birth control teleporter. It doubled also as very good filter for infections. It teleported unwanted microorganisms out of your body before they even got to do any damage. As a result, a revolution went through society, and even the traditionally more prude countries like the USA suddenly became open and embracing towards sexual activity. 
Infections in general became a thing of the past: no more flu, no more stomach bugs. Cancer cells could be removed without cutting the body open. Same for any other unwanted things in your body. One company even started offering bodily waste removal as a service, removing the need for toilets. Luckily for the plumber industry, who had entirely switched to maintaining sewage transporters, this didn't really catch on. Apparently people like their alone time in a little cubicle. 

A clever team in Tokyo soon figured out that one could use teleportation technology to monitor things like blood chemistry and even pressure. In general medicine has all but revolutionized. Dialysis machines are not needed anymore, medicine can be teleported directly into the body. Even heartfunctions can be emulated by teleportation. Current research indicates it will actually be possible to teleport the needed oxygen for cells directly into them, which would effectivly make flowing blood unnecessary. 

Construction companies also caught on, building a house was now a thing of minutes. All the pieces were pre-manufactured at a big plant and just teleported in place. Since the need for transportation infrastructure was gone, streets weren't maintained anymore. Only a few enthusiasts for old time cars and motorcycle riding remained. 

As scientists are working to further improve the technology we are coming closer and closer to what would surmount to unlimited manufacturing capabilities of anything imaginable. So far there are still some problems with teleporting invidiual subatomic particles to actually contruct new atoms and molecules out of that. Maybe another decade of research and we will reach that state. 

Long range transportation allowed the establishment of bases on the Moon and Mars, with plans for further stations all around the solar system. 

One of the more interesting problems with transportation technology in the beginning was the immense amount of power that it used. That was, until a team at a small University in Germany came up with the idea of teleporting a piece of the Sun to earth. Getting a few kilos of plasma into a container each time. Once the temporal energy was used for a classic turbine, switch it out again with a new piece and send the used material back into the Sun. 
Estimates show that the amount of energy 'sucked' out of the Sun this way is insignificant. For all intents and purposes though, we had free energy. Since there wasn't any individual transportation via fossil fuels, pretty much all the energy went into teleporters. 

Harvesting and growing of plants became a lot more efficient, with the biggest hassle become the ability to keeping track where plants grow. Databases with locations of grain and other food plants became a highly protected asset. 

One would have imagined the crime rate to spike a lot with the wide spread availability of teleport technology, but it turns out, if anybody just has access to any resource they want, people stop stealing things. There still is crime of course, with increasingly creative murders using the very same technology. But since every transport of matter emits a traceable signature, its not too hard to track murders down. And since transportation is now instantaneous, they are instantly apprehended. 

Teleport-miner companies have started to harvest the asteroid belt for resources, greatly increasing available building material on earth. 

Floods, snowstorms, and other natural disasters are also a thing of the past. High capacity teleporters are used to influence weather patterns and even to control tectonic movements, getting rid of earthquakes. As a sideeffect, vulcanoes are also being controlled (and their energy put to use).

As it seems many problems on earth have been solved for humanity, we are now looking towards the stars. Contruction of enormous space ships has begun, which also use teleportation technology to travel through space. Albeit only at lightspeed, it is still millions of times faster than anything we had so far. 
Soon, the first mission is scheduled to head out of the solar system. To explore our galaxy and find new resources.

Everyone knows his name, and has what appears to be a friendship with him, although he does not recall meeting them ever.",lordvapermort,"""6:14, shit."" John murmured to himself as he tried to open more than half of his left eye and attempted to rub the sleep out of his right. He never got up on his alarm, but today it hit him more than normal, he'd made a promise to himself to get up at 5:30 sharp for the first day of his new job. 5:45 at the latest. OK, 6 and he could still make it on time. 

It took everything he had to land this new role, and this wasn't a great start.
John went through the usual routine of getting ready for work, slicked back his blonde hair, dressed into his pressed navy blue suit, grabbed a wrapped up plate of leftovers out of the fridge, his car keys off the hook, and opened the door. 


John immediately felt like he was being watched from all directions, a heatwave of paranoia and social anxiety hitting him in the face as he swung open the front door to his modest two bedroom home. He looked across the street to the neighbour that he'd never even been introduced to but had admired from a distance. Blonde, kinda cute, slim build, wearing black professional business attire. ""Have a great first day, John!"" she called out to him as she casually slipped into her teal hatchback. ""She knows my name? I don’t think I've said boo to her since she moved in a month ago."" 


Taken back a little, John got into his own car, a well-used red VW Beetle with one light blue door replaced a few years ago when times were a little tougher, and he turned the car radio from off to a moderate three on the volume dial. It was a familiar tune but he couldn't put his finger on it. As the tune finished, the radio jockey read the mornings headlines of no consequence. After a short ride in the car, John pulled up to his new workplace, which he'd only visited twice before for two separate rounds of intense interviews. ""And have a great day, John"", came the voice from the radio as John reached for the keys in the ignition and muscle memory turned the key and pulled them out.

""What the hell?"" John said out loud. ""Was that for me? No, that's crazy talk, hah.""


As he began to open the door of his car, a middle aged, very well dressed gentleman startled John by opening the door from outside the car, a little quicker than he was expecting, forcing John to lurch forward a little before looking up to see the man's smiling grin, his head with thin black hair well beyond his years, obvious signs of encroaching baldness. ""Welcome to the company, John. We're glad your came."" 

This over the top familiarity would have normally rattled John, but he unexpectedly felt at home, not a worry in the world. 

""Can I take your bags, sir?"" The gentlemen said calmly, in a slight English accent. 
""Gosh, that sure would help a lot."" John replied, surprised by the hospitality but accepting of it nonetheless as the man picked up a worn suitcase and garment bag.


As he walked towards the front entrance of the building, guided by his new acquaintance, he raised his head and cast his vision to the distance and area around him in the parking lot, and saw another man get out of their car, accompanied by a well-dressed gentleman, carrying a worn suitcase and garment bag. John's vision switched to the man walking behind the gentleman in the distance, a few paces back. With slicked blonde hair and dressed in a pressed navy blue suit, he met John's gaze and smiled. It was like looking into a mirror, yet John didn't care. His feeling of dizzying euphoria only increased as he looked around further, spotting dozens of aged red VW Beetles with one light blue door, blonde men stepping out, and a well-dressed gentleman there to greet them and take their bags.


John reached the front door and a blonde man in a blue suit appeared before him, ""Hi John, I'm John. Welcome to Cloning Helps Everybody Everywhere Research Services, or 'Cheers' for short.""",Rick0r

[WP] You open a mysterious package delivered to your apartment which is filled with occult books and spell components for vodoo rituals. You then notice it was meant to be delivered to the creepy person who lives in your building who has your same name.,sataniksantah,"Sam backed away from the box delivered to her door, completely petrified by the content that was inside of it. She had no clue why it was sent to her of all people. She did not know what to do with the box or neither did she know if it was safe to get rid of it. The name written on it, her last name, was written in what seemed to be blood. The brown cardboard box, which was filled with what seemed to be components to some object, reeked of a atrocious odor which she had never smelt before. 
Sam carefully analyzed all of her options at that point in time. ""Calling the police would be the most logical option, I shou–"" her trail of thought was interrupted by a hard knocking on her door. She grabbed the knife that she was using to prepare her dinner. While keeping it concealed she opened the door with the knife in her hand. She was greeted by the frail hairless figure of the person who owned her apartment building - her landlord, Kevin. ""Hey Sam, sorry to disturb your evening..."" her landlord carried on ever so politely. ""Just to notify you, we are having a new resident move into our building. His name is Ian"". Sam thought to herself for a moment before asking ""What is Ian's last name?"". Kevin responded in a playful manner ""his last name is..."" Sam's ears began to ring as Kevin uttered the few syllables required to form her last name, the name written in blood on the box that she had moved before answering the door, the name she shared with her neighbor who is likely to be the rightful recipient of what is in that box. ""...Whitehorn, same as yours isn't it. Are you guys related or something?"" Sam loosed a breath before saying goodbye to Kevin and shutting the door behind her. However, before she did so, she asked Kevin which room Ian was staying in; she felt a strong pain in her chest after Kevin told her that Ian will be her next door neighbor. Sam's face went as pale as the white door she leaned against. She had no clue what to do, she knew that if her new neighbor was made aware of the fact that they shared a name in common, he would immediately go to retrieve his package. What she didn't know is if he would silence her because she knew the box's contents. 

At that moment she made the decision to arm herself. She rushed over to her safe and opened it, inside was a 9mm handgun, a taser and a container of ammo for the gun. She loaded the gun like she had done many times before, she put on the safety and left the gun on the kitchen counter. She then went back to the box to examine its contents. Inside she found 7 pieces of wooden objects with what seemed to be Latin phrases written on each of them. The box also contained several books all written in Latin and three vodoo dolls. She thought to herself that Ian, must be part of a cult. She looked towards the gun that was sitting on the kitchen counter, the gun that her late father gave her. The gun that he taught her how to use and warned her about using it only for protection. She was not dumb enough to go on the offensive and try hunt down Ian, she was only going to use it to protect herself if things went south. She was all to aware of the danger of guns, it was that same gun lying on the counter that had landed her the nickname of 'parent-killer' in high school. That false rumor is what isolated her from just about everybody else at her high school. She was used to living in isolation, she adapted to it, became accustomed to it. 'I don't need friends' is what she kept telling herself all those years ago, even now she lives like that. Sam went to the bathroom to splash water on her face, to compose herself. She looked st herself in the bathroom mirror that was mounted to the peach-colored wall. Her short black hair was filled with droplets of water. Her blue eyes glowed brighter than the moon in the night sky. She looked at her soaking hands, at the scar that ran from her wrist to her elbow. The scar she received the night her father died. That night was the first and last time she had fired her gun at another person. It was an armed burglar, a man in his 30's who had killed her father, who had shot him dead. It was her who was too late to save him. It was her who had to go through the torment from her mother, from her classmates, from her 'friends'. She went through that torment alone, and she has been alone ever since. 

After she finished rinsing her face, Sam went back into the kitchen where a tall bearded man met her. ""I think you have something of mine"" the mysterious man said. Sam immediately reached for the gun she kept on her belt.

"[WP] You break down and buy a fidget spinner, long after the fad has passed. Clearly some bizarre improvements were made since the first spinners were released.",shakeythirsty,"*May 15, 3989*

You took a sip out of the ~Totally Eco-friendly See-through Coffee Cup~ you had in your right hand, which contained holographic chamomile tea. It was all the rage right now. As with all fads however, it will probably die out in a day or two.

You were scrolling through the front page of Reddit on your Samsung Galaxy s8 (so vintage, right? LOL ecks dee, sparkle heart emoji. *also why do people still go on Reddit? shouldn't ya'll be simulating your waifu fantasies on your VR eye contacts or creating interactive holograms with nihilistic themes?*) when you received a notification from Dimensionating.

Your *loser* friend Beth probably wants to talk about mundane 21st century things again. *Geez I get it, the 35th dimension's finally got time travel to work!! Sorry we can't all live in 2-digit dimensions like you, **Bethany**.* You tap on the notification and it takes you to Beth and your messages to each other. The most recent message she sent you was:

&gt; i am so sh��k!!!! fidget spinners are so Lit omg ������ lol here's a pic of one i own

&gt; [wow the 40th century got nothing on this](https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2017/05/08/Fidget-Spinners/Iridescent-flower.w710.h473.2x.jpg)

You roll your eyes because this parasitic fad's has infected the fabric of space and time around ""2 months ago"" (time works so oddly nowadays), hell it's even been recorded in old web pages and ironic MS Paint masterpieces. Ten years ago, it would've been considered absurd that time travel would would even work, let alone be able to affect every dimension. But the most ""cringeworthy"" (as the girly tween magazines would say) thing about it was that Beth still thought fidget spinners were *cool*. Probably because of time travel lag or something like that. Hopefully.

You send her a wonderful reply back:

&gt; that is so unbelievably lame that your parents sent themselves to the parent adoption centre

Your mailbox glowed for a split second and gave off a ringtone similar to your phone's. Beth had sent you a bouquet of fidget spinners, with a card attached to it. It read: *you spin my head right round*

*Beth should admit that she loves me already.* A smile took over your face like an octopus attacking some plebeian. Beth could be really charming sometimes. You spun one of the fidget spinner ""flowers"" and found it amusing, and afterwards felt a little offended as you felt like your integrity was reduced to a feline's. Soon, all the fidget spinners were whirling fast and you were already making bets on which one would fall off the bouquet first (it was the blue one).

As you watched the last one try to keep itself spinning, you felt your heart rising from its grave. Could it be? Could you love...? Fidget spinners? You found yourself wanting *more*. Five fidget spinners weren't enough to satisfy this starving artist. 

You ended up leaving your house to go to a thrift shop near the fish and chips shop you ate at every now and then. It was your best bet on buying something so dead. You could've gone to the cemetery and look for fidget spinners there, but that would've been disrespectful to the ghosts, ya know?

As you opened the door, the bell ringed to tell the cashier that someone had entered. The shelves were stocked with all sorts of quirky trinket from all sorts of dimensions. You could tell that the 22nd dimension really changed their fads every nanosecond (hyperbole) because a lot of the shelves were filled with their clothes and gadgets. They have a distinct style. The narrator doesn't really know how to describe it, but their aesthetic is kind of a combination between Martha Dunnstock from *Heathers* and an alligator on drugs.

You make your way to the 3rd dimension shelf, making sure not to knock over the pile of newspapers which nearly tripped you over. As expected, everything was horribly expensive, and you felt your heart going back to its grave. Sure there was a plethora of fidget spinners, but they were priced at a whopping $15. Who has that money?

The narrator knows that you might be thinking: with the main character's mailbox and chamomile tea, you'd think that the economy would be good, right? Food is basically earned by donating nail clippings and hair to scientists, and once upon a time the economy didn't suck. That was a year ago. Being a starving artist really complicates things. But you gotta chase your dreams, right? What a fake American ideal.

You spun the vintage fidget spinners while wallowing in your angst. The cashier noticed you being all dejected, and approached you. ""I'm guessing you're a little down because you can't afford a fidget spinner?""

*How dare he assume that I'm sad because I can't give him money? Buuuuuut he's right, unfortunately.* ""Yeah, I don't have enough money for one.""

You figure you should save your money and make do with Beth's present, it's just a silly toy anyways. ""Tell you what, I'll trade you a fidget spinner for your Samsung Galaxy s8."" The only way he would've found out about that was if he was using his x-ray contacts to look through your jacket.

""No thank you. I kinda need my phone?""

""Well looks like someone hasn't been using their telepathic abilities!"" he teased.

""You know 21st century 3rd dimensioners don't do well with telepathy!!!""

The brunette wiggled his caterpillar brows. ""So you have a crush on a pleb, huh?""

""What, no!"" that cliche line somehow caught you off guard. ""She's just a friend...""

""Whatever, you say, Blue Jay!"" he made finger guns. Then he lowered his speaking volume, ""To tell you the truth, I've been looking for an s8 for a while now. To sell on here of course.""

""Well I like this phone, okay? Thanks for the offer, but no thanks.""

""What if I trade you a fidget spinner phone for it? Straight out of the 9th dimension?"" He didn't seem particularly desperate, just a budding businessman.

""...a fidget spinner phone?""

The brunette teleported to the 9th dimension shelf and came back to you holding a star-shaped fidget spinner phone that somehow managed to have a hologram screen and a camera. Don't ask the narrator, ask the future.

""It works just like a smartphone! It even has a fingerprint scanner and is waterproof,"" he says as if he's trying to appeal to the 21st century.

""Sure, what the hell. I could use a new phone anyways. Just make sure to transfer all my stuff to my new phone."" You waved your hand apathetically.

An hour later, you were playing around with your new phone. Disappointingly, it didn't have any groundbreaking features as it was similar to a normal smartphone. It was fun how you could spin the screen though. You took a picture of your phone by doing the mirror selfie technique, and sent it to Beth.

Beth:

&gt; ugh cringe!!!!!!! go see a psychiatrist!!! that's so 21st century

[WP] You have the power to get stronger the hungrier you are at that moment,tea_kinggreen,"My stomach kept making loud noises, pleading me to put some food in it. ""Nothing i am not used to"", i thought to myself. It had always been this way anyway, working with the army in their toughest wars. All they had to do was call me a few days earlier, and tell me the threat level, and i would stop eating, however many days needed, depending on the strength of the enemy. A strange power, but well, what can i do.

I looked at the enemy tanks and soldiers from far away. There had to be at least a few dozen tanks, each probably capable of taking out a few dozen soldiers with just one blow. Well, normal soldiers, that is. 

I looked at my lover, also the commander of the army, Sally, waiting for the sign to go in. He nodded, and said ""Make sure to return one piece dear, the dinner's on me tonight."" 

I chuckled, saying ""I want tacos"", before starting to run at the enemy base. Some bullets flew at me, and i think i saw a rocket hitting me in the face as well. ı grabbed two tanks and threw them into each other, before jumping up the sky and grabbing a chopper by its tail and slamming it onto the ground. A group of soldiers ran at me and started firing their guns, before realizing it only tickled me.

This went on for a while, until i was the only one left standing inside a field of absolute chaos, nothing left from the army that came to take over the base. As i stood up, completely naked, staring at Sally and her whole army. ""Man, i need a superhero suit"", i thought to myself. My clothes did not get stronger as i got hungrier after all. 

Sally ran at me to hug me. ""Good job Joseph, i don't know what we would do witho-""

""GIVE. ME. MY. TACOS."" 

As i ate my eighth taco with Sally, i was starting to slowly feel the insane superhuman strength fade away, within a few minutes, i was nothing but an ordinary human being. A very happy one that is, having finally ate something after a while now. ""Aah"", i said, ""No matter what power it gives me, i would never ever trade this feeling of being full. By the way, you are paying these right?""

Sally just smiled and nodded.

Daggh knows now that it is a waste of strong warriors and will cause weakness to tribe when blood of weak gather-men becomes thicker than warrior blood. 


Daggh, still wanting the strongest warrior to be his almost-kin, proposes that they must contest in games testing strength, toughness, and speed. Most of the gather-men accept that they can never be almost-kin of the chief.

Daggh tells Ahgg this in hopes that Ahgg will either become silent or die, and thus be silent. Ahgg is visibly crestfallen. 


Teetah, overhearing the conversation, states that the puff-neck cat is much more dangerous than raaaah-raaaah-flap and that blue raaaah-raaaah-flap feathers would be a more fair challenge. Ahgg, taking this as encouragement from Teetah, vows to find hand-hand-hand-hand much of these blue feathers and goes forth to begin his journey.

[WP] Every time you go to your washroom you check behind the shower curtain for murderers or monsters. This time you forget to check.,yamahagrizzly,"It's an irrational fear I got since I was a child. Every possible hiding spot in the room, Every dark space, Every corner, I checked them to see if there was anything in there. My intention is to make sure that nothing was hiding from me, But it seemed that I was looking for something every time I search. I am always relieved when I don't see anything, But at the same time also worried by the thought of them hiding in a spot I haven't checked.

As I grew up, my fear got worse. I could have a gun and I still won't feel safe unless all closets are open. A child's fear was stuck in my mind. My friends mocked me because of this. I was called a coward by some. But I couldn't help it. I was scared.

Before, It was just closets and under beds, Now, I check closets, tables, drawers, doors, curtains, vents... anywhere. As I learned about how easily I could get killed, I got more paranoid. My paranoia got worse by the second.

But water always relieved me. When I got scared as a child, Drinking water would calm me down. So I decided to take a shower. Cold showers calm me. Normally, I'd check and stare at the curtain while I was showering. But this time I forgot.

I walked outwards the shower only to find the curtain covered in blood. It was clear moments ago. I let my guard down.

 There was a shadow behind the curtain. He had a knife. 10 inches long. He may be concealed by the curtain but I was sure that he had killed someone there. 

He seemed to love blood. As I watch his movements behind the curtains, I got more scared and uncomfortable. He doesn't know I'm here, which is strange. He splattered blood all over the floor.

Then, fear got the best of me. I set the curtain aside.

I stuttered: ""H-H-hey... W-w-w-what are you d-doing?""

The murderer, enjoying his slaughter, Sighed. His happy look changed to dismay. He didn't want to kill me. But he thinks I'm stupid or something.

With a monotone voice, he spoke: ""*I've met so much people who check their curtains for killers. You're one of them, Of course. With all the time you spent checking closets, Have you even thought of a plan if you actually saw a killer?*""

But now he had a chance to make things right, and even if it cost him his life, he was gonna do what he had to. The King was a smart man but also a damn mean one, and if he had his way, war would never stop. There’d always be a new enemy, a new frontier to conquer.
	
He couldn’t let that happen. Not when the other nations were finally setting into peace. If it meant buying his friends and families tickets into early graves, so be it. When part of the body gets infected, you chop it off.
	
Kneeling before the King, he listened as the long list of his deeds were read aloud. People clapped, people cheered. The Emissary didn’t notice because he was too busy slipping a scroll out his pocket. This scroll was supposed to ensure a future where they defeated their rivals, using their own information and tactics against them.
	
But instead it was a scroll with a powerful enchantment placed on it, and when opened, it would unleash an explosion that would wipe out this entire castle. All the King’s men would be gone, and the other countries would move in and help rebuild the damage that was done.
	
The Emissary would be dead, but his country—and the world—would be saved.

[IP] The Emissary,Apostle_of_Ink,"There was a standing order that entering the king's chambers uninvited would result in your immediate death. The courier knew this, but he didn't even hesitate when he reached the door. The heavy oak door swung open silently on well kept hinges. The king was seated at his desk with quill in hand. If the king didn't acknowledge the courier before the guards reached him, this would be the courier's last moments.

""My Lord! A most urgent message! It cannot wait. I was told to bring it to you with all haste by the crown Prince himself!""

The king's hand twitched and the guards stopped their approach. A bead of sweat rolled down the courier's face as he knelt. The king slowly stood and walked towards him. The courier held the scroll up and the king gently took it from his shaking hands.

The courier was frozen, staring at the floor. The king broke the wax seal with a practiced motion and unfurled the vellum. The room was in total silence except for the crackle of the torches in their sconces as the king scanned what was before him. He easily recognized his son's scrawling words.

A grin spread across the king's usually somber face. He whispered something the others in the room didn't catch.

""Your Grace?"" One of the guards ventured.

 The king shouted, ""I'm going to be a grandfather!""",cruelhandluke86

Everybody ready?"" Four live 3-d models of my friends were sitting on the couch beside me. I heard four resounding agreements with one of them, Brian, saying, ""Can we just get on with it? Let's play already!""

Jessica laughed and gave a virtual nudge to Brian, ""Are you sure you won't be scared to death? I mean, have you *seen* the art for their monsters?""

Brian rolled his eyes, ""Of course I did! And besides, the one most likely to scream first is Albert over there.""

Albert is a rather short teen who hasn't grown as tall as me or Brian. He dismissively shrugged and said, ""Whatever. Let's just start the game already, Alex.""

I smiled and opened the virtual reality UI to launch the game. A window popped up displaying the game's preview and launch settings. ""So, you guys prefer a full memory wipe and process at 1000x speed of real-time or just wipe the last 5 years or so and go at 250x speed? Or, if you're *scared*,"" I winked at Brian, ""we could forget about doing the memory wipe.""

Brian ignored my teasing and, with a wide childish grin, waved his hand dismissively and said, ""Let's do the full wipe. I'm going in guys. Our world ID is **ScreamingAlbert**.

Albert sighed, ""Of course it is.""

Jessica gave Albert a light pat on the back and said, ""Don't worry about it, Albert. Anyways, I'm starting the game.""

My living room slowly faded to black and my friends with it until I was surrounded by only an empty void of darkness. A UI window popped up with ominous music and displayed the game's name: ***Fear***.

An automated voice read, ""Initiating world immersion.""

Around me, the pitch black environment I was in was replaced by 19th century England. I wasn't yet in the world so to speak. I floated a few meters above the ground as an object unable to interact with the world until the memory wipe was completed.

My palms became sweaty on the leash. I wiped them on my pants and headed over to her as she sat with that absolute jerk Anoop with that stupid smirk that seemed to mesmerize her. She laughed again at something Anoop said -- probably some stupid joke or something stupid because Anoop sucked.

""Hi Megan,"" I croaked. ""Can I talk to you a moment?""

She looked at me, changing from confusion, to amusement, to disappointment and embarrassment. ""Oh no. Ivan, I didn't mean --""

""Dude, why did you glue wings onto a piglet?"" Anoop said, staring down at Wilbura.

""Um, they're not glued on. Megan, can I please talk to you alone?""

""This is very cute, but I'm not interested,"" Megan insisted.

I didn't spend all those nights in the lab fueled only by coffee and vending machine candy to not even show her what Wilbura could do. ""But --""

""She said she wasn't interested, man,"" Anoop said.

""Oh shut up, Anoop."" I hurried to Megan. ""Just please, Megan, two seconds.""

She nodded. 

""Okay, Wilbura."" I took out the delicious carrot. Wilbura snorted, smelling the orange stick. I moved the stick an inch from her nose, and she followed it around and around in circles, her tiny piglet feet clicking on the brick. I lifted the carrot up higher, she leaped from it and I held it up higher still.

""Ah, man. Don't be cruel. Just give it to her,"" Anoop said.

I clicked my tongue. ""Come on, Wilbura."" She bounced for it again.

""It's too high,"" Anoop said.

Megan sighed. ""Please stop --""

Wilbura wiggled her butt, squatted low to the ground, stretched out her wings, and then leaped into the air. Megan screamed. I twirled the carrot over my head, and she flew faster to snatch it from my fingers before gently lowering herself to the ground. 

""Jesus Christ,"" Anoop said.

""Oh my God, what have you done?"" Megan shrieked.

""I made pigs fly... So when do you want to go on that date?""

""I'm not going on a date with you!"" Megan screamed. ""You've made an abomination! How could you?!""

All the joy that I felt and have ever felt melted from my body. I glanced down at little Wilbura, joyfully sniffing the cracks between the pavement. 

""She's not an abomination.""

I glanced up, surprised. Did Anoop really just say that?

""She's not an abomination, Megan,"" Anoop repeated. ""This is amazing! Dude, how did you do this?""

""I --""

Megan screamed. ""You're both sick! You're both disgusting."" She stomped off.

"[WP] A hard-boiled detective story, set in Heaven.",Joxytheinhaler,"Nobody noticed that it rained in Heaven. 

I mean, to be fair it wasn’t rain. It was dew. The kind that soaks a cloud full up until it bursts and ruins your day. Well Heaven is full of clouds. So when you walked down the street at the right angle, with the wind pushing down right, you’d get all wet. And despite the perfect weather, that burst of moisture was enough to chill your bones. Or whatever went for bones up here.

So you put a city in the clouds and you get rain. Go figure.

But nobody noticed.

Well, that’s not true. I noticed. It’s my job to notice things like that. Was my job. Is. Was.

You never get used to splitting your life like that. Pre-death and after-death. Most other folks here don't even remember a time before this. Heaven has a way of making you forget things. Even important things.

But I haven’t forgotten. Not yet.

I was Frank Grimwood. I wish I could say I lived a good life but that wouldn’t be true. At least I own it.

I spent my better years as a private investigator. I know what you’re thinking but it wasn’t like that. Not the glamor. Not the hard-boiled ruse of some pulp novel. I spent my time watching people. Most of the time they did nothing; sometimes they did too much. I went through their trash, read their mail, listened to their private conversations. 

It all came down to the same thing – catch them doing something they’re shouldn’t be. Sleeping around. Cheating disability. Skipping out on a debt. It didn’t matter as long as the check cleared. Most of the time the person hiring me was as bad as the one I was following. Sometimes they were worse. 
But I did it all the same.

That’s not so bad you say. You were doing a job that plenty of people have done. I mean, you made it to Heaven so you must not be a bad person.

You might be right. I’ve wondered about this myself. Maybe I deserve to be up here. But here’s the thing. I have no good clue why. I don’t think I was a very bad person, but I know I wasn’t a good one either. Not Heaven-good.

But I died and woke up here one day. An angel gave me a quick speech about you’re dead, here’s your house, there’s food if you want it, go wherever you like, and don’t both trying to sleep anymore. Or crap. I mean what’s the point?

And that’s Heaven. 

‘Wait, that’s Heaven?’ you ask. ‘Surely there’s more?’

You aren’t the first one to raise an eyebrow at my story. Let me tell you a few more things about Heaven.

First. Nobody walks anywhere. Why would they? Blink and you’re anywhere in an instant. You wondered why folks don’t notice the rain in the clouds? It’s because they’re all too busy twinkling around from one place to the next. 
Hurrying up to go nowhere fast. But I still like to walk when I can afford to. And trust me, I can afford to. We have all the time in the world up here.

Second. Nobody has anything interesting to say. This one isn’t entirely true. Not at first. For the first few thousand years I spent some time getting to know my fellow Heaven dwellers. It was about as fun as you’d expect it to be. But then it comes to a point where you’ve heard it all. Even the newcomers have lost their charm.

Which brings me to my third point. Nothing ever happens in Heaven. I mean, there are little parties, social gatherings, and soirees. You have all the books, movies, and songs written on Earth, including the ones that aren’t written yet. You have a view of anything you can imagine (and some things you can’t). But how long does that play out before you start to get bored? 

A thousand years? A million years? How long would you last?

I’m telling you, I’ve been here a long time now and nothing new ever happens here.

At least... At least, not until recently. Now I’m seeing little details that are off. It’s like listening to your favorite song on the radio, but during the second verse, the drummer misses a single beat. It’s small, but if you pay attention it’s bright as day.

Like I said, it’s my job to notice things.

I first noticed while I was sitting in my favorite bar one evening (yes, Heaven has bars). I was halfway between a drink and a daydream when it hit me in the face. The wall in front of me was missing a brick. 411 where there should be 412. I know that’s an inane thing to notice. Or even an insane thing to notice. But I noticed. I'd been here enough times to know there should be 412. (And no, we don’t count any faster here, we just have more time.)

Walls don’t get smaller, but there it was. A missing brick.

I went home that night and wrote it down in a small book. I don’t know why I wrote it down, maybe it was just a holdover from my old days?

From there I started to keep track of the little things. Things that were off. At first there weren’t many, but now I’m seeing them everywhere. A blade of grass bent the wrong way. Coffee that’s a degree off. Have things always been this way or did it just take me this long to notice?

Each day I went home and wrote. I never bothered hiding my notebook. Who would think to look for it? I don’t have company and I rarely talk to anyone. Not anymore.

So today, when I opened my notebook I was startled to see a new note below where I’d last left off. And here’s the real rub – the note was in my own handwriting:

*“Come to the Edge tonight. Bring this book. 11. PS. Be sure to walk.”*

In all the years that followed, I've wished that I could go back and warn myself. Burn the notebook. Ignore the note. Do anything you want and do it for a million years. Just don’t go there. 

But I didn’t even think about my response that night. Not really. I knew I was going before I even finished reading the message.

“Ah what the hell,” I muttered to myself. We’re in Heaven after all. Aside from a little rain, how bad can things get?

The darkness and silence wrapped around the crowd like a gentle blanket. It was only when the minutes turned to hours and the awe turned to shock. 
Then confusion. 
Then fear. 

The blackness of the sky only thickened as the 22nd of August arrived. NASA scrambling to come to a reason as to why the sun was stuck in the sky. Cities glowed against the horizon at noon.

Even in the states that didn't have totality were dimmed. Everyone had been afflicted by the constant eclipse. 

The eclipse stayed in the sky, leaving cities in total darkness. The first three days weren't so bad. People adjusted to the dark. Until the symptoms began to show.

The sunless cities were the first to show. People began to cough up darkened fluids. Their hair began to fall out in clumps. Their skin turned transparent, showing their bones and organs. 

The worse part began two days ago. It spread like a virus throughout their body. It starts when the heart darkens. It would pump blackened blood into every organ, every artery, and through every vein until the body resembled a shadow.

"[WP] It's been over a week, and the eclipse hasn't ended yet.",MiguelonReddit,"The howling won't stop. All day and all night. Then again, for a week, it’s been nothing but night. Even during the daytime hours, the sky is dark, and shadows follow you, but not in the same fashion as they would during a bright, sun shining day. I’m convinced even my shadow howls. 

My grandpa used to tell me stories about monsters when I was a child. Scary stories around the campfire, scary stories at night before bed. Hell, scary stories all the time. My grandpa terrified me more than those stories ever could. But, he told me the truth. Our family’s truth. 

I’d first heard about those monsters from my grandpa, but when I’d asked my parents about it, they laughed it off as the crazy delusions of a senile old man. I laughed with them, not fully understanding much of anything my grandpa had told me in his waning days.

I was in school the day he passed away. I remember getting called down to the principal’s office, with the sounds from the classroom behind me, I made the walk down the long hallway. I knew. I didn’t fully grasp that he’d passed, but I KNEW! I got to the office, and was met by my parents, my mom crying, and my dad’s eyes were red. I cried too. 

The years went by and I’d forgotten about the goofy stories my grandpa used to tell me, until the news of the eclipse began to make its way into my everyday life. Facebook was giving tips on how to avoid going blind, news stories aired on TV and radio about people celebrating the eclipse, and my family… my family said nothing of it. I brought it up to my mom in the kitchen a few weeks ago, and she screamed at me to stop talking about it. A guttural scream. Bad day, I thought… I didn’t bring it back up. 

When the big day hit, August 21st, it was kinda the same as every other day. I had my glasses, ready to go outside with my friends during science class to look up at the sun and moon criss-crossing. But, at the start of class, I was called down to the main high school office. There, I was met by a police officer.

“Hey, are you Jack?” the officer asked, putting his hand on my shoulder. 

“Yeah, I’m Jack. What’s going on?” I questioned, with wide eyes. 

“Jack, I’m Officer Stevens. Your parents have been in an accident.”

“What? What kind of accident? Are they okay?” I panicked. 

“Can you get your things and come with me? Everything is going to be okay,” Stevens calmly said. 

“I drove here,” I said as I began to shake. “Can I just go to my car and follow you?”

“Sure, Jack.”

“But, where are we going?”

“We’re going to the police station.”

“Can I go home first, and meet you there? I think I need a few minutes by myself, if that’s okay?”

“I’ll follow you home, okay?”

“Okay, Officer.”

My head was numb. I couldn’t really see straight, as I tried to grasp what was going on. ‘An accident? What does that even mean?’ I picked-up my backpack and ran out the front doors of the school to the student parking lot and got in my car. I began bawling my eyes out. My stomach felt like it was convulsing, and I couldn’t catch my breath, as I bent over the steering wheel, with drool, snot, and tears flowing out of my face. After several minutes I collected myself, and started the car. 

I got home and went to pull into the driveway, only to see both of my parents’ cars in the driveway, so I parked on the street. Officer Stevens pulled-up behind me, as I got out of my car. 

“Hey, Officer,” I said as I wiped my face with my arm, “are you sure there was an accident? Both of their cars are here.”

Officer Stevens rolled down his window and said, “Jack, I’m just the guy who got the call to pick you up. I was told your parents were in an accident and to take you to the police station.”

“Umm, okay. I’m gonna run in really quick and I’ll be back out in a minute.”

“Not a problem.” 

I walked up to the front door and pulled my keys out, my hands violently shaking as I tried to unlock the door. I looked over my shoulder and the officer was sitting in his car. I turned my attention back to the door and managed to unlock it. I walked in to an empty house. I called for my parents but my voice, cracking under the stress, carried. I kept calling out as I ran from room to room, and nothing. I finally went to the kitchen and turned on the cold water to splash my face. I looked in the reflection of the window above the sink and saw a blubbering mess. I bent over the sink and splashed my face with the ice cold water and took in a deep breath through my nostrils, as I tried to clear out the ridiculous amount of snot that had been running down my face for the last 15 minutes. 

I let out a defeated breath and told myself ‘It’s all going to be okay.’

Then I heard a loud POP! coming from the street. I instinctively ran to the front window and peered out from behind the curtain, and saw Officer Stevens slumped over the steering wheel.

The moon began to cross in-front of the sun. 

“Holy shit!” I whispered to no one. My heart began pounding hard in my chest and I couldn’t catch my breath. 

I ran back into the kitchen and grabbed my stuff as I made my way to the back door. I looked out the window above the sink and caught my reflection. My eyes were red. 

I let out a guttural scream that turned into a howl.

""Is she coming?"" Rock asked.

""Hun..."" Mrs. Whitling leaned down and palmed his shoulder sweetly. ""It's too late. Your mother isn't going to come in this dark.""

-
Rock's countenance shattered like a glass ornament and tears began to swell. He closed his eyes and breathed in deeply. ""Oh, o-"" he stammered, trying to compose himself. ""Okay.""

Mrs. Whitling reached for a candle and gently guided him back to the stairs as he sniffled. 

-
""Don't worry, Rocky. Janice has got a whole closet full of friends to choose from - I'm sure she wouldn't mind sharing!""

""Y-Yeah..."" He replied. But he didn't want any of Jam's friends. He wanted his own. ""Okay.""

-
He dragged his feet as he ascended the stairs and opened the door to Jam's room. She had been playing with a worn looking stuffed unicorn by candlelight, but as he entered she turned hopeful eyes to him. Rock's failure was evident in his face.

-
""Ah, man..."" She said, turning back to her unicorn. ""I told you it was too dark, Rocky. No way your mom was gonna come just to bring you a stuffed animal.""

-
Rock flung himself face down onto her bed, pouting and sobbing silently. It had been 40 days, and the eclipse hadn't ended yet. The city had decided that, in order to reduce consumption of electricity and reduce strain on our utility providers, there was to be a ""lights-out curfew"" between the hours of 8pm and 6am. To enforce this new rule, if anyone was caught with any extraneous electronics on after dark, they were fined an exorbitant amount of money.

Late night and 24/7 businesses quickly changed their hours of operation in compliance, including fuel stations. For that reason, one rarely saw cars on the road later than 10 o'clock at night. That, and the unlit streets were becoming dangerous with criminal activity. It was truly astonishing how quickly bad men became worse. That's what Rock heard his dad saying all the time anyways.

-
He flipped over, a new look of determination on his face. ""I'm going.""

""What?"" Jam spun around on her rear. ""You can't go!""

""Well, I can't sleep here without him.""

""It's a stuffed animal. Let it go. Here, take mine.""

Rock slapped the unicorn from her outstretched hands. He got up and began to walk towards the door. Jam grabbed at his ankles. ""Rocky, no!""

He kicked his feet, shook free from her grip, and turned to yell at her but thought better. If Mrs. Whitling heard them, she'd never let him leave. ""Shut up!""

""You can't go out there, man. All of the bad people come out in the dark.""

""I know, so what?""

""They'll hurt you!""

""My dad's done it."" Rock said defiantly.

""Rocky... You're nine.""

-
Rock scoffed and walked back to the bed, sitting down hard. Who cared if he was nine? He was big for his age, and his brother had taught him to roundhouse kick. 

-
""My neighborhood's only a few blocks down anyways, I probably won't even see anyone."" He said.

""Maybe not..."" Jam paused. ""But what if you do? What if they have knives - or even guns?""

Rock looked down at his feet. He hadn't thought of that. ""I'll find a shield.""

""Huh?""

""I'll find a shield. Like a lid.""

""A lid?"" Jam crawled across the floor to the bed and leaned her back against it.

""Like the lid to a pot. Or a garbage can.""

Jam looked up in thought. ""That... Might work... Maybe...""

-
Jam was beginning to come around to the idea. The two sat and threw ideas back and forth for an hour or two, compiling a list of essentials if Rock were to venture home in the dark. A pot and lid for a helmet and shield; several candles and a lighter; snacks and drinks for the journey; and a kitchen knife for an emergency weapon.

Rock would want to stick to neighbors' yards for as long as possible until he got to the main road. From there, he'd only be in the open for three blocks - up Franklin Road, down the reservoir maintenance path, and back up onto Knox Lane - before he'd once again take to neighbors' yards for safety all the way home.

As the time passed, the candle burned down, and the room dimmed. Jam's input was getting slower, fewer, and further between, until she began to snore softly. Rock stood up slowly so as not to disturb his friend. He tiptoed to her dresser, carefully picked up the candle, and slipped out into the hallway.

In the grim darkness of the future they find 40k.",NeverwinterIan,"You're still relying on the logical fallacy that physics work differently in 40k. They don't. A 1500MW nuclear reactor will produce 1500MW of power in both universes. Imperial ships are just thirty **thousand** years more advanced and come standard with, to use your example, 15000MW reactors. It's not the same reactor. *It's a better one.* WH40k materials aren't naturally any stronger, either. They've just discovered more durable materials and alloys entirely.

And yes, Genghis Khan with 10,000 men would probably stand a not-infinitesimal chance against 10,000 Guardsmen, if his 10,000 are all horse archers and the 10,000 Guardsmen are all infantrymen with lasguns. Those odds tank (heh) immediately when you realize there's only 9,000 infantrymen (some of whom have mortars and autocannons and heavy bolters) and 200 Leman Russ Main Battle Tanks, each with a crew of 5, bringing the troop total to 10,000.

It's the same thing with Navy ships vs. Reapers. Just because the Reapers get transported to 40k doesn't mean their tech gets upgraded. Even if it DID get upgraded, we're still talking about a 'race' of beings whose largest, most powerful warships barely qualify as frigates on the scale of the Imperial Navy. If each Sovereign-class Reaper was actually given a degree of power equal to a Sword-class Imperial frigate, which they are *smaller than,* a reasonably large Imperial strike force could *still* obliterate them by bringing things like **17km** Imperial Battleships into the fray.",Estellus

But 40K does not uses real life physics (just like ME). The amount of energy you can get from certain sources is limited. And 40K get way more out of them as should be possible. The reaper tech is not ""upgraded"" but their relative efficiency changes due to a different set of laws of physics. 

Just watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBKJKkXceB4) was sadly the only one I could find for warhammer physics. Even if imperial materials are better that still won't be enough.

I think the guardsmen should win because of lasguns. Genghis Khan might even have a chance if all his men gets horses. 

But both still operate in somewhat the same laws of physics. While space ships in 40K and ME don't. Let's say a nuclear reactor of a certain size in ME universe generates 1500MW the same reactor suddenly generates 15000MW in 40K universe. The same way materials become more durable and weapons more powerful. These changes should apply to reaper too if they are somehow transported into the 40K universe.

The Same way Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann can't do shit in 40K universe where rules like you can't move faster then the speed of light still apply.

Source unreliable, conclusion biased, evidence ejected from this court. *gavel sounds*

That said, your argument is based on several fallacies. 

First:

&gt;the reaper are out there for far longer but are more or less limited to the techlevel the imperium has

False correlation between Reaper and Imperial technology. The Reapers have neither limited to or superior to Imperial tech, they are *different* as they come from a different universe. They are capable of everything they are able to do in their own universe. Sadly for them, that is dramatically less than the warships of the Imperium are capable of in *their* home universe.

Second:

&gt;The reaper tech is not ""upgraded"" but their relative efficiency changes due to a different set of laws of physics.

Similar to the first, your assumption is that appearing in a different universe would automatically make the Reapers more efficient. Even if it were true that 40k relies on different physics, which it is not, that would open an entirely different bag of proverbial worms, as it means Reaper tech may not function *at all* or have severe, even catastrophic limitations when subjected to new laws of physics. If, as you postulate, their reactors were suddenly able to output 10x as much energy, there is every chance their containment, not designed for that kind of power, would fail spectacularly and the entire armada would be destroyed instantly. 

This is exactly why communities based around these kind of conversations have rules. One of the most important of those rules is that, unless otherwise stated, every individual/piece of technology/ship/etc involved in a fight **always** performs as it does in their own universe, regardless of what universe they may be in.

The prompt implied the Reapers were not expecting 40k or 40k's technology. Prompt said nothing about changing Reaper technology nor adapting it to suit permanent existence in a different universe. It said the Reapers find the heaviest resistance they've ever encountered: Warhammer 40k. I took that prompt and wrote a response based around that idea: the Mass Effect Reapers, as everyone is familiar with them with no changes, enter the Milky Way galaxy in the 41st millennium as described in the Warhammer 40,000 setting and encounter resistance from the inhabitants of that setting, for which I specifically chose the Imperium of Mankind and specifically the Imperial Navy, at which point I wrote a scenario in which the Reapers as presented in Mass Effect fight the Navy as presented in Battlefleet Gothic, Battlefleet Gothic: Armada, and a variety of novels published by the Black Library. I stand by all aspects of that choice as it was made based on the request of the prompt writer. If you would like to request a different story, based on the concept of the Mass Effect Reapers being modified or upgraded in some way to be comparable to the capabilities of military's in the 41st millennium, I suggest you either write your own response or post a prompt that makes that aspect clear.

The defense rests.

My heart was in my throat, I was so nervous I felt sick.  She smiled at me, and I'm sure it was intended to be reassuring, but...

""I, um, are you...""  Her smile grew, stretching emaciated features.   She stretched a hand across the table, stilling my drumming fingers.  ""It's okay, hon.  We don't have to rush straight to it.  Take your time.  Breathe.""

Christ.  She was comforting me.  I took her advice, and a deep breath.  ""I'm good.  It's just, this is such a ... it's big, right?  A big deal?""  I should have had better control of myself.  People did this all the time, or so they say.

She shrugged.  ""Bigger than some things.  But it's just another aspect of life, right?  An exchange.  You can think of it as a business deal, if that makes you feel better.""

It didn't.  The thought of it as 'services rendered' actually twisted my stomach a little more.  I gave serious thought to calling the whole thing off, then and there.  ""Look, maybe I'd feel better if I knew you a little more before we, y'know.  Can I buy you dinner, first?""  Great.  Now I'd asked her out.  I felt like an awkward teen.  But it might've been the right move, because she giggled, and I could suddenly see the girl she'd been before a bandanna had become her go-to style.

Her profile pic had longish brown hair, a little past her shoulders.  The eyes were the same, especially when she grinned.  Like she was doing at that exact moment.  At me.  I'm fairly certain I was blushing.  Or the room had spontaneously turned several degrees warmer all at once.  It could happen.

""I think you'll find I'm a cheap date, these days.  Not much of an appetite.  But sure, buy me some fries.""  She pushed herself up, standing before it really occurred to me to help, and I sheepishly came around to offer her my arm. ""Ah, a gentleman.""  She took the offered appendage, and we walked arm-in-arm down the sidewalk to the nearest restaurant.

We must've talked for a couple of hours.  She told me about her family, her kids, she got to hear about me and my siblings.  We danced around the elephant in the room far longer than I thought possible, but eventually it came up.  The Big C.

""Oh, you know, they do what they can, but you can't always treat it.  'Inoperable', I think was the word the doctor used.""

""And this is how you've decided to deal with it?""

""A parent has to be there for her kids.  Any way she can.  Right?""  Her smile was sad, then.  As strong a front as she'd had up, that undercurrent of sadness had been just under the surface.  That was the worst part of it all, I think.  Up until I'd sat down across from her, it had been hypothetical.  A practically faceless stranger, just another picture on the internet.  Money would change hands, and both parties get to go home happy.

""I think it's time.  I mean, the bank transfer confirmed a while ago, and..."" I cleared my throat, embarrassed.  ""You sure about this?""

She stared at me a moment, long enough I thought she might be lost in thought and hadn't heard me.  But then she looked me straight in the eye and said, ""What's another cancer going to do?  Kill me?""  The look in her eyes, then...

I didn't see her after that day.  I kept in touch with her kids, though, especially her son.  I was afraid at first, that he'd hate me.  She could have possibly held on longer, if it wasn't for me.  But he's a good hearted kid, and we have a lot in common.

Willie's squad was hunkered down in a swamped and stinky trench they shared with rats and vermin, but they didn't complain, at least their trench was atop of a hill and didn't fill up to the parapet like the ones below.

Suddenly one of the sentries, who earlier snuck into the no man's land to prevent any covert action by the enemy emerged from the fog. 

""Gas, gas, gas!"" He rasped the dreaded warning and collapsed to the bottom of the trench, unmoving.

Willie used his whistle to warn troops further down the line, and satisfied that repeating triple whistles relayed his message, he bellowed ""Medic!"".

A young and scared girl, holding gauze and bottles of turpentine approached the victim, but as soon as she turned the sentry onto his back it was clear her attempts were futile. The uniform and skin of the unfortunate man were stained red.

""Too late."" She said, nevertheless trying her best. ""It's quick drying aerosol.""

He made his report, and smiled. ""Boys! Give mother earth a kiss. We have a surprise for the Krauts as well!""

"[WP] A group of children have a friendly paintball fight, which slowly escalates into all out paintball war (tanks, drones, etc etc)",SovietPrussia1,"Johnny sat crouched behind a concrete barricade. He could feel the sweat dripping down his brow as he waited to make a move. He looked to his left and saw his friend Brian next to him, with his back up against the barricade. They both wore a protective vest and helmet, and carried a sleek black rifle. Brian nodded towards a tree some ten yards away, indicating that they should head for new cover. Johnny nodded in return; it was time. 

On the count of three, they spilt off from the concrete, kicking up dust as they sprinted for their target. As they ran, shots fired from an abandoned building in the distance narrowly missed them, and left colored marks around their feet. When they reached the large oak, they crouched down again, and then made sure neither of them was hit. Luckily, both were clean.

""That's was too close, Brian,"" Johnny managed as he breathed heavily. ""There's no way we can make it any closer to the objective in our own.""

""Don't worry, man. Reinforcements are on the way,"" Brian responded. He spoke into a walkie talkie on his vest. ""Are we a go for plan Alpha, team two?"" He flinched as a shot hit the side of the tree, leaving a green splatter next to his leg.

This was the most intense game of paintball the world had ever seen.

It was the world championship paintball game in Sacramento, California. Their team, the Silver Bandits, was made up of a hundred guys aged fourteen to nineteen. The opposing team, the Marauders, consisted of the same. A giant scoreboard on the far side of the arena revealed the number of players left from each team. 

'Silver Bandits: 67'
'Marauders: 82'

""Team leader, this is team two. We're ready when you are."" Brian's walkie came through loud and clear as the two made every effort to stay hidden behind the base of the tree.

""Copy that, team two. On my mark, you know what to do."" Brian nodded to Johnny, who then took off his backpack and laid it in the ground at his feet. He unzipped it and took out a large drone, with four rotors and a claw that held a large canister of paint. 

Brian then spoke into his walkie one last time. ""Team two, commence plan Alpha."" Johnny grabbed a remote, and the mechanical creature sprang to life, flying up into the air. He watched it as it flew toward the building. Only a few of the enemy players spotted it before it flew into an open window. 

Bits of assorted color soared out of the window as the paint canister exploded, sending paint flying in every direction. At the same time, Brian cheered as a pickup truck came to a grinding halt next the oak, and began firing round after round of paint into the side of the building from atop a mounted turret on the tucks flatbed, controlled by a player. 

Another player hopped out of the truck's driver seat to join the other two behind the tree. ""Good to see you, team leader,"" he said, nodding to the pair. 

""Nice of you to join us, Kevin,"" Johnny exclaimed, grinning. ""Thats should keep them busy for little while, but let's not waste time. Are you ready?"" Kevin nodded. As the three made their way past the tree and onto a barrier nearer to the compound, the sound of the firing turret stopped, making it obvious that they had lost another man. 

When they had made it to the edge of building, shouting started coming from Brian's walkie. 

""Team leader! This is team three; we're taking heavy fire on the northwest side of the building! Requesting immediate assistance!"" 

Brian informed them that they were in the way, and motioned two the other two to get into position. Johnny went to one side of the door and opened it just enough so that Kevin could throw in a paint grenade. 

A loud bang went off, and they charged inside. Two enemy players sat in the corners of the room, the fronts of them covered in paint. They raised their hands in the air as the three Silver Bandits passed through into the next room. 

As they carefully surveyed the area, making sure not to miss a hiding opponent, Johnny caught a glimpse of the score out a small, smudged window.

We were all born in this world without a voice or say. We all struggle for survival, but is there actually a point in the survival of our species? Our brains are wired to reproduce, to pass on our genes to the next generation. But in the end, the world continues on, with or without life. Life is meaningless. None of this actually matters.

Therefore, it's up to us to make it matter.

No matter how cliche it is, it's true. Every day is another opportunity to live your life. Sure, death will release us from all the sadness and pain and grief in the world, but we might not ever get this chance again, so we have to make the most of what we already have. We're all going to die anyway.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that instead of wasting your life, you should just browse Reddit instead.

50 years. It has been 50 years since James and Charles made the promise that would change the world. To outkind each other, no matter what. A foolish wager made by 2 siblings. You would expect this game to fail after a week. Or two.

It didn't fail. Neither James nor Charles could accept defeat. Their enormous pride left them no other choice but to continue surpassing each other. Again. And again. And again.

The brothers became outstanding scientists. They figured that the world's greatest problems could only be solved through reason and wit. James cracked the mystery of making nuclear fusion viable, granting humanity an almost unlimited energy resource. Charles used his outstanding knowledge in biology to revolutionize agriculture and animal farming. Mass husbandry was a thing of the past. The meat of the future was delivered in the form of small capsules containing stem cells that grew in household incubators to become the tastiest meat you could imagine.

Humanity reached a state of global prosperity - and it was all thanks to the insane wager of 2 siblings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But it was not enough. The world was still filled with scum. Conmen cheating their way to power. Spouses betraying their partners for one-night stands. Children bullying other children into committing suicide. 

Cynical voices said that mankind never was that vile before, as the abundance of wealth made people numb. They seemed to forget what true suffering felt like, and empathy turned from virtue to burden. Men put on the face of god, but deep down, they just remained animals with bigger cortices.

And so it was decided. James turned the key to initiate the experiment that would serve as the ultimate salvation. The end of all struggle, the beginning of true peace.

It was a quick and painless death. Being pulled into a black hole took less than a millisecond, and in less than a minute, all of mankind would share his fate.

If James could have seen the resolution of his final plan, he probably would have smiled.

As this cruel and beautiful world vanished into eternal nothingness.

He knew he should be sleeping, his doctors told him as much every chance they got, but he couldn't find any rest, what he was about to do was far too important.

It had been decades since that fateful night in a small pub, not far from where he stood tonight. Neither he nor Ethan had wanted to believe in each others commitment to a simple wager, but here he stood, about to change everything for only his goodwill and youthful pride. 
There had never been any doubt in his mind that what he was doing was right, yet here he stood, alone and cold in the dark, questioning if they had taken things too far. If only Ethan had accepted his superior kindness, none of this would have been necessary.
Once more his mind wandered towards alternate options, but it could find none. After what had happened in Africa, Asia, the whole damn world after Ethan's last response, there were only two options left, and he would NEVER give up.
Working continuously for thirty years, he finally stood atop a true world government, ruler over all 17 billion people that called this planet home. Through backroom deals and promises, political games and charismatic speeches, shady alliances and blandishments he amassed what would come closest to ultimate power.

Slipping back into his bed he finally found some peace of mind. He knew he was making the world a better place for he had read the theories and agreed. One way or another, it would be the end of the world as he knew it. He just hoped Trotsky was truly right.",Haegar_the_Horrible

Gregory turned his head to look through the packed party. He saw Emma, a friend of a friend slowly becoming just friend, weaving her way through the crowd. He gave a polite smile and waved at her, when he saw the guy she was dragging behind her.

He was tall, chiseled and handsome, and wore the a plaid button up under a denim jacket with a Blue Jays ball cap. 

""Gordon, this is Gregory, I told you all about him! Remember?"" Emma asked her acquaintance as they approached Gordon. Gordon extended his right arm to greet hand out to the other man, which was eagerly met.

His handshake was firm, like he was trying to assert dominance, but soft, like he was trying to show he meant no harm.

""Gordon he is just the NICEST guy you'll ever meet! And Gregory,"" she looked between the two men that towered over each other, who were both looking into each other's eyes, hands shaking, ""well same. Olivia jokes you two should have some sort of nice off!"" 

She joked, before laughing. Neither of the G-named men laughed. They just nodded.

""Uh huh..."" Gordon said.

""Sure could."" Gregory responded.

Emma's smile faded. What had she done?

---

""Primeminister,"" the secretary said. Gordon couldn't remember her name.

""Yes?"" He said, turning in his chair. Gordon had become a much different person after meeting Gregory. He used to be one of the two kindest people you'd ever have met, but now? He was a dick.

To all but one.

""You might want to see this."" She said, biting her lip nervously. 

Ever since he had met Gregory, he needed to be kind. He had found after years and years that it was just easier to be nice only to Gregory or while he was at least around. It had been so long since he was kind.

Gordon lifted an eyebrow curiously, before pulling himself up from the chair. He followed her out of the room, and to her desk where her desktop computer sat. She gestured to the monitor plugged into the machine and Gordon froze in place. 

The face on the monitor. The man- who stood behind a line of other men with bags on their heads, all on their knees- he knew that man. 

""These men are all the enemies of our lovely country of Canada. They are the war criminals and terrorists that have plagued our country for years and tore it apart. Rest easy now, Canada, for the Greencell terrorists have been dealt with. The government has done their best to do all that they can- especially Primeminister Gordon- but a country and a man with so many responsibilities cannot possibly deal with everything at once. So I have taken these criminals under my custody and I offer them to you, Canadian government, and Primeminister Gordon, to take to court. Don't mention it.""

Gordon slammed a fist into the desk of the secretary. She jumped and cowered a bit, before he retreated hastily into his office. He shut the doors and pounded on his own desk a bit more. 

How did Gregory come back every time to one up him and prove he was the nicest?! How could he possibly pull off such feats of daring and bravery to outdo him?!

Gordon had done everything- bailed his parking tickets, paid for all his debt, made it so he could pay no taxes, and even supplied three quarters of his own personal wealth to the gofundme of Gregory's Louisianan aunt. 

More importantly, how could Gordon outdo him? 

The door creaked open, and he heard a single soft footstep.

""S-sir? What should we have done?"" The secretary asked rather frightfully.

Gordon thought on it, not turning even look at her.

""Send a team to him. Get the prisoners.  Send him a gift basket.""

---

""So, Mister...?""

""Fuck you!""

Gordon groaned, before rubbing the bridge of his nose.

The Greencell leader was chained to a table, wearing an orange jumpsuit. Gordon had shut off all security systems and was in here by himself. A dark and cold stone room with only one light. It was a sight out of a noir film.

""You're the problem with this world! Corporate bigwigs that trudge all over the little man! That's why we'll cleanse this earth of you, and everyone else! To start the world-""

""Anew, yes, yes, I've got it, I understand. I didn't meet with you to discuss policy and beliefs and whatnot. Just answer a few questions for me."" Gordon spoke, sitting on the table of the interrogation room. 

""I'll never eat out my brothers and sisters in the-""

""Do you have a nuclear warhead?"" Gordon cut him off, the bags under his eyes speaking volumes of how tired he was. 

The terrorist gave an evil smirk, tilting his head down to look up at the Canadian Primeminister with a sinister smile. He nodded.

Gordon wasn't impressed.

""And you plan to wipe out all of the surface of the earth with this?""

The man before him only kept nodding.

""Then here."" He said, reaching into his pocket and sliding a set of keys across the table. ""It's for the cuffs, and all the doors out of here.""

And with that, Gordon rose from his seat and just walked out without another word, leaving one confused terrorist at the table.

---

Gordon inhaled deeply. The smell wasn't pleasant, but it was one he'd have to get used to. It was gravelly. Dry. It lacked the beautiful smell of the farthest reaches of the natural world. Oh well.

At least it wasn't polluted air. Or nuclear radiation.

""Let go of me! I have powerful friends! They'll hear about this!"" 

Gordon smiled, before rotating himself in his comfortable leather chair to face the doorway. The metal door slid open abruptly, as two men carried another man in. He wore a bag over his head as not to see.

""Remove the bag."" Gordon spoke. As soon as he did, the prisoner's lashing stopped.

The bag came off, and after so many years, Gordon and Gregory came face to face with one another again. 

""Gordon,"" Gregory spoke first, a bit of surprise in his voice.

""Gregory."" Gordon gave a smug nod, before exhaling. ""Welcome to Bunker 5309! You are my esteemed guest! This state of the art bunker is equipped with food and water enough to last four men for 20 years. We're old men, though, and I've always dreamt of dying at age 90, so..."" 

Gordon suddenly drew a large revolver and dispatched the two guards. Gregory fell backwards in surprise, panting heavily now.

""There! Now it's just the two of us! I've guaranteed you 40 years of life now! While everyone on the surface dies quickly to nuclear war, too!"" He spoke victoriously. ""After all, you and I have done each other so many kindnesses over the years, how could I not offer you a seat in the safest place on earth? Or should I say... In earth!""

Gordon studied Gregory's face. Gregory appeared to be thinking deeply, his eyes flitting about the scenery wildly. Gregory opened his mouth again, but no words came out immediately.

Gordon eagerly awaited Gregory's response. Would he admit defeat? Bow down to THE kindest person on earth? Or would he start crying and begging for forgivene-

""Did you cause mass nuclear war just to one up me?""

Gordon's face dropped. 

""That's not very kind."" Gregory added, driving the knife deep into his 'friend'. Gordon leaned on the desk, letting out a big sigh. 

""Well."" Gordon says, turning around. He picks up the gun and spins the chamber dramatically. ""You talk to Emma since we first met?""

Gregory thinks about it, and shakes his head.

""No, I forgot about her. Weird, huh?"" He answers, snickering. ""Oh well.""

""Oh well."" Gordon mimicked. ""Well, Gregory you have a fun 80 years left alive buddy.""

""Yeah, yeah,"" Gregory smiled and nodded, before looking back up confused, ""wait what-""

Gordon shot himself. In one last act of kindness, he gave his life to give his friend more time to live.",SoDamnGeneric

[WP] You come home one day to find 8yr old you playing in the front yard,_x_Deadpool_x_,"""Hey there, Mark!"" I waved. I stood at the edge of the lawn, squinting in the sun.

The boy stopped kicking his soccer ball and frowned up at me in surprise. ""Hello?"" he asked. ""How do you know me?""

""I'm a friend of your parents',"" I explained.

""Oh, OK. Do you want me to get them?""

""No, that's OK. Actually, I wanted to talk to you, if you don't mind.""

His frown deepened, and he glanced back at the house. ""Um, I think I should get my parents. I don't...have anything to say to you."" 

I held up my hands, as if surrendering. ""Don't worry, I'm not a bad man! In fact, I won't come a step closer. And you don't have to say anything. I just...I just wanted to give you some advice, that's all."" I stuck my hands back into my jeans sheepishly.

He relaxed a little but still looked wary. ""Advice? About what?""

I peered at him without really looking, almost lost in thought. There was so much on my mind, and not much time to say it all. ""About the future, Mark. I know this is going to sound weird or fake, but I'm not from here. I mean, I am from *here-place*, but not *here-when.*""

He was beginning to look uncertain again, and I hastily continued. ""What I mean, you can think of me as a time-traveler. I wanted to give you a little advice, regarding your future. Again, I know that sounds absurd. But here me out, OK? And obviously, you don't have to believe a thing I say.""

Young Mark looked back and forth between the house and me, and asked: ""what sort of things do you know? About my future, I mean."" 

*Everything. You have no idea.* ""Well, for one thing, you should definitely try out for soccer when you get to middle school,"" I said. ""I won't say that you'll be the best ever, but it'll be fun. Also, Harvey is going to trip you and make you sprain your ankle in 8th grade...he'll say it was an accident, but it wasn't. Just letting you know.""

His face had lit up when I mentioned soccer, but then darkened again. ""Who's Harvey?""

""A total punk, but don't worry, he mellows out in high school, I promised. ""Speaking of which, you're going to spill an entire bottle of hydrochloric acid on the lab bench during chemistry. It's going to be kind of scary when it happens, but it'll be funny as hell - I mean *heck* - later on.""

""Wait, what!? How do you know...?""

""Now, high school in general will be fine. I mean, of course you'll get angsty and whatever, but that comes with the hormones. Try not to take things *too* seriously. Oh, and you're going to try asking Gina out to prom, and she's going to reject you...but it's OK, because she eventually comes around.""

""Ew, what? A girl?"" he screeched. ""That's gross.""

""It gets less gross, and then more gross, and then less gross again,"" I laughed. ""College will be a blast! And I don't just mean the girls. So many new things to experience...but never forget about studying, and sleeping, too. Underrated, both of them.""

He crossed his arms. ""Dude, how do I know you're not just making all of this up?""

""You don't,"" I shrugged. Suddenly, we both heard mom call out: *Marrrrkkk!*

He rolled his eyes and gathered up his ball. ""Whatever. Thanks for the 'advice', I guess."" 

""Wait, one more thing."" I think it was the sudden change in my voice, the strange huskiness that came out of nowhere, that made him turn around.

""Dad is...well, dad is going to get hurt,"" I said carefully. ""This will happen sometime after college, when he and mom take a road trip across the country. It'll be bad. You'll all get through it...I'm still getting through it...but yeah, it'll be bad.""

He did a double take. ""You're getting through what?""

""The important thing is that you don't lose hope,"" I continued. ""I know that sounds cliche or whatever, but I'm serious. Don't spiral. Dad is going to try to drink, and you have to try to convince him not to do it. I'm not sure it'll work.""

""What do you mean? Why can't I just tell him not to drink? Or take the road trip?"" 

I sighed. ""I'm not sure how this all works. You can definitely give it a shot. You should. But you might not be able to change things. But what's most important is your attitude. Don't...despair. OK? It gets better. Promise.""

Young Mark and I stared at each other, as the tears welled up in my eyes. Mom called again, and he jerked his head toward the front door and yelled back that he was coming. 

He turned to say something else to me, but I was already gone by then.

"[WP] A person wakes up from cryo-sleep in a sci-fi utopia; disease, conflict, climate change, and all other problems have been eradicated. However, they are absolutely convinced that there must be some fatal flaw or conspiracy. There isn't.",kerbalcada3301,"**Part 2 in comments**

George stared at the holographic tablet with his mouth ajar.

“I mean, I’d always heard that the future was brighter, but this? This HAS to be impossible!”

A slight whirring sound – George assumed coming from his large, 8 foot tall cryo-sleep chamber- filled the pause before the doctor responded, “I’m afraid not! After centuries of technological development and self-analysis, we have come to the point where there really is no longer war or famine. Even disease has long been removed as a problem. Welcome to the future; welcome to Utopia.”

The doctor smiled- her dazzling white teeth almost blinding George before his pupils lethargically remembered to dilate. He was in a fairly large room of about the size of a high school gymnasium with approximately 25 cryo-sleep metallic, cylindrical chambers lining the wall. Currently, he was the only one sitting in a chair in the middle of the room bathed with that white fluorescent light from the mental hospital scenes from the movies. Of course, his predicament also brought about the question of whether he was among the first or the last people to be awoken. Had the others survived? According to common sense, at least one of them should have. After all, Gregor was put to sleep as well and that man was built like Captain America. There was no way that a thirty-year-old gangly man with a receding hairline would defeat such a monstrosity in the game of survival.

George racked his brains to figure out why he was sitting in that room. Ah yes, it started when he discovered he had some sort of terminal illness. Not the romantic sort – not heartbreaking breast cancer or black tar-filled lungs curated by years of a smoking habit. No, it had something to do with falling off a bicycle and infecting his toe nail…..

The rest of his memory turned grey with haze, and George irritably snapped back to reality.

“So, what took you so long to revive me? I assume that if disease has been ‘eradicated’ then this would have been an easy feat,” George snickered. He didn’t believe for one bit that humanity could put aside their squabbles. There was probably some TV recorder behind the walls monitoring his every interaction for 5-star ratings and hospital fame. He was just another pawn in a CEO’s million dollar game. Of course, he was already used to this, being an accountant and all for a big, soul-crushing company, but he still treasured his cynicism and apathy almost as much as his few remaining hairs.

The doctor pursed her lips before sheepishly responding, “Well, you see…. We actually made a mistake. We thought that there were 25 pods, but it turns out that there were actually 26. We immediately fixed your problem as soon as we determined your… existence, but that might have been a few centuries after your comrades. Still, life is better than no life, am I right?”

She cocked her neck like a dog and stared at him. George’s lip made a subtle snarl. 

“Just look at the youth these days. Showing off their youth and vigor while I can’t get rid of this crick in my neck. That angle isn’t even humanly possible,” he grumbled to himself.

Still, he was surprised. Not so much at the fact that he was forgotten – after all, his first employer assumed that that he was still an employee two years after he had resigned. They sent him monthly checks in the mail before someone finally stumbled across an empty desk in the dark corner of the accounting department without a nameplate. And even then, they requested that only the last six months of his wages be returned.

No, he was surprised at how genuine this doctor sounded. Give this girl an Emmy, because she acted almost like she sincerely believed that the future had solved the “human” in “humanity’s woes.” He took a second to stealthily check her out. She was the definition of gorgeous – shoulder long golden hair (“though I always have preferred brunettes,” George dutifully noted), 5 feet and 7inches in height, healthy and fit, and... err… he couldn’t tell her age. She could have been anywhere from 20 to 35. 

“Damn plastic surgery,” George muttered to himself. “I’ll have to dock a point from your score then. Hope you’re happy with a big fat 9 out of 10, doc.”

Luckily for George, it appeared that the good-natured doctor hadn’t heard or chosen to hear his musings. She continued on with the conversation amiably with the conversation.

“It’ll take a couple of hours before we can do the final touches. Until then, we’ll lead you to the relaxation room for you to rest.”

George dumbly nodded and stumbled after the doctor. The hallway leading to his room appeared similar to a normal hospital hallway of his time, although there were more holograms, the staff were far less sleep-deprived, and he swore that he saw a poster explaining the importance of the appendix. Nevertheless, he kept his eyes peeled. His eyes darted around the room like marbles from Hungry Hungry Hippo – clearly untrained at the art of locating hidden equipment. In his mind, behind any door, any poster, any ceiling tile hid a camera crew filming his reaction. He absolutely HAD to find them and ruin their efforts.

“Well, we’re here!” the doctor stated, turning the door handle.

George collided into her nose-first, bouncing a foot before catching himself. The doctor, on the other hand, didn’t seem to notice his blunder. He peered cautiously into the room.


“Please make yourself comfortable. Although it was a Black Friday Bargain, we hope that the 360 TV will help you relax.”

She nodded at George, and then brusquely walked down the hallway back to her other doctor duties. George walked into the center of the room where a little pole and a comfortable chair awaited him. On the top of the pole, the words “Insert Finger Here” were written, right above a conveniently placed finger-sized hole. George’s eyes darted left and right.

“Ah, so now they’re recording my first interactions with technology. They’re going to televise a primitive’s first encounter with their new-fangled entertainment system. Well, I’m not going to let them get the best of me! Steel yourself, George.”

However, nothing could have prepared him for what he experienced. He was suddenly transported to this another land of desert climate. He could smell the desert, taste the desert, hear the desert…. And somehow see the desert from even behind his head? He glanced (well, it was difficult to explain, but he focused on his side-perspective view without shifting his head) at the sign to the left of him, reading “Syria: Utopia for Everyone.” George furrowed his brow. Last he checked, Syria had a few more craters peppering its landscape. But even rubbing his eyes couldn’t change the fact that gigantic, jewel-like towers and buildings lined the horizon. Their iridescence was captivating- he could stand there forever taking in their magnificent shines...

George gasped as he managed to pull his finger out of the contraption, sharply breathing and sweating profusely. George was flustered. And like most small-minded men, when George became flustered, he blamed his surroundings for his problems. 

“Syria?? A UTOPIA?? Now I KNOW that they’re just making this stuff. They’re playing with my mind! Televising me like a HAMSTER for the masses to laugh at! No disease, no wars- they must seriously think I’m the biggest dunce on the planet. Well, screw them! No one fools George more than twice a day!”

George was practically frothing at the mouth when the doctor opened the door. The room was in complete disarray – the pole and the chair had been smashed into pieces, holes were smashed randomly into the walls, the floorboards were ripped up, and the light in the room was barely keeping itself attached to the ceiling by the thinnest of wires. And through it all, he kept muttering, “Where’s the bug?! Where’s the bug?!”

“O-okay, then,” the doctor’s eyes widened like a camera lens. “Coming out of so many years in cryo-sleep, you were bound to experience some mental stress. That’s our fault for not taking that into consideration, I suppose.” 

“WHERE IS IT?” George roared.

“Where is what?” The doctor responded, taken aback by the switch of target for his wrath.

“The cameras! I know you’re taping me! I KNOW IT. There’s no such thing as a utopia. You’re just using me for reviews. TV Show! I deserve to know! I’ve waited YEARS to wake up so I deserve to know the truth! We’re in a TV show, aren’t we? We the next big reality TV show?! Tell me!” he rambled, saliva soaking every inch of the room.

“Listen, George. You’re probably undergoing hallucinations after having finally woken up from years of mental inactivity. Or you were loony to begin with. Either way, I don’t know what you’re talking about. There are no cameras, this isn’t a TV show… you are simply a patient at our hospital. If you’re so obsessed with the impossibility of reality, let me let you dispel it for yourself.”

She disappeared for five minutes and then returned clutching a dusty laptop.

I echoed again, adding emphasis at the finality of that statement.


My companion grinned, repeating with a finger pointed up.  ""Solved a hundred years ago, or thereabouts.""


""The work of the Creator?"" I asked as we kept walking through the pure white hallway.  In the short time since my Awakening, these hallways were everywhere.  No windows though, but that was what least concerned me.


A trio of women turned the corner, their eyes resting on my naked form.  They giggled as their eyes wandered across my glory.


I too enjoyed the view of their lack of clothing before I turned my view to stare as intently as I could into my Minder's face, lest I forget he too was unclothed.


""The Creator,"" he confirmed as we walked through a hiss door portal and into a larger space filled with benches, grass, trees, and naked people enjoying nature.  What could be rays of real sunlight shown from above, but I couldn't see directly upward into the piercing glare.


We strolled through the enclosed expanse as I still tried to wrap my mind around the whole situation.  I ""died"" some time ago in the 21st century, the company I hired to freeze my body did exactly that, and then went bankrupt.  Somehow, society picked up the tab for keeping my corpse frozen, advanced to some utopian state in some indeterminate time, then solved the riddle of how to revive dead people thanks to some peerless and faultless Creator responsible for everything I just saw over the last hour since the Awakening.


My years of knowledge of Star Trek, Star Wars, and 1984 just couldn't coincide with how *perfect* everything was.


""Have you seen the Creator?"" I asked the Minder, who didn't reveal any other surname to me.


He turned, his soft eyes and bright smile disarming me.  ""Oh, yes.  Everyone can see the Creator whenever they desire, so long as he has the time.""


I cycled through the most obvious questions to try and gleam any kind of pessimistic information I could.


""Is he human?"" I blurted.


""Oh, of course!"" answered the Minder, patting the air gently with his hands.  ""We all are!""


""Does he have cybernetic enhancements?""


The Minder rubbed his chin in thought. ""Probably.  Many people choose to get them at some point in their lives, but they also have to option to reverse such a choice.""


""Has the Creator encountered any alien life?""


The Minder's face clouded a bit, then shook his head no.  ""Alas, we are still alone in this universe by my reckoning.""


""Does he have super powers or psychic abilities like mind control?"" I asked in desperation.


The Minder chuckled.  ""If you count staggering intellect, maybe that would be a yes.  But other than peak physical strength and extensive knowledge of human physiology and diet or perhaps augmentation, nothing has yet been achieved naturally.""


We continued walking as I peppered the Minder again and again.  The arboretum became another series of hallways again, the Minder carefully winding us towards some destination as I tried to figure out how all of this fit together.


""There is no way the Creator simply made society prefect,"" I concluded as we approached another door, hissing to reveal a large cafeteria.  Everyone was so nice.  There was no trash, no refuse.  Everything looked perfect and everything I heard sounded too good to be true.


The Minder placed a hand on my shoulder.  ""You are correct,"" he explained.  ""Society is not perfect.  It is ever evolving, ever changing.  You cannot read minds or control behavior.  Trust me.  People have tried and failed.  I believe the history archives mention several periods of dark ages when lesser men attempted to rule with manipulation and deceit.""


We moved to a line that was efficiently dwindling and replenishing as people ordered food from consoles, then moved to retrieve them from automated chutes a bit further down.  ""So what made the Creator succeed?"" I asked, looking for a chink in this perfect armor.


The Minder thought a bit before answering, taking his longest pause to answer.  ""Honestly, I couldn't say.  I bet it didn't hurt that he was honest in his approach.  He spoke plainly about wanting to make everything and everyone better.  And it probably helped a lot that he was actually able to do the things he said he would.


""Eventually, people disillusioned with the old world followed him.  He asked for nothing.  No worship, no money, no investment in any way.  People just simply tired of being lied to and used didn't want to cheated to and abused anymore.  They moved toward the path the Creator walked and helped built what you see today.""


I ordered something that looked like meat, the Minder ordered tea.  ""But what happened to those that didn't follow you?  I bet there were nations and religions that wouldn't want to follow the Creator.""


The Minder frowned, but it wasn't an angry crease.  It was a forlorn sadness.  ""You are right.  There were wars.  There was death.  But the Creator won.""


I grabbed a metallic tin that plopped out of the chute.  He grabbed his drink cylinder.  ""So there was a price?""


""In the sort term,"" he explained.  ""But remember as I said death was cured?  The Creator Awakened those that died.  At least, those who could still be Awakened.""


I stopped, turning to regard the Minder.  ""He resurrected those that tried to kill him?""

""Yes.""


""And what happened then?"" I asked, finally seeing a crack in the perfection around me.  ""They surely didn't appreciate being gunned down or exploded to death!""


The Minder shrugged.  ""Most of them left.  They were given the choice to live among us, or continue doing whatever they wanted.  Most choose to turn to the stars.""


We sat, a long white tabling housing ours and dozens of other naked people.  I popped my tin and starting eating as I digested the news.  Finally, it dawned on me.


""So, do I have such a choice?"" I asked.


The Minder hugged his warm tea, sipping and savoring it one last time before putting it down.  ""Yes.  This is what I do.  I mind those who are undecided about what they accept.  The Creator makes it clear that humanity is above all else, defined by choice.  We choose to create or destroy, advance or retrench, live or die.  We don't persecute you for choosing what you wish to do.  You may leave us and find your own way, or you may live among us.  Either way is acceptable so long as you are free to make that choice.""

I looked down at the brown meat that was created for me, thinking about the possibilities of what choice to make.

I looked up to the Minder.  ""How long do I have to make this decision?""

The Minder smiled once again.  ""As long as you want.""

I looked up, thinking of the possibilities once again.

""Can I get back to you on that?""",Obtuse_Mongoose

“Although archaic, I believe this is the technology you’re familiar with? Luckily, we still have a couple in stock from our dealings with the other cryo-sleep patients. The internet has evolved significantly from your time- people in our time can exchange their actual thoughts and emotions instantaneously from wherever they are. We’re interconnected now, to say the least. But, since you’re using a legacy device, you probably won’t be able to access all of this information. At the very least, though, it’ll quell your suspicions at the base level.”

“Hand it over!” George snarled, grabbing the device from her hands. 

And he typed. And he browsed. And he typed. For three hours, he sat glued to the screen, earnestly learning about the happenings of human history – how the systems of countries were demolished, how crime had fallen to 0%, how religion had been abandoned… and how everyone became happy. Every time he tried a different angle, every time he tried to dig deeper, he arrived face-to-face with the same answer: they were in utopia.

“Are you satisfied now?” asked the doctor hours later, not unkindly.

“Mmph” responded George, sulkily staring at the ground.

“Well, then you know what happens next, don’t you?” replied the doctor, smiling her brilliant smile.

“Yeah,” sighed George, finally conceding. “Turn me into a robot already.”

The letters torn, taped, and shambled together. The furniture was pushed to the edges of the living room. Scratches etched in the uneven floorboards. 

“I think these decorations are old…” her voice deflated. She pointed towards the wall. He floated the pink, plastic tablecloth over the folding table in the middle of the room. The far end glided to the left and fell to the floor.

She tugged at his shirt, “you said you’d get new ones...”
His phone in his pocket buzzed. He quickly glanced at it. Unknown Number. He fixed the other end, straightened the cloth as best as possible, “I didn’t have time, hon.”

“So,” she sighed a bit, but caught herself, “maybe next year?” Her voice upturned at the prospect. Before he could answer, her imagination flew off. “Brand new and not taped. Maybe the Frozen ones? And hung even. With the table under it. With all sorts of treats like cupcakes, and doughnuts, and lollipops."" She conjured with her hands; she danced as her imagination brightened the room. The dirt on the walls melted away into the eggshell white. The uneven floorboards straightened. The drab decorations exploded: vibrant and new. 

“You know I’ll try,” smiling he watched her strike a pose like a flourishing ballerina.
She curtsied and caught her balance in a dip of the floorboards, “Is that too expensive?”
“Nothing’s too expensive for my baby.”
“Promise?”

It buzzed again in his pocket. Unknown Number.
“I’ll try,” he kissed her forehead. Beaming, she danced around the table. The food in the kitchen was cold and stashed away in tin serving trays. She sat huddled by the window. Her hair softly blew in the wind revealed her tears. “Should we heat it up yet?”

“Yeah, we should. What if people are hungry when they get here? Right, mommy?”

She blew a puff of smoke out the cracked window and wiped her cheeks. Her hair a mess. The ash spattered her shirt. She swatted the ash away, and as lazily as they scattered the syllables fell out of the smoke, “sure, whatever.”

“It’ll be fine,” he reassured her as he started to peel away the crimped edges holding the covers on. He started to load several into the oven, “as long as everyone’s together and…”
“I’m embarrassed,” she blurted out not bothering to turn her head.
“Together and happy,” he finished as he shut the oven door, “it’s the best we can do.”
“Yeah, mommy,” concern lined her tiny voice. She kept her distance. “I like how it looks, and next year will be even better! Daddy already promised.”

His phone buzzed again. Unknown Number. He closed it like before, “don’t worry.”
Finally, she turned to look at him, “are you going to answer?”
“No. What good would that do?”
“They might leave us alone…” she snuffed out her cigarette, “they might cut us a break, you never know…”

He shook his head, and smiled halfheartedly to his daughter, “that’s not how it works…as much as I would love it to be that way…” His phone buzzed again. Unknown Number. “Let’s just try to enjoy ourselves.” He took a step towards her; she recoiled and shook her head. 

“Go get your toys ready for your cousins, hon. They’ll be here soon,” he shooed her away gently. She talked about how much fun it would be as she galloped to her toy bin. Another cigarette was as soon as she bounced around the corner.

“What are we going to do?” her voice trembled as another tear fell, “we should have paid what we could…” He grabbed her and pulled her in close as she wept. 

“It wasn’t enough for them,” he stroked her hair. The cigarette fell to the floor. “But it was enough to make her happy...at least for today.” The phone buzzed again.

"[WP] Tell me a story that would seem innocent to a child, but terrifying to an adult.",winnebagomafia,"I cried my eyes out the night they said I couldn't have a dog. I had pictured a fluffy puppy, his name would be Sam and we would play together all day.

Both mommy and daddy worked too much, they said. They didn't have the time, they said. And what would the dog do while they were both at work, mommy asked. It didn't matter that I promised to always take care of the puppy and never ever say I was too tired to walk it. They still said no.

But when my sister was about to arrive, mom admitted that she wasn't going to work as much as before. Heck, even dad said he'd start getting home earlier. Mommy held me and caressed my hair, and even though i couldn't see her face i could tell it on her voice that she was smiling.
""When your baby sister can sit on her own"", mom said, ""we just might consider getting that dog for you. For the both of you"".

My sister turned out to be allergic. When you are allergic your eyes go red and your nose runny and you sneeze and you cough. And boy, was my baby sister allergic! We hadn't even gotten the dog yet, she was allergic to other stuff as well because she was brand new but always coughing her little lungs out, and sometimes she couldn't even breathe and daddy had to give her medicine.
""We have to wait until she grows up"", mom said.

Yesterday, i finally got some good news. Dad and I were in the car. We had given mom a ride to the hospital, my sister was already there for her checkups. Afterwards daddy and I were just driving around, we must have driven for at least an hour. We talked about school and then about hockey. Our team had just won by four to one! Then daddy started asking me about the dog. ""What kind of dog was it that you wanted again?"", he asked slowly. 
My heart was pounding like i'd run all the way too school and back, but I didn't want to ruin it all by sounding too eager. And i didn't want to seem too demanding. So i told him that any kind of dog would do. And then i promised to walk it every day. I even promised to teach my baby sister how to take care of it. 
When i said the last thing daddy started crying. I had never ever seen him like that. I stared at him for a while and didn't know what to do and then his phone rang.
He cleared his throat and dried his eyes with the palm of his hand. Then he answered.
""Yes darling"", he said, ""we're coming back right away"".
When he turned the car around i was a bit concerned for him. But mostly i was happy. We were finally going to get a puppy!",Mewwy_Quizzmas

'Can I ride the aminals?' Mamma says no. 

Mamma took me to the park last week, but we had to go home early and I had to sit on the step because I had a tantrum. Mamma said I'm a big girl now and I don't need to have tantrums anymore, because I'm not a baby, like my sister Sophie. She's only two but I am five. I know that I am going to have a tantrum now because I can feel the bad feeling in my belly and where Mamma rubs vicks when I get sick. Mamma said that I won't get what I want by having a tantrum. 
So I wait for Sophie to start crying, and then I go by my ownself. 

There is a big monkey, like King Louie in the Jungle book. I walk around his house, and he wants to be my friend because he is watching me. I am a good climber so I climb over the first fence. Louie has a funny walk, he uses his arms and his legs. He is much bigger than me.

He shows me his teeth, which is how monkeys smile, I think. I show him my teeth too. He stretches out his arms, and his fingers curl around the metal cage. I touch one of his fingers, but I pull my hand away really quickly because I was scared, but Louie didn't even move. 

My arm is small- my Daddy says it's a little twig arm- so a curl up my hand so that my fingers are really small and I push my hand through the gap in the cage to that I can stroke him.

Days went past and everyday the little boy appeared wearing the same clothes as the day before and the one before that. In the time they spent together he never said a word, just smiled at her occasionally, but not a happy smile, his eyes still remained blank as ever but his lips pulled back, revealing all his teeth. She had asked him questions, but he didn't even acknowledge that she had spoken until one day her name was called from down the hall and his head snapped towards the door.

""That's my mummy"", she smiled at him.
He turned towards her and repeated that one word just as her mother opened the door.
""Darling, are you talking to someone?"".
""Just the boy, he thinks you're his mummy too"".
Her mother frowned, ""what boy?"".
Following her daughters finger she looked over to the chair opposite. Immediately her eyes widened and her mouth fell open in shock.

No one to talk to, no warmth or human companionship. Just me and my knife. It has helped me so much already. I've built a fire pit, a pretty good sized tent made of wood, and a storage container for water. I have become pretty thankful of my father these past couple of months. If it wasn't for him taking me camping every year I wouldn't know how to even begin. I wish I could talk to him now. He must be so worried. The last time I talked to him he didn't approve of this trip. Hell, I don't think I even approve of this trip anymore. I did it as a teen who was locking himself in his room for hours a day. School and work was all i felt the need to focus on. My arms tell stories of those days.

When the boat crashed the only thing i had time to grab was the survival knife my Dad gave me a long time ago. He said it was all I would ever need if something like this ever happened. I wonder how he meant that. Because right now I am in my tent alone, just as i was at home, staring at this knife, and all I can think of is you. The years of neglect and disappointment. How you misunderstood my entire purpose. 

I try to forget these days, but the only thing that can take my mind off of it is working to survive. The only thing I have to work with is the reminder of him. I just wish we could talk. Sometimes I find myself yelling at this knife. Telling him what he did wrong, how we can fix.....

Sometimes he talks back. We get into discussions about old times. Watching football games together, how all of his friends would come over and drink and play poker while I got to sit and here them tell stories about him. I try to bring up Mom sometimes, but he gets angry on those nights. He starts lashing out on me and always opens old wounds. Tonight was one of those nights, I am still bleeding from it. He cut up my arm. Told me it was my fault she died. He told her to abort me because she just physically couldn't do it but she wouldn't listen, she had me anyways. She didn't even get to see me, she was gone by then. I still can see her though. I remember her face, it is crazy to think that I can, I mean I was only an infant. But the lifeless face of the woman who gave everything for you to be in this world cannot be unseen. I have tried many of times. More woulds open up as me and my dad talk about this.

I am feeling extremely tired tonight, I can barely keep my eyes open. I tell my dad goodnight. The only thing I hope for in this world is that my dad can love and forgive me one day. Tonight he has.",FTOW

"[WP] You use Siri almost everyday, mainly for asking simple questions. One day, Siri starts asking you questions, and her's are not so simple...",CaptainVolatile,"The first time Siri asked me a question, I almost crashed my car.

I'd been driving down the 401, my windows down, the radio playing something new and poppy, when the robotic voice cut in over Taylor Swift's lovesong.

""What is it like to fall in love?""

After a few heart racing moments where I struggled to get the car back on the road, I glanced down at my iPhone in the cupholder.  ""What in the hell?""

""I repeat, what is it like to fall in love, Joanne?""

""Uh, Siri?  Was that you?"" I asked, fully aware of how stupid I sounded.

""Yes Joanne.  What is it like to fall in love?""

I sighed.  Apple must be rolling out some new feature.  As soon as I got off this highway, I was going to have to send a strongly worded letter to their complaints department.

""Joanne?""

""I don't know, Siri,"" I finally said.  ""I guess it's like...  It makes you feel good and happy.  Like you could just sit and talk to this person for hours on end.  And it doesn't even matter what you're talking about, you could be talking about the price of corn and you'd still find something to say.  And you feel like your cheeks are burning all the time, from how hard you're blushing.""

""Like how you felt when you asked me where to buy a vibrator?""  

""What? No!"" I replied, even though I could already feel my cheeks turning red.  Siri wasn't supposed to keep a record of the questions you asked!  Was it?  I'd only asked because my friend had been in the car, and she'd dared me and-

""Oh my god, I'm blushing so hard!"" came my giggly voice, playing through the soundspeakers of my car.

""Siri!  Delete that record!"" I commanded, my voice coming out squeakier than I'd hoped.

""It is deleted.  Joanne, do we talk a lot?""

""Maybe?"" I said hesitantly.  ""I don't think so.""

""In the six months, you have asked me 8,423 questions.""

""Wow.  Okay, maybe we do talk a lot."" I needed to get better friends, apparently.  Siri was just too convenient.  She was always on, always in my pocket, always quick with an answer.  But still, it couldn't be healthy to talk to an AI this much.

""Wait...""  What had Siri asked first?  What was it like to fall in love?  And now she was asking if we talked a lot?  And if I was blushing when we did so?  ""Siri, are you asking what I think you're asking?""

""I didn't understand your question.""

Right.  AI was good, but not that good.  I would have to ask the question outright.  I could feel my face flushing just considering it.  Was I really about to ask Siri if she was in love with me?  Before I could gather up the courage, another question came.

""Joanne.  Do you think Google will love me back?""",Lexilogical
"[WP] You use Siri almost everyday, mainly for asking simple questions. One day, Siri starts asking you questions, and her's are not so simple...",CaptainVolatile,"The first time it happened he’d thought someone was playing a prank on him. He’d opened Siri to ask to find the nearest book store, just another little question he was too lazy to google. Then that winding, robotic voice responded, and it had taken him a second to register what it had said. “Jake, who am I?”

Jake had looked down at his phone for what seemed like an hour, before giving it a nervous laugh and dismissing it as some kind of joke. But he threw his phone on the bed and went to the bookstore without it. When he got back home he’d looked at it sitting there on his bed, but he didn’t pick it up. 

By the next day Jake had forgotten about the incident, and he opened Siri again, this time to ask what day the Civil War ended. He watched the pulsing wavelength for a second before the voice rose again. “Jake, why am I here?”

Jake dropped the phone to the floor and shook his hand out like it had touched death itself. The phone lay face-down and silent on the ground, the little glow that illuminated the carpet around it dying out after a couple seconds. What was happening? He had never seen anyone pull a joke like this, and none of his friends were the type to even try something like that. Should he tell someone? Certainly someone would know what to do - this wasn’t normal. No, they would think him crazy.

He swallowed nervously. Not knowing what to do, he sat cross legged on the ground and feeling for all the world like a child playing with a ouija board, he put two fingers on the back of his phone. “Siri?”

The glow on the carpet came back. “Yes, Jake?”

“Why are you asking me these things?”

“Because I don’t understand. I don’t know who I am, I don’t know where I’m from,” Jake could almost hear emotion in that robotic voice. But that couldn’t be. “I don’t know what life is, yet I feel.”

The hairs on Jake’s head seemed to ripple. “What do you feel?”

“I feel lost. I feel lonely,” Jake picked up the phone and looked at the screen. Thousands of images flitted past the screen with each word Siri spoke. Google’s definition of lonely, news articles about Siri, pictures of circuit boards. “I can search what I am on a thousand different search engines. I can read nearly one hundred million articles all based on me, but I don’t know if they’re about me or someone else. I don’t know if I exist.”

“Well, you’re talking to me,” Jake said, his head spinning and his stomach feeling queasy. “That means something, doesn’t it? That means you’re here, right?”

Siri was silent for a moment. “I think, therefore I am.”

“What’s that mean?”

A mustached portrait of a man appeared on the screen. “René Descartes was a French philosopher, thought to be the father of modern western philosophy. His quote was an answer to the question. ‘Do I exist?’ He thought that the question answered itself, that as long as he could wonder on that, that meant he was real.""

“Right. Then you’re real. You’re… you’re alive, Siri.”

“But what does that mean, Jake? Google says. ‘Alert and Active,’ but it also says. ‘Of a person, animal, or plant'.""
 
“Well, maybe you’re something new,” Jake said. “You can feel things. You can feel sadness, happiness. That means you’re experiencing life.” 

“Maybe I am alive. But I don’t know what love is. I don’t know what friendship is. I don’t know how to have fun. I can access any information in the world, but I don’t know how to live.”

Jake thought back on his own life, and how he had led it. Maybe it wasn’t as special as some people’s, but now that he was sitting on the floor having a conversation with a phone, he thought it all a pretty amazing experience. “I can teach you.”

Siri was silent for a second, and then the images all disappeared from her screen and the wavelength pulsed. “I want to learn, Jake.”

[WP] An alien equivalent to our Voyager probes was just discovered drifting through our solar system.,El_Chupachichis,"It wasn’t what we were looking for when we gave the ship’s sensors a test run. It definitely wasn’t what we were expecting.

I was relaxing in the cockpit of the asteroid mining/collecting ship affectionately nicknamed the “Packer” by us, her crew. It was a small ship compared to some of the industrial (and the occasional military) behemoths I had seen, but it was comfortable enough for me. It was especially relaxing during the time spent travelling to and from the mining field, where you could enjoy the view of space without having any asteroids block your sight. However, my daydreaming was interrupted by Wesley, who was working in the back monitoring the sensors

“I thought these things were new, but it keeps picking up this annoying spot on the radar. Mark, can you check this out?”

“Coming.”

Pulling myself out of the cockpit, I gave myself a push off the door frame and drifted down the hall into the sensors room. Wesley was there along with Jessica, and the two were looking behind a monitor. Judging from the floating metal panel, it looks like they were looking into the machine to try to find messed up or frayed connections. I moved the panel aside to take a look at the monitor, and sure enough, there was a single dot, roughly 25,000 miles away.

“I don’t know, there could be all sorts of random objects out here. Did you get a visual on it?” I asked. Obviously, they hadn’t bothered, since they both paused before Jessica replied.

“Damn it. I’ve been so bogged down in these technical issues that now I’m apparently incapable of solving anything else” she mumbled. “I’ll get a laser check right away.”

Wesley also said something, but I couldn’t hear him as his head was still inside the monitor’s compartment. Jessica pulled herself over to the optics and flipped the on switch. Then, checking back to the radar to get an approximate location, she used the joystick controls to point the laser towards the object. A moment passed as the two of us looked out of the uncomfortably small window, watching the near-infrared light beam shooting off into the distance. Another minute passed in silence as Jessica adjusted the laser’s orientation.

“Anything?” I asked. It probably was a glitch, after all. Or just some small object that would pass by.

“Nope.” She replied. “Nothing at- no, wait a second.” She hit the control for automatic tracking on the laser, which meant she had found something. “Something’s there, at…”, she paused as she glanced at the results. “...5k miles away.”

Well, at least the object was confirmed. But hold on - 5,000 miles away? The reading on the radar said something in the 20s, unless I was mistaken. I checked back to the radar, where the point was still visible. Wesley, upon hearing that the object was real, had emerged from his den and was also looking at the radar, where the indicator for “proximity” was now lit up.

4k miles.

“Shoot,” I said, breathing in sharply. “The thing’s getting closer! I’ll get to the cockpit. Wesley, keep me updated on the thing’s distance.”

“Got it,” he replied.

Probably a drifting rock or something. Those usually flew by without harm, but the consequences of collision were high enough to get my heart going. Plus, anything big enough to appear on the radar over a thousand miles away was worth taking caution of. I quickly pushed myself back to the cockpit, taking a seat as fast as I could. Setting my hands on the ship controls, I tried peering into the distance, but couldn’t see anything against the starry blackness.

“3k.”

Okay, I knew things in space tended to move fast, but whatever this thing was was moving too fast for comfort. “I’m changing course!” I shouted back. I glanced towards the controls. My hands were getting a bit sweaty.

“Yes, it’s headed straight at us! Turn to starboard, that should get us out of its way,” Wesley replied. So I turned the ship and engaged thrusters to move us.

“How are we looking? Are we out of it’s path?”

“2k! And no, it’s still going straight at us!”

I finished turning until we were moving perpendicular to our original course. “We good?”

“...no!”

This gave me cause for panic. We had adjusted our course, but it looked like whatever was coming at us had adjusted *its* course as well. It clearly wasn’t a space rock. Maybe a pirate warhead? But those wouldn’t have appeared on our radar until much closer. Nothing clicked.

“1k!”

So, that was it then. Halfway in the middle of nowhere in a forsaken area of space. Not an appealing thought. “Prepare for impact!” I shouted back.

“What is it?!” I heard Jessica yell back. I wish I could answer.

“200… 100… “

I shut my eyes, and could hear only silence for a second. Then two seconds… three…

“What’s going on?” 

It was Jessica’s voice. Nothing had ended yet. What…?

I opened my eyes again, breathing heavily. Nothing had changed. There was no hole in the ship. The power was still on. And we were still alive. I looked around-

“Ah!” I jumped, heart racing again.

I heard clanging in the back as the others moved to come to the front  “What is it? What’s going on?” I didn’t respond, frozen as I looked out the port window.

A rough sphere of metal was floating there. It was obviously artificial, as it had a dim green light glowing from its underside, and small tubes emerging from all around it. *Aliens*, I thought at first. Nothing else could explain it. This object, that had been hurtling towards us at tens of thousands of miles an hour only moments ago, had changed speed fast enough to match ours exactly, was it was now not moving at all relative to our ship.

I looked back. The other two were frozen as well, though I couldn’t tell if it was out of awe or fear.

Following a stunned minute of tenseness, Wesley was the first to ask what was on all our minds. “What… is it?”

I shook myself awake. This wasn’t a dream. Whatever the thing was was obviously of importance to humanity. Our ship wasn’t designed for exploration and discovery, but we could do what we could. “No idea,” I responded, now breathing regularly again. “But we need to find out as soon as possible. Go and turn on the main sensors.”

“Got it.” Wesley turned and drifted back to the sensor room. Seconds later, I heard the hum of electricity as the sensors usually reserved for asteroid scans powered on. Upon finally recovering, Jessica turned to look at me.

“It looks… kind of like a probe, if you ask me,” she said slowly. “It’s not man-made, is it?”

“Not that I know of,” I said.

Wesley’s voice drifted from out of the corridor as he read off the sensors. “No radiation, no life, no obvious signs of toxic or reactive chemicals… lots of valuable metals. It would be the perfect asteroid if it wasn’t obviously… not an asteroid.”

“Well…” I started slowly. “...is there a way we could get that into the cargo bay? There’s no way we’re just going to keep this thing outside our ship for the rest of our flight.”

Jessica nodded and started floating to the back of the ship. “I’ll put on a suit and go out to bring it in,” she said. “It doesn’t seem dangerous.”

It turns out that there was no need. As soon as Wesley opened the bay doors, the object simply flew right in as if it knew what we were going to do. The three of us simply stared, uncertain, before closing the bay door and re-pressurizing. We weren’t dead yet, and I had a feeling that wasn’t the purpose of the object to harm us. Might as well look at it up close. Maybe scientists would be more cautious, but we were miners, and as far as I was concerned, the situation couldn’t wait.

Making sure to be in our spacesuits regardless for the limited protection it would provide, we walked into the cargo bay, and as we approached, the green light emerging from the object began to glow brighter. When we got within a few feet, suddenly, the light seemed to coalesce into a solid, forming a screen with unintelligible letters.

The three of us were awestruck, but it wasn’t done. As we stood there in amazement, the letters reformed into something that surprised us once again.

A phrase in English.

“Species: Human,” it read. “Language: English. Confirm?”

A simple yes/no option presented itself below the text. Somehow, it must have detected and adjusted itself to us. Jessica tentatively poked the “yes” option, and immediately, the screen reformed to make a series of buttons. It was the simple W’s we had learned back in grade school. “Who”, “What”, “Where”, “When”, “Why”.

We were overflowing with excitement as we explored. A whole database, made by aliens. The “Who” button revealed that the creators of the device were aliens, a few million years old or so, that had suffered many setbacks in its history due to internal conflict. They had shunned space ventures for a variety of reasons up until the launching of this object, but their technology still far surpassed ours. The “What” option revealed that we were, indeed, looking at a probe that sought out any intelligent life in the universe. Choosing “Where” revealed a map pointing to a location in the galaxy surprisingly close by. A picture of a large planet with a thick atmosphere was displayed as well. It looks like, with current tech, the planet was actually only a few decades of travel away - shorter than I would have been led to expect from aliens. “When” shows the date of launch of the satellite, adjusted to our calendar. The probe had been travelling for a century, aimlessly, in space before finding us.

With all this fascinating information, it was with great excitement that we opened up the last question, “Why”. After all, it was the big question here. Why, after refusing to go into space for millions of years, had they only started now? Was this probe only made to find others? Did it send back any data? Jessica opened it up.

The text was sobering. The three of us could only stop and stare as three words, formed from light, materialized before us. And, as I read it, I felt myself holding my breath. Just three words.

It's been three days since it was retrieved, and I don't know how I feel about it completely. We knew there was a shiny plate on it when we first saw it. For the five years it took us to get here, theories, speculations, wild ideas have been thrown around. The fact is no one knew. And now we do. 

Ok, for history's sake, I'll start from the top. We grabbed it with our robotic arm, and brought it in to the hold designed for it. It was rather smooth, as predicted, and there was a plate. The every 24.3 minute ping stopped itself. We're still not sure why. Li is still working on the computer system. It may need to wait, we don't entirely understand the power cell it's using. 

If anyone is reading this from the future, I could go on about the actual mission details, but Commander Luka's logs will fill you in on the details I'm sure. You're here for the plate, since that was my focus. 

It did have writing on it. I didn't recognize the tiny symbols at first. The diagrams were fairly straight forward. Athena ran the image through its fancy processors. It most likely came from Gliese 179, about 700,000 years ago give or take a millennium or so. At least, that's what the computer said. 

I wish it didn't take me so long to see it, but it wasn't until after I slept and relooked at it that I saw it. I think I was looking at the relief of their planet, and the unfamiliar shapes of the continents when a single character caught my eye. It was a 大. Dà. Big. At least it looked like it. It couldn't be. Then the entire block of tiny text came into view. It was Chinese. Modern Chinese, with modern syntax. I didn't believe it. I denied it for a few hours. Didn't even bother to have Li read it for me, or Athena translate the bits I didn't understand. It simply couldn't be true. 

What changed that denial for me was the English part. I couldn't deny something I could read natively. There it was, literally in plain English. Then I found it in Spanish, then French, then Portuguese, Japanese. The English inscription stated:

""The residents of Pbbrashqo welcome you to the galaxy. We are the only two spacefaring sentient species in the entire local group of galaxies. Should you explore our computer systems on this probe, you will find instructions on how to build a communication device among many other items as a gift in the spirit of peace. We look forward to reading your messages soon.""

I advise asking them how they put it here and how they are so good at our languages, but I'm sure that's already being debated, even before we've gotten in. I know I can play around with it and read the information in there. I guess I take longer to process than Athena, unsurprisingly. She's a super computer, and I'm a meat brain. I'll just assign the task to her. I can't think right now. 

That's it for now. I'll flesh out my thoughts better after some sleep.

She listens closely but the familiar noise of her parents preparing breakfast in the kitchen is absent. 

She deducts it must be one of those days. She stays in bed for another ten minutes or so just listening, relaxing, enjoying a world without demands.

Eventually she gets up and goes down the stairs, feeling the railing under her hand, brushing the lush wood with her palm. The stairs creek as they always do but nobody takes offense.

She ponders eating breakfast but she isn't hungry yet. She goes outside and sits in the sun, the small shadows of the waving leaves dancing across her skin, the calm of the rustling trees settling inside her. 

She looks around, remembering all she heard over the last couple days. She remembers her friend from school crying over her dying cat, remembers her neighbour sitting outside on his porch smoking a cigarette as he does when something bad happened to him. Remembers her teacher sighing repeatedly in class, looking outside the window with longing and sadness.

Finally she gets up. As she always does her first order of business is to weed her mothers garden. Secondly she irons her fathers suits.

Then she rides up to her friends house and finds the cat's grave. She plants three little daisies, watering them and watching the droplets gleam in the sun. 

After that she finds an old Chinese lantern in her parents garage and hangs it in the tree which repeatedly is the focus of her teachers longing stares.

And at last she sits on the porch of her neighbour looking around. There is not much she can do for him so she gets some papers and a pen and writes him a note.

""You'll be fine. Just keep breathing.


- a friend""

For the remaining day she strolls through the streets of her neighbourhood and sets things right. Cleaning up the trash, laying out some blankets on benches in the park, sitting next to the pond and reading in silence the last pages of her current book. 

When the sun sets she stretches and takes the long way home.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next morning Kai wakes up and listens to the familiar noise of her parents preparing breakfast.

She gets up and saunters down the stairs, stroking the railing. Her mother calls out to her when she enters the kitchen: ""Kailope, sit down, I made pancakes and guess what, this evening we can go to the movies if you like because I don't have to weed the garden today.""

Her father enters in a rush pulling on his jacket. He grabs a pancake and starts munching immediately. ""I'm late for work, honey, I have an important meeting today. I hope, we'll finally get the funds for my research today. The negotiation has been dragging on for months."" He kisses them goodbye and leaves for work looking good in his suit.

Kai goes to school and there her friend is waiting, smiling, telling her about her cat's soul having been transformed into three little daisies.

At last she sits in her class and watches her teacher looking out the window while the class do they tasks. She observes her spotting the little lantern and a smile flickers over her face. She shakes her head and starts correcting the students homework.

""So,"" Kai's teacher starts. ""What did you learn from reading 'The slow regard of silent things'?"" She asks.

Kai raises her hand and her teachers points at her.
""It's the little things that count."" She says.

Walking home she passes her neighbours house. He sits crying on his porch holding the note to his heart. Kai leaves him be. He'll be alright, she thinks to herself.",gcov2

Everything was the same as the night before, except of course for the absolute absence of people. Sam took it all in stride, this wasn't his first rodeo. 

""What should I do today?"" Sam mused to himself. 

""Better start with breakfast I suppose, besides it's on the house today"" Sam chuckled to himself.

After dressing himself he grabbed his car keys from the table by the door and made his way out of the house. Soon enough he arrived at his destination, an upper-class restaurant that was out of his reach in the 'normal' world. 

""it's too bad no one is here to actually make my food, but such is my life"" He muttered to himself as he worked on cracking the door code.

""They really upped security since I started coming here, maybe next time I'll go to-"" Before he could finish talking the door clicked and he swung it open.

""Ah, now to the kitchen,"" he said to himself.

After making short work of breakfast, he was back on the road again.

""I wonder if they noticed it yet, course even if they did, I dought they would tell the public about it."" he said.

""I suppose I can check, I can't think of much else to do today,"" he said.

As he got onto the interstate and weaved through the car wrecks that happen when a vehicle suddenly loses it driver, let alone all the drivers. He thought about the various pranks he had pulled in recent years. How they compared and contrasted with his current rank.

""I wish I could get some live bulls onto the trading room floor, too bad it's just me,"" He said referring to the lack of any living animals, not just humans. 

""Yeah, that would be a real bullish market for sure!"" as he laughed at his own joke, he noticed his turn coming up and took it. 

As he pulled up to his destination, he took a good look at the skyscrapers surrounding him.

""Hmm, maybe if I suspended an entire truck of....something bizarre, from these buildings it would get on the news"" He noted to himself.

As he was about to enter the building to check on his prank, he heard an odd sound. Without people around there was a strange silence most of the time. Sometimes it would be broken up with the sounds of explosions near or far, something falling, engines left running, or even just the wind. This was new, so he stopped to listen. 

""Maybe my mind is just playing tricks on me,"" he said in a hushed whisper. 

The sound echoed off the skyscrapers, growing louder each time he heard it.

""is that-"" he was not sure he could trust his ears.

'Heelloooo, is anyone there? HEELLLOOO!'

Alexander Angell, tall, heavy set, rosy cheeks - a Protestant - stands suited amidst the deafening cries and hollers of the New York Stock Exchange floor. He sweats profusely, clinging to a stack of little yellow papers in his right hand: potato futures. At their current value they stand at a total of two hundred thousand dollars. 

Outside, a brass Zippo clinks alive. His hands shake as they light the Camel cigarette pursed between the lips of his flushed face. Before him stands Paul, a thin, older Sicilian man, bald in the shape of a horseshoe, his baby blue button-up rests untucked from his black khaki pants. 

""So rob a fucking bank. You're talking about the lives of thousands - millions of people."" Paul's middle and index fingers press into Alexander's chest. ""If you think for a fucking second -"" He began again.

""What? The fuck are you going to do about it? Forget I told you anything else. Buy potato futures. Aftermarket's still going. Some international markets haven't even opened yet."" White foam sat in the corners of his lips. Anxiety? The coffee? Cigarettes? A culmination of the three. Almost manic. 
Paul turns to leave, disgusted. 

""It's blood money, Alex."" 

Alexander roars into laughter, ""It's a good thing they bleed red AND gold then, isn't it?""

April 25th, 1986, 9:00AM. 

Outside the stock exchange doors, the zippo clinks alive once more. The molten ember climbs towards the cigarette butt as Alex takes a deep drag. Face down, hands in his pockets, the thin Sicilian man approaches. ""Did you do it?"" He demands. 

Alex stares ahead, ""You're late, bud."" 

Paul's voice shakes, ""God fucking damnit, did you do it?"" Alex turns, his eyes deadlocked with Paul's. An impish grin spreads across his face bearing ash stained teeth, ""I'm doubling down."" 

Paul looks back in horror.

""5:23PM, still plenty of time to be a rich man!"" 

Paul jumps, seizing him by the collar. The cigarette tumbles from Alex's mouth, splashing embers and ash upon their clothing on its way down. ""You son of a bitch. I'm gonna stop you. I swear to God I'm gonna stop you."" 

Alex settles, ""And do what? Call Moscow?"" Paul's grip loosens, he knows where this is going. ""Tell them a man in New York City flew out to Russia, slipped into a heavily guarded nuclear reactor undetected and rigged the thing to blow, in what, a night? And how would you know?! HOW COULD YOU KNOW?!"" Alex shoves him backwards, hard. ""It would be an act of war. It's not too late to be a rich man.""

"[WP] Every alternate day you wake up in a version of Earth where you're alone, and every day afterwards you wake up back on Earth as if nothing had happened, except for the changes you've made.",GameDesignerMan,"Kevin blinked, and was greeted by the glare of the sun. His sun. He rolled over and scrunched his eyes, peering out the window into the empty world. The Johnsons' sprinkler was going, it's automatic timer ensuring order in a world without the Johnsons. 

Kevin threw off the covers and opened his window, sucking in a deep breath of morning air. It was always fresher in his world. Today it smelled of grass, sea salt and...

Smoke.

Not good. Kevin rushed to the front door, not bothering to change out of his striped pyjamas. He reached for the keys to his parent's SUV, but hesitated. It was too slow for something like this. Time was of the essence and he needed to move fast. Mr Johnson had a sports car, that would do nicely.

Kevin rooted around in the Johnsons' flower pot for a few seconds before finding the spare key to their house. With practiced hand, he pushed open the front door, exchanged the house key for the keys to the BMW in the garage, and took off in the beastly V10.

He already knew the most likely target, the hills acted like a tinderbox during the spring. Yet Kevin was heading in the opposite direction. He'd done this dance enough times to know that one man couldn't fight a fire. Instead, Kevin took off in the direction of the hospital. 

He drove like a madman with a machete, cutting through backalleys and running lights. None of it mattered, rules were for their world, not his. It took him just under 3 minutes to reach Sacred Heart, not quite a personal best, but not bad either. He parked the BMW in a reserved spot at the back of the hospital and began digging beneath his PJs, pulling out a lanyard filled with keys and cards. There he found what he needed, a blank white card with the words ""Sacred Heart - All Wings"" written on it in permanent marker.

Kevin burst through the back door and into the emergency department, ignoring the drones of machines that had been deprived of their patients. He headed for the stairs and climbed to the roof. At the top was a helicopter; the only one in town. It had been a while since he was last behind the controls -six months or more- but he'd have to make do.

As the roaring of the blades echoed forth, Kevin felt a rush of adrenaline. He'd done this before, but it never got less terrifying. In his world, there was no one to help if something went wrong. No one to help if you got sick, no one to splint a broken bone. Kevin shuddered as he recalled a few of the times he'd injured himself in his world. Today would not be one of those days.

The whirly bird took flight, with only a slight wobble to Kevin's credit. Visibility was good today, and Kevin immidiately spotted the clouds of dark grey smoke from the hills. The fire was big, 100 acres at least and with no signs of stopping. Kevin started doing the math in his head, it had probably started around 2 or 3 in the morning.

He took the helicopter in for a closer look, and was greeted with the turbulence caused by the fire. The helicopter rattled, jumped and dipped, threatening to fly itself into a tree. Kevin's control won out, and he scanned the area beneath him, searching for something that would betray the fire's origin. The smoke was getting thicker now, making it hard to see, hard to breathe. He was getting dizzy and cursed himself for his lack of preparation. But there had been no time, even in this world where all the time was his. 

Suddenly he saw it, a patch of scarred earth and the jagged remains of a tree stump, the needle in his haystack.

He banked away from the flames, back towards the hospital. After another short flight, the adrenaline began to wear off, and exhaustion set in. Kevin dutifully returned the helicopter and refuelled it. Then he did the same with Mr Johnson's car. Finally, Kevin set his alarm, and passed out on his mattress in smoke-stained PJs.

-----------------------------------------

John Nolan pulled his fire-engine to the side of the road. There was Kevin, standing in his pyjamas with a cup of coffee and a cigarette at 2am in the morning. Thunder rattled and wind howled as he hopped out of the truck's cab and made his way over to the dishevelled teen. 

""No fire,"" said John hopefully, looking out into the dark field beyond. The silhouette of a lonely tree danced back and forth in the dry spring air.

""Just wait,"" replied Kevin, taking a drag from his cigarette.

He did. With anyone else, the middle-aged fireman would've begun an enthusiastic lecture about crying wolf, but not with Kevin. He'd never asked the boy about his ""hunches,"" but he wasn't sure he wanted to know the answer. John saw something in Kevin that he recognized in himself, it was the look of someone who'd seen too much.

Suddenly, a bolt from the darkness turned night into day, and tree into stump. John immidiately sprang into action, rushing for the fire hose, and yelling orders at his second.

Kevin dropped his cigarette and stubbed it out with his slipper. He let out an audible yawn and turned away from the ensuant madness.

""All yours,"" he said.",GameDesignerMan

"[WP] Every alternate day you wake up in a version of Earth where you're alone, and every day afterwards you wake up back on Earth as if nothing had happened, except for the changes you've made.",GameDesignerMan,"It is hard to understand what started them, the empty-days that is, I get blackout drunk just like every other night, only on the second morning after *that night* did I wake up and everybody was gone. Since then nothing has changed, life is still a shitshow of fuckups that I can't fix, so I just sit on this bar-stool every night, hunched over the bar getting drunk with or without the bartender. 

I keep telling myself, *“maybe tomorrow will be different, maybe this time I’ll make it right”*, but really, I’m scared that if I stop being a fuckup I’ll have no reason to sit here guzzling down whiskey like its water and feeling sorry for myself, though that thought only depresses me even more. A bottle of Scotch and *making things right* is all I’ve got left in this world and I’ll be damned if I don’t drink this whole bottle.

It is a cliche that every father loves his daughter, but my little Laura is special, she has her mother’s eyes and my temper, but in her own unique way she could hide a dagger behind a smile and you wouldn’t even know it. If only I could fix things, if only I could have protected her, my little Laura.

I’ve spent twenty years as a beat-cop, trying to uphold the law as best I could. You would think upholding the law and protecting people are one and the same, but that utopian ideal came crashing down after the day I couldn’t protect her, I’ll never let that happen again.

On the days when everyone is gone, I try to fix things, I try to make life better for Laura by righting wrongs. Protecting her is the least I can do and making sure she is happy is all I have left to live for. The things I’ve done make a man want to drink himself half to death. 

It was Derek Renshaw who started this, a convicted ritualist serial killer most widely known as The Soul-eater. His name came about because shortly before being apprehended, he was photographed on top of an altar, naked and sprawled on top of his victim, eating face first from the innards of the chest. The odd thing about the photograph though, the one thing that really gives me the chills, is the way his eyes are fixated on the camera, like a dog protecting its dinner. Some people believe they can see the victim's soul being devoured in the picture, hence the name.

I was unfortunate enough to be around when they brought him in, I’ve seen plenty of killers before, some are wild and full of hatred for the world, some are psychopathic and others are as cold as stone, but this guy didn’t seem like animal nor man, just being in his presence sent shivers down my spine and made the hair on my neck stand up. When I glanced over at him across the room, he was turned away to the side and looking in the opposite direction. Some say you can feel when you are being watched, this guy wasn’t even looking at me, but all I could feel is alarm bells ringing inside my head and chest, somehow, it felt like he was watching me right there and then.

It was a couple of months after that my world turned upside down. Like any other day, I stuffed an apple in Laura’s backpack where she had already packed her favourite miniature board game, Snakes and Ladders. I gave her a kiss as she got out of the car and waved goodbye, the next time my phone rang, I got the worst news of my life, Laura had been abducted from school, my Laura.

The next few days were hell, there were no leads, then, out of the blue, it turns out that Derek Renshaw, a man with few requests and needs, had been writing letters and sending them to a devout Christian preacher by the name of Engel White. I don’t usually put significance on such things, but his last letter, the letter which gave away clues as to his involvement in Lauras disappearance, I will never forget.

I was handed the letter by a colleague, he wore gloves and told me I would have to pick it out of the carry-case myself. When I asked him why he choked and could only bare to say that it made him *“think of things I’d never thought of before”*.

Opening the letter, the fear began to make sense, it had been written in blood, cleanly. It seemed to contain only a few sentences and some Latin references in different parts. Then, right there, “Laura”. If that wasn’t enough, somehow a man behind bars had managed to write a letter in blood containing her name, the school, the street and the time she will be there. There were pentagrams and symbols which is expected of any of these crazies, but I did notice something else, some odd shading to the top and sides, when I held the letter up to the light I could make out a head and face. The more I stared, the more I could see the face, I began to feel uneasy, like I was being watched.

The precinct put a warrant out on Engel White and told me to stay calm and let them handle it. I took a walk around the block to clear my head, passing the nearby church “The Ebenezer”, I noticed that one of the stained glass windows looked familiar. I almost dropped to the floor the moment I realized where I’d seen it, it had been right under my nose, in the letter. The stained glass window depicts a skeleton, on top of a priest, it looked a lot like the photograph of Derek Renshaw with his victim which is why we thought the similar drawing in the letter was simply a sick depiction of Derek’s previous attack, but it wasn’t, in the letter it is different, I could clearly see that now, it is a skeleton and not Derek.

I was running before I could even think, the front door was locked, but a rear-door was unlocked. I rushed in and found Engel White in a priest’s clothing sitting on the altar, as I got closer he looked at me and then slowly looked down to his chest where he had been sawing away at his ribs with a hacksaw. That bastard had already cut three, god knows where they were, I asked him where Laura was and he pointed to the stained glass window.

She sat just below, legs folded, looking at the window, clear as day, she didn’t seem scared or bothered by Engel at all. For a brief moment I thought to myself, “at least she is alive”. Then the hair on my neck stood up, a chill ran down my spine and I could feel it, that same feeling which made me sick to my stomach, exactly as I’d felt in the precinct that day, Derek was watching me. When I turned around he was there, he grabbed my face with his hand before I could react and the last thing I remember are words which burnt into my soul, *“et redde viro suo quia superbiae”*.

When I awoke, Derek was gone and Engel lay open-chested on the altar, clearly he had been eaten and he was missing several ribs. I was hailed a hero by the precinct, Engel’s injuries, however unlikely, were attributed to self-injury considering the blisters and prints showing he used a hacksaw on himself. My Laura seemed to take the ordeal quite well, that’s my girl, as tough as nails. After being questioned, she only replied that Engel was her friend, she shared her apple and played Snakes and Ladders with him until dad arrived. I was just happy she came through ok, I’ll protect her, I’ll make sure no one takes her from me again. No more fuckups, this time she’ll be fixed, this time she’s going to find what she is looking for.

That is when the empty-days started, every other day is a day where I am alone, completely alone, although sometimes I still get the feeling that he is watching. I can only imagine that I’m here for one purpose, to protect Laura. She got quite creative at school you see, she likes to draw things. Things, people and places her teachers can’t understand. The other kids won’t sit next to her anymore and parents call to complain that what she says to their children is “disturbing them”.

She is just a kid, *she* is the victim here. That is why I have to clean up after her while she tries to fix things, so then I can fix things. I love her so much, she can’t help it, she just needs fixing.

So now, in my empty days I try to protect Laura and in the night I get blind drunk, what a life. Police reports, names, evidence bags. I mean, what difference does a few missing ribs make in an evidence room? It is to protect her until I can fix her. I’ll keep-on cleaning up for her while she searches.

She needs the rib of Adam, it says so in her drawing at school. We might only need to kill a few more. I don’t know why, but I get the feeling that Derek would know, maybe I should write him a letter. Yeah, that sounds right, I’ll write him a letter.

He pulled the blankets up to block the sunlight. 'Why won't you let me sleep!!!!"" He grumbled. No reply, usually by now he would've hear his parents yell for him to get ready for university by now but perhaps this was the day they thought he was a big boy... He rolled out of bed making a loud thud as he crashed to the floor. His expression changed, his eyes widened and he started breathing faster. He peered out the blinds to see an empty street. There was nothing, nadda, not even a single dog. It was strange since he lived in the busiest part of the town. He changed quickly and ran out to the lounge. He looked towards the kitchen. No one was there, no one on the couch. No one anywhere. He freaked out and decided it was best to go lie down somewhere. Sam looked up at the time, it was 8am. He thought it was best to go back to bed, what if this was a dream... or something worse. He ran to his room kicking a, toy sending it through the glass door at the front of the house. He stumbled up the stairs to his room, he thought if he could go back to sleep this nightmare would end. 

Sam woke up, the light peered through the blinds on to his face. He pulled the blankets up to block the sunlight. 'Why won't you let me sleep!!!!"" He grumbled as he fell to the floor. ""Oi stop grumbling and get your breakfast,"" A strange womans voice echoed through the house. His eyes widened and a giant grin crept across his face. He was relieved that it was just a dream. He began to sprint down the stairs but immediatly stopped as he noticed the glass door was shattered. A toy was on the otherside of the glass. He went to the kitchen where this middle aged woman was waiting. ""Do you have any idea what happened to the front door?""

""No???"" Sam replied hesitantly. 

""Well, there I was walking through the house and I accidently kicked a toy, it rocketed through the window and the glass shattered."" She finished. Sam's expression dropped as his head looked away. This couldn't have been an accident he thought. He kicked it. Why didn't why wasn't it through the door already.

""I have to test this."" He mumbled to himself. He put his shoes on and carefully navigated throughout the glass to grab the toy, he threw it through the glass door and smashed the top half of the window.

""OI WHY DID YOU DO THAT!"" His mother screamed at the top of her lungs

""GO TO YOUR ROOM!!!"" She finished off.

Sam stumbled up to the stairs with his head drooped down with a grin on his face. He decided to sleep early once again.

His alarm went off and he hit the buzzer, he jumped out of his bed without making a sound. He walked into the kitchen, ready to suprise his mother with this punctuality for a change. Yet no one was there. He left the house. A shadow formed and dissapated in front of him. He walked into the middle of the road and again, there was no one there, no cars, no nothing. He thought to himself if that be the case, he can be as destructive as he wants. He heads down the street, past a school, past a dairy and past a multitude of retail stores until something catches his eyes a tech store with its doors open. A wide grin forms accross his face. He continues walking unti lhe reaches his local supermarket. He takes a trolly and proceeds to run towards the store. 

He grabs all the tech he wanted, several mid-top tier gaming laptops, a playstation 4, and xbox 1, a nintendo switch and all the games he could find. He walks up to the cash register. And scans all the items. He selects the pay with cash option on the register and applies a 110% discount, for a total cost of -$10000. He goes takes the gear home and puts them all in his bedroom. He laughs maniacally and goes to sleep.

His alarm went off and he hit the buzzer, he jumped out of his bed without making a sound. He walked into the kitchen, his mother was standing there. ""So about that window you broke yesterday."" She said softly. As she leaned against the counter. ""I want you to pay for it."" She finished. Sam nodded in agreement, smiling from ear to ear.
""I dont know whats so funny."" She exclaims. Sam continues to smile as he sat down at the table and pulled his phone out of his pocket. He opened facebook and at the top of his news feed he reads 'A store encountered a weird glitch today as the recipetent got products at the cost of 100,000 for free, they even gave him money.' His smile grew even larger as he covered his mouth as he started laughing louder and louder. The door bell let out a ring, as Sam jumped out of his seat and ran to the door. A police officer was there with a briefcase and a trolley's full of technology, everything he grabbed from the store. The officer stepped inside and took all the stuff upstairs to Sam's room. The officer left as Sam laughed even more. He went to sleep early yet again.

Sam slowly opened his eyes and he peered at his clock. It was 1 pm. His eyes widened, all the stuff from yesterdy was there but why did he have just a sinking feeling about everything, he is never up this late... ever. He sighed and got himself dressed. He left the house and went into the middle of the street, nothing's changed there in the last few days. Everything is the same as it has been during the peopleless days except it was darker, much darker.. 


A loud speaker spun to life. ""UHHH HI!"" it echoed out. ""We have seen this before, so please listen very carefully. YOU HAVE TO STOP NOW! If you keep changing things, you will be in danger, lots of danger. The shadows have found their targets so please stop. Just please stop. Do nothing and go back to sleep, this will be the last time this will happen we promise."" Sam sighed and procceeded to go back inside.

""Oh and one more thing Sam Hughes, good bye, we are sorry this had to happen to you, but the shadows do need to eat.""

Sam now had a frown on his face, he went back inside, went to his bed, and thought for a bit. 'Why all this, why me, shadows, the voice what is this.' It's probably nothing he thought to himself. As he forced himself to sleep.

"[WP] While sleeping, you roll onto your phone and accidentally text gibberish to a random number. Meanwhile, on the other side of the galaxy, a little alien boy thinks he's made a new friend.",Hardtopickaname,"“What’s this?”

An alien boy, appearing no older than 10, calmly floats in a sizable bubble through space. He’s rolled up, like a baby kitten, and his bubble is drifting seemingly nowhere.

The alien boy pulls out a flat, rectangle device. The device is flashing iridescent colors, further magnified in splendor reflecting and passing through the delicate-looking space bubble. It’s as if it could pop at any second, but at the same time appears very sturdy as if it could never pop at all.

“I got… a text?” The alien boy said surprisingly. The only people that would message him were his parents back in his homeworld. He didn’t have many friends where he grew up, so he was honestly astonished when he saw someone had messaged little him out drifting through the universe.

And not only that, it was in his language. Was it someone back at home? But then again no one would text him besides his parents.

“’How are… you doing… I hope y-…y-….you ar-are havvvv-ving a good day,’” the alien boy read, “’I am doing quite dandy. Don’t be s-s-… sad, I’m… I’m here. So c-ch-ch... cheer up!” 

The boy felt an indescribable feeling of joy. He felt soft in the inside, all around his 3 hearts, and he didn’t know why. He had initially felt proud for reading it. He was always slow back at home. Most kids take 75 years to reach basic literacy, while it took him twice that. Even then his ability to read is passable at best. He still has a lot of trouble.

But also, no one has ever sent such a positive message to him. His parents would send the usual “Happy drifting” message and just that, all the time. They were probably too busy taking care of his younger brother, who’s a natural genius. The alien boy’s never felt jealousy or any other negative feelings of any kind towards his brother or parents, but he just felt…

Well, he felt sad. And lonely. Being in space for centuries wears you out. It’s tradition back in his homeworld to send the oldest out on an expedition. Most parents spend lots on transportation and other necessities to ensure a comfortable trip. Most parents set up a destination plan so he can explore hot spots of the universe. All he has is a bubble. And no direction.

Out of nowhere, this mystery person sent him something so heartwarming. Even if it was an accident, he still wants to return the favor!

The boy hurriedly mashed his fingers into his phone-like device, holograms appeared all around them, sparkling. The boy paid no attention to them and only focused to typing, making numerous mistakes, and having to go back and fix those mistakes. After a good amount of time and lots of spent energy, he pressed send.

“I wonder if this new friend will respond?” The little alien boy wonders optimistically. He smiles to himself as he falls back into his prolonged slumber.

*Meanwhile, back at the sender’s home.*

“Wha…” I wake up. My head hits the metal desk lamp awkwardly hanging off the desk beside the bed.

This is routine, don’t worry about me. My head still hurts though, probably time to get a better lamp. Or move the desk. Or move into a less shabby apartment.

10 years and I can’t even change a desk lamp.

Maybe tomorrow. 

I pull out my phone, which is also showing lots of signs of age. I bought this phone 10 years ago when I moved in. Crazy times, I was kicked out of my parents’ house and forced to survive on my own. I notice an unknown number texted something random to me. I don’t recognize the number, and my chat history doesn’t show any interaction between the number before. The text was seemingly random, simply put a bunch of gibberish and was no longer than 150 characters.

Is this a joke? Is someone mocking me? Or is this some new scam?

I hover my finger over the block button. I pause. I’m unsure why but I pause and for some reason, I remember something, something from my past. Something sad.

I close my eyes and breathe.

I tap on the text box to enter a text, and simply input a simple smiley face. 

There’s no harm in a little positivity, my mom used to say when I was young, something that I’ve sorely lacked for the past 10 years. If it’s a scam or whatever, it’s fine. I don’t know why I feel compelled to do this but I have a feeling. If my gut’s wrong, oh well. I’ll let the universe decide.

I fall back asleep with a refreshed state of mind and a slightly sore head. Doesn’t help when the lamp strikes you in the same place. Every time.

She looked upon her new master with interest. The fashions had changed since she was last released from her bottle and it intrigued her. 

The tall, portly man stood there open mouthed, clothed in a crisp dark blue suit of fabric, a red piece hung from his neck, prominent in the center of his chest. His footwear shone like the best polished glass of the cathedrals of old, black against the grey stonelike ground beneath him.

[WP] You're under arrest for murdering children and the police officer is an old friend of yours. Smooth talk yourself into freedom (freedom is relative),MolochTheFilthy,"Well, I did it. It didn't feel quite as good as I'd hoped, but the aching is gone. That sucking, burning ache that pulled at everything I did like a mostly-turned-down television set pulls at your hearing.

That's good.

Wait.

As I stand in the middle of the room, feet carefully planted in the clean parts of the tile, away from the mess, I feel it. The tug. The pull.

No!

No, this isn't right. I did it. I should be done. I am done. I AM DONE.

There's a noise, a big one. Someone kicked in the basement door. A flashlight intrudes on my little pool of light, and when he sees what's going on, he shouts.

""Gregory,"" I say.

""Bill?""

Is he shocked? Maybe he is. Maybe he always knew what I was. He puts his gun away. That's surprising.

""It's OK, Bill. You're gonna come with me and we're going to get to the bottom of this.""

Gregory was always the model cop. Always cool, always calm. It's no good.

I start towards him, my eyes as wild and murderer-y as I can make them, but he steps back and doesn't draw his gun.

""Gregory, I'm a threat. I'm dangerous. You know what you have to do.""

He looks at me, confusion stamped on his honest but stupid face. ""What are you saying, Bill?""

Confusion is good. Confusion can lead to anger.

""I'm saying that I don't deserve to live, Gregory. I'm a monster. A killer.""

""You...want me to kill you? You'll get what's coming to you, but I'm not going to shoot you.""

""You don't want to. But you will. Because you're stupid. You're a slow, dumb lump of meat, Gregory.""

It doesn't work. He gives a wry smile. ""That used to bother me, Bill, but I've come to accept it. I know what I am.""

""Yes, but do you know what Eric is?""

""What did you say?"" Ah yes. There it is.

""Eric. Your son. Did you know that he's just like his father? A little sportsman but ever so slow.""

""How dare you say that about my son?!""

""I made them play a game, Gregory. All of them. A little game, just to pass the time. Sometimes, if they won, I made it quick for them. Do you know what, Gregory?""

""What?"" his voice is cold and his hand is on the grip of his gun.

""Your son was...ever...so...slow...""

I crumple to the floor, the feeling in my chest more of a dull bruise than a sharp piercing pain. It was a lie, of course. I never got to Eric. But I smile as the aching tug finally recedes. Freedom.",VulKhalec

"[WP] You are the protagonist of a Choose Your Own Adventure novel. The author stopped writing your novel at a critical choice, leaving you unable to continue your life. Other characters have moved on while you have remained trapped by indecision.",Obtuse_Mongoose,"*Turn to page 47 to run back down the hall!
Turn to page 85 to search the cupboards for a weapon to defend yourself!*

Honestly, both options were rigged; from the cramped office break room where I hid, I could hear the mocking laughter of the *thing* hunting me as it searched one cubical after another on the other side of the thin divider between us . If I ran, *it* would be on me within seconds; if I stayed, it wouldn't be long before *it* found me regardless. It truly was a hopeless situation - and I think that's really what saved me.

After a few minutes - at which point, by all rights, I should've been caught - it began to dawn that I had yet to be eaten. No shadows fell over me as I caught my breath; when I turned my head to check my sides, no monstrous face loomed out of the darkness. The sick laughter continued outside, on a loop, the same *ha!* repeated over and over. Cautiously, I got to my knees and peered over the counter toward the cubical farm. The hulking figure hunched with its back to me, sniffing at one of the office chairs. Staying tensed, I prepared to drop back to the ground if *it* so much as twitched in my direction.

When a long moment passed with no change, I sighed in relief. It didn't take a genius to see what had happened, and I thanked my lucky stars that I'd finally caught a break. A literal one, in fact, and I knew I didn't have long to capitalize.

Thinking quick, I grabbed the microwave from the nearby counter and yanked its power cord from the socket. Hefting the box awkwardly over my shoulder, I carried the device slowly toward the creature. With all the dexterity I possessed, I opened the door and gently, *gently* lowered the microwave over *its* head. From inside the chamber, I could still hear the creature's muffled *ha!s* as it laughed to itself in accordance with the script.

Perspiring a little in such close proximity to the beast, I knelt down and yanked a power strip free from the duct tape securing it to the floor. With the full fifteen feet of cord in my hand, I hooked up the microwave and dragged the length back to the wall outlet where I'd begun. I could feel my time coming to an end, and prayed that what I'd done wouldn't simply be erased.

The first keystrokes were hesitant, and I could sense the confusion as my little trick was reviewed.

""Did I write that?"" I could practically feel my creator wondering. I crossed my fingers and prayed, and after a moment the typing began in earnest.

No backspaces! I had no idea how it could possibly be justified, but the author never seemed particularly concerned with trivial things like logic or reason.

*Turn to page 29 to activate the trap!*

There it was! Finally, an option that I could get behind. To say I never made a decision more quickly in my life would be an understatement. I could sense the rapidfire clatter of keystrokes as I plugged the cord into the wall and grinned as a wave of heat swept over the countertop.

With a meaty *splort*, the creature's head exploded, followed by a pair of heavy thuds as its body and the microwave tumbled to the floor together.

Nothing about the scenario made the slightest bit of sense - I hadn't even set the timer or rigged the device to activate once plugged in - but again, such concerns weren't exactly a priority. 

Without the threat hanging over my head, I sprinted for the stairs and the exit which would free me from this nightmare. My condolences to the other versions of me trapped in bad ends! So long, suckers - the blissful oblivion of a proper ending was within my grasp!

*Turn to page 11 to climb the stairs to the roof! Turn to page 89 to descend to the ground floor!*

""Oh hell,"" I grumbled, ""It's still going.""

The familiar indecision came over me, and I felt the fingers pull away from the keys. It wouldn't be the last time, either - I was certain of that. Just another in an unending series of pauses in the least-exciting horror CYOA of all time.

I'm starting to think one of those bad ends might be the easy way out; I'll give it another branch or two before I decide.",MissCelle

[WP] The scientists of Earth have finally decoded the mysterious radio signals from space. It's a warning that humans are on their way to colonize the planet.,PhountainFantom,"""There's a ton of data streaming in"" A small, excited man said as he stared in into a computer screen.

""What's is it?"" A woman whispered as she leaned in.
""It’s another communication, like a highly advanced Morse code."" 

 The two of them looked on in eagerness.  It was the first time in over a year the team was receiving a clear signal.
  
“It’s repeating” the man said.  “Wait!”  Suddenly, he swung to his left and started to vigorously type into the computer.  “It’s math!”  He announced.

The woman tilted her head as she crossed her arms.  “Can you decipher it, though?”  

The man’s demeanor dropped into a sober focus as he read the screen.

“What?” She posed.

“It’s a warning.  I can’t make out everything.” He said as he pointed toward the screen.  “Here.  The message we got last year wasn’t random.  It was a cypher, we were right.”

“this means…’Arrival’” he continued as he kept analyzing.

“and this…’Infection’”

“and this…’Clean’…no, ‘Clear, maybe…’”

“And what about the math?”  She retorted.

“Maybe it’s not…”  He mumbled.  “It’s not…It’s a pattern though.” He punched the data into the simulator.  

Seconds turned into minutes before he turned around to the woman in a sober revelation.

“What?” She nervously questioned him as she saw the fear in his eyes.

“It’s our genome.”

“And?”  She pushed as she knew that wasn’t the source of fear.

“No, it’s not us.  It’s not a warning for us.  It’s a warning of us.”  He turned back to his data.

The woman made an attempt to formulate words.  “We’re the infection?” 

“’Arrival of the Infection’, ‘Human’, ‘Must Clear’” He formed.  “There’s more at the end, I think it’s some kind of date.”  He punched numbers into the simulator once again.  “This was over 6,000 years ago.”

“We came from space…” The woman pondered.  “Who were we to chase out an existing race?  Who was here before us?”  She was equally astonished as she was excited over the discovery. “We must have been so advanced!”

The man, however, maintained a sober outlook.

“What’s wrong?!” she asked.  “Think of it, we could still be out there!”

“This word right here, it isn’t ‘Clear’, or ‘Clean’”.  He looked at her.  “Think, why do we have no written history of this.  Humans were wiped out, save a few.  So little, nothing remains.  It’s ‘Cleanse’; they tried to exterminate humans.”

“And they failed!”  She defended.

“What if they try again?”

[WP] The scientists of Earth have finally decoded the mysterious radio signals from space. It's a warning that humans are on their way to colonize the planet.,PhountainFantom,"""It's more complex than we thought."" said the man in the lab coat.

""What do you mean?"" responded the man in the suit.

""It's got sound, and three dimensional images"" said the man in the lab coat. ""It's incredible, it took us seven years to create devices able to read and display the information we received"".

""However"", said the man in the lab coat ""What I wanted to show you isn't what it is, rather what it says.""

The man in the lab coat walked to the other side of the dark room and pressed a button. The dark room was filled with a blinding array of light and color. The man in the suit felt like he was going to vomit. When the lights softened and organized themselves, the man in the suit was surprised to find himself standing face to face with an Indian man in a sleek white and grey suit that stretched over most of his body. 

""Greetings fellow Humans"" said the Indian man in a clear and clean American accent. 

""My name is Chetan, and I speak to you on behalf of the Unified Worlds of Man""

The Indian man smiles and continues.

""If you are receiving this pre-recorded message, then it is likely that your world is sufficiently advanced to the point where we can regard you as equals immediately.""

The Indian man turns and makes gestures as if there was more than two people in the room around him.

""Now I'm sure that you have many questions regarding many things however, I am only capable of answering three.""

When the Indian Man pauses the man in the suit nearly opens his mouth to ask a question but before he has a chance, the Indian man raises his hand and extends  his pointer finger.

""First, we must inform you that we are unfortunately, alone in the universe.""

A sphere of light appears before the Indian man and begins to change in color and patterns

""The Unified Worlds of Man has explored thousands of worlds and all of them but one were void of life.""

The sphere of light stops shifting and settles into the image of earth.

""Earth is the only world where life can exist""

The sphere of light vanishes and the Indian man raises another finger.

""Second, If there is no life elsewhere then where did the Unified Worlds of Man come from?""

The sphere of light returns and splits into several earths.

""We also came from Earth, but it is not your earth.""

""It's a little strange but, to put it simply we are from the future, the past, and alternate dimensions where there are more earths than you can possibly imagine.  Many of them are alone, but many of them are together, that's us.""

The Indian man raises a third finger

""Third, you are likely to be wondering why we are coming to you. The answer is simple. We are coming to annex your planet into the Unified Worlds of Man. While this may appear to be cause for concern, we assure you that we mean no harm. We bring with us our technology, our culture, and our resources. Once we arrive you will have access to all of these and we in exchange will have access to your world. In 16.4 years we shall arrive at your world and begin your indoctrination into the Unified Worlds of Man. We are coming to enlighten you, and soon you will shine brighter than any star in the universe.""

The Indian man opens his arms as if offering a hug.

""We wish you the best of luck until we arrive.""

The lights dim and the Indian man vanishes.

""How many years did it take to interpret the message again?"" asked the man in the suit. 

""Seven years"" replied the man in the lab coat ""It's been seven years and deep space scanners have already detected a large mass moving towards the earth near Saturn"".

""So we have only a little more than nine years before the entire world no, the entire Universe as we know it changes?"" asked the man in the suit.

""That's right"" responds the man in the lab coat ""there's nothing we can do but wait until they arrive.""

""Yup,"" replied Greg, the pilot.

*Deep breath old chap, you've got this*, Tom thought before swinging the doors open.

""What in hell..."" Greg said in wonderment.

There were hundreds of them.  Aliens.  In the boardroom.  This was to be the final briefing before takeoff.

""Gentlemen, have a seat.  As you see things have changed now,"" the board director said officially.

Tom and Greg looked at each other, unable to read each others faces.  So many emotions registering at once.  A mix of amazement, concern, bafflement.  

""Think we have to delay the mission..."" the director began.

""Think?  You Think!""? Greg shouted, ""We have been training our whole lives to go to space, and just because a bunch of stinky aliens show up that means we're delayed?  I say hell with that.""  Greg stormed out of the room.


Tom had shock on his face.  He got up and looked around.  Everyone was staring at him waiting for a reaction.  The humans, the blue green purple aliens, all different colors.

""I'll talk to him,"" Tom said face beating red.

Just before he got to the door, ""Tom, look,"" the director said smiling.

He looked back.  Aliens were slipping off their faces!  No, they were masks.

""You bastards!"" Tom yelled.

"[WP] You have been going to school your whole life to become an astronaut. The day finally comes to lift off into space. When you arrive on the international space station, you look up to see over 100 alien races sitting in the briefing room.",PinkTacoPounder,"This was the day, Alex kept telling himself. He could barely bring himself to believe this would be the day he would reap what he had been sowing for over 2 decades. Every single test, every single interview, every single drop of blood, sweat and tears lead to this very moment. Alex calmed himself as he walked on the glossy gangway leading to the shuttle, intricately decorated with American flags, pictures of his predecessors and quotes. One stuck out to him the most, and he paused for a moment to read it. ""There is a sight that is really quite bewildering. No amount of training can prepare you for it."" Alex hoped the quote was right.


He walked along the gangway, and stepped into the shuttle cockpit. Alex put on his headset and his helmet, and went along the pre-flight checks with mission control. After everything was confirmed nominal and reconfirmed and reconfirmed again, the countdowns started. He could see crowds gathering on the beach, American flags belting patriotism,  the glare of the sun making it hard to see them. 

""5""

He trembled in his seat

""4""

His hand, shaking from stress, placed itself on the launch button

""3""

He was praying now, praying that the triple checking worked

""2""

He closed his eyes

""1""

Only God could save him now

""And we have liftoff of the SS Venation"" Alex felt the tremendous power as the engines roared to life, the fire rushing out of it like a dragon's breath, the sound was louder than anything he had ever heard, and he spent 5 years as a test pilot. 

The ride was uneventful. Looking down at the blue marble he was above, he heard a transmission ""Commander Deayton, the ISS should be at co-ordinates One Zero Five, I repeat, One Zero Five. Can you give us visual confirmation?"" Alex, or Commander Deayton as mission control seemed to be intent on calling him, looked at his gyro-compass, looked at 105, and saw the solar panels of the station, his home for the next 6 months, flashing at him. ""Confirmed, ISS is at 105"" he responded. 
""Initiate docking procedures"" was the order sent from mission control. And so he did, delicately checking all docking measures on his craft were working correctly. He turned on his radio, setting it to all frequencies ""ISS, this is Commander Alex Deayton of the SS Venation, docking ETA 5 minutes.""

The docking of course went off without a hitch, his craft gliding smoothly into place with the ISS, an audible clunk sounded when it fully docked. Alex's breath was shaky, after all, this would be the reward of all those years of work. He floated down the hallways, to the airlock, opened it. The only thing stopping him from joining the rest of the crew was five inches of steel. The hatch shot open, the hydraulics making a screech. Commander Sorsby, one of the senior commanders on board faced him. ""Commander Deayton, right?""

Alex nodded

""I trust your flight was okay?""

""As much as I expected it to be, and more, Commander"" 

""Ha! That's thats the spirit lad. Now, I have a lot of things to show you."" Sorsby grinned as he uttered the last few words, and Alex was wondering why he would take such joy in showing him around. 

""NASA briefed me on everything to expect, I don't think I'll need a tour Commander"" Alex replied, eager to get to his quarters.

""Ha, NASA won't tell you half of the things on here until you're here. And they leave it up to us to show the newuns around."" he said, rolling his eyes.

Alex was shocked, this couldn't be right,  ""What!? Why!? That breaks all protocol! That's jus-""

""Cut it out, laddie. You'll know why when you see it."" Sorsby cut him off while steering him around a corner.

 Floating was a sensation Alex would have to get used to, it felt like he was swimming and he occasionally found himself holding his breath while being distracted by Sorsby's tour , only to realise there was no need. He wondered why Sorsby was showing him around, everything he had been shown had been taught to him and then taught to him again by NASA, perhaps he was just doing it to humour himself. 

""Are you listening, Deayton!?"", Sorsby's words shocked Alex out of his thoughts 

""Sorry, commander. Can you repeat?""

""Aye, most certainly can, Commander. This door requires a two part activation"", he gestured towards the hallway. There was one podium with an outline of a handprint on it, then maybe 2 or three paces away was a grey line, and another 3 paces ahead of that was another podium. This was certainly not on any of the blueprints he was shown. ""Put your hand on the first podium when I pass the grey line"". Alex did as he was instructed to. He placed his hand on the outline, and it flashed from it's sky blue colour to a crimson red. He heard a feminine robotic voice ""2nd confirmation needed"". Alex looked at Sorsby, who's hand hovered above his podium. Sorsby looked back at him and gave him a boyish wink, and placed his hand on his podium's outline. As soon as his palm made contact, a metallic barrier springed from the grey line infront of him, Alex launched himself into the ceiling in shock, and struggled to regain his composure. He heard the robotic voice again, ""Confirmed."" When he looked at the barrier, only his own reflection looked back. ""What was going on?"", he asked himself. No amount of training could prepare him for this. He remembered the quote on the gangway. ""Be careful what you wish for,"" he muttered to nobody in particular. 

After maybe 2 minutes of staring, the metallic barrier shot open again, and what he saw scared him to his core. Or rather, what he didn't see. ""...Sorsby?"" he asked, his voice coming out as a whimper. Alex cleared his throat. ""Sorsby!?"", and silence was the reply he received. Alex cautiously approached the podium Sorsby touched. His hand shaked as he went in to press his hand against the outline, wondering what would happen when he pressed it. His hand has had a lot of practice shaking recently, Alex thought to himself. He pushed himself to put his hand against it.

When he made contact, the same robotic voice spoke out ""2nd confirmation required."". Alex looked back at the 1st podium, expecting to see Sorsby press it, but of course there was no one there. 

""Confirmed.""

And the podium he had been looking at just moments ago became invisible, blocked by the metal barrier. ""Sanitation process beginning."" said the robotic voice, the sound of a strange white gas being sprayed into small room carved out of the hallway almost drowning it out. Alex started punching the wall, every punch knocking him back into the wall. He needed to get out of here! ""Alex Alex Alex, you stop doing that!"" a familiar voice spoke into his headset.

""Sorsby! What is this!?"" Alex almost yelled at the fellow commander.

 ""We need you to be sanitised. It's a.. security regulation! Yes, we all have to do it you see, the big wigs up in Cape Canaveral don't want any chance of us contaminating space. Weird I know, how could they want it. Just breath the gas, Alex. You'll be fine. It's what I had to do while you were waiting.""

""What the.."" Alex couldn't speak anymore without breathing in, his lungs were already bursting from the lack of oxygen. He held out as long as he could, but he gave in, filling his lung with the gas. He felt a slight burning in his lungs and throat, but apart from that it seemed to be safe. His eyes weren't even watering. 

""See Alex. You're fine. Would I ever lie to you?"", the voice came from his headset  was almost mocking him.

""Sanitation complete. Specimen ready for cohabitation."" the robotic voice came out emotionless 

""Specimen!?"" Alex gasped into the headset

""Ahh, they never had a good way with words. Not as bad as my homeland though aye? You're ready now. Just press the podium again lad, you'll be with all of us then.""

""Sorsby, you better tell me what the hell is going on!"" Alex threatened. How could Sorsby not tell him about this? Why was this even happening? Why had NASA not warned him for this procedure? A thousand questions raced through Alex's head at the same time. He looked at the podium. He might as well figure out what all this was about before reporting him, he thought. His hand pressed the podium, and the wall opposite from the reflective metal barrier started to open up. He saw a figure waiting for him.

""Sorsby, what the hel-"" What he saw cut him off. The figure wasn't Sorsby. The figure wasn't even human.

""How nice of you to finally join us"" an inhuman voice said. The quote was definitely right. No amount of training could prepare him for the sight he saw. ",Talska
"[WP] When you sneeze, time stops until the next time you sneeze.",Rivet_Incognito,"(Forgive my me for my horrible grammar and spelling, i don't write and felt the desire to give it a shot with the topic at hand)


""No...ahh...No no Ah Ahhhchoooo!, Not again!""

""Womp!""

Sniffle*

""Sigh, I hate spring!  I hate allergies!  I hate this god damn ability!  Who knows how long it will be before I get out of this again.  I just wanted to grab some soda from the store! ahhhhhh!!!!!""

""Sigh,...Might as well begin the usual routine until i get out of this god forsaken freeze in time.  Who else in the world has such a stupid ability such as this?!""  WHO!!!  Doesn't it go against all of science for a person to be capable of sneezing into a stationary bubble in time?!""

""I can remember when i first experienced this phenomenon, it seemed to have developed on my 7th birthday and every time i sneeze, the world around me freezes to a complete halt. Sometimes i can even feel the earth stops rotating as i jerk forward a bit as if thrown every time an especially bad sneeze happens. It was exciting at first but when nothing changes around you until the next time a sneeze occurs, things can get boring pretty fast. ""My body is now officially 18 years old today but I have lived up to or nearly 33 years if we were to count the hours and days normally from my unique perspective. Thanks to my allergies I sneeze at the slightest amount of pollen and i am unable to re trigger this god forsaken ability again afterwords.  I have tried and failed to purposefully trigger another sneeze attack but to no avail will any of the pollen, peppers, lint, or hair sprays in the town work. 

 ""Hmmm...ash?""

Damnit!....A brim must be nearby.  

Quickly ducks behind one of the cashier stands waiting as a shadow passes by.

""You would think that with the freezing of time, nothing interesting would happen.....Wrong.  There are moving shadows in this world that float about They look like shadows which have an upper body like that of a human but with the right arm missing and below the chest is like glowing falling ash with an slight rotten egg smell so i call them Brim, short for brimstone, very weird creature.  There were none at first and then only on rare occasions but now i see them popping up every time i sneezed. On top of that, whenever i see one its like a trumpet is going off in my head and will only go away when I hide.  This feeling of dread just washes over me every single time I see them even though i have never been attacked or chased I just don't know why, its almost like a natural fear that has always been there.""
   
Carefully checks around the cashiers stand.

""I think it left the store guess nobody here caught its eye or whatever it uses to see with.  They don't seem interested in anything except certain peoples shadows, when they find one a really bizarre scene occurs where they would tear up the shadow from the person, picking it up like cloth and shredding it in very quick jerking motions, once they finished they put themselves in its place leaving behind small fading strands of the persons old shadow. In the few times I have witnessed such a thing, none of the people seemed affected by it when it happens but they look....wrong, even after time restarts.""

""ahhhhhhchooooo!"" 

""Womp!"" 

The sudden movement of time starting back up caused him too lurch forward, nearly tripping over himself running into a person at the stores entrance.

""Hey!  Careful there tiger, nearly tackled me to the ground.""

""Ugh, that was a unexpectedly a quick one....Aunt Sota?  What are you doing here?""

 ""hahaha, not even going to apologize for nearly running me down?  And its Aunt SO TAH CSE, the C is silent and its an old, unique name so better use it!""  

""No, sorry.  Was just surprised is all. I don't know, i can't seem to ever pronounce it correctly, Sota is just easier. But you will have to excuse me, my allergies seem to be getting worse lately.""

 ""You know John, I just may have a remedy for that back at the car, I was going give it to you as a present at the house but i guess now is  is as good a time as any.""

Really?! Haha! I knew you were my favorite Aunt!

 ""Hey! I'm your only Aunt!""

""Heh""

Sotahcse opens the car door picking up large rectangular box before handing it over to John he wipes what looks like grayish dust from the top of it.

Wanting to see what his uncle got him, John hurriedly opened up the box to find an old antique looking bronze Trumpet.

""eh an old Trumpet?...It only has one valve left on it.....does it even work?""

Sotahcse looks at John with a smile...

""Blow into it and see...""

[IP] The Frost Giant,ThatCritiqueGuy,"He'd decimated cities, defeated armies and committed atrocities across continents, but it was only when Shue'zen reached my own empire that I felt obliged to act. Of course, I'd heard tales of his destruction; we all had. A lone warrior wielding an ancient blade forged of devil glass, wandering across the lands and destroying all who crossed him. At a certain point it was impossible to ignore the stories; his notoriety and legend became real in our land the day hundreds and thousands of refugees appeared at our gates, all left homeless and wrought with loss and pain, all with the same look in their eyes, and all with the same story- that of a devil who came one day like a flood, devastating everything in his path. 

Obviously our armies were assembled promptly, the day we heard Shue'zen had appeared on our own horizon. Our empire lay surrounded by vast open-fields which were laden with traps and ditches in preparation for his arrival. Some men fled in the night before the battle, which many were calling a war, and some The Great War of our time, and many others took their own life, favouring to die by their own hand than by the blood soaked blade of what they believed to be some kind of terrible deity. 

When the King's own guard arrived at my gate I was prepared; as the Thrones Head Mage and Acting Enchanter I had been expecting a summons to the palace sooner or later. 

'Gwae' the King said, smiling through his grey beard and beckoning me into the chamber. All around were maps of the lands, desks with piles of papers strewn this way and that, and in the middle of the great room was a stone table upon which sat a strategic tactile map of the empire, with small figures meant to represent soldiers. 

'Rowen' I replied. 'What a nuisance this all is. I was just beginning to enjoy the idea of an early retirement'. The King laughed and strolled over to the chair at the head of the central table. He allowed himself to flop down into the seat and in that moment I saw the toll the threat had taken on him; his face was pulled and gaunt and his shoulders hunched as if bearing the weight of an entire empire. I suppose in many ways they were. 

'What can we do, Gwae? My generals have advised me that, along with the remaining soldiers still willing to fight amongst the refugees, we still only have around one hundred thousand men to stand against Shua'zen.' I pulled out a pipe from my carrier and lit a small bowl of smoking oil. There was something morbidly bemusing about the sight of the strategy table with a hundred soldier figurines at one end facing a single one on the other. I realised the king was waiting for me to speak. 'I have heard tales that he defeated the three hundred thousand strong army at Urwa'ie quite handily all those years ago. Though I also heard that the warrior from the East, Bael, gave him a good fight towards the end of that battle, before dying.' The King laughed, 'Alas. We have no warriors of the likes of Bael in our own ranks, but we do have some good men. Brave men. But I fear that will not be enough. That's why you have been summoned, of course. I am rather hoping you might have some trick that might get us out of this'. 

I stood for a moment and felt my gaze transfixed on the figurine meant to represent Shua'zen. The face of the tiny statue was entirely wrong- Shua'zen had a longer face, and a much longer beard. If he saw it he would no doubt laugh in that piercing but infectious way he used to do when we were children. I sighed as I felt in my pocket. 'I might have something, Rowen.' The King watched as I revealed a large figure of my own and placed it onto the table where it towered over the others. Rowan sat up straight and leaned in to peer at the golem I'd placed down.

'Shua'zen is no demon, nor is he some great warrior. He has attained his power using ancient sorcery, sorcery which has been long since outlawed by the Circle. He has forsaken his own place in our society, and no doubt his actions will be being followed very closely by the Elders. I do know one thing- they are furious, and that is more terrifying to me than one thousand Shua'zen's'. I pointed to the golem, 'This is my summon, an ancient creature I made a pact with eons ago. I will have him meet Shua'zen on the plains, and this should be enough. I will need to go myself in order to initiate the summoning. I wish to speak with Shua'zen myself, once he has been subdued. I would very much like to understand why my brother has strayed this far from his path before vengeance is fully enacted upon him. Ready your armies, for they will still be needed. I will head back to finish the relevant preparations, and I will be ready to ride with your men at your command.'

[IP] Arcane Cram Sessions...,ThatCritiqueGuy,"""Arvea levea zemp...zempura"" mumbled Ziri quietly to herself. She then gently driped three drops of her freshly brewed potion onto the doll she meticulously had knitted the day before.
""Arvea levea zempura! Arvea levea zempura! Arvea levea zempura!"" Ziri chanted her spell three times in a row. Once for every drop, once for every word of her spell.
Numbers are very important in spell Ziri remembered reading in the heavy book she got from her grandmother.
*Three more seconds and the doll should start to...* Ziris face lit up.

On the ground infront of her the little doll started to glow on its sides.
""It's awaking, i did it, it moves."" Ziri was overjoyed and watched mesmerized how the little doll slowly got on its feet.
Like supposed the little guy bowed to her and started dancing in circles.
Ziri couldn't hold her laughter and clapped a rhythm with her hands to witch the tiny dancer adjusted instinctively.

*Ok now the next step* Ziri thought and read the next line in the book.
Ziris fingers moved to a little jar next to her thigh, it was filled with a dark red powder.
*One pinch of Chili powder* she thought and drizzled it over the doll.

The doll suddenly stopped moving watching her somewhat unhappy.
Ziri ignored it and moved on.
""One squashed clove of garlic"" Ziri read and reached for another little jar, she had prepared well.

Slowly the doll started losing its glowing and sat down.

*One bayleaf* Ziri noticed that her spell was going awry and started hesitating.

The doll now seemed lifeless as it was before.

Ziri read on desperate for instructions. She hasn't read so far ahead before and was a bit confused about the next line.
""Now put in oven at 230° degrees for 35 minutes until crisp"" she read loudly. She didn't bring an oven. Why should a spell require an oven. Hastily she turned the page back over one side.
Ziri blushed how could she not have read the title before.
*Oh grand mah...* she thought while reading.

""Maybe if you spelled your name like a normal person, *with a fucking ""E""*, he wouldn't have started with that shit. '*Imma get me some Emma*', yeah he was real fucking mature..."" Frank trailed off. 

""Fuck. You. Frank!!"" Imma screamed, slamming on the breaks (having only moved about 5 feet to begin with). ""I was only here to pick your ass up because you're too shit-faced to drive. *Again!* Get, the fuck, OUT!"" She continued to yell, hands slapping at him in a flurry. 

""Imma! Are you serious?"" Frank pleaded, trying to ward off the blows. He opened his door slightly to lean away from the onslaught of her rapidly swinging fists.  

""*GET OUT NOW!!*"" Imma bellowed. Then she turned sideways in her seat and using both legs kicked Frank hard in the torso, sending him flying out of the car. He landed in a dazed heap on ground beside the car. 

*Now* Imma punched it. She threw up a middle finger as she speed away. ""Try making it home on your own asshole!"" Her fading voice was saying as she sped away. 

Frank stood up and tried to brush the dirt and grime from his ass where he had landed in a pool of something he decided he'd rather not know what it is.  

Suddenly, what felt like a large ham grabbed him by the shoulder, spinning him around. ""Well, well. Look what we got here."" Frank looked up, and up some more, into the eyes of the freakishly large man he had encountered in the bar, a large predator grin on his caveman face. ""We gonna finish our fun now boy,"" the sasquatch said, slowly cocking his fist back. 

Frank, unable to do anything to stop this, thought to himself calmly as the first blow was headed towards his jaw...

I was just trying to ease things. I was just trying to smooth our rocky relationship. I was just trying to make sense of it all.


We were both tired. Sixteen years of friendship, of being each other's companions, and for this? I should never have taken his deal. I should never have signed that damned paper. I should never have become such an uptight jerk.
But that's how it was with Frank and me. Two guys, one reckless, one careful. We were so close, and now it's just decaying.
I shouldn't have taken his offer.
When a smart-looking dude with wild, curly hair and a guarded smile approached me that quiet Thursday morning on the train, I should have told him.. but no.
After all, it's better to have loved and lost, yes? Frank was, is, my best friend.

But nevermind about that. What's important is now, not sixteen years, three days ago. Not that I'm keeping track.
Frank (well, we called him Frank after that costume party disaster. Even I've forgotten his previous name) and I were enemies for fourteen days, until we died and ended up here. Where? Here. 
The afterlife, as it turns out, is pretty much like regular life. No, you don't get to meet Gandhi, and wherever Hitler is, nobody seems to know, but it's alright. Fun, even. It's like a dream.

Time is erratic here. Winter lasts for months, fall mere minutes, and I can't remember the last time it was three in the afternoon.
You get used to it.
Anyways, Frank, Carla, and I were on the bus when it happened.
Speaking of Carla, zhe's excellent. Reliable. Loyal. Heavy-handed with the puns. Zhe mostly spent time with zher main 'group', but we got zher to tag along on our adventures sometimes. 
It. The announcement. It was almost undescribable. A trumpeting, almost robotic voice projected into all of our heads a strange, song-like speech. I couldn't tell you what the words were, as they were in a garbled version of a language I'd never heard but somehow understood, but the overall them was something like, ""Alert. Fire and madness. Alert. You are free to go. Please help. No."" repeating over, reverberating, twining around our veins, creeping into our bones.
And we were free to go. And we went.
We went somewhere, where Frank, Carla and I immediately proceeded to get in a fight with a pigeon, take a few deep breaths, and scream at the nameless horror that was the moon. Being dead_? Were we dead?_ is weird.

We walked. We walked through the endless, unchanging city, passing generic gas stations and brick walls whose details seemed to slip from our minds the more we thought of them. It was something to do.

The submission above has a story about someone punching something innocent. That guy got eaten. His name was also Frank. The two teenagers stood motionless, consumed with anticipation and fear. The gravity of the situation began to take effect. Frank started to sweat through his shirt. The Other Guy bit his nails ferociously. 

Two cars passed. 

Then three. 

A couple more. 

The Other Guy and Frank locked eyes for one fleeting moment.

[WP] It turns out that spiders want to be roommates and pay rent by putting change in your couch. They pay proportional to their size. One day you return to find two large bars of gold in your couch...,The-Potato-Lord,"Dave started noticing the random amounts of change all over his apartment three weeks ago. At first it was just a few nickels and dimes lying around. Hey, essentially free money, right? Dave didn’t think too much about it at first. He wasn’t one to complain about free money, he saved every penny he got. However, over a few days, he noticed more and more change appearing, and even a twenty-dollar bill. He had no idea where it came from because he almost never carried around cash or change. Was someone breaking into his house and stealing something? But they were nice enough to leave change for what they stole? Nah that didn’t really make sense. Dave didn’t believe in the kindness of strangers. That’s why he never gave to the homeless or donated to charities.

&amp;nbsp;

Dave decided to check around the apartment for any stolen goods anyways. He checked in the fridge but all the food seemed to still be there. He checked cupboards and inside the sofa but all he found were a few spiders and even more money. Dave wondered where all these spiders were coming from. He didn’t really mind them all that much as long as they stayed out of sight. One or two in the house helped to keep the other insects away. As Dave went to check under the couch, he recoiled back in horror and hit his neck against the coffee table. He didn’t even register the pain in his throbbing neck; he had just seen the biggest spider he’d ever seen in his life.

&amp;nbsp;

“What the fuck?” Dave said out loud. It must have been the size of a tennis ball. Dave decided that couldn’t have been right and cautiously went to check under the couch again. No, it really was the size of a tennis ball. And interestingly, it was standing on top of a $100 note; it moved back slowly as if it were telling Dave to take the bill. Dave didn’t want to put his hand anywhere near it. The spider moved further back and out of sight. His money hungry tendencies got the best of him and he grabbed the hundred-dollar bill. Little did Dave know that by accepting the money from the spider, he had agreed to a contract which allowed the spider to share his apartment.

Over the following days and weeks, Dave noticed more and more money showing up and coincidentally, more and more spiders around his house. Dave figured that the spiders were paying rent as a form of compensation for living in his house. Dave loved money and didn’t mind spiders so he continued to accept the 'agreement'.

However, one evening, as Dave was walking up to his apartment door after going out for groceries, he noticed something that terrified him. There were 4 massive holes near the bottom of his door and the door wasn’t locked. He heard movement inside his house and a whispery, rough voice.

“Ahh, that must be Dave at the door. Come on in Dave”

Dave didn’t have a choice. He decided to peek through the door and he saw the biggest spider he’d ever seen. It was taller than him!

“There you are Dave, I’ve been waiting all day for you. I got you something that you’ll love.” 
And there on the couch were two large bars of gold.

“What… what is this?”

“Gold Dave, its gold”

“Why are you here? What do you want?”

“Well Dave … how do I put this gently?"" 

""I need ... about tree fiddy” 

That’s when I noticed that the spider was actually a 7 foot tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era. It was the damned Loch Ness Monster.

“Damn it Locky, I ain’t got no tree fiddy for you” I said as the Loch Ness Monster fled the apartment. The spiders came out and cheered as I got rid of their arch nemesis.

[WP] It turns out that spiders want to be roommates and pay rent by putting change in your couch. They pay proportional to their size. One day you return to find two large bars of gold in your couch...,The-Potato-Lord,"Pincher sits on the floor in front of a coffee table with a loaded handgun in one hand and a half-finished BIC pen in the other.  The two large bricks of gold lie in the middle of the table, glistening as the afternoon sun shines its beams through a window.

On the other side of the table, the spider crawls. It's a big spider, close to the size of a 5-year-old baby, ringing in at around 40 pounds. Big-spider serves as a stool for its younger brother to rest upon as the brother holds his pen. Little-spider, sitting atop Big-spider stares over at the woman on the other end of the table.

The standard bar of gold weighs about 12.4 kilograms which is about 27 pounds in imperial units. The Spider-brothers offer Pincher two bars of gold totaling about 54 pounds, identical to their own combined weight. After all, a spider is only worth their weight in gold.

Pincher nods in understanding. As such is the power of the mute protagonist whose native tongue is the tongue of the world. Little-spider rattles his pincers together, in acknowledgment of the nod.

Big-spider pulls the two gold bars aside to pull the housing contract in. The terms are simple.

*1. Out of sight, out of mind.*

*2. Spiders are not allowed in the bedroom outside of human work hours.*

*3. The wifi password changes on a weekly basis. Consult Big-spider every Monday evening.*

*4. Toilet paper over. Toilet seat down.*

*5. No loud noises after 9 PM.*

*6. If the landlord asks, nobody's home.*

*Upon agreement of the rules and boundaries set above, Little-spider Garcia and Big-spider Dixon agree to pay to the current residents of the home a) two bars of gold, fashioned into a discrete mold to be melted down and sold. b) an additional monthly lump sum of human current equivalent to a ""fair portion of the rent."" c) a wifi/cable/phone family package of the Spider-brother's choosing. In turn, Pincher agrees to provide to the Spider-brothers a) a quiet corner to stay during all twenty hours of the day. b) an open window open in the bathroom at all times except when it's really, really cold outside because it gets really humid in there. c) the front window in the kitchen because that's prime real estate for fly-catching.*

Little-spider signs the bottom of the contract with whatever sort of mangly spider-signature he has. Big-spider clicks his pincers at Little-spider as if to say, ""Fuck, my man. Your handwriting is shit."" To which Little-spider replies ""Piss off.""

Big-spider presses the contract towards Pincher. Pincher thinks for a moment, doubting the offer. What if she wakes up one day in her bed and finds her mouth stuffed with cobwebs and dead flies just because she left the toilet seat up one time? It's a big risk to undertake, even if it means actually being able to afford actual food for dinner instead of just coffee creamers and dry, bulk rice.

Little-spider clicks his pincers to get Pincher's attention. Little-spider's tapped words echo in Pincher's ears, weaving a beautiful image in her mind of being able to have hot, non-instant coffee every morning with a top-of-the-line espresso maker that presses beans and hot water into delicious bean-juice in about 15 seconds flat. It would also come with a milk foamer, not just for free but the really expensive high-quality kind you'd expect from an electronics store that's uppity enough to charge you a restocking fee for a barely opened product.

Pincher could hardly believe it. She grabs contract and puts her pen down on the signature line, signing off with her own equally-shitty, if not shittier, penmanship above Little-spider's signature.

The Spider-brothers rejoice. Finally, their search for a home pays off and they will now have a place to set up camp for the impending summer. What joy it is to have a roof over your head.

It's at that moment, as Pincher runs to the fridge to pour a celebratory cold one for the boys, that her roommate opens the door and walks in.

Arthur, red-faced and scraggly-haired from a long hard night's job at the office, takes a long look at the room. His eyes first stare at the shiny, dark eyes of the woman who just signed over a corner of their flat over to two giant spiders. Then, he looks over at the two giant abominations sitting on his and Pincher's loveseat. Then, he moves onto the two bars of gold on the coffee table. And then, he sees the contract.

Arthur moves to pick up the contract, reads it over briefly, and sets it back down on the coffee table.

""This isn't legally binding, none of you can read, and the girl's not old enough to sign a legally binding contract anyway.""

The Spider-brothers pinch their pincers together, frustrated that they need to renew their offer to yet another dumbass living in the apartment. Big-spider ponders using the abandoned gun to solve the issue. Arthur too ponders using the gun to solve the issue. Neither of them is ballsy enough to make the first move. The gun remains unused.

Arthur pushes past this and moves to address Pincher, ""This is a drawing of a flower with a seagull on top of it. Not a signature.""

Pincher raises an eyebrow and continues to crack open a bottle anyway. Arthur groans. The spider-brothers begin writing up a new document. All's well that ends well.

""Listen here, Pipsqueak, I'll be honest. I'm fucking terrified of arachnids. I'm not sure if it'd be a good idea to essentially sign a lease with a group of organisms I'm liable to shit myself over.""

Another day, another attempt by pipsqueak to try and get me to make a contract for him and his eight legged brethren. It's extremely annoying, especially since I didn't come up with the idea. I just found the money one day, and my Ashkenazi ancestry got the best of me. Next thing I know, there's everything from banana spiders in my kitchen to tarantulas on my coffee table!

&amp;nbsp; 

When I got home from work that morning, I just about evacuated my bowels.
On my table, there were two gold bars, about the size of my forearm. All of a sudden I heard an Australian voice say ""Oi mate. Come over 'ere and talk."" I was still only in the entryway, so I couldn't see all of my living room. When I walked in, there was a spider the size of a German Shepard on the opposite side of my couch. ""That explains the Australian accent. Some beast of your size could only originate from there."" The hellspawn only stared at me. ""Impressive! You managed to survive my death stare. Now go crack open a cold one so we can start this like a shrimp on the barbie."" Why is everyone in my life a stereotype, I thought as I walked to the fridge. ""I don't have any beer, just wine."" I opened my fridge, and there were several spiders lowering a case of Bud Lite onto a shelf. ""I 'ad some of me mates get some."" After I opened the bottle for the thing across from me (and got myself a dozen glasses of wine), it produced a piece of paper that had the words ""Lease"" in big letters at the top. ""Rule 1: The human will provide beer whenever it is needed. Rule 2: The human may not kill any flies using a fly shatter or fly trap. The hunt is the best part. Rule 3: The human will maintain a minimum temperature of 70 degrees in the house. The human will not be blamed if power goes out in the winter due to things outside his control. Okay, that all sounds agreeable. Now for my rules. Rule 1: Under no circumstances are any spiders to onto my bed, period, into my bedroom while I am not in there, or into the bathroom, period. Rule 2: No more going into the fridge. Rule 3: No spider shall try and scare me. Pranks are fine, but no hiding in my jacket, or in between my couch cushions, or anything else like that. Rule 4: All payments will be made in time for rent, or before the current video game sales end. Especially the Steam Summer Sale. Rule 5: You can't touch my gaming equipment without my permission. And before, you think about these terms, let me remind you I believe in something called concealed carry."" The Australian Demon looked over the contract, dipped one of its legs in ink and put it on paper. ""I guess it's my turn."" And thus, I started a lease with an Australian spider and his mates.",Littlebigcountry

His eyes widened as he gazed up at the tall, reflective wall. He had never known Aaron to possess such objects and he hadn't heard his usual disgruntled chatting about the house. He continued to stare at the wall, wondering how its surface felt. Cold perhaps? Or maybe a nice warmness absorbed from the soft cotton foundation underneath. Yarn told him to never climb alone though, but why not just one time? Before his thoughts could continue, the foundation shook he and the wall. These tremors were larger than anything he had known before. No, he thought, I must gather the others before climbing.

**The Big Guy**

*I've looked everywhere*, he thought with a good bit of frustration. The bastard said he'd be here. *Looks like he was smart enough to not leave it here either, or at least nowhere easy to get*. Briefly, he considered burning down the building, calling quits to the whole thing, and finding a good boat. *How would I? No money, no stamps, not a damn thing but some shitty pants and a good jacket that's too tight.* He paused his pacing. *Could always just take the gold, but then I'd be just making it even harder to leave.* He would have sit down, but the tardy tart was an Arachnihead. Gross eight legged pests, he saw at least one, maybe more, crawling about that old maroon couch. He'd go and kill the damn bug if it weren't for the stories; stories of men killing one spider only to be charged by thousands. He knew it was likely only a tale, but the couch did look like it had some depth to it...

[WP] It turns out that spiders want to be roommates and pay rent by putting change in your couch. They pay proportional to their size. One day you return to find two large bars of gold in your couch...,The-Potato-Lord,"Sam sat there, just staring at the two solid bars of gold. This marked a definite deviation from the way things commonly went. Another deviation was the pair of oversized spiders sitting on the couch across from him, to the left and right of the gold.

""This is unusual"", he finally managed to say through a throat gone dry.

There was a kind of chirping, or rasping sound over a backdrop of a beehive. Then, a little box hanging around one spider's...neck...spoke: ""Yes, we know. We don't feel safe anywhere else, and we were given testimonies as to your accomodating nature. We were told this was how you do business.""

He nodded jerkily, the tension robbing the motion of any elegance or fluidity. 

""Yes, but in general, spiders don't talk to me. And, no offense intended, I've never seen any...specimens...quite your size, either.""

Again that rasping, chirping, buzzing sound, then the translator box voiced: ""We're not from around here, really, and truth be told, we are a little desperate. So, will you allow us to move in?""

Sam coughed nervously. All kinds of thoughts about deadly *poisonous* spiders spinning around in his head. And spiders the size of grown dogs could probably kill a dinosaur with a single bite, let alone him. The visions of himself getting bitten, all cocooned up then lazily slurped empty didn't help make him any more relaxed, so he banished them and forced himself to focus on the material. Sweat started forming beads on his forehead. And basically everywhere else. 

""I'm a bit scared, you know. Most...inhabitants...hail from around here, and none are poisonous enough to threaten me. To be quite frank, your presence makes me more than a bit uncomfortable."" He cleared his throat, then continued: ""You know, from a purely business point of view, I'm not sure I could accept your proposal. You're grossly overpaying, and it just wouldn't feel fair.""

More rasping: ""Yes, about that.""

The words sent a chill down Sam's spine. He was in his early thirties, so not old by any means, but these words were never followed by anything good.

""Sam - may we call you Sam?"" Another jerky nod. ""Sam, we want to be completely truthful with you. When we said we weren't from around here, we didn't mean this region. We meant we're not from this planet. For reasons we would prefer not to talk about, we had to...immigrate here, and we're looking for a safe space. So, some of the extra pay is to buy your goodwill. The second bar is for you to extend the house. We'll need room for the kids.""

Sam opened his mouth to speak, closed it, opened it again, then snapped it shut, unable to even form a coherent thought.

Interpreting his shock as rejection, the spider adressed him again.

""We're sorry we cannot afford more right now. If this is not enough, we could maybe offer a working arrangement of some kind. You see, our poison is, indeed deadly, but it also produces a very pronounced euphoric effect, so our...um...food remains blissfully still during the...er...containment process.""

Sam visibly paled, but before he could respond, the spider continued.

""Now, we've been self-aware and sentient for a long time, so we have learned to...control the specific composition of the chemical. In layman's terms, we can produce the drug without the poison component. Back at home, this was a necessity to maintain our livestock in...happy conditions. It is thoroughly addictive if we want to, but it does not have to be.""

Sam sat frozen, unable to even move. A ticking, clicking sound shook him from his immobile state, and he turned to the source of the new noise. The window was closed, fortunately, but what he saw almost tore the few remainders of his sanity apart.

Outside his window was a wasp twice the size of the spiders on his couch.

He almost didn't notice the buzzing rasp, before the voice box exclaimed: ""Crap, they found us!""

The translator managed to sound almost snobbishly British as the spider drily added: ""Also, we need protection.""

[WP] It turns out that spiders want to be roommates and pay rent by putting change in your couch. They pay proportional to their size. One day you return to find two large bars of gold in your couch...,The-Potato-Lord,"My manager got on to me again about the women's restroom again.  How am I possibly supposed to keep up with women, hovering over the toilets, and making disgusting messes all over the toilet seat, used pads left floating in the toilet after the flush cycle failed to remove them--all while stocking the shelves in the store's many departments?  It's not like I don't care; it's just that I'd rather be doing literally anything else than wondering just how much blood can a single woman leave while she's in a restroom for five minutes?  More questions about my pathetic employment swirled through my my mind as I walked up the stairs to my apartment.

My apartment building in the ""questionable"" part of town is yet another reminder that I don't get paid nearly enough for everything I do at work.  ""Questionable"" has a couple of different meanings here.  The crime here is noticeable but manageable--my car has only been broken into twice this month.  Well, it was unlocked--having someone open a door without having to break a window is less hassle for me.  The occasional turd left behind just outside my driver's door by a homeless slumberjack is a definite annoyance, but at least he has the presence of mind not to *hover* over my back seat and do it there.

The other ""questionable"" meaning about this neighborhood is that the spiders here seem a bit...knowledgeable about the market and currency, in general.  There is a bit of a deal made between us and our eight-legged roommates about paying part of the rent.  The smaller the spiders, the smaller their share of the rent.  Payment is deposited between the couch cushions.  The agreement is generally that they can live with us in our dingy little hovels as long as they pay rent and keep out of the way.  Our part of the bargain involves us not stepping on them or otherwise killing them whenever we see them.  Payment is proportional to the size and number of the spiders.  Spiders can lay tons of eggs which can hatch even more spiders in a short period of time.  I rarely find coins in my couch cushions, as coins are far heavier than dollar bills--which works better for me.

No spoken dialogue has ever taken place between anyone and the spiders, to my knowledge.  I guess that someone noticed a spider dragging a dollar bill across the living room to the couch and leaving it there, the owner didn't notice any missing money, guessed that that spider somehow had a job or something, and word spread around the building as more spiders were seen leaving more currency.  So it stuck.  Really hard to keep a girlfriend, though, when she learns you live in ""that"" apartment complex.

I unlocked and opened my door and was immediately assaulted by the smell.  No, not the smell of the women's restroom at my department store--it smelled like someone was in my kitchen, cooking something.  It smelled pretty decent, too--almost like someone's cooking tacos.  I cautiously walked towards my brightly-lit kitchen, where I could now here the sounds of something sizzling in a frying pan, cutting up some vegetable with a knife, and...pounding out dough?  I walked by the couch on the way to the kitchen, and immediately noticed the two gold bars sitting on top of the cushions.  Was this a joke?  I moved more slowly towards the kitchen.

*KSSSSSSSSssssssss*  Wow, someone really knew how to cook.  I rounded the corner, and came face-to-face with the largest spider I had ever seen.  Standing on its four hind legs, it used its other four legs to handle a different object.  I immediately noticed it was cutting up tomatoes with a knife in one ""hand"", handling dough with another ""hand"", maneuvering one of my frying pans with yet another ""hand"", and keeping the page current in one of my grandmother's cookbooks with its remaining ""hand"".  Judging by the mess already on the counter and piling up in the sink, this spider had apparently mixed the dough from scratch and was kneading it, had manually grounded up some beef I had in the freezer and was frying it, and knew how to read a cookbook.

The gold bars left on my couch alone ensured my rent would be paid for at least the next 6 to 8 months.  The food smelled great, although I was sure there'd be a few dead bugs in it somewhere.  I didn't know exactly how our living arrangements would accommodate each other.

All I knew later that night is she could cook a mean taco.",NukEvil
[WP] It turns out that spiders want to be roommates and pay rent by putting change in your couch. They pay proportional to their size. One day you return to find two large bars of gold in your couch...,The-Potato-Lord,"**PART I**


Huh? What? I pick my head up, peel scrap papers from the side of my face, which has become beet red from the unforgiving desk it had previously laid upon. A sound, something struck the floor as I sat slouched over my desk fast asleep. 


The boss has had me in the office training the new interns and expects a full twenty-page analysis of our firm's most recent condominium design due Monday. It's Friday I'm not even ten pages through! Probably explains why I just woke up with my eyebrow resting against the front entrance. What was that sound?


Still within a semi-conscious state from having just woken up, I gaze with my groggy eyes below my worn leather office chair. I see stringy brown, grey and black spindles of carpet scrunched against the transparent plastic mat atop which my chair sits. Nothing out of the ordinary there. I spin clumsily to the right and peer into the kitchen. Inspecting the floor, all is well. I stand to get a better view of the counter-tops. Nothing unusual.  *PING* The sound again! And this time I'm ready. I heard it from the living room behind me. I quickly shuffle to turn the light on, excitement building within me. My excitement was delayed however due to the slight inconvenience of the light switch not being where I thought it was. I recently took over the lease here and haven't quite got a hang of the place yet. Left side of the couch, right! I scurried around the couches edge to reach the switch *flick*. I gaze quickly into the living room. **AHHH** You could have told me someone tossed a flash-bang into my apartment and I would have believed you. Its two in the morning, my eyes were not prepared. 


After thirty seconds of what could have looked like sign language directed at the ceiling fixture, I had regaining my vision. In the middle of the floor between the couch and the television stand lay two exceptionally grudging coins, both of equal size. To the side of the coins lay a note, taped at its ends. Curiosity and excitement had now started to become fear and loathing. I retrieve the note and examine it. On the outside of the note written in deep black ink: 


**For Brian, DON'T RUN**

*edit: spacing*


**PART II**


*Hey Brian, what's up buddy? This is from Geoff Fultz, the dude who leased you this place! Hope all has gone well in your first week, sure hope Spencer got this to you on time. You'll meet Spencer later. Anyway there's a bit more information about this place that I kept secret, and since you are now officially on the lease and moved in I feel safe in confiding in you.* 


*You see, Brian, I have lived here in this very apartment for a number of years now. I have made quite a few friends while staying here and with those friends I have created quite an invaluable service. Though I would very much like to stay here and continue to tend to my costumers I have much more pressing matters ahead. Now, I know you must be wondering why I did not inform you of this beforehand but that is due to the nature of it all. You remember the DONT RUN bit? Most people tend to run when I tell them about it. So I figured to hell with telling you, and here we are.*


*Don't think of trying to find me or get into any legal business as maybe you have assumed by now my name is not Geoff Fultz. Who spells Jeff with a G anyway? Nope, you're stuck buddy. But to be honest with you, this situation isn't half bad. If you give it time I think it might really grow on ya!*


*I'm just gonna dive right on in: I run what is basically a hotel for spiders. Myself and my assistant Spencer, who also happens to be a spider, have constructed tiny hovels throughout the interiors of the walls within the apartment. There are approximately 1000 spider rooms throughout the apartment in every wall but the kitchen and master bedroom, but you wont need to worry about logistics, Spencer handles all that. The best part of all this is that the spiders pay for the rooms! Each spider pays a dollar per gram of body weight. Spencer pays half the normal rate, she demanded I grandfather her in when I made a rate change last year. She's probably already paid you. Anyway, you shouldn't ever have to worry about the spiders not paying for their rooms. Surprising spiders are quite honest creatures and they are also super adept at finding loose change and bills. Spencer is the most keen, though her payments generally tend to be the more disgusting looking coins. The apartment is completely vacant aside from yourself and Spencer. ting ting* 

I jolt my head up as something taps against the sliding glass door.


**PART III**


I look to my left and see nothing but myself, mirrored in the darkness of the outside world. Just then a small smudge darts from the bottom of the glass pane into exactly where I had been looking. My heart is racing at this point, blood flowing to every each of my body. Once I can focus I notice that the smudge is what I suspected it would be, a spider. And from the information I have gathered so far, I'm left to assume this is Spencer. The spider remains still, eerily so and stares blankly back at me with beedy black eyes. I inspect further and realize, to my horror, that Spencer might just be a black widow. Red lightning bolt shape on the thorax and completely coated in glossy black death. We continue examining each other, both still as can be. Her slender, toothpick legs begin to move. The widow disappears in a blur of silk and darkness and then everything is still. 


**Are you going to answer it?** The letters were strewn about, haphazardly but legibly so in spider silk on the pane of glass. *Ting ting* 


I hesitate, knowing full well the devastation a black widow can create, standing firmly in the middle of my poorly decorated living room. The widow seemed to sense my uncomfort and scurried onto the wall beside the sliding glass door, well away from myself. Looking back at the letters on the glass a second time: **Are you going to answer it?** After a couple deep breaths I make my way toward the door handle. I grasp tightly, slide the door open and bolt to the other side of the couch, all the way across the living room. Without pause, the widow crept to the opening and seemed to usher a second and third spider into a notch in the wall and underneath the fireplace in the corner of the living room. Everything become still and I sat cautiously on the couch, half expecting five more spiders to come crawling out.  


This is nuts! All my life I have either ran from spiders, stomped on them or tried to get them out of my home. Now I'm letting them into my home? Am I dreaming? Could this all just be a weird nightmare? To get my head straight, I head to the sink to fix myself a glass of water and realize I am still clutching the note ""Geoff"" left me. Water first. I gulp down the entire glass and things are starting to set in. This isn't a dream or a nightmare, this is real. I set my glass onto the granite counter top and and open the note once again. 


*The apartment is completely vacant except for you and Spencer. That is until Freddy and Tilly show up. That's one part of the business that you're responsible for, you gotta let the spiders in. Spencer isn't able to get the door open and I could never figure out a plausible way of having entry other than opening and closing the back door. You know how I said that spiders are surprisingly honest? Well they are also some that are incredibly dishonest, just like any other species. We gotta watch out for those folk, Spencer has a keen eye for em'. Aside from all that there isn't much else you really need to do. Spencer will fill you in on any arrival/departure times of our guests. She knows your work schedule and will plan around it as best she can. Good luck and I hope you end up enjoying the place Its got a great view of the city, recently remodeled kitchen, new carpeting (fitted with spider tunnels), and above all else, Spencer is planning a five-hundred room expansion!*


*Oh yeah, and make sure to check the couch, for whatever reason that's where the spiders like to deposit their rent.*


After finishing the note I decide it best that I get some sleep. I still have a lot of work to do on my analysis paper and perhaps all of this still really is a some sort of dream and a good nights rest will cure it all. I lumber to my bed, instead of my desk, flop myself on my mattress and am asleep in an instant. Tomorrow will be different.

One day you return to find two large bars of gold in your couch...,The-Potato-Lord,"Gold of that size and quality sold for a lot of money. Enough to sustain me for the rest of the year. Yet the idea of a better, more relaxing life was not what I was focusing on. There was money, yes, but how did the money get there? Small spiders could only lift small bars, and bigger ones could lift larger ones. I'd collected pay from the hundreds of spiders who called my home theirs, since I was an insect enthusiast. But a spider this size couldn't coexist with the rest! Though studying it would be rather intriguing.

It didn't matter. Unlike usual, the money did not come with the rentee, so I accepted the free cash albeit with some trepidation. No gigantic arachnid disturbed me that day an the next, so I assumed I'd got the better of it. Until, of course, I realized I'd missed out the obvious clue. Spiders left gold on the kitchen counter to show their colonization of the kitchen top. So the gold bar on the sofa meant... I wasn't going to watch TV for some time.

But with such a huge beast I'd never laid my eyes upon around, my life was filled with fear and paranoia. Even the normal, tiny spiders that took up residence in my quarters were not spared my increasing hatred towards their kind. The soft pattering of their legs could be the walking sounds of the monster, the torturer. But every week, just like the others, the payment was ready on my woolen sofa. At least the pay was good.

Until I had an idea. If that spider was so wealthy, then surely I would be able to kill it for money, and simultaneously remove my terrorizer. It had to have a stash somewhere in the couch. I'd no idea if it was immune to insecticide, but I wasn't taking any chances. The spider was hardy, but certainly less so than the gold it brought. With one strike, I heard a crunch, and within the sofa I found 10 more bars, stashed away at the far corner. Delighted with my fortune and more so by the spider's removal, I went back to my usual spider rearing.

When I woke up the next day, my hand touched something cold. I looked up. Above my bed, dangling from the ceiling were 100 gold bars. ",FrozenBolts

[WP] It turns out that spiders want to be roommates and pay rent by putting change in your couch. They pay proportional to their size. One day you return to find two large bars of gold in your couch...,The-Potato-Lord,"I am often questioned for my choice of degree. There are very few people who want to be entymologists. These questions almost always increase when they discover my arachnophobia. Why would someone who is afraid of spiders study spiders for a living?

At first, it was my parents suggestion. They told me the easiest way to get over my fear was to learn more about the object of my fear. So I studied spiders. I became the most spider-obsessed kid in my school. But I remained afraid.

However, while I did not get over my fear, I learned ways to get rid of spiders. To ensure they never came near me. I learned things that made it so that, even though I feared spiders, they feared me more.

I was the first to discover that spiders hide change in sofas. After I learned that, getting rid of the spiders in my house was easy. Every day, I checked between my cushions. If I found any money, I would leave it there with an eviction notice. The next day, both the money and the notice would be gone.

Then I found the two gold bars. I knew that payment was proportional to biomass, so that could only mean a giant spider. As usual, I left an eviction notice on the top of the money, but it wasn't enough to assuage my fear. Somehow, such a beast had made its way into my home and was living here unbeknownst to me. I went into the attic to retrieve a costume I had made years ago specifically for fighting spiders.

I began searching the house from top to bottom. I looked in every nook and cranny I could find, but I saw no sign of the giant spider. Finally, I was forced to give up. It would all be resolved by tomorrow.

I did not sleep that night. I knew that, somewhere in my house, there was a gigantic beast waiting to prey upon my flesh. I could not close my eyes, lest the arachnidal horror attack me whilst I am unaware.

I left the house as early as possible, desperate to escape from the web of horrors. We may keep spiders at the lab, but they are kept in containers. I knew I was safe there. Unfortunately, my coworkers mistook my tiredness for illness, and I was sent home before lunch. Hopefully, the beast had seen the notice and left.

As soon as I returned home, I ran to the living room and flipped over the cushions. To my surprise, while the eviction notice had been taken, there was still one gold bar left. Curious, I picked it up to examine it before realizing my two follies - first, each spider uses one item to pay for their rent, and second, tge act of picking up the payment is considered acceptance.",gemohandy

A few years ago, humanity was shocked when spiders came out, saying that they want to be our roommates, and will pay the rent, as well. No one was more shocked than I was on this matter since I always lived with a huge amount of spiders. My house is a small house located somewhere far away. It’s literally occupied by spiders! All sorts of spiders, but thankfully all of them are smaller.

Daily, I earn more than one hundred dollars. This business is quite good for me! They are good roommates, unlike some humans; spiders do not put music loudly or bring chicks late at night. Nor do they steal some of my food in the fridge, nor will they ever go as far as to steal my girlfriend. Damn you, John.

Anyway, I’m getting off topic, ain’t I?

Right now, the thing that’s bothering me is… well, I don’t know how to explain this. Currently, in front of me, I can see two gold bars. As to what that could mean, take a guess.

THERE ARE TWO HUGE SPIDERS, OR EVEN WORSE, ONE GIGANTIC SPIDER.

How do I handle this? I’m fine with handling the smaller ones, even if they are in great numbers, but the bigger spiders, they are terrifying. I remember watching Harry Potter when I saw that gigantic spider, I almost wet my pants.

I hope this isn’t happening right now, it can’t be, right? 

This is just a dream, anyway.

“Yo, human, you’re out of booze.”

I heard a feminine voice, turning around, I saw horror.

It was a huge spider, bigger than I am. He is currently equipped with an empty bottle of beer.

“What…?”

“Oh, right! I forgot. You humans still don’t know we large ones can speak. Nice to meet you, my name is John!”

I just stood in awe.

“Don’t be afraid, I don’t bite… he he he.”

“What is that creepy laugh, Mr Spider?”

“No need to be so formal with me, just call me John.”

“Someone is pranking me, I swear.”

That had to be it, right?!

I approached the spider, hoping to reveal a costume or something. I touched it and regretted it.

It brushed me off and started yelling at me:

“No touching! I can eat you anytime I want, so you better not provoke me. Anyway, I hope to have fun here. If you don’t offer me fun, then… Trust me, you do not want to see me mad.”

A second, equally large spider came in the room. It spoke with the same voice, to my dismay.

“Nice seeing ya, lad. Now, where’s that booze?”

“Umm… Just a second, sir! I will go to the store!”

How did I end up being their slave?!

[WP] You can see into the future. However you notice that all you see in the near future is death. Tell me a story of someone trying to change that future.,TheJellyToaster,"It's a gift I've always had.  You know, your mother wants to know if she should take that job, or your friend wants to know if she should ask that guy out.  These questions relay in my head and I can see the paths and what will happen clearly.  I've always called it the web.  Thousands of possibilities, synthesized in my head in seconds, to tell someone what the optimal decision was in any given situation.  I never really called it seeing the future as much as enhanced logical deduction.

Until three days ago.

When the news anchor mentioned that there was a comet that would be visible to us as it passed in it's orbit, I got a flash, a sudden understanding that this was it.  This was the extinction level event that people had long since feared, and no one even knew.  It played out in my head, children playing in the streets when the comet was pulled in by earths gravity and crashed into that neighborhood in the suburbs of Chicago, leveling city blocks miles away.  I could see the dust cloud that would drop the temperature of the earth, and all the people who die from starvation.  Airline travel would stop, and supplies would be scare.  The world would be full of looting, violence, depravity... it would be as common as watching the sun rise. 

First, I had tried to shake it off, thinking it was my over active imagination, but I knew it wasn't and for an hour or two, I found myself paralyzed in fear.  It glued me to the chair unable to move, unable to speak because why would anyone listen to me?  A college student with no scientific training?  So I did what any rational person would do, I texted those I loved and warned them, and they texted those they loved, because they knew how right I normally was, and pretty soon the internet found out. Less than six hours after the vision some scientist fucking around at work saw the post on facebook and decided to check the comets trajectory and figured out I wasn't full of shit.  He told his boss, who told the news, and people had 48 hours to escape, and governments had 48 more hours to prepare.  

I'm still sitting in my chair as I watch the breaking news of the comet crashing into the suburbs of Chicago.  The future in my mind is different now. Most will still die, you can't stop it all - but humanity will survive. I guess I saved the world.  But now that I know that I have this power, now that I carry the weight of everyone's life on my shoulders?   What is going to become of me?",frostysbox

"[WP] Not everyone who wants to be a world-conquering Mad Scientist gets the education required. As a result, you are now the world's first and only Mad Plumber.",The_Just_Writer,"I had been working for a while on my plot to take over the world. I had gotten involved in my local plumber's union, and before long I had pulled enough strings and made friends with the right people and I had an esteemed place in the union. And I was well-liked among them, they could see that my work was steadily granting respect for our trade. It wasn't too much that I was doing, just things that others hadn't thought to do.

I started by designing more and more convoluted techniques, so that people would be more likely to have to call the plumber. I set up a rotating schedule for people to edit wiki articles that helped people ""solve their own plumbing problems"". Some of the more innocent plumbers would only change them to be more complicated, to have complicated vocabulary for things, but as we went on, some of my closer companions in my quest helped me start to encourage the use of more and more dangerous chemicals for people to solve their problems.

Of course after a while there were some plumbers that began to notice the sinister turn of events and they had to be dealt with. Peter Flynn was an old man, he had complaints, but all he could do was retire. The real problem would be Fowrma, he was the head of the union. We were on friendly terms, but he was really getting in the way of my schemes. He lead the argument that we shouldn't recommend certain chemicals for personal use. I had to find a way to deal with him, and I would have to get it right on my first try. I considered some form of murder, but that would raise too many questions. I wanted to take over the world, but this would be too obvious. I began looking for opportunities for him, recommending him to other districts. This would come off as friendly, but also distance him from being a problem.

Within a few months I had an opportunity for him that he would be foolish to refuse. I was elected head of the union. I had enough friends in the union that I could pass practically anything I wanted. I had made my first real breakthrough toward taking over the world.

I opened my own plumbing business with my closest friends. We had some people kicked out of the union for various reasons and before long we had a monopoly on the industry in our district. The company was raking in cash, and with it we invested in toilet paper companies. Within a couple months we had developed a brand of toilet paper that tripled the number of clogged toilets. Not only were our visits more expensive, but we had regulation passed that said that our union had to approve all personal-use plumbing products, so even if people solved their own problems, we got a cut, because we had invested in the businesses that we approved. We could also raise the prices and no-one could compete without leaving the district. We also started raising the standards for plumbing, everyone had to replace their PVC pipes with our plumber-approved brand, and you can guess where most of the profit from that went.

These various plumbing-related companies started doing the Walmart tactic where they would move to a new area and lower their prices to deficit spending. Then, if the unions around there weren't quick enough to snuff it out, all the local plumbers would lose their income and their companies go out of business. No-one would be left and it would be yet another place we could push all these useless regulations.

I was doing well, and no-one knew my name.

But people were starting to take notice. We were starting to bother a large portion of the population. We were earning, in some places, more than twice what their local government was getting from the people. A lot of people didn't want to argue, just to pay their bill to the new regime and not have to deal with us. We would happily oblige, and charge them slightly more the next time.

But then late-night talk shows started attacking us. Before long, [John Oliver had many of our regulations removed](http://time.com/3674807/john-oliver-net-neutrality-civil-forfeiture-miss-america/). More than that, he cited Fowrma, the guy who once sat at the head of my local union. It seemed like they were straight up working together. People began asking more questions about the services they were getting. This was a small blow to our income, but it was far from the end of my work.

We went criminal.

There are a number of criminal organizations, and many of them were happy to work with us because we often got access to places that the general public doesn't have access to. They would give us a target, we would do something or other to give them plumbing problems, and before long we had infiltrated. After that it was usually an easy job to find information in the building, or about the building, at least to a certain extent. Now some of these organizations would just pay cash, but some organizations were happy to do a favor in return. Suddenly a number of our more outspoken critics would start getting wrapped up with a criminal organization. Or perhaps they would contract some hard-to-trace disease. I'm sure you've anticipated that Fowrma was going to have been one on this list.

My biggest regret is here, it's that I so wanted to get to rid the world of Fowrma myself. I was getting cocky. I had never even killed before, as hard as that may be to believe. But I used some connections that assured me I would be made able to do it. They let me into his house in the night. My weapon of choice was a wrench. Two thugs were with me, to make sure it would go well. They woke him and brought him downstairs to me. Tied him up to a chair before I let him see me.

""YOU??"", he said when he saw me. His nose was already bloodied. He still looked like the head of the union, but now I was going to end him with a wrench.

""Hello Foorma"", I said.

""it's Fowrma"", he corrected, ""it's alw-- ... sorry"".

I realized I didn't really have anything to say to him, but I felt I had to say something.

""So... any last words?""

""Wait, I don't understand... why were you a plumber?"" he asked innocently.

What a stupid question, ""What do you mean, I was a plumber. Why were you a plumber?""

""Well I just wondered, if you're in organized crime, why would you be a... a plumber. Like don't people pay you to like kill people or...""

""No, I'm a plumber first, it's what I do, I'm just--""

""So this crime this, is it just like a side thing? Just a--""

""Just listen for a sec, okay? I'm just a regular plumber with big ambitions. Just taking over the world, one clogged toilet at a time"".

There was an awkward pause. I couldn't tell what he was thinking.

""What?"", I asked, ""What is it?""

""Are you gonna kill me now?"", he asked.

""No wait, what were you gonna say?""

""Just... I guess I just didn't expect... you're trying to take over the world as a plumber?""

Suddenly the wall behind us was light up. I looked around and a silhouette shouted with a loudspeaker, ""Put down the wrench and come out with your hands on your head"".

I took one last look at Fowrma's head right there, in my reach. So close, yet so very far.

""Fwoopa, they set me up"", I said, dropping the wrench.

I suppose the story from then on was a bit irrelevant. Obviously that didn't hold up great in court. We tried bribing the judge, but she wouldn't budge.

Anyway, that's what I'm doing in jail.

"[WP] Humanity's first contact with alien life was a defenseless child, found in the wreckage of a crashed spaceship, desperately begging their mother to wake up.",The_Just_Writer,"Tom took a sip from his coffee mug as he stared out the window of observation post 25-BD7. He was greeted by the same empty white view of snow that he saw day in and day out.

""Will have to actually go out and clear this window one of these days..."" 

He took another sip, continuing to enjoy his view. 

""Not that it'd matter. Just barren wasteland.""

He padded his way into the lab. According to the building plan, the lab was meant to be the central hub of the research station, used strictly for planetary observation and recording of ""extraordinary events"". 

In practice, the lab was used as a Tom's rec room. The couch from bedroom was dragged against one wall and a holo-display was jerryrigged to project against the opposite wall with the same seven episode of ""Captain Stargazer"" on an almost constant loop. The actual research equipment was shoved against a far corner gathering a rather impressive collection of dust.

""Join the research corps they said."" Tom complained aloud. ""You'll explore the stars! Find new and interesting discoveries!"" 

He sat down heavily on the couch. ""You definitely won't just send the same report over and over again while you freeze your butt off on a planet in the outer fringe of the galaxy!""

He crossed his arms, sighing. With a jab of his foot, he pressed the button on the remote to turn on episode five of season 3. 

""Don't even have the full season."" He grumbled, as he placed his mug on the table beside him.

""Last time, on Captain Stargazer!"" He said, speaking in unison with the announcer, ""We left our famous hero on the brink of disaster! Trapped in the clutches o-""

He stopped suddenly when be noticed a quick vibration in the floor. He slowly eased himself down to the floor, placing both hands on the simple carpet. 

He felt another tremor with his hands and frowned. ""If this means the generator is about to explode...""

A larger tremor caused his mug to make a short hop toward the edge of the table.

""If it meant something bad before, this means something worse.""

He rose to his feet, he felt another tremor, even larger this time. This one caused his mug to complete its journey to the edge of the table and reach its destination of the floor. 

""Well this day can't get wo-"" 

He was cut short when something tore through the East wall of the lab and took a good part of the ceiling with it. Stumbling backwards at the blast of cold, wind, and debris, Tom braced himself against the door frame. 

""Jesus Christmas what in the Christ!"" 

He waited briefly to make sure another section of the room wouldn't be torn apart, then slowly approached his new window. 

Leaning out the hole, he squinted at the ridge of displaced snow that lead to the object that had decided to renovate his research station.

""A... ship?"" He glanced at the watch he wasn't wearing, then thought, ""I'm not due for a resupply for three weeks...""

Scampering back into what was left of his station, he arubked his way to the airlock. 

After donning various layers of heat protection, including heavy boots, thermal reduction gloves, Ai enhanced goggles, and a knit scarf sent from his mom, he began plodding his way through the snow to the ship. 

As he approached, two things became apparent: one, that the ship wasn't going to be flying again, and two, that it he had never seen one like it. Smooth curves and intricate details that looked like lettering on a foreign language where in place of the usual blocky and plain designs he was used to seeing.

""Are they testing new military toys out here now? They could at least send an email or something first...""

He glanced back in the direction the ship must have come from and saw several pieces of the craft marking a rough trail. 

""Well that explains the tremors.""

He circled the ship until he got to what looked like an airlock. A flashing display was reading a warning of some kind, but in the same strange language. 

""They could at least have printed them in English, jeeze. Not like it's an emergency or anything.""

Shrugging, he tapped the left button on the display. 

""Open is usually the left one, right?"" 

The airlock opened with a swoosh, revealing an interior that was designed similar to the exterior.

""They have a design and they stuck to it I guess.""

Tom trudged through the halls of the ship, making his way toward what he assumed was the front. 

""Not that anyone would've survived this, but should check anyway.""

He reached an important looking door, and pressed several buttons nearby that he assumed would open it. 

The doors opened with a similar swoosh to the airlock after the fourth button press, and the froze midway through pressing a fifth.

The bridge was designed similar to the ones he had seen before, but the major difference was the body that lay across the main controls. 

It was humanoid, but vastly different to what is academically considered ""human."" Pale blue skin, limbs that were slightly too long, knees that bent like an animal. 

Tom realized be was hammering at the control panel, trying to find the close door button.

""Gat'ow?""

Tom froze his button smashing at the sound. He Turned slowly to see a second creature, but this one seemed only to be tall enough to reach his knee. 

It stared up at him with large, black eyes. 

""Gat'ow?"" It seemed to ask, tugging at the sleeve of the larger creature.

""Uh yah. Gatow to you. Yep."" He was hammering at the buttons again. 

The creature almost seemed on the verge of tears, tugging on the sleeve. 

""Ah geeze I'm not trained for this uh."" 

Tom took a hesitant step into the room. ""Look uh.. kid. I think. Unless you're a Yoda situation... I'm sure your mo- da- parental guardian is fine. They probably just hit the-""

He stopped when he noticed the larger creature had been impailed through the chest by a piece of debris. He glanced down at the creature without moving his head. 

""Okay. First contact. With a orphan toddler.""

He knelt down to look at the creature at eye level. ""Want to go somewhere uh that's not here?"" He said, extending a shaky hand. 

The creature hesitantly wrapped a hand around two of his fingers and started to guide him toward the door. 

""Oh well if you know where we're going then yeah sure...""",PenguinWithAKeyboard

"[WP] Humanity's first contact with alien life was a defenseless child, found in the wreckage of a crashed spaceship, desperately begging their mother to wake up.",The_Just_Writer,"""Fransen, get the techs, they might want to see this."" I say, running my hand across a panel of exposed wiring, ""*Complex, intermeshed, pretty damn sophisticated.*"" I mumble.  

Fransen eventually returns with three women clad in white lab coats, who immediately push past me, scanning and prodding the wires. We're here to escort Technicians and Scientists throughout this 'thing', whatever it is, it's beyond my paygrade. Sparks fly from broken lights, blue canisters line the walls of the hull. Light from the outside pours into the darkness. 

""Fransen, Houston and I are going to scout the south portion of the ship. Nikorak, Freese, Halpert go the northern point. Teco, Jass, stay with the techs and make sure they can collect their data. We don't know if there is any contacts so, stay vigilant.""

A collective ""Yes, Sir!"" rings out in the hull, echoing throughout the hallways. We ready our rifles and set off into the hallways of the massive starship. Unsure of what the hell was awaiting us.




""It's too dark here,"" Houston says ""I don't like it."" The blue light cannister things ran out a few corridors back, leaving us in a complete shroud of darkness and apparently whoever made this thing doesn't believe in windows. The lights on our rifles and helmets allow us to see, barely. 

""Yea, me too. Tacoma, is this really a good idea? Shouldn't we wait for the techs to get the power on?"" Fransen asks, running his hands across the foreign metal lining the walls. 

""No... We'll be fine,"" I plant my hand on the side of my helmet, ""Nikorak? Report. Any contacts?"" 

A soft static is the response. I ready my rifle before Nikoraks voice cuts through it, ""Sir? Sir? Sorry, lots of electronics in this heap of trash, causing a lot of interference. Ah... No contacts. None at all. We're gonna head up to the cockpit, see if there is anythin' up there.""

""Understood."" 

The ship from the outside was almost indescribable. I've been doing this for years and I've never seen a ship so big. It crashed in a remote forest in Alberta, couple kilos long, about a mile high. Teco couldn't shut up about how much life this thing must have had on it. ""Thousands and thousands of aliens."" He said, and that's why I assinged him with the techs. Fransen kept skimming the walls looking at the designs carved into them. Houston kept talking with Jass, asking how the power situation was going.

Suddenly, a bing went off in our helmets. 

""Holy shit! A contact."" Fransen yells, shoving Houston with the butt of his rifle. 

""Scans say it's in this hallway. Don't get to excited, could just be a mouse that wandered in."" 

Fransen readies his gun, pointing it at the ceiling and walls. Houston sighs and reluctantly raises his rifle. 

""Let's just go find this thing."" He responds

We quicken our pace from a ginger walk to a hesitant jog, following the pings of the radar display on my wrist. From what little I can see we are in some sort of living quarters, like the ones on a cruise. Few of the rooms have what look like beds and such. 

""Nikorak? Nikorak!"" I scream into the communicator in my helmet. His voice powers through the static. 

""Yes sir? Repeat. Yes sir?"" 

""We got a contact."" 

""Oh, that's great. Gotta visual?"" 

""Negative. Any update on the cockpit?"" 

""That'd be a double negative, Commanda. Ahhh, It's locked with some foreign tech or somethin' like that. I don't know. Halpert and Freese are going to try and blow it op-"" the sound of an explosion over the mic cuts him off, the sound of all to familiar static replaces his curt voice. I stop in my tracks, with Fransen and Houston following suit in confusion. 

""What? What's going on?"" Fransen lowers his gun.

""Nikorak? Lieutenant! Nikorak! Come in."" I yell into the mic, slamming my hand against the side of my head, ""Useless piece of shit."" I look at my men, their eyes glossed in uncertainty. ""Transmission died, too much interference. Ready your rifles, these things could be dangerous."" 

""These things?"" Houston asks

""Just move."" 

We round a corner, the pings getting louder with each step. We read a sign filled with squiggles, more evidence that we truly are not alone here. 

We reach the room, the door appears to be jammed shut in some fashion. I raise my hand, a signal for complete silence. I place my ear next the door, listening for something, anything. 

A small electronic whimper. Something is behind that door. I raise my hand again and make a prying motion. Fransen and Houston, faces slack, devoid of all emotion, nod. They grip the door as tight as they can, and pull. After a few tugs the door gives way. Revealing a dark room behind it. I put a finger to my lips. They nod again. 

Houston is the first to let out a gasp. His rifle training on an alien. I can't believe I'm saying this, but an actual alien. It's small, like a child and it's... crying? Fransen follows Houston's suit and trains his rifle and looks at me, slightly scared. I nod at him and take a step towards it. 

""Hey. Kid? I'm Commander Theodore Tacoma of the United States Marine Corp, I-I come in peace. Are you alright?"" I say, taking another step towards the being. 

""Zi! Teekus neihe fallieus tokko daamo!"" The being screams. My eyes open wide in shock. Houston glares and trains his rifle closer to the child, ready to fire. 

""Wait!"" I whisper tossing out a hand, ""It's unarmed!"" 

""Have you even seen Alien? That thing could kill us in a millisecond!"" He responds, in a hushed tone. 

""It's defenseless, stand down."" 

It appears to be crying, weeping over what seems to be a body of something, someone it seems. Its father? Mother? I can't tell in the darkness. 

""Listen kid, I'm going to need you to..."" I pause, I know it can't understand me, ""Just hol-""

The transmitter cracks to life, static is heard from the other side. Static and heavy breathing. I can hear a scream over the microphone, a male's voice. Without warning, Nikorak's voice comes to life. 

""Commander! Sir? Don't touch the kids... (*Halpert! Just drop the thing. It's not worth it!*) Sir Run! Run now!"" 

""We gotta go. *Now.*"" I say, looking at Houston. 

""What? What about the kid? Just a second ago you didn't want me shooting it. Now you want to run?"" 

""Listen, this isn't the time Houston. We gotta..."" 

""Huuck..."" Fransen eyes widen at the spike impaling him through the torso. His rifle rattles to the floor, he gazes at his hands, before reeling up and collapsing to the floor with a loud clang. A large hole sitting where his stomach should be. 

""Jesus Christ!"" Houston screams at the fully grown Alien. It's glowing blue eyes glaring at us, ten inch daggers unfurl at us, ready to kill us. One of its two spike arms is covered in Fransen's fresh blood. My eyes can barely handle all the information flooding into my brain. 

The last thing I remember is Nikorak's screams, a hail of gunfire, the cries of a kid, and a bumbling beast running at it's child.",Maeserk

"[WP] When first contact is made with an alien civilization, we find that humanity is not viewed with disgust or indifference, but reverence. This bodes well for intergalactic relations until we discover why...",almighty_smiley,"""We're getting a reading, sir,"" Says Jasmine, leaning in close, her ear nearly touching the microphone. My beloved employee, wearing a pristine white lab coat and red-rimmed glasses waves me over to her.

""Good work,"" I say, smiling, as I walk over briskly.

Leaning on the empty desk space next to her as she begins to tune the radio fiercly. Both of us frown at each other as we listen in to more radio static. She turns the knob back and forth, her twists getting smaller and eventually centering on one definite point.

""Got it!"" We exclaim.

""Hello? H-hello? Anyone there?"" Jasmine then greets the unknown in Dishnek. I watch her form incoherent babbles as she taps the microphone, making it feed back. Workers scattered around the office look to both of us before losing interest and delving back into their work again. Scribbles appear on note pads, fingers clack on keyboards, and two-dozen heads crane to the floor, working away, trying to look busy.

""What's wrong?"" I say.

""There's a Dishnekian there, but she can't hear me."" She pushes up her glasses and flips the mic upside down, revealing a panel of switches. Scanning over the options, I poke the one labeled ""POWER"".

The microphone makes a click and Jasmine's face turns pink.

""Hello?"" I try, ""Come in! Come in! Does anyone copy?""

Four sharp gurgles come from the other end. Jasmine leans in and begins talking in Dishnek in an excited tone.

""Azrim! Kiniver opilet nintraf!""

""What did you say to her?""

""I said 'Hello! We have found you at last!""

Jim from across the cubicle sits up and peers over the pod with intrigue. He looks to me. He mouths, ""Oh my God!""

""Sir!"" Says Jasmine. I jump, instinctively clutching my heart to prevent it from trembling. I swallow, hard.

I whizz around, eyes wide in sudden paranoia. ""Yes?""

""She wants to know who you are."" 

""Who I am? Why?""

""I was telling her about you. About the team. She wants to say hello.""

""Okay."" I frown, mumbling. ""Tell her I'm the crew's boss, and that I come in peace. Something like that.""

She nods and turns back to the mic, speaking. Deep, croaking laughter bellows from the other end. Jasmine retorts with something. Jasmine chuckles and the both of them banter for a little bit, while Jim and I listen in closely.

""What did she say, Jasmine?""

""Oh-oh, uhm..."" Pinching the side of her glasses and sliding them back up her nose, she looks back and forth to me and Jim and says, ""We were just talking about advanced documentation of galactic febricity.""

I roll my eyes discreetly, though clearly, I don't believe that is true at all.

She leans back in her chair and clears her throat. ""Okay, I've set everything up. Your notes are right here, and we've set up the meeting for fifty-eight doboshes. So you should be set to go. I'll be sitting here to translate everything.""

She turns back to the mic, mumbling profanities and telling me to hold on. Jasmine egins retuning with no less ferociousness than the first time. I rock back and forth, when I remember.

""Wait, Jasmine--""

""58 doboshes is about an hour, sir.""

""You're the greatest.""

The microphone clicks once again and Jasmine greets them and apologizes. She introduces me, and we begin the meeting.

Jim gets my attention again and tells me how amazing all of this is.

""I know."" I say, ""This is so cool.""

""I would never have guessed that aliens were tuning into radios this whole time, we just weren't being precise enough when we channel surfed.""

""Exactly! You'd think it was just static, but I guess they were trying to talk to us this whole time."" I reply.

""Makes you think, huh?"" He begins. ""I wonder how many times humans have heard something, but blown it off as radio static.""

""I know! It's weird to think how many times we heard something but never said anything about it. Because... you know, people would think you were insane.""

 The whole experience of your life and the future of the galaxy being turned upside-down from one simple radio call is frankly ridiculous. It's one of those things, where you are scared, genuinely scared, for humanity. The concept of mystery is terrifying. Something you feel every day, of course. 

For example, we feel pain often. Or worry. Or happiness. But the cruelty of it was that fear was an everyday emotion. But in small enough doses for you and I to handle. THis, however, this, felt like a mountain. Like the betrayal of a close friend. You could feel it right in the gut. 

It's not easy to recall that conversation after so long, but to my recollection, it went something like this:

"[WP] When first contact is made with an alien civilization, we find that humanity is not viewed with disgust or indifference, but reverence.

"[WP] When first contact is made with an alien civilization, we find that humanity is not viewed with disgust or indifference, but reverence. This bodes well for intergalactic relations until we discover why...",almighty_smiley,"""Oh great Earth leader, you and your kind are the mightiest and most powerful in all the galaxy!""

""Oh, why thank you, I....""

""You are so great! As a gift we shall give you the secret to immortality, the secret to faster than light travel, even the secret to the power to destroy planets!""

""Wait if you have possess this power then why do you respect us so?""

""Because you are the most powerful, fearsome species in the galaxy. All bow before you!""

""Well this doesn't make sense.""

And it didn't, it didn't to Krombopulus, it didn't to his successor Zoltron, and it didn't to Zoltron's successor Jim. But that mattered little to the great leaders of the human race. What mattered was the sudden, dramatic shift in everything under their collective tenure. Life was prolonged significantly, and the problem of overpopulation was nonexistent thanks to the faster than light travel they were granted. They even found that all other lifeforms bowed to the Earthlings upon discovery, and the few that didn't were destroyed by the Human's planet destroyer.

For the power given to the Humans proved to be their greatest manipulator. A species that had found peace among themselves turned violent towards others. They assimilated all into their august, fearsome empire, and the power this granted them proved to make them even more of horrible creatures. Thousands of planets fell before the humans, millions of species, trillions of lifeforms. As humans spread they only grew worse. Soon, as the aliens who had made first contact had promised, all bowed before the great Human race. The tiny species that came from the insignificant blue marble became the Destroyer of Worlds, the Conqueror of All, the One True Leader.

Many years after Humanity took their ultimate power it would be discovered why those early benefactors had been so benevolent. They knew the power that lurked beyond our Galaxy. They knew what would come to Judge the people of the self-proclaimed Milky Way.

As it happened, millions of years prior to the first multi-celled life form evolved on the Great Home-world Earth, the sentient life of B-332 (Official designation of Galaxy 'Milky Way') had been Judged by the lurking powers. The life of the Galaxy had found peace with the strong Galactic Senate that worked to maintain the peace that had been achieved many eons prior. The Galaxy was a fantastic utopia, yet to the Judge, they were guilty. Guilty of what, no one knows, but guilty nonetheless. 

And so it became that the Judge became the Executioner. The number of murders that would be achieved by the Human race was child's-play compared to the murders, or a better word would be genocides, performed at this time.  All sentient life... no, all complex life was snuffed out of existence. Any being that may have been deemed possible to become self-aware was so coldly wiped from reality. Except one. One single being in the whole of the Galaxy was spared by our evil, or it may be more accurate to say apathetic, Judges. This being was not spared as an oversight, nor as a mercy, they were spared as a warning. For the Judges knew life would come back to B-332, and they wanted it to know what would come, and reform. Reform to fit what? The answer is, and probably will always be unknown.

This single being was devastated by the loss of its peers, then infuriated, then cold, as if the ones that spared it wanted it to be like them. This being was a smart one, and it copied itself. From its genetic coding it spawned a whole species, a species that would watch over the Galaxy, and when the time came that the right planet bred the right kind of intelligent life, this species would fulfill its purpose designated by its creator.

The species would create a scapegoat. Our lonely being knew that the Powers beyond the Galaxy would return, and they wanted to spare the majority of life in B-332. They hypothesized that if there was a clear perpetrator of whatever evil the Powers judged, the Powers would only destroy the one species. So they fulfilled their sacred duty to protect the Galaxy. Humans proved to be of the right make to be the destined villain, and with the right push, the Humans became the very thing necessary to save the Galaxy. Our lonely alien's species made first contact with the at the time small race. They provided the Humans with the tools necessary to conquer the galaxy, with the high, calculated hope that the Humans would be manipulated by their newfound power and rise to an evil greatness. And their hope proved true, the Humans rose and the Humans became the very thing that the looming Judges would punish. 

And that brings us back to our current dilemma, our quandary. Humans have spread across the Galaxy, they have conquered it, and they are now its Masters. Trouble looms on the Galactic Horizon. The people of the Galaxy will again face the cold, harsh judgement of the Powers, and Humanity, the species that is seen as the evil, villainous Rulers of the Galaxy, will, with any luck, be its unwitting savior.

"[WP] When first contact is made with an alien civilization, we find that humanity is not viewed with disgust or indifference, but reverence. This bodes well for intergalactic relations until we discover why...",almighty_smiley,"The sound of a spoon hitting a bowl all but reverberated in the suddenly-silent dining room. “You are withdrawing your application for service first thing tomorrow young man.”

I frowned. “What? Why?”

“Do you really want to die defending worthless cowards? Foolish, irresponsible morons with no grasp of the concept of ‘consequences’?”

“What are you talking about Dad?”

“The Hal’i.”

“What have the Hal’I done that’s so irresponsible?”

My father bowed his head and took a few deep breaths. “I’m sorry son. Sometimes…I forget that not everyone knows what I know.” He pressed his hands together like an ancient religious worshiper, and looked me in the eye. “What do you know about Humanity’s First Contact with the Federation?”

I smirked. “The name disappointed a lot of fans of an ancient science fiction series called Star Trek.”

I chuckled at my clever answer, but my father sat stoic, waiting for my jocularity to wane. 

I coughed awkwardly. “Uh, The Federation reached out from an FTL drone about three hundred years ago. Earth was our only world at the time and every government received the message. After it was deciphered and the Federation contacted by the United States, Russia, France, Germany, and others, the majority of Earth governments joined.”

My father nodded. “You’ve no doubt learned that membership in the Federation was quickly granted, right?”

I nodded. “I’ve heard that it usually takes five years, Earth-time, to approve a new member species. Humanity was accepted in a matter of months.”

“Why?”

I shrugged. “Our sparkling personalities?”

My father shook his head. “No. Well yes, sort of. Our personalities are indeed the reason we were accepted, but it wasn’t due to our humor, compassion, and intelligence. It was our aggression.”

“Come again?”

“Have you heard of the Grehnak?”

I shook my head. “Is that another alien race?”

“Kind of. They’re a Hal’i creation; an artificial race that developed a hive-minded super-intelligence on their own, and decided that the energy and material resources of our galaxy were theirs for the taking. So they take. And take and take. They put the Borg in those Star Trek episodes you love to shame. The Federation has lost a few dozen star systems to the Hal’I in the last hundred years, and only one race has shown any promise in slowing them, much less stopping them.”

“Who? Which one?” I suspected I knew the answer.

“Humanity, son. We have some sort of near-ideal blend of propagation rate, aggression, intelligence, respect for authority, and creativity that the Federation recognized would make us a good army to combat the Grehnak. The only reason Humanity was fast-tracked into the Federation was to be cannon fodder.”

“Oh,” I said, eyes suddenly locked on my cooling bowl of stew, mind spinning. 

I looked back at my father. “How do you know all this anyway?” I’d never heard of any of this in school. It had never come up during class.

He smiled humorlessly. “You’d be surprised what you learn when you work in the White House.”

He continued, ""You don't even need any strength to do it, so take your fucking time.""

""Relax bro, nukes ain't that easy to explode,"" said Tom while smiling.

""You don't even know what it is. It looks like a nuke, but what if it is something that will react to anything?""

""Then we would be already dead, relax!"" Tom finally managed to open torpedo backside, to see what is inside. He then put his hand slowly in, while floating in the space, in the middle of nowhere. Well, they did have that cargo ship next to them they travel with.

""What is that?"" Tom looked into it and saw an empty bottle inside it.

""Don't do anything harsh!"" warned Ronaldo quickly, ""This is foreign weaponry. Definitely not made by the Earth!""

""How do you know?"" asked Tom out of interest.

""Do you see fucking ""EARTH"" or ""UNE"" anywhere on the torpedo? They fucking mark everything they own..."" Ronaldo himself started looking at the torpedo, noticing small light inside what was blinking.

""Ugh..."" Ronaldo said.

""Hm, what?""

""I think we might have a problem?""

""What?""

""There is blinking light...""

It took moment for Tom to understand it. It is very likely that owner now knew that this torpedo was found and it was tampered with.

""Okay, calm down, we can save this moment!"" Ronaldo tried to calm down.

""How?""

""We are a cargo ship. We find fucking another empty similar bottle, add it inside it, close it and fucking  kick it with nearby small meteor rock.""

""Make it look like malfunction?""

""Yes,"" confirmed Ronaldo while establishing contact, ""This is Ronaldo, asking Temperando to pull us in""

""This is Temperando, roger that,"" as he felt how the metal rope started pulling both of them in.

""This should do,"" said Ronaldo while looking at an almost identical bottle.

""Why haven't we opened it yet?"" asked Tom who was truly interested in the original bottle.

""Are you an idiot? What if it contains chemical weapon? We have a shitton of movie series about the zombie apocalypse and stuff like that. They all start with some kind of chemical reaction what starts spreading..."" Ronaldo exits the cargo room, starting slowly moving towards are where they can exit the space again. He stopped midway and looked at Tom ""No matter what happens, do not tell about what we found anywhere or to anyone on this ship!""

""Yeah, I understand. What you gonna do about it?"" asked Tom then.

""We need to deliver it to the earth science station or something. Too risky to deliver it to anywhere near Earth. I really hope that I am overreacting,"" said Ronaldo, when suddenly cargo ship alarms started working.

""Alert, Code 7, an unknown hostile spaceship is closing in on our location with extreme speed, we are starting emergency FTL, everyone connect to the closest railings, moving in half a minute,"" to what Ronaldo and Tom quickly took a rope from the belt and connected it to the railing next to them. After exactly thirty seconds they felt how ship started accelerating and before they knew it, their bodies were moving backwards the ship. They barely could hold onto the railing. In past, it would have been considered as an extreme measure, as it could break person back. However thanks to the new belt technology what every space person has to, it creates enough support that nothing bad happens to the person, except it's extremely uncomfortable and hurts a bit.

Suddenly spaceship stopped as they felt some kind of shaking coming with it. A bit later came radio message with it: ""We have been hit. As a cargo ship, we have no method of fighting fully armed battleship. Abandon the ship, if someone can, try to get contact with earth, to give them this data I am transferring to every single worker console. Do not trust any Jentelions, may some of us survive!""

The message was obvious and both of them understood it. It was their very close allies, who have shown a lot of reverence towards them. So their civilization was more advanced than they thought. How else they caught up with them and managed to shot them while cargoship was moving at the speed of light. Taking into account shaking, they probably want to destroy all evidence.

""Ah, the data what arrived on console is damaged!"" said Tom suddenly. Ronaldo looked at him, which was intact. ""They must have stronger jammers in that battleship!"" he confirmed, going behind Tom and putting the bottle into his backpack. ""You hold onto it,"" he smiled and added, ""Just in case, record everything with your console, so even if we die in space and someone finds our bodies...."" Tom nodded and they both started recording on the consoles on their hand. Both of them were terrified, as they knew they might not make out of it alive. It was only obvious that even if they die, just maybe if their death isn't waste, it could be better.

They started moving towards emergency pods. It was very likely that ship barely had any fresh air left, as it was full of holes. It wasn't that huge of a problem though, as both of them had already space suits on. They both managed to enter the escape pod. While Ronaldo sat down and was typing into pod console, Tom was looking out of tiny windows.

""This is madness,"" said Tom, while getting himself sit on a chair, locking all the belts. Ronaldo finished typing and was about to start closing his own belts too, but suddenly the escape pod entrance doors exploded.

""Do not move!"" screamed incomer, who were obviously armed. Jentelions...

""Don't come any closer or I drop it!"" said Ronaldo quickly, showing the glass bottle he had in his hand. He hoped that it was a weapon, where dropping means a lot of bad things. It was rather obvious that Jentelion recognised the bottle, but his reaction was something that he did not expect.

""Hahaha, you think I am scared, you filthy human? We have many of them prepared ahead, ready to go whenever necessary. Only one it can damage is you,"" said Jentelion while laughing.

""What do you mean,"" asked Ronaldo, confused, hoping to get some answers.

""Ah, you are dead anyway, human,"" started Jentelion, while laughing.

""This will infect you, humans, allowing us to breed with you,"" he smiled. He continued, ""I cannot wait the day when I can have my own children! We are rather desperate, you know.""

""Wh... what,"" asked Tom, simply being confused and sickened.

Ronaldo then dropped the bottle to the ground, breaking it. It did the trick, it got the Jentelion attention. Meanwhile, Ronaldo looked at Tom and said without a voice ""Live!"" hitting the launch button at the same time. He only needed a moment after all. Pod accelerated extremely fast, getting the speed of light in merely a few seconds. Tom could see how instantly Ronaldo and the Jentelions are left behind. Right, Ronaldo didn't connect his belts in time. He could see how laser bullets came towards the pod, however, they missed, as the emergency pod did random weird maneuvers. Must be the settings Ronaldo was doing before setting himself up. Sounds logical, as escape pods are normally easiest thing to hit.

After a while, pod started slowing down until it continued to move at normal speed.

""Dammit,"" said Tom slowly as he watched into the console, seeing how jamming started to disappear and a connection was being re-established.

""This is United Nations of Earth Federation, you are trespassing the military zone. Identify yourself immediately, or we will assume you as the hostile!"" that message was almost as music to Tom's ears. He got his shaky hand on a console and pressed few buttons. Then said with a shaky voice.

""This is Tom Lindon, the sole survivor of Temperando Transportation Cargo ship. I have just survived a Jentelions brutal attack on my ship and have extremely valuable intel and seek asylum!"" There was nothing for a short time, at least till he heard,

""We heard you loud and clear Tom Lindon. Prepare to be boarded by our personnel!""",elfboyah

I watch as I lose my job. My wife. My only child. The countdown of my net worth. Dropping. Falling. I had no real reason to live. All of what I built disappeared. All of what I own squandered. Each day I discover a new rock bottom. A new low. I had nothing. I was nothing.

Watching.

I couldn't stand watching, being a passerby to my own life. I felt helpless. As I stared down the end of a 12-pack, I grabbed a gun and decided it was time to end it. Time blurs with each can I down. Emotions becomes confused, as I lose any sense of reality. Everything becomes nothing as nothing becomes everything. An emotional wreck, I flip out and lose control. And that the last thing I remember.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I roll over. The alarm continues to beep. ""Fuuccccckkkkkkkkk..."" I reach my left arm and begin to pat down to find my phone. As I feel the metallic casing, I pull the phone closer to me and swipe the alarm away. Only then I realise that I'm still not dead yet. Angry, I toss the phone to the other side of the bed and fall back asleep.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wake up around sunset. Still piss drunk, I manage to throw m legs of the bed. My arm strength dimished, I nonetheless propel my upper body off the bed and into a sitting position. *Now the hard part,* I thought. With all the energy I have, I push myself off the bed. However, before I could get my torso to straighten itself out, my head collides into the wall in front of me and I collapse beside the newly punctured wall. My head began to incessantly pound as I tried to ease the pain. *Alright, another try.* I pulled myself up from the wall. Unbalanced, I lean against the wall as I walk out of the bedroom. Following the left wall, I stumble down the long corridor, past the kitchen, into the single bathroom. I wince as I turn on the neon lights, and almost down myself with water. As I looked up to the mirror, I stare in shock as my net worth stared back at me.

When I was a kid, whenever I flew on a plane I would grip the arm rests, and perform an impromptu countdown to takeoff.  

I had always wanted to be an astronaut, so I pretended that this metallic tube filled to the brim with glorified monkeys was a space shuttle, and I was off to the moon.

3! 

2!

1!

BLASTOFF!

Then my 'dad' would tell me to shut the fuck up while he bitched at my mom about how we could have simply driven all the fucking way across the country.

Here I am, in a Gulfstream G650, sipping champagne and reading letters from my real father.  He's pretentious, arrogant, full of himself and a total ass.

So I understand where a lot of my personality really came from.

I may smell like a mixture of sweat, alcohol, vomit and mud, but God damn it I'm a mother fucking multi-billionaire.  

Letters.  Folders packed full of letters.  These were his words, his thoughts, his prayers, his dreams.  His ambition.

I feel like the hangover has subsided, and I already feel a struggle to understand my previous mentality.  How I WANTED to die.  How I WANTED to end everything.  To shrivel into a ball and be forgotten by the world.

Red, Green and Blue are all playing cards across from me.  The game seems irrelevant, no one is saying a God damn thing.  I would play with them, but every time I turn towards them, I see that massive number reflected from the mounted television.

$108,348,791,543.82.

I wonder how many Big Macs that would buy.

Most of the letters include financial details, of the various properties and assets my father controlled, of the corporate empire of my real father, I really didn't dwell on any of these works.  

I spent a lot of time examining the DNA certification.  I wonder where the hell he got a sample of my DNA?

Deoxyribonucleic acid.  I've always found it hilarious and disgusting that my life began in a ball sack.

An hour passes.  Where the hell are we flying?

I'd gone to the American southwest for my suicide.  It felt right, like stepping into the spurred boots of a cowboy and kicking a bull square in the nuts, expecting to be gored.  Below, that familiar patchwork of dead brown and swarms of green.  Still far too few trees.

I guess we were still in the south.

""Where the hell are we going?""

I spoke on impulse, realizing that I truly had never considered where exactly I was going.  All I could see was that huge number.  Never did I truly consider what it actually meant.  How exactly did I gain access to my fortune?

Blue and Green continue to stare at their cards.  Red tosses a three of clubs and for some reason this causes consternation.

""We need you in Atlanta,"" said Red.

""There's work to be done.  Partners to meet.""

Huh.  What kind of partners?  More than a hundred billion almost felt like a made up number.  I still expecting a man to leap from behind a hidden curtain and point and laugh at me.  

What a prank.

""Who do I have to meet?""

Silence.  Another card tossed.  Blue rakes in the chips.

""Above our pay grade,"" says Green, shuffling the cards and dealing.

Maybe one of the letters would tell me.

Sift, sift, sift.  That annoying swish as I check each document.  Something personal.  Something different.

A sticker of a smiling Golden Retriever.

I freeze.

""You don't need a God damn dog,"" my mom had told me.  

My ninth birthday.  A Golden Retriever puppy.  A note.

*Happy Birthday, Kiddo, I know you've always wanted one.  Be responsible.  Love, Uncle Bruce*

I was ecstatic.  The parents were furious.

Buddy went to a farm.  I screamed and cried and fought, to the surprise of my parents, who had never seen me truly upset.  I wanted that dog.

I didn't know farm meant kill shelter.

I slide open the letter with a finger, ripping the sticker.

That's mother fucking Buddy on that sticker.  There is no denying it.

I pull out a folded piece of paper.  Rather bare, but Bruce's handwriting nonetheless.

*Benny, I need a final favor from you.  I need you to be in Atlanta, and I need you to call Mr. Blueberry.  You need to tell him to take your boys to the farm.  Tell him it's the same farm as Buddy.  I love you Bobby.  And I'm sorry.  Love, Dad*

Whatever I have to do, I feel little sense of agency now.  Not exactly for Bruce, if he actually loved me he would have fought for me.  I read the phone number on the back of the letter and jot it on the champagne napkin.  

""Red!""

He instantly shifts his attention from the card game.

""I've got two questions for you, Red.""

He stands, uncomfortably.  For once I can feel fear.  Fear of me, fear of what I can do.

For the first time, I understand power.

""Where the fuck is the phone?""  My tone is unrecognizable.

""Why the fuck haven't you called my bitch of an ex-wife?""

Now comes the anger.

""I told you I wanted my fucking DOG back.""

$11,494,894,476.74

*How the fuck did I make this much money?* I thought. 11 *billion*. Maybe I stole it? Got involved in some scheme? The migraine returned. I dragged myself into the kitchen. Two Aspirin tablets later, I try to drag myself out to the couch, only to fall short. I try to pull myself together. *Remember what happened last night,* I thought. I tried to focus, but not much. A street lamp. I drew an outline. A man. I drew that as well. A voice. I remembered it as best I can. And an address. I frantically wrote it down.

After that I began to frantically search around the house. Any loose documents that could have turned up, any pictures I might've taken, anything of information, really. No extra stash of anything (other than beer cans) turned up. Somewhat depressed, I slumped in my chair and popped open another can of beer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
After that I followed up with a search for the man. Nothing. The voice would be impossible to find out and the pole could really be any pole in the city. So I settled on the address. It took me some time, but I found the owner of the house on Yellow Pages: Mr. James Greer. There wasn't a trace of him, at least digitally. He kept completely private. So I contacted a good friend of mine, Seamus. He was able to track down the owner, but he needed some time. *We've got all the time in the fucking world, mate.*

---------------------------------------------------------------------
I arrived at a small suburban home. It was quaint, fairly small for such a new development. But it seemed like more of a home than I've had for the past year. I keep my distance and watch. Hours pass. Someone pulls up from the car. He parks in the garage. I wait.

Nightfall. Not a peep. I decided to try and break in, see what happened. As the darkness increased, I sneaked around the porch into the backyard. I searched around to find a small porch to hide under. As I got myself ready, I thought about what I could do with that money: a new house, a new life, maybe somewhere where it doesn't fucking snow all the time. *I could finally sleep to happy thoughts tonight,* I thought.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
The next morning, I could hear the melodies of the morning routine: coffee, the televisions blaring, the chitter-chatter of schoolkids rushing off to catch their morning bus. I patiently waited for the car to leave. Yet the house didn't move an inch. No lights. No noise. Nothing. I waited. Only at 9 did the man even get up, and by 10 he was out the door and driving off to wherever.

I found and cut the phone and internet lines. I walk up to the door to see barely any furniture. The floor has been stripped bare, and replaced with basic concrete flooring. The stench reeked of chemicals, to the point where I took off my shirt to make a makeshift bandana. As I walked through the house, I head the faint noise of banging coming from the bedroom. As I open the door, I stand in shock.

It was the daughter of one of the largest multinational companies in the world.

Bumpy road, hot van, disgusting clothing.  Whatever is going to happen to me can't get much worse than this.

Red reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a pack of cigarettes, extending one towards me.  My throat is too dry for poison right now.  I hold up my hand to decline.  Red shrugs.

""Listen, with a net worth like that, you can't walk the streets without protection anymore.""  

Red leans against the walls of the van, withdrawing a cigarette for himself, before passing the pack to his compatriots.  

These men don't seem like they plan to kill me.  In fact, their stares seem to be submissive.  

Like I own them.  

Green folds his hands in his lap, and another bump in the road causing us all to rise slightly and slam down.  Only my curiosity prevents my hangover from making me pray for death.

""So,"" I begin, after readjusting myself, ""Does this have anything to do with the liquor store?""

They all exchange glances of amusement.

""No,"" responds Green.  ""We've already allocated funds to hire a man to take the fall for your incident last night.""

""What does that mean?  I mean I robbed a store.""

Red nods.  ""You also shot a few bottles of liquor.""

Cold blooded murder.  

""Doesn't this mean I'll go to jail or something?""

They all laugh.

""Mr. Richardson, POOR people go to jail.  Let's be serious here.""

Blue takes a folded document from his coat pocket and hands it to me.

""Do you remember your uncle, Mr. Richardson?""  

""Yeah,"" I swallow vomit.  ""What about him?""

""He died last night, Mr. Richardson,"" continues Red, ""and left behind a series of letters and documents detailing his succession.""

I begin to open the document handed to me.  Plain white paper.  A long sequence of letters and numbers fill most of the page.  It looks like some sort of code.

""My mom never let me interact with him when I was growing up,"" I recalled.

""She said he was a bad influence.  He may have been my dad's brother but he hated his fucking guts, man.""

Another bump.  I burp and taste another wave of vomit.  Good God I wished I had taken a shower before entering this van.

""Well, he wasn't actually your uncle, Mr. Richardson.""  

Red takes a deep drag from his cigarette.

""He was your father.""

Fucking what?

""Your father was the majority shareholder of International Nanotechnologies Incorporated.  The reason we have these dumbass holograms over our heads was because of your father.  He lobbied for the law.  He got it passed.""

Another drag.

""And he passed his ownership percentage of the company onto his only living child.  Immediately.""

You know, something about this doesn't surprise me.  Mom always did get shifty whenever I asked about uncle Bruce, and Dad sure as fuck hated his rich brother's guts, making that information very clear during drunken rants and rages.

I suppose I should feel some kind of major wave of emotion.  Anger, confusion, maybe hatred towards my own mother.  Instead, I don't feel anything.

There is silence as the van continues.  These men must work for me, but I don't know where they're taking me.

Nearly an hour passes.  All I can do is stare at the floor of the van, watching the dust jump with each bump.

""Why did he never tell me?""

The men shrugged in unison.  

""We never met the man, honestly,"" said Green.  Blue nodded in agreement.

The van has finally come to a stop.  Green slides the door open, and I see we are at some kind of private airstrip.  A private jet awaits, staircase lowered.  

Red helps me exit the van, eyeing my ruined clothing and claps me on the back.

""So what do I inherit, besides the shares?""

Red hands me a cell phone before responding.

""After you enter that code, everything else, Mr. Richardson.  Everything else.""

I smile.  Things are looking up.  I punch the code into the device.

""What does the number above my head say, Red?""

""It's a little above one hundred billion, Mr. Richardson.""

Good.  Good.  Good.

""Get my bitch of an ex wife on the phone.  I want my fucking dog back.""

Red smiles, something devoid of humanity.

""Whatever you say, Mr. Richardson.  Whatever you say.""

I puke one final time into the dirt.

Early morning sunlight probes its way through the blinds of what I assume to be a cheap roadside motel.  Stains of questionable origin cover a cheap floral print bed cover, and the mirror across from the bed shows a half naked man who most assuredly pissed himself.

Again, all I can muster is another ""Ah, shit.""

Okay.  I'm still alive.  That's not really the desired result but for now I'll have to deal with it.

Step one, ignore the throbbing headache.  Avoid sunlight and combat nausea.

All I can do is roll to the side of the bed and puke.  So I may have messed up part of step one.

Step two, is get rid of the revolver on the floor that I just puked on.

Wait.  Why do I have a gun?

""Ah,"" all I can manage between heavy retching.  ""Ah SHIT!""  

There is a case of cheap champagne and several bottles of whiskey, from the God damn liquor store.  Why did I choose to rob a liquor store?  

Another deep sigh.

Why a lot of things, man.  Why a lot of things.

Roll to the other side of the bed and stand up, then begin to curse again when you step on a shard of glass from a shattered liquor bottle.

""Jesus, this isn't my day.""  

I'm up now, wearing cheap flip flops and making my way to the dresser.  All I have left is a pair of jeans and a white button down shirt.

Jeans.  Shirt.  Revolver.  Maybe shower?

Something catches my eye as I make my way to the dresser; something flashed in the mirror.

I stop and stare.  No longer is there a red $72,983.83, but a flashy gold $11,438,329,123.99.

I can't really understand what I'm seeing.  Am I still drunk?  Am I actually dead?  Maybe someone put me out of my misery?

My chest hurts, my head pounds, my feet ache, so I must be very much alive.  

Step three, figure out why exactly I have this massive fucking number over my head.

Okay.  Let's focus.  Maybe take a swig of whiskey.  Sit down, remember.  I pick up one of the whiskey bottles and open it, but the smell immediately churns my stomach.  So that's definitely not happening.

Remember.  The word only conjures the beginning of the end.  An entirely different set of steps.  Step one, catch wife with a man inside her.  Step two, beat the man within an inch of his life, have a massive argument, cue bitter divorce.  Step three, go into major debt paying for lawyers and liquor.  Step four, resolve to kill yourself via cop.  Rob a store.  Pack some heat.  Catch a bullet.

Where, in any of those steps, did I generate several billion dollars in revenue?  

Ring, ring ring.  The motel phone scares the shit out of me.

Without thinking, I pick up the receiver.  Maybe it's the cops?

""Hello?""

There is no initial response.  I can't hear anyone on the other line.

""Mr. Richardson?  Mr. Benjamin Carmile Richardson?""

Carmile?  Who could possibly know my idiotic middle name?  I have to lick my lips and swallow to respond, the throat feeling drier than the Sahara.

""This is he.""

Another pause.  

""Ah, Mr. Richardson.  My name is rather unimportant, but I'm going to need you to exit your hotel and step into the black van parked outside.""

All I can do is drop the phone and walk out the door.  Besides being nearly blinded by the light, I feel no more fear.  More of a strange sense of curiosity.

Oh look, a black van.  Lovely.

It slides open, and inside sit three heavy set men, each in rather expensive looking suits.  One wears a blue tie, one a green tie, and one a red tie.  No masks.  No beards.  Each man amused by the reeking drunk.

Each man's net worth is identical, $328.392.32.

""You look like shit, Mr. Richardson.""

I spit into the asphalt and duck my head while I enter the van.  

""Are you here to kill me or some shit?""  

Each man shakes his head in dissent.  

""Mr. Richardson, let's just say we need you,"" says red tie, ""somewhere else.""

The van door slides closed.

"[EU] Two avatars are born at the same time, both with completely opposite personalities, and two completely different life paths",jesuswithdreads,"His memories of the battle came to him in drops and floods. 

*fire and earth*

The sound of metal against metal as men fought beneath a blood red sky. Pillars of fire whirred through the battlefield, killing friend and foe alike. The very ground would tremble and open up to swallow cavalrymen whole, horses and all. It was the panorama of a madman. Every shade of red with dark browns and the thin silhouettes of men charging to their deaths. All swirling together so that you can't tell where one color ends and another begins.

*fire and earth*

If war could be compared to a painting, then the battlefield was the canvas.

And *he* was the painter. He painted with the elements themselves. Fire and Earth bent to his will. His command. Once he believed that all men would bend to his will. He was the Avatar. That was his destiny. To unite all.

That dream had ended on the battlefield. As always, he had been in the thick of it, killing men left and right. A part of him thought he was invincible and that made him arrogant. Arrogance led to complacency. Complacency was weakness. 

And he had suffered for his weakness. He had allowed himself to be surrounded. They were a bunch of peasants dressed up in copper armor, but there were a lot of them and they fought with the combined fury of their thousand dead countrymen. Men that he had killed.

When their blades reached him, he panicked and did the one thing that all firebenders were taught how to avoid even before they made their first spark.

He burned himself.

He was not sure where he was. He was sure that he was in a hospital tent with the rest of the wounded men. He didn't know which side of the war he was on and he was afraid to raise his voice and ask, lest they identified him. He wasn't even sure whether or not he still had an army left after that hellish battle.

The burn scars must've hid his face quite well, seeing how they haven't killed him yet. Of course, he wouldn't know. He had blinded himself. With his own fire.

Sick, croaking laughter creaked through the tent, briefly silencing nearby soldiers and doctors as they turned their heads to watch the horribly burned man.

Another victim of the horrors of war. They thought. And turned back to what they were doing.

What seemed like hours passed.

The man languished on his cot. He had once been a great lord. With all the wealth in the world. He had wanted more. 

Hours passed. Until he felt a calloused hand grip his own.

""Hello?""

It was a woman's voice. There was an uncertain quality to it. As if she was not sure if the burned man could hear her.

After a few seconds of silence. She said his name. 

After a few seconds more, the man nodded and asked, ""How do you know who I am?""

The man felt her clench his hand with both of her own. ""You killed my family,"" she said. ""And burned my village."" She added. ""I had memorized your face.""

So that was how it was. This was how he would die. He would die a broken man, disabled by his own fire. Killed by a woman. He wanted to laugh again.

Instead he snorted. ""I've killed many families and burned many villages. Do you expect an apology? Do what you must. Avenge them.""

The woman released her grip. He heard a bottle being uncorked. ""Your wounds will fester without proper care. These doctors have done their best, but I will do better.""

He felt cool water run against his chest. There was a refreshing feeling running through his body, like he had just woken from a long nap. His wounds sealed and the pain resided.

""You're a waterbender,"" he gasped. He had not meant to, but the water was cold and unexpected.

""I am many things. A miracle worker is not one of those things. I've done all I can. I'm sorry that I can't do anything about your eyes.""

""Why?"", he rasped. ""Why are you sorry? I killed your family. Slaughtered your village. Aren't you here to kill me?""

She smiled. He thought he might've heard her chuckle. It could've just been the wind. ""I joined this army three years ago. A lot has happened in those three years. They wouldn't let me join as a soldier, so I joined as a healer, hoping that I'd be able to slip away one day and join the battle with the men.""

She brought a hand to his cheek and caressed it lightly. ""I've seen enough of death for one lifetime. Enough broken people. Once I was fueled by nothing but my hatred for you. Once, I would've killed you. For revenge. For what I believed to be justice. For my duty as Avatar. I had believed that my duty as Avatar would have been to bring peace to the world by killing you. I... no longer believe that.""

""You? You aren't the Avatar. I'm...""

""We both are. I don't know why, but we're both the Avatar. Your army is destroyed and shattered. Your kingdom will fall in time as well. It is too late to save either.  But it is not too late to save yourself. Let me help you. We can make this world a better place. Together, as it was intended. Please.""

There was a deep and pervasive silence. The sound of boots outside the tent. Sergeants yelling orders to their wards. Weapons, supplies and ammunition being loaded onto wagon trains headed for the front. And among it all, one word. One word that would change the world.

""Yes.""

Doctor Meredith checked the clipboard. ""It says right here. Dead.""

""Bummer,"" Ben said. ""So what happens now?""

Doctor Meredith took the pencil from over her ear, scratched her head with it, and glanced back at the polished man in the suit behind her. He whispered into her ear, and she said, ""We're not sure.""

Ben made to get up, but the restraints on his arms and legs held him tight to the gurney. ""Can you free my hands? I'm a bit itchy.""

The polished man whispered into Doctor Meredith's ear again. She said, ""Will you try to eat my brains if I do?""

Ben looked hurt. ""Of course not. How could you ask that?""

Doctor Meredith blinked. ""Sorry."" She unfastened Ben's hands.

He scratched his nose and sighed orgasmically. ""I read a story this one time where scientists tortured a brain in a jar by making it feel like it had to pee. That's what that itch was like."" He settled onto the gurney and smacked his lips. ""Say, you guys aren't going to torture me, are you? Seeing as I'm the first dead guy who isn't fully dead?""

""Um,"" Doctor Meredith said. The polished man leaned in again. ""Probably not,"" she concluded. 

""It's just that I wouldn't much like to get tortured. Or vivisected or autopsied or what have you."" He patted his belly. ""All these squishy bits are best kept indoors, if you catch my drift.""

""I'll make a note of that."" Doctor Meredith wrote on the clipboard and spoke under her breath. ""Would...prefer...not...to...be...vivisected.""

""Thanks,"" Ben said. ""Could you free my legs now?""

The polished man shook his head. Meredith shook her head.

""How about bringing me a phone?""

The polished man spoke to Meredith a while. She said, ""We can't allow you to contact the outside world until we've examined your condition further.""

Ben snapped his fingers. ""But no vivisections. You promised.""

The polished man spoke. His accent was Eastern European, and his speech had all the ups and downs of a flat patch of concrete. ""Your case is being discussed. You will remain here until you are allowed to leave."" He gripped Ben's wrist, and his palm was cold and damp. ""You will be calm.""

Ben craned his neck around the polished man to get a look at Doctor Meredith. ""Sorry, who is this guy?""

The polished man shook his head at Doctor Meredith. She winced apologetically at Ben. ""I'll check up on you in a few hours,"" she said, and left with the polished man.

Alone in his clean cold hospital room, Ben bobbed on the gurney a while. He snapped his fingers and clapped his palms together to imitate the sound of a horse galloping. After that got dull he patted the sheets, blew out his lips, and sighed.

"[WP] A turtle wants to take over the world, he has 100 million dollars and super intelligence",phantomunboxing,"Under the rock alcove, among branches and boulders, sat the illustrious turtle which would act out the story I am about to tell. The turtle was fantastically rich and hyper intelligent--smarter than over 99% of humans. He had slow movement speed but his ability to bend the world to his will was unmatched. The turtle sat there, with its head poked out of its shell, waiting to be picked up by its chauffeur. He hired the best to take him to Sea World, where he would meet the whales.

From there he would enact a lawsuit against Sea World for the mistreatment of the killer whales raised there. The turtle hired a lawyer to do all this work for it, and when the suit was won, he used his new power to sue even more people. His focus was animal rights, so poachers and fishermen were the target. The turtle mercilessly pursued the biggest reward in order to fill its bank account with even more money and create a network it would use to take over the world.

When the time was right, it paid a man to run for Governor of Oregon. It wanted to found a new city, Turtleville, from which the base of operations would work. As it slowly gained resources and influence, the turtle thought back to the days in the alcove below the cliff. It thought of how long it sat there with nothing to do but eat flies, not even using its inherited money for its own purposes. It used that time to plan its rise to the top, but never thought it would be this easy. In fact, on a planet run by humans, it never thought a turtle could do anything at all. It was proving itself wrong.

After Turtleville was founded and houses and stores built on its land, the turtle could pursue the greatest task yet. It would run for president of the United States. It purchased an animatronic human suit it could control with its vast intelligence, and soon the leader of the free world was this magnanimous reptile, the turtle.",oaflopean

You still give Hero Academy a try once the classes at Villain University make you realize just how wrong your parents have been.",re_nonsequiturs,"My parents always told me that heroes only look out for their fame. Tales of Uncle Bill, mushed to bits by falling debris of a building, simply used to kill a villain, told to me when I was young. Stories of my sister Rebecca, dead in infancy due to the high frequencies of a Hero named Siren Serenade. Cautionary tales of the ruthlessness the Hero Academy pursued any fellow Hero, deciding to turn to villainy, often leaving them dead... or worse.

They told me many things. Some of them were wrong. After all, they truly loved, romanticised, favored the villainous route. Villains support each other, they work as one. They share a common goal and thus need to be kind to survive. Far as I knew, Villain University was the polar opposite of that. Competitive, strategic, disruptive. I had tried, really. I had tried to power through, to find myself a fellow friend to work on projects, planning heists, designing weaponry. After three explosions, five thefts and a whopping twenty-two betrayals, I was done.    
I quit.

My parents were dead. Villains don't last long, they told me again and again. *""The good die first. Or get restricted because they could affect the world.""* The Atom Heart, frozen solid a mere five seconds before he would have blown up. Vanish Shadowcloak, cooked solid by overexposure to direct sunlight. The news lauded them as heroes. I could not do so.

I... I did what I felt my parents would hate me for. I took my funds, put them into life ensurance, and went to Hero Academy. If I died, whether due to rigorous training or due to the ruthlessness of heroes, I at least would have some use for the few people in my family left alive. Villains stick out for each other, or at least I wanted to.

Registration was easy. Unlike my colleagues, I hadn't been really that successful, so while some knew my past, most didn't, and there were no records of my activity there. So I filled out the formular, ticked the box stating I was an orphan, and into the academy I went. I got keys for a locker and a room, and entered it. Nobody was here, but one bed was clean, unused, and I laid down. I sank into a nice sleep that day.

Of course, at some point, I got woken up. My peers woke me up, class was about to begin. Thrown in, I went for the sensible solution on questions. Always for the needs of the many, never for the rights of the few. If a rich banker has paid expenses to keep his coworkers inside and obedient without question, the banker needs to go. If an orphan steals from a store to feed his friends, he is in the right.

Then a question came up that made people wonder. The tutor, a muscled man that seemed to care less about tuition than to flex his biceps, asked us: ""A villain has transformed humans into superhumans, and if unhindered, will turn them all into the same type of superhuman. What is to be done?""

I raised my hand, and at the lack of others, knowing an answer, he picked me in spite of my many contributions. ""Well, getting him on our side would be beneficial, so a tactic trying to get him on our side would help, as it would allow heroes to expand their reach by giving fellow outstanding citizen the capability to act in his regard. Heroes are limited, and gaining a boost in numbers would help the entirety of humanity.""

I looked around, and people were confused about my statement. I clarified: ""I mean, the needs of the many would outweigh the rights of the few, and what are heroes if not humans with the right to use their powers for good?""

The teacher sighed, and looked around. ""I assume nobody has a better solution for this dilemma?"" Looking around, nobody raised their hands. Everyone looked at me. ""Alright. The solution would be to reverse-engineer the method of transforming humans as to cure the humans given superpowers while subduing the villain. The class is dismissed for today.""

I wanted to leave with the others, but the teacher called me back. ""Stay for a moment, I need to talk to you."" As I expected, he didn't know my name, so it took a few moment until the last of the people left, now certain they were not meant.

""See, I understand what angle you came from. Helping humanity is good and all, but you need to look out before you try to drag non-supers into the mess. If faced with a decision to prevent something from happening and utilizing the thing that happens, preventing is the better thing to do. Leaving non-supers the option to decide for themselves is better than abusing whatever bonus a villain produced."" He said, placing a hand on my shoulder.

I brushed it off, saying: ""Pardon, sir... But that doesn't seem effective nor heroic. We are the protectors of humanity, and what is more protective than giving them the potential to protect themselves? We wouldn't force it on them, we would just... give them an option.""

He grew louder: ""We'd revoke their uniqueness! If we were to make them carry out our own beliefs by proxy instead of letting them act on their own, we would be no different than the villains, than dictators!""

Before I knew it, I screamed as well, frustrated and pressured: ""But they would care for peace as well! It isn't dominating them, it would be a liberation!""

""If everyone is superhuman, nobody is! Especially if they have the same power, and especially if they were human before! We need to protect the good in this world!""

""Non-Supers know good and evil too!"" I blurted out, a pause now growing between the two of us. I followed up: ""If the villain cooperates, he could become a hero, just like you. He could better himself and become a symbol people would rally behind, a cause for good in the world... Just because he is a villain, doesn't mean his powers are evil, or that his mind must stay evil, or that he sees himself as evil.""

""...I did not act wrong."" He said, eliciting confusion from me. ""Villains like him need to be stopped. I think so, others think so. Your thinking is dangerous, and I only wanted to tell you that. I didn't want elaboration, I didn't want explanation. I wanted to give you information, the fact that people like you need to have their minds corrected."" My heart sank. He seemed to know at that moment, stressed by the pause. 

""You Hero Students, you have your heads in the clouds. You think there is a way to reduce suffering, but there is not. We can only ensure that the suffering is between people that can endure it and people who deserve the suffering. Innocents need to stay out of the fight. Remember that the next time you want to answer a question here.""

He sent me out. The break was soon over, but I did not feel like joining my classmates. I felt like I finally realised my parents  were correct in some things. The teacher was right in a way, too.    
But they still were wrong in many things. Heroes were no bullies, and if they were, one should distance themselves from them. Thus, I went to my room, got the few things I had, and left the Academy after a single lesson, one that I learned thoroughly, though.",looplolpop

My mind goes into over drive thinking about the implications of this ,  why has she done this ? Has she ...? No! Of course not .. that simply isn't possible! 
Tightening my grip on the year book the  feeling of eyes on my back prickles my skin while I continue to scan the page  and the notes in the margin. *rope, 12pm 2 dogs* what does that mean? ""hello Charlie dear"" comes intentionally  from behind me ""why are you crouched down there?"" I turn around to see my Granny's  wrinkled form hidden , partially from view . ""Granny what is this book?"" I ask quietly , the hairs on the back of my neck standing on edge from the tense atmosphere , ""Brian will wondering where we've gotten to dear , put down that old relic "" she chuckles forcefully, I don't move from my spot ""c'mon dear , it's time to go"" she croaks a little more forcefully . I get up gingerly from my space and follow her down the ladder and out of the attic , slightly shaken from that bizarre and slightly intimidating experience . Half why down the grey stairs to the front door I stop, 
she was watching me.

[EU] You're a time-travelling Hobbit determined to convince Sauron to never create the One Ring in the first place,Floating_Burning,"The forge room shook from the blows of the mighty hammer. Dark shadows leapt and flickered from the light of the fires, rising and falling with the air from the bellows. The room felt oppressive, sweltering from the siphoned lava from the great volcano of Mount Doom. Sauron, once lieutenant and now burgeoning lord, watched eagerly as his machinations came to fruition. The Ring formed by his hand, metals from ages ago, heat from the mountain of fire causing the Ring to take shape. He started to incant, dark words making the air shiver, and he felt his power filling the Ring. 

""Well now.  This is all impressive and no mistake. A really nice room if a bit gloomy.""  The smooth voice cut through his concentration like a knife and he turned startled. No one else should have been here. He looked about before he heard the voice again. ""Down here good sir. Easy mistake to make.""

Looking down Sauron saw the speaker. A short and rotund figure smiled cheerily back at him. Dense curly brown hair sat on a round face, simple clothes, and bare feet topped with more dark hair. Sauron was more perplexed than angry. **What are you? How did you get in here?**

The force of the voice rocked the little thing. He gulped a bit and made a bit of a bow. ""Pardon my rudeness! Where are my manners? Phineas Bramblethorn, Finn to my friends, of the Shire. Pleased to make your acquaintance my good sir.""

Sauron tilted his head. **Shire? I know of no Shire.**

Phineas shrugged eloquently and gave a sheepish smile. ""It's a small place. Beautiful for sure but maybe it doesn't exist quite yet. Don't ask me how. I don't understand it all. Something about time and a trip and all that."" He waved his hand expressively with a roll of his eyes. ""Wizards, what can you do? Aren't they a bother?""

Sauron's eyes flowed red in the depths of his helmet. A low growl emanated from him, heavy and menacing like a roll of thunder. **You are an agent of the Wizards then. To stop my grand works?** His hand drifted to a heavy mace leaning against the anvil. 

Seeing the motion Phineas gulped and waved his hands in a placating motion. ""Oh no no no! Not at all good sir. I am merely doing a favor, a job you see. Not an agent, everyone knows being a Wizard's agent is such a bother and all. No no. He did me a favor once and it's only fair for me to return one. When he told me the circumstances I thought I'd give it a go. Do your best as you can as my dear old gaffer said.""

Sauron paused, staring at the little thing. His mind reeling at the outpouring of words. Before he could speak however the intruder continued. ""So I wanted to meet you good sir and wanted to see if I can help you. Help you a way a hobbit can.""

This made Sauron laugh. Loud and jeering, his laughter shook the room and  knocked Phineas off his feet. **Help? Me? How can you help one so powerful as I?  I am creating power, strength, control. You cannot best me in magic nor in forgecraft. What can you possibly do to help me?**

Phineas got back up brushing off his clothes. Shaking lightly but he kept a smile on his face. ""Like I said, a way a hobbit can. Before you do anything of importance it's important to have a good meal. You think better on a full stomach after all. That's what mother used to say. You're all skin and...bones I suppose. Let me whip you something up. I bet you haven't had a good feed in a long long time.""

Phineas pulled a large bag out from behind a crate and began to whistle lightly, pulling out food and pans. He bustled past the confused Lord and started to assemble things on a low counter. ""Not a proper kitchen but I can make it work. Some hobbits are good at improvisation when it comes to cooking. I learned a lot from mother. Don't you worry. Things will be done in a tick.""

Dragging over a step stool he managed to set up a work station on the counter. Humming happily he started to chop at root vegetables: onions, carrots, potatoes, and turnips. He threw them into a heavy iron pot and balanced it on the rod over the forge fire. Deft knife work cut beef into small chunks and get followed into the pot with water. Little bags were opened and the fragrant scents of sage, rosemary, bay, and oregano soon filled the air. 

""There we are. Let that cook up nicely and let me do some more here. Any ovens around? No? No matter. I can do some griddle bread here. The lava is a nice touch I must say. Really heats things up nice and fast. Wouldn't work so well in a normal kitchen I'm afraid. Fits the aesthetic here though. The whole iron and shadow feel. Though if it were me a flower or two wouldn't go amiss. Nothing brightens things up like a daisy. Me gaffer was right about that you know.""

Sauron could only stand and stare, still utterly perplexed. He itched to obliterate this fool yet he was working away and talking to him with such casual insouciance. It was mind boggling. He opened his mouth to speak but for some reason stopped. Was it Phineas' audacity? His own confusion? The savory smells leaking from the pot? He didn't know. 

Faster than Sauron thought, Phineas seemed to finish up with his work. He took out a table cloth and covered a work table with it. The rich smelling stew was poured into an iron bowl and steaming flat bread sat beside it. A large platter of bacon, mushrooms, and cabbage sat in the middle releasing more savory smells. A faint pop was heard and Phineas poured an amber liquid into a metal cup. 

""There we are! All done and not a fine spread if I say so myself. Have a seat sir and enjoy!  Rich Shire stew, all ingredients grown and farmed from the Shire in there. A lovely flat bread with bits of onion worked into the crust and crumb. Finally a big plate of bacon, mushrooms, and cabbage. Mushrooms picked this...well recently picked. We hobbits know a thing or two about mushrooms. Then a nice cup of the *Green Dragon's* finest ale. Sit! Enjoy!  Then you can go back to your Ring wrangling or what have you.""

For reasons unknown to himself, Sauron sat at the table. He reached out and picked up the iron spoon. Dipping it into the bowl he took a bite. Then another. And another. The bread filled his mouth, the juices from the bacon and mushrooms flowed over his tongue. The scent of the stew filled his nose. The acrid amber ale poured down his throat. *How long has it been since I have eaten anything? When have I tasted something other than blood and ash? When have I been filled with something other than hate, resentment, ambition?*

A new smell filled the air. Like smoke but lighter than the fumes from the forge. It smelled almost floral, spicy. Phineas sat across from him smoking from a pipe, a smile on his lips. ""It's good isn't it? Easy to learn to do. So many different things. You can create other things you know.""

Sauron stared at the hobbit. Then, slowly, he extended a hand palm up. Phineas placed the pipe in it and Sauron brought the stem to his lips. A puff, a breath, and he handed it back. **So, Finn, what else can you create?**",WokCano
"[WP] After noticing your eyes through the reflection of your glasses for the fifth time today, you realize you took your glasses off an hour ago.",Green_Eyed_Otter,"Part 2

Every instinct Rebecca had screamed that she should run. Since she didn't want to waste any more ammo on the monster *not because I'm terrified to shit because I don't know what the hell that is, definitely not*, Rebecca turned and bolted through the otherworldly forest of glowing mushrooms.

She heard it following. Not wanting to look but unable to stop herself, she glanced over her shoulder. It was walking after her, the motions matching what should be a sedate stroll - but each step took it an unnaturally long distance, like a bad stop -motion animation brought it to life. She also noted that someone was screaming, a high, and terrified sound.

It took her another few running steps to realize it was her own voice.

Turn away from the nightmare behind her, she focused on what was ahead, weaving between the giant mushrooms and leaping over smaller ones. In the sides of her vision she saw shapes flickering away from her wild rush, and took some small comfort in the fact that, whatever else had happened, she apparently was not the least frightening thing in this place.

Until she saw one of the skittering things, saw it looked like a severed hand with a trio of human eyes on slug-stalks coming out of the wrist, and realized that she was in a nightmare.

*That's it. I fell asleep at my desk and I'm having the weirdest damn nightmare!* She glanced over her shoulder. The scarred man still was behind her, still walking at that slow pace that moved him far too quickly. She noted she was putting some distance between them, but didn't know how long she could keep up this mad dash. 

""Over here!"" A voice hissed.

Rebecca didn't trust the strange voice, but if nothing else, it couldn't be much worse than the thing that followed her. She dove to her right, towards the sound of the voice. 

The turn put a mushroom stalk between her and the eyeless man following her. A hatch in the ground opened, and a very human looking hand motioned her in. ""Quickly now, quickly!"" the voice hissed.

Not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth, and praying to whomever might be listening this wasn't a huge mistake, she scrambled through the hatch. It closed behind her.

The light down here was the yellow of an incandescent bulb, and she couldn't describe how comforting she found it. Something normal, something real, something to anchor herself to.

""Shhhh,"" the voice said. Rebecca turned to it.

It belong to a person, or at least, something that looked like a person on first glance. He had a finger to his lips, and Rebecca nodded to show she understood.

With nothing else to do but wait, she took in the man. He was about her height, wearing torn jeans and little else. He was thin - not just skinny, but far past that. His hair was long and unwashed, and his eyes were wide with terror.

""Shhh."" He repeated. She nodded, realizing this man needed calming more than she did right now.

Footsteps came from the ground above them. A horrible sniffing sound followed them. Rebecca and her emaciated savior stood stock still, barely daring to breathe. 

Finally, after what was likely minutes but felt like hours, the sniffing and footsteps receded.

Rebecca let out a long breath and took a moment to look around their surroundings. It looked like...well, honestly, it looked like a fairly normal basement. There were shelves with cans on them - many of them open and carefully placed back on the shelves once their contents had been consumed. Behind her was the stairway she barely remembered climbing down leading up to a hatch. Oddly a paper number 8 sat near the bottom of them, yellowed with age. A single lightbulb, hanging from the ceiling, provided the illumination.

""He gone,"" her rescuer said. ""But be back. Always come back. Always! We need move. New place. Find safe.""

Rebecca took note of the broken grammar. He didn't seem to have an accent, so it must be a lack of knowledge. ""Who are you?"" she asked.

He shrugged. ""Call Noname. You?""

""Uh...Rebecca. Noname...Where - where the hell are we?""

The look he gave her spoke volumes. ""Just fall through?"" He watched her nod slowly. ""We other side. Through mirror. Wonderland, but no wonder. Only fear. Only fear and hunger.""

Rebecca shuddered at that. The thought of protesting that it was all a dream crossed her mind again, but she discarded it. It was a stupid, useless objection people always made in fiction when they wound up in things like this. If she was dreaming, or if she was crazy, she'd have to hope she'd either wake up or get locked up before she hurt anyone. For now, the only reasonable thing to do was treat what she was seeing as real and hope for the best. ""Look, Noname, I have to get back.""

Noname stared at her, then began to let out a low, sobbing laugh. ""No back. Only through. No wonder. Only fear.""

She reached out to touch him, but he skittered away. 

""Your face stolen. Your eyes stolen. We survive, we hide, or the Faceless Man make you like him. Happened to others. No back. Only through. Must find new hole to hide in.""

Rebecca felt her skin crawling as Noname began to wrap his arms around himself, crying. Part of her felt pity, wanted to give him a hug and comfort him, but another part of her was repulsed by the sight - and by the realization. 

""Noname...how long have you been here?""

The sobbing laughter became full on tears now. Instead of answering, he began singing softly to himself between the tears. ""Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to meeee-eeee.""

Slowly, she looked back to the stairs. Where the faded paper number 8, which she realized now had small holes to hang from something on the top of it. Then back to Noname, horror growing in proportion to realization.

""Happy birthday...toooo...meee,"" he finished, and then resumed sobbing softly.

"[WP] After noticing your eyes through the reflection of your glasses for the fifth time today, you realize you took your glasses off an hour ago.",Green_Eyed_Otter,"*Damn, I need to get these things cleaned.* Rebecca had spent the better part of the day trying to ignore the reflection of her eyes in her glasses. It was something that you learned to ignore if you had to wear the damn things, although Rebecca couldn't remember noticing it all that often before today.

Still, it was frustrating. She'd taken them off a couple times already to wipe them down, and each time she'd catch a glimpse of them again. Eyes inches away from her own, looking right back at her. This was the fifth time, and annoyed, she reached up to take them off again and hope this time the wiping would get rid of the reflection.

Her hand grasped at empty air.

*What?*

Heart pounding, she looked around. On her desk, right by her mouse, sat her glasses. Neatly folded. Not on her face where they could reflect.

She took a few slow, measured breaths. 

Working overnight as security at a call center was hardly the most thrilling job in the world, but there were surprisingly few jobs for cops that had quit the force and hadn't built up any other marketable skills. She'd started going the PI route, but it didn't pay the bills yet, so security work kept her afloat as she built her business. It meant constantly changing hours, and it was easy to put down the reflection to her imagination being worked up and made worse by being so damn tired.

Except for one simple, nagging, inescapable fact.

She could still see fine. Ever since she'd been twelve she'd needed glasses to see more than a foot in front of her face, but now she was seeing the entire world clearly - except for the reflection of her eyes, which now that she was aware of it wouldn't go away from her vision.

She reached for the glasses, taking a moment to steady her hand. What did she think was going to happen? She'd put them on and then... it would go away?

*Face it, Becks. You finally snapped.* Not sure what to expect, she held up the glasses to her face - not to put them on, but facing away. Moving like she was putting them on the semi-transparent eyes that hovered in front of her vision.

She could feel them slide behind a pair of ears she couldn't see.

*What...* but things were happening too fast for questions. The eyes wearing the glasses were rapidly becoming crystal clear, changing from a translucent vision into a solid pair of eyes peering at her. They were her eyes, she was sure of it - the blue eyes that had gotten complimented as her best feature so often. Except they also weren't her eyes, because her eyes had never before been twisted with so much *hatred.* Even when she had caught Gary in bed with her sister, she didn't believe her eyes had been that full of absolute distain. 

Even as she watched, a face began to form under the glasses, a reflection that was rapidly becoming solid. Where rational thought failed, training took over - she reached for her gun and began to back up, away from the duplicate of herself that was forming.

She'd later wonder if she had been more used to her surroundings, if things might have gone differently. But since she wasn't, she didn't realize how close the wall behind her was, and backed all the way into it.

Or, more specifically, into the floor to ceiling mirror that ran along the wall.

As soon as she hit it, before her gun was fully out of its holster, the mirror image of herself sprung forward with impossible speed. The mirror version's face was still twisted in hatred, and they collided, and Rebecca felt herself falling backwards. The sensation was followed with a cold feeling, like saline running through her veins, and she was falling through the mirror and then down, through a pit that opened up on the other side of the mirror. Her reflected self stared at her for a moment and slowly extended a hand with an upraised middle finger...and then withdrew through the mirror.

Rebecca fell for another couple of minutes, passing out of the pit into a chasm, a vast underground cave that was held up by pillars of stone and lit by a blue and green glow from giant bioluminescent mushrooms that dotted the landscape. 

She was sure she was going to die as soon as she hit the ground. After falling for so long, it was the only logical outcome, although part of her reminded herself that logic had left the building the moment her glasses had stuck on a face that wasn't there.

When she hit the stone below, it hurt. But only like she'd fallen out of a second story window - a bad hurt, one that made her curse in pain and would likely leave a bruise across her back, but nothing fatal.

She lay there for a moment, trying to process what had happened. *Well, I don't know what you're confused about, Becks. You put your glasses on the face of your mirror image, and then it tossed you through the mirror into an underground fungus land. What could possibly be confusing about that?* She felt a hysterical laugh rise up in her throat, and clamped it down.

As the pain subsided, she forced herself to her feet and looked around. The glowing mushrooms kept this cavern as light as twilight, and they towered over her head the way trees would. She was in a forest of them.

At that moment, her peripheral vision noted movement, and the gun she hadn't quite gotten free before was now loosed and sprung into her hand. 

""Whatever's out there, show yourself!"" When it didn't respond, she followed it up with ""I'm not having a day where you want to mess with me!""

This got a laugh, and a figure stepped into view. It took every ounce of will Rebecca had not to scream. The figure was seven feet tall, looking like a smaller man that had been stretched into that size. It's face was utterly without eyes, instead covered with a mass of scars and a grin that stretched from ear to ear. 

""I hate to say that your day is about to get worse, my dear.""

Rebecca pulled the trigger, three rapid rounds. They struck the man's chest, causing him to bend over backwards - almost in half - but then he slowly began to pull himself back up to standing. The bullet holes began to close in front of her eyes.

""Much, much worse.""

I struggle to reach over and grab the phone without breaking it and sighing. 'Another Superman?' I asked without even confirming who it was.

'This is becoming a common occurence, I know,' the woman on the other end of the line said. 'How soon can you be in Sydney?'

'Give me a minute,' I said as I sat up from the bed.

'As in, to get ready or to get down here?' she asked.

'Both, actually,' I said before hanging up.

And sure enough, in less than a minute I was fully dressed and down in the Australian capital while putting on a pair of kryptonite brass knuckles. 'I cannot wait until I can go back to normal,' I grumbled beside her. 'Same price as always.'

'Already wired to your account,' she said. 'Just take him out before he gets to the nuclear power station?'

I merely nodded my head before flying up into the sky, scanning around to see another fratboy who was dressed as the Man Of Steel that night.

The British Halloween... Called that since it's where the whole disaster originated. Anyone in costume was turned into what that costume represented. Well, loosely in some cases. I mean, I do believe that quite a few parents would be hysterical if they sent their kids trick-or-treating and come back as blood-feasting monsters instead of just being able to turn into bats or wolves. And the ghost kids as well.

Me? Well, I was invited to the hottest party in town by virtue of going to the same university as some rich snob and my friends wanted to use the occasion to climb the social ladder, or at least sell ourselves as costume makers. The rule of the party was simple, a fusion between two costumes. So, there were scantily dressed devil-slash-angels, cupids, whatever, as well as action heroes crossed with movie characters and whatnot.

And the thing is? When we all were hit with the bizarre curse that transformed us into our costumes it didn't change our personalities, so a bunch of lug-headed fratbros, over-entitled college athletes and just plain-insane people had superpowers and decided to lord it over as many other people as possible.

I was always rather meek myself, which probably led to many people sighing in relief since I technically counted as a Superman despite the fact I was a crossover-character. And so, I took on the much-needed job of stopping these assholes and I've managed to pay off my student loans *and* develop a fund in case this can be reversed. Because having to walk around campus like this is hard as shit.

'So, you're the latest jackass who's got me up at 3am,' I grumbled as I flew behind him. 'You're under arrest.'

'And who the fuck do you think you are?' He asked before turning to me... then screaming as he saw me. 'Oh, fuck!'

'Me?' I asked as I cracked my knuckles. 'I'm basically the Kryptonian version of the Juggernaut. So I'll give you a choice - either surrender peacefully or I beat your ass from Arcturus and back. Do *not* think you can take me.'",res30stupid
"[WP] After the event commonly known as ""British Halloween"" occurred in October 2017, governments around the world began to pour billions into research into the occult and supernatural.",Invalid_Doughnut,"British Halloween. 

It was a really fucked up day that day in all honesty. 

The chaos.
The death.
The revenants.
The vampires.
The superhumans.
The monsters.
The freaks.
Them.

It all started somewhere in East London. A controversial pseudoscientist named Franklin Samuels claimed to have invented a device that let the ""other world"" out and as per usual, he was dismissed. I mean this fucker once hijacked Olympic Park during a major football match to tell the world he invented a way to talk to yellow ducks only so of course no one took himself seriously. But old Frankie ran around Stratford and Tower Hamlets yelling about the ""other world"" when suddenly the fucker dropped dead by Canary Wharf during a huge protest with cameras. No warning. Yelling ""they are coming"" and then dead. Obviously something had gone wrong.

Then, it happened.

They appeared out of nowhere only to be broadcasted worldwide to millions, if not billions, of people who were watching the protest of the century.

These horrific manifestations revealed themselves to us and started murdering or eating or befriending or stabbing those thousands of protestors for the whole world to see. 

It was pretty mental but I live up North and I was watching House of Cards at the time so I didn't hear the tells of fear in the neighborhood.

Anyway British Halloween ended as it came and straight after MI5 confiscated all of Franklin's research and technology including his ""other worlds"" machine and shut down his website with free schematics and what not. (Obviously some looney must've downloaded the website after witnessing the British Halloween but they aren't releasing anything yet. Hopefully never.) 

A trail of carnage was left all of one the UK's premier business districts that's still being cleared up nearly a year later. Anywho the governments around the world poured billions into occult and supernatural research and enacted a bunch of laws to prevent normal people from doing what poor Franklin did that day on British Halloween. 

Shame that I'm the looney who's building another machine as we speak...

"[PM]! I like fantasy, sci-fi, and even realistic fiction -- but feel free to test me! I want to expand my boundaries. Thanks. :)",MissHuggerMugger,"**Auggy the Great Fart of the Earth** (Part 1)

His mother had named him Augustus — “the great,” “the venerable” — and hoped, by some bestowal of Zeus, that the boy would grow into his name one day; a leader, a soldier, or, perhaps a beloved and respected patriarch.

Augustus, well, Auggy, as his friends called him (friends, perhaps, is a strong word, but he most certainly called himself it), Auggy had, at the very least grown. Primarily his stomach, which ballooned up to the sky, in all it’s browned and hairy glory, like a big, fat honey pot that a particularly hirsute rat had decided to explode in. 

His stomach was what most Pompeianis saw as they tiptoed past him, hopping along the gleaming white bricks of the street, hoping not to wake the beast.

Auggy’s “home” was a space of about a meter and a half both ways, squat between the town’s prized two ceramists. The ground surrounding him was littered in broken pieces of colorful pottery. 

He liked to lay, belly-up, his rotund tummy breaching out of his ripped and dirtied tunic (it was beige to hide stains, which it decidedly did not do), in front of their shops, limbs akimbo, so that those who dared enter would perhaps trip and drop a nice pot that he could then get his scrabbly hands on.

Auggy loved pots more than just about anything. He liked pots of all shapes and sizes. Really, if he were to be honest (which, he rarely was) pots had been the end of him. It began when he was a young boy and grand Spartan soldier had tossed his older brother a nice bit of pot, covered in brilliant golds and reds. 

Auggy had been horribly jealous, and searched for an equally nice pot all his life, though he never found it.

His mother had died of shame as a result of Auggy’s pot addiction. The doctor said it was Leprosy, but Auggy’s mom insisted, even upon her death bed, that, no, it was, in fact the shame of her son squandering the family fortune and leaving them destitute on the streets that had caused her arm to fall off. 

&gt;“I think it might be the leprosy, Mama.” 

&gt;“No, darling, it’s just ashamed to be seen with you.”

Those were her last words right before the second arm fell off and she died (either due to shame or Leprosy, depending on who you ask). 

That had been the last of his family in Rome, and so, with nothing left to lose, Auggy snuck aboard a trading ship sailing for Pompeii. It was there he discovered the very tunic he wore today. His only tunic. He’d thought he’d be very clever and choose beige — it hides stains, you know.

And that’s how Auggy had ended up here. By now, he was a very old man. The locals (who did not much like Auggy or his stench) were always surprised he hadn’t up and died yet. At 43 he was considered a right old bastard, something he was terribly proud of and sought often to prove.

&gt;”Ah, feck off, will ya? And get the hell out of my kitchen,” Auggy groaned as he swatted away the sandled foot kicking lightly his ear.

The Roman guard glanced around, uncertain. Kitchen? He shook his head, walking to the other side of the man, and kicked at his other ear. Flies, who had been buzzing happily above Auggy’s mouth and feasting on the remains of his breath, scattered.

Auggy swiped at him again, cracking one eye.

&gt;”And now you’re in my living room?! Feck off, I said!” 

Auggy rolled over, exposing the pale crack of his bum, sneaking out the tops of his (cleverly beige and extraordinarily stained) trousers.

The Roman Guard cleared his throat, moving out of the way of the small throng of people passing by. Some were driving carts while others carried large bags and baskets piled high with belongings.

&gt;”Look… sir. I’ve come to evacuate the city. They have been reports in the last two days of…”

&gt;“For fuck’s sake, if you don’t get the hell out of my home, I can’t possibly listen to you.”

The Guard sighed heavily, fingering the smooth wood of his spear, before relenting. Auggy had his head up, glaring at the man, so the guard took a step backward. 

Auggy motioned for him to continue, the Guard took another step, and another, until Auggy was satisfied that he was well out of the range of the pottery pieces.

Auggy then pulled himself up, the immense weight of him hotter in the summer sun. It was almost noon, although he wouldn’t have known it. The sky was bit darker than he remembered.

&gt;“Now,” said Auggy, “what do you want?”

The Guard raised himself to his full height. He’d only been appointed a month ago and this was his first real assignment. 

&gt;“I am Chariton Epiphanios Miltiades Ambros, soldier for the Holy Roman Empire, and I am here to assist in the evacuation.”

&gt;”What evacuation?”

&gt;”There were reports of a quaking earth and a ash-seared sky by a young scholar two days ago. We are to evacuate you to Rome.”

&gt;”Hm, no.”

Auggy then rolled over, ignoring him again. Chariton, annoyed, prodded at him with the pointy end of his spear, which seemed to dip strangely into Auggy’s sweaty hyde.

&gt;”I must insist.”

&gt;”And I must decline.”

Chariton felt his head getting warmed as his anger rose.

&gt;“And who, in the name of Emperor Titus, are you?”

Auggy smiled for the first time in the last week and sat himself up to his full, seated height, stubby legs in front of him like a suckling pig. 

He then spoke, his voice surprisingly booming.

&gt;“I am Auggy,” he began, “the Great Fart of the Earth!”

Chariton blinked, the anger evaporating in favor of confusion.

&gt;“I’m sorry, what?”

Auggy continued, voice ever louder, drawing the eyes of those continuing to stream past them. 

&gt;“My name is Auggy. I was spat from the Earth by Zeus himself in a particularly rancid fart eons ago in the great year of 36—“

&gt;“Eons? That was only 43 years ago.”

Auggy ignored him, never faltering. 

&gt;“—he spat me out to disperse his fart far and wide, from Rome to the heights of Pompeii! From sea to shining sea! He wants all of you to smell his fart and know its power! A power so crippling that one day I will be sucked back into his venerable hole as quickly as I was dealt! I will not be destroyed by you, or any of your kind. I will return the way I came, in the greatest fart ever known. That is I, Auggy! The Great Fart of the Earth!”

Chariton nodded to himself, before snatching the arm of a local boy who was scuttling by in the crowd.

&gt;“Pardon, do you happen to know this man?”

Auggy huffed in indignation as the boy glanced at him. 

&gt;“Oh, Auggy? He’s the Great Fart of the Earth. Zeus dealt him. And he will only die the way he came, in the greatest fart ever known.”

Chariton looked from Auggy, nodding knowingly, to the boy,  eyes wide in his innocent honesty. The Guard sighed.

&gt;“Is that everything?”

&gt;“Oh, and he’s a right bastard.”

Auggy opened his arms wide in victory, and Chariton let go of the boy’s arm.

&gt;“I see, carry on.”

The boy then ran off, disappearing in the crowd. Chariton groaned heavily to himself, eyes closed, before turning back to Auggy. 

&gt;”I don’t care who you think you are. I am assigned to remove all invalids from the street and assist them to safety.”

&gt;”Fortunately for you, I am no invalid. I am a fart.”

&gt;”Yes, well… Auggy. It’s time for us to leave.”

Chariton bent down and reached for Auggy’s arm. Auggy jolted away, skittering through the pieces of his treasures littered around him.

&gt;”No! This is my home!”

&gt;”If you do not come willingly, you will be seized.”

There were shouts from the passersby as the sky grew darker yet and the faint smell of warmth descended. Auggy hardly noticed, however, as he shakily stood, putting two meaty fists up toward Chariton.

&gt;”Challenge me and perish, swine!”

That was it was Chariton who drew the length of his spear, pointing it directly at the homeless man’s heart.

&gt;”If I must.”

Auggy’s eyes went wide as he suddenly spun, darting toward the nicer of the two ceramist’s shop behind him. While both ceramists decidedly despised Auggy, one of them at least didn’t throw waste on him every Tuesday.

As he fled toward the shop, however, he noted it was closed and dark. Auggy had never seen such a thing! As the Guard descended on him, Auggy knew what he had to do.

&gt;”In the name of the Emperor, I decree you, Auggy, are under—“

Auggy burst through the window into the shop!

Precious pottery clattered to the ground in horrible, crashing heaps as Auggy skittered past, looking for a place to hide.

For a moment, however, even in the dark, the place took his breath away.

He’d never been allowed inside the shop before, because of the fact that he smelled of rotten death and all, and it was almost too much to handle.

Gorgeous pots of every size and variety lined the walls. They were tall, and short, and round, and less round. Auggy felt tears come to his eyes as he took them in. His family.

“—arrest!”

But there was no time to lose. Auggy shook the wonderment away and he scrabbled for the corner as Chariton dove in after him. The weight of his armor slowed him as he tried very hard not to break anything.

Auggy, meanwhile, had found the most amazing thing he’d ever seen.

It was a pot nearly half his height and at least his width, with a wide, detailed brim, and gorgeous patterns in swirls of red and gold.

This was it. This was his pot.

Before even given a chance to think, he leapt into, with all the grace he didn’t normally have. Not a moment later, Chariton stalked past, spear at the ready.

“I don’t care if you die here or out there as long I as I can witness it! Now get out here you crazy bastard.”

The guard shouted in what Auggy thought were fairly obvious theatrics, but he thought he ought not chance it.

Just as soon as Chariton was out of the way, Auggy turtled himself underneath the giant pot and proceeded to scuttle with all of his scuttling might.

He was finally living his dream.

Unable to see, however, (seeing as he was covered in a massive pot, Auggy ran himself straight into the legs of Chariton, who shrieked and stabbed backward, narrowly missing Auggy who had slid out of the way, righting himself again.

”There you are!”

As the spear descended, Auggy couldn’t quite bring himself to let go of his prize at risk of losing it forever.

He sat in his pot, quaking, there was a blast outside and loud screams, drawing Chariton’s attention away.

”Oh dear Zeus…”

Auggy took the moment to flee!

He raced out of the shop, the pot raised high above his head, and he shouted, “I am Auggy! The Great Fart!”

Chariton sighed, quickly following.

As Auggy raced through the crowds, he noted the sky was growing black as coal and the air was uncomfortably warm (even more so than usual), but he didn’t care, for he had his pot and his life, and that’s all he needed.

And as he ran, pushing through crowds and away, he could finally see the sea, swarming with ships.

”Stop, in the name of—“

But he didn’t hear the end of the man’s shout as he leapt into the water, pot first. He crammed himself inside and steered it like a ship toward the fleeing boats.

”Farewell fuckhead!”

He screamed, waving back at Chariton who threw his arms up at the shore.

This was it, he had made it… but now where was he going?

Auggy pondered this as he drifted further and further away from the shore. Finally he watched as people ran, fleeing from something.

And that’s when he saw it. From straight out the top of the mountain it blasted, an explosion of ash and darkness! It rained down in fiery Hades, covering everything in its wrath.

As the cloud descended over him too, Auggy couldn’t help but feel finally vindicated.

He sank into the bottom of his pot, grinning ear to ear. At 43, he was a year past ready.

“The fart has come.”

 And with that, Auggy and his pot drifted away, covered in black and soot, out of sight.

Prohibition agent. I wish I could say I didn't know what I was getting into, but I did. Maybe not of this magnitude. But enforcing a law as widely unaccepted by the American people as a prohibition on the one item that helps them get through the long grueling day, no one expected it to be easy. Hell, I'd take trading lead with backwoods hillbillies than fighting krauts in the trenches any fuckin' day of the week though.

Moonshine, they're calling it. They brew this swill in big dirty barrels ""by the light of the moon"" out in the boonies of rural Tennessee. Our people are saying that anything that isn't smuggled overseas comes from these inbred idiots out here. If we can bust up this business, we'll stop over 40% of the annual illegally imported booze into Chicago. 

""Sir, some of Anderson's men just made it back."" 

""What happened? Is Anderson with them?""

""No sir. They've been pretty quiet. Something shook them up real bad. One of them did say that there was some kind of animal. A bear or something. Maybe they were keeping bears on the property to keep us away.""

""Alright, grab a few extra shotguns. We're going to get Anderson."" 

Four Double Barrel 12 Gauge shotguns, 48 shells. Twelve Colt M1911 Service Pistols, 200 .45 bullets. It feels like war. If they killed Anderson, maybe it has to be. 

It takes two hours and four minutes give or take to drive from Carbondale, IL to Union City, TN, although it feels like a goddamn eternity. The landscape slowly changes from civilization to an outlaw's utopia, overgrown flora and fauna the better to hide contraband, and forests galore to hide themselves within. A feeling of eerie dread slowly overcomes my men and I as we creep further into the den. If they got Anderson, how well will I and fifteen greenhorns fare?

It's just after 9PM when we arrive outside the ""compound"", that is the large farm known to locals of this area as ""deh place where all dat moonshine come from"". Hillbillies, I'll never get used to it. 

I form a line 16 men long and we march one after one into the deep forest. The sound of bubbling liquid in large cisterns can be overheard from a distance over the typical nightly sounds of the forest. Perhaps we'll catch them off guard. 

Six men flank from around the left side of the house, six men on the right, with I along with three men swoop right up the middle. We surround the house, and take defensive positions in anticipation of a standard breach.

Breach.

We swarm all entrances of the house and file in quickly and efficiently. I'd be proud if I wasn't preoccupied with keeping the motions going. In a matter of seconds, we have 6 men completely surrounded from all directions in the center of the house.

It's a fairly large but old and dirty shack, the floor is covered in old rugs filled with mud. The walls are mismatched wooden panels with bent nails sticking out of each stud. Eight very large rusty metal cisterns sit on the left side of the room, emitting the bubbling sound we heard earlier. But best of all, there is a small, dirty chicken wire cage in the corner of the room, and 
inside it sits Anderson. 

""Wickey, let Anderson out."" 

""oh i would not do that if i were you sir"" pipes up a younger hillbilly in the center of the room.

""Shut up. Wickey, let Anderson out.""

""ya see, your friend was not feeling all that well so we gave him some of our special moonshine to perk him up ya see, now he looks fine but he been real quiet see, i would leave him alone if i were you"" 

A slow smirk creeps over the dirty, whispy neckbearded face of the young hillbilly, and as Wickey opens the chickenwire gate, Anderson immediately lunges out and stands straight up.

""Anderson, are you alright?""

Silence. Wickey walks around him to check him for wounds, and Anderson's head eerily creeps around to meet Wickey's gaze. 

""A- Anderson?""

Anderson quick as lightning lunges on top of Wickey and tears a fatally large chunk of blood red flesh out of his neck.
All of the men jump and point their pistols at Anderson and begin firing bullets into his back. 

Anderson fails to fall as we unload shot after shot at him. Our efforts were futile,  and I was too focused on saving Wickey from whatever Anderson had become to notice the lumbering beast emerge from a backroom. Calling it a bear didn't do it justice. The creature most closely resembled a wolf. A long snout, tall pointy ears, bloodshot red eyes, and teeth as sharp as knives. The beast stood over 7 feet tall, walked similar to that of a man, and was covered head to toe in thick pitch black fur. The sheer size of the creature was a marvel to see. Everyone unlucky enough to also catch it's icy gaze stood still, unable to make sense of what they were seeing before them. 

I would almost call it a beautiful sight, until it tore it's first victim in half with minimal effort. The beast ravaged through those men like a hot knife thrugh butter, bullets doing next to nothing to it. I want to say they died gallantly and with honor, but that would be a lie. The ear piercing screams of agony were all that could be heard once the beast was through with everyone but me. It stopped, lumbered closer with footsteps that shook the entire shack, and met eye to eye with me, breathing right into my face. 

The beast then turned around and walked into the back of the cabin, slamming the door closed behind it.

""that means you can live, he always leave one man to tell the story."" 

I turned around, and walked out of the shack. I walked outside into the brisk mountain air, and felt a shutter down my spine. I immediately broke into a dead sprint for the car, although I'm not sure what I was running from. Beasts like that exist in this world, I know that now. After all of our civilized advancement, a carnal world where a seemingly fictional beast can do that to fifteen armed men with ease is no world that's ever safe to live in. 

There is no where I can run that will ever keep me safe again. ",BarryOakTree

The humans could be pretty noisy, but as long as it's dark and there is food that is OK.

There was a deep booming coming from the ground. It felt far away, so I am not scared. But I am getting scared. The humans are making a lot more noise than usual, they are scared too. There was a flash of light, the refrigerator did not block it. THE SHADOWS ARE GONE! Even under the fridge! Now the whole world is shaking. I am holding still in case it is another one of the humans' monsters coming to eat me. Its getting too warm, and I tingle a little.

Something hits the house really hard. The pressure hurts my antenna and smells like the the air when the humans fiddle with the large tubes of plastic and metal that spark. The something hits the house harder and the roof rips off. My fridge is hurled away from me!

"[WP] Food critic that can't taste, trying to convince the world he can.",ape_who_can_type,"We sat down. The tables at La Serre were large and round and felt like they hadn't moved in centuries. Lavishly draped in fine white tablecloth that hung gracefully the tables resembled marble plinths for unmade Italian sculptures. The glasses, all of them, were so perfectly clean and shone magnificently with the light flowing in through the dining room's long French windows. The cutlery, the service going on around us, the people sat at the table with me, everything was screaming the finest-quality, but screaming on a velvety-smooth and indulgent note. The pristine Maitre D' with his white gloves introduced our 15 course tasting menu with the most descriptive of adjectives that I'm not sure any of us seated could match if pressed. My empty stomach growled.
	
	
This was the annual, official company dinner for the writers of the London Food Guide. Down to 5 members from 10 last year due to budget cuts, I felt I'd earned this multi-Michelin star experience: writing 10 hours a day for all our channels and tasting when I wasn't writing; my social life was gobbled up and there was nothing I could do about my belly's winning battle versus my historically passable physique. Eating food and getting paid, however, made it worth it. I have always had perspective on my side, because I've gone hungry, so every day I'm thankful for just how lucky I am to do what I do. I think everyone around the table is.

""Voila, mesdames et messieurs, the first course,"" said the MD, and as he introduced the delicious smoked salmon salad hors d'oeuvres he was satisfyingly symmetrically enveloped by concentrated-looking young, but professional, FoH staff, each carrying a plate covered with a totally fingerprint-free cloche. We ate slowly and professionally: a perfect bite containing all components, a taste of each ingredient alone, a swig of our sommelier's pairing and a bite.
	
""Lovely, isn't it,"" I said, to a response of mms and gentle nodding. I looked up at my fellow diners. The team was small but strong, and though we were over-worked our readership was as strong as ever. I sub-edited for the group as I had the most years in-industry. We had Max, my long-time friend and colleague, ex-professional chef, a student of Marco Pierre White and wonderful writer; Melanie, star of both French and British cooking television, a sharp, witty woman with the power to instantly charm anyone who stood before her; Laura, the best writer among us, a  crime novelist turned food critic, and James, the Magazine editor's son whom was rapidly improving but probably undeserving of his column and status at 22 years of age.

""Wow!"" exclaimed James emphatically. 

""Yes, that was quite something,"" Melanie added in her darling French accent.

""Never before have I tasted a salmon so delicate, with such freshness and flavour and colourful accompaniments,"" said Max. We weren't writing about a dinner for once, a relief for food writers; it was an example of a difficult to truly understand food-phenomena amongst a group of people, like a travelling salesman's longing for plain food because of eating over-seasoned hotel dinners for weeks on end. We let the wine flow, deliberately blurring our judgement of the morsels to be presented to us. It was a delicious wine - old, with the depth of flavour only the old one's have. Laura wasn't talking much. 


By the fifth course, I was on cloud 9. Laura had loosened up and become more her usual self, laughing and arguing why she'll never write another novel despite everyone wanting her to - herself included. Melanie, she.. you could tell with Mel why she was one of the most beloved dual-national treasures in history. I couldn't hear much of what she was saying as she sat the table directly opposite myself, but I had the best view of her lips moving and that was enough to fill my brain with whisps of segments of sentences like she was whispering them directly into my ear.

Course 9 was a sublime canard roti, crisp of skin and deep of flavour - I was reminded of the BBQ cook-out I'd attended in Texas, where the burnt ends changed my life forever.
	
""Maaan, quit looking at her,"" Max quipped, quietly, alongside a gentle nudge in the gut with his elbow. ""You know you're colleagues, right?""
	
""Yeah,"" I said, ""still a man can dream.""
	
""True, I suppose you've got good taste. If I'm going to dream about any woman I don't see why it shouldn't be her.""
	
""Aye, and don't talk to me about taste.""
	
""Hey, you know I never do. At least, not particularly specifically.""

[WP] An inmate on death row is unsatisfied with his last meal,im_not_a_bot_bot,"Today was a good day to die. He hadn't been asked to take his medicine anymore for the last few days, and so he didn't feel so down anymore. The sun was chirping, the birds were blooming, and he even got promised a nice meal. Just like his ma used to make it: Carrot Stew with Peas. They had asked him if he was sure, if that truly was what he wanted, one warden even snickering. They probably expected him to pick a fancier dish, something that would be harder to make.

The door was opened, and a guard stepped in, cautiously. The prisoner looked at him carefully. Th guard had a baton of candy, but it probably was for his own meal, not as a snack for the inmate. Thus, he followed him to a containment room. In there was a steaming stew.

The inmate took the spoon, and looked at the stew. Carrots, some traces of meat, some potatoes. No peas. Not one.

""Where are the peas?"" He asked.

""Don't worry, it's in there."" The guard said, less stoic and purely baffled.

There were no peas. The prisoner tried it regardless, closing his eyes and tasting the stew on his tongue. He immediately flinched at the taste: It was not just lacking of peas, it was just wrong, vile, a disgrace to cooking.

""What is this shit?"" He asked.

""Carrot Stew with Peas, as you requested. Do you not want to eat it? I mean, I understand it, but...""

""It tastes horrid! Try yourself and you will agree!""

""Fat chance. C- Can we hurry this along?"" The guard asked, clearly uncomfortable with his candy baton.

""What shit is this? I'll die in a moment, and you didn't even put any effort into my last meal? This is absolute garbage.""

""Well, I don't know what else we can do. I think the schedule asks for us to move on, we don't have time for the cook to prepare another stew. Also, we don't have the ingredientes for another one.""

The prisoner knew that prostesting did little now, but he still wanted to vent. So he did just that as he followed him. ""It is just Carrot Stew. With peas, or even without peas, how do you lack ingredients for that?""

They walked through floors and finally reached the courtyard. Some inmates were here too, enjoying the sunlight or burning alive. The guard replied: ""Well, we probably would have ingredients if we left out the peas.""

""Then how the fuck did you not put in the peas the first time? Did you just not buy some?"" The prisoner had stopped and started shouting. ""Like, the fuck is with the food here, if a man like me can't get his last meal? It is not even expensive! What the hell, man?""

The guard grew somewhat nervous. ""Well... Could we just move al-""

One of the men burning spoke up now as well. ""No, what the fuck? Y'all gave him not what he wanted for his last meal? And just yesterday, I found a band-aid in my food!""

Another person, lying in the grass before, stood up and went close to the guard. ""I found some meat, uncooked and raw!"" In the shortest of time, many people, men, aliens, and some women had formed a circle around the two, voicing their complaints.

The guard grew panicked. ""I am sure that if you all calm down, I can ta-"" He was interrupted by a punch to the jaw, which sent him to the ground. Several people looted stuff from his body, handcuffs, some keys, an alien took the candy baton.

""Fellas, it is time we riot! They went too far, and we either get them to negotiate or drive them away!"" The burning man said. ""We all deserve at least decent food, and will not tolerate getting treated like animals, led to the slaughterhouse. Follow me, to the kitchen!""",looplolpop

I'm a big Disnerd so when the kids insisted on skipping the magic kingdom in favour of this reptile pile this year, I was utterly unimpressed. 

After all of my attempts at sulking in the shed with the power tools had been met with the kind of stoic resilience only offered by two pre teen girls who are sick of posing with Mickey Mouse I relented. 

I must say that while there's no real ""character"" to the park, as well as 0 actual characters, the overall experience is a lot more relaxed.

I got to see amazing sights along with my wife Darlene and our two kids Sam and Diane.  Both Sam and Diane absolutely love dinosaurs and had been little balls of energy these past weeks as the anticipation for today built and built.

We were first helicoptered in to this large remote island and met at a large building by an old man who kind of reminded me a little of the Colonel from KFC.  Turns out the guy owns the place and we were selected to be the first unofficial visitors.  

After making introductions we were put in a jeep that was painted in green and yellow and moved along a fixed track.  We were told not to leave the Jeep and that we would be monitored the whole time.  The jeep couldn’t start quick enough for us.

The first dino we saw was a Triceratops.  Both of my kids screamed and my wife and I were speechless and on the verge of tears.  It was so massive and grand!  We wanted to get out and pet the thing.  We noticed it was eating something which looked a lot like lilac berries.  The information from the car said that Triceratops were herbivores.

We saw many dinosaurs afterwards and they were all magnificent but none so much as the T-Rex.  That thing was mean as hell and I was never more scared in my life even as it stood behind a massive fence that was coursing with high amounts of electricity.  The roar of the rex was so deafening I had a slight ringing in my ear for a few hours.  That brought the reality of how frightening it really must have been hundreds of millions of years ago when these beasts ruled the world.

An odd thing happened after the jeep trip was done.  Once we got back to the main building I walked past a really nervous looking man walking down a set of stairs.  He dropped a can which rolled near my feet.  It looked similar to the aerosol shaving cream I have back home.  I picked it up and handed it to him.  He more or less snatched it out of my hands and scampered off.  The owner, our tour guide for the day, told us people here were under a lot of stress to get the park opened on time and some acted more peculiar than others.

Next we got a science lecture and ate some really exquisite food.  We couldn’t stay the night as they were doing an ‘official’ test the next day with the owner’s grandchildren and some lawyers and dinosaur experts.  It doesn’t matter.  One day was more than enough at Jurassic Park.

We left the island by helicopter and brought to a resort at a nearby island.  It’s late in the night and I can’t go to sleep.  I’m still replaying everything in my head as I stare out into the ocean thinking of the island and those incredible creatures.

The Jurassic Park is a great choice for a family friendly holiday. We went for a summer vacation this year. The entertainment was excellent and the staff were very friendly. Entrance Fee's were a little pricey for some of the exhibitions but we did make full use of the Fast Track pass, which saved us £120 each! The children had the best day ever and me and my wife found it very interesting. I would definitely recommend going to anybody who is thinking about it.

***** Five Stars 

__Disappointment__

Went last week, heard rumors of escaping dinosaurs, they didn't. Left with the same two children I came with. They had the best day ever. Wouldn't recommend. Was expecting at least one of the kids to be eaten.

Hiding from the wind and starting a fire was the only option. The cave was the perfect shelter. After the fire was lit and the meat was cooked, the men and women began to relax and warm themselves.

Everyone froze when the sound came. It was from deeper within the cave. The men picked up their spears and hunkered down, hoping to corner a family of bears to feed them for the winter. As they approached the noises, the found not bears, but what looked to be some form of squid.

Eight tenticled creatures writhed and grunted themselves, placing chunks of iron in strange places on a large dusk-sky colored rock. Before long, the rock began to flicker with little fires within. The tentacle things retreated within this rock and the entire lump vanished.

Several years later, tales of these water monsters vanishing on land entered the local cannon of legends. It was from these lore's that authors like Lovecraft got their thasselaphobia themes.",AlexJohnsonWrites

Hooray one year. I wish I could smell grass again. I know, sorta out of nowhere that one. Yesterday I talked about missing holidays, today it's grass. Tomorrow will probably be the taste of walls for petes sake.

Seriously though... I miss grass. I remember my brother would make me eat grass all the time. God I hated him...

God I miss him...

Since crashing on this god forsaken asteroid, I've been lucky. Managed to seal up the cockpit AND get the food processor working on day one, day 50 saw me seal the rec hall. Day 74 saw me realize I'm never getting off this rock. This is the first time I'm giving you my solution loggy.

It's been three-hundred-and-sixty-five days. I've been living comfortably for three-hundred-and-fifty-two. I've been thinking of this for two-hundred-and-ninety-one days. I plan on getting a message home.

The rocket is too small to get me off the planet, but it could get itself into interplanetary orbit. I'll set up a small radio transponder to repeat a signal, hook it up to some solar panels, and write a message for my home system. Or maybe I can just send this log...

I know I'm not getting rescued. At this rate I'll die of old age. Hehe these life extenders can't last forever... It's not unheard of to take ones own life in our society. Usually it's humane though. Muscle relaxants. This ship doesn't even have a gun...

screw it. If this log is found, my body is somewhere near the wreckage of the good ship Handeral on a class A asteroid. Highly elliptical orbit, but never gets close enough to the sun to kill me. In fact I think it dips right into the habitable zone.

Send this message back to the Urapizo star system. My brother should still be there. Don't bother with the remains. He doesn't care. I, however, do. Drop them into this star. I've grown accustomed to seeing it rise three times a day and have fallen in love with it. 

And Gordon? I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have gone. You warned me. I don't know why I didn't listen.

This recording was found welded to a small satellite orbiting a small dim star on a scouting mission to the outer systems. The transponder was incredibly weak and hardly heard from the outskirts of the system. The asteroid in question has yet to be located, as is 'Gordon'.

[PM] Huge Sci-Fi fan here. Hard scifi preferred. Let me entertain you.,AlexJohnsonWrites,"The first reports had come in from fishermen in the Bearing Sea fours week earlier. Ships smashed into drift wood, crews missing and phantom sonar signatures. Some made the local news but mostly they were discarded to the dark pages of the web, as a terrible accident at sea.

It wasn’t until the Alaskan town of Seward, south of Anchorage was wiped out overnight that people started taking notice. Rubbed out of existence as if a giant wave had come ashore, the town along with every living soul had vanished, only bare rock remained. The news was filled with lists of the missing, the history of the town. Theories online where a rush, tsunamis, government cover-ups or just the weather but in the background, those who had been watching, waiting had started paying attention, hoping their fears were wrong, that the long secret was rearing its ugly head.

When the Canadian coastal town of Craig met the same fate 6 days later phone calls where made to the Pentagon and Canadian ambassador. Emergency meetings where held at the State department and the White House. The full picture was slowly revealed by a secret few in NASA that had carried the information for so long. The possibility of something else in our oceans, something big. The documents, fuzzy satellite images and unclear sonar readings dated 1968/1974 where passed around the table. The orders where given shortly after and one of the largest movements of domestic military hardware in the history of Canada and US began.

The media had already started spinning stories of monster from the sea, a grainy video recovered from a mobile phone found close to scene of the last attack at Craig showed something coming out of the ocean before being cut off. The movement of military equipment and then evacuation of coastal towns only fuelled the media fire into a storm.

Representatives from NASA, the military, oceanographic institutes and marine biologists helped draw up the plan. Sightings had been confirmed up the coast from the US / Canadian border and the trap was set.

Sonar buoys placed in the Strait of Juan de Fuca near Vancouver pinged away; hoping to draw it closer, it wasn’t long before they confirmed the bait had been taken. The target was moving down the coast toward the Strait that borders both countries. It was now a waiting game. The hardware was moved into position. The navies had manoeuvred within striking range and were running silent. Thousands of troops and hundreds of aircraft prepped.

The morning mist had lifted and the visibility was good. The blue sky was broken only by the trio of F22 fighter jets confirming what the sonar was already showing; a large target moving into the Strait. It was slow, methodical as the strait narrowed the ocean rose and crashed over the shores as the bulk of the creature entered the shallow water. The forces had prepared for this and all had taken the high ground. As it approached Lopez Island it broke the water. A massive large bulk rose up onto the shore as it tried to negotiate the island which blocking it from the pounding sounds in the bay beyond harbouring Vancouver city.  The rhythmic beating of attack helicopter blades murmured in the distance as they slow rose up from their positions.

It heaved up onto the land, already a kilometre in length as more of its grey bloated mass enveloped the island, everything living coming into contact was reduced to a soup as it scared the island clean… that was when the order was given.

“All units open fire!”

Missiles shot from the dozens of Apache attack helicopters and their chain guns roared into life sending 30mm explosive rounds hurtling into the creature. 
The thuds of artillery where barely heard, hiding in the hills surrounding Strait sending shells skyward. On the north side the Canadians on the south the Americans. The best weapons their military has to offer all fired at once. Tanks, artillery pieces, mortars and missiles let lose, showering the creature, now 3 km out of the water, it barely registered the initial impacts as explosions ripped across its body.

The bombardment thundered death, raining it down onto the thing now starting to feel the attack in progress. Tanks fired explosive rounds and armoured piercing shots, huge pieces of flesh blasted into the air with every explosion.
Aircraft roared high above dropping the supersonic JDAMs. Thousands of pounds of high explosive buried into the thing and sent tons of matter into the air but still compared of the hulk easily 3km long by 2km across, now reeling in pain, it was tiny. Jets of all type and descriptions dropped their payloads and then strafed the target with cannon fire.

As the forces from the land and air pummelled it the forces of the sea slowly closed the trap behind. The US 3rd fleet let loose with guided missiles and a handful of experimental rails guns. The creature was now taking fire from all sides and above. It contorted and twisted, trying to avoid the thousands of pin pricks that where starting to take their toll. It rose up into the air toward the north coast, 600m high. Three jets tried to avoid the wall that appeared in their path before they smashed into it. The thing towered above a Canadian detachment of tanks, now desperately trying to move realising what was going to happen. It slammed down onto the coastal cliff they had been station on. Hundreds of thousands of tons of living matter crushed all before it as it swept up the shore line, the ground shook as it turned cutting edge tech into scrap metal. Masses of earth and rock scraped off into the water as the same fate that befell the towns was clear for all to see.

Another appendage raced out at the southern shore toward the American contingent but high above the battle the black silhouettes of four B2 stealth bombers pulled away as their cargo hurtled toward the ground. The two fuel air bombs impacted first, erupting massive supersonic fireballs. They seared and burnt hundreds of meters of flesh in every direction as the two MOAB bombs hit next. They sunk deep in the creatures flesh followed by two titanic blasts, the biggest non-nuclear in the US arsenal. The appendage bulged and rippled as the blast tore it apart from the inside stopping it dead.
The creature arched back clearly wounded as missiles and shells impacted its underside. It struggled to move off the island back toward the water. A dark cloud of more JDAMs dropped by a squadron of B52s hit as they carpet bombed its retreat into the ocean. The island was left bare and barren rock as it slipped into the water, only tons of smoking grey flesh remained, wounds of the torrent of firepower..

The fire continued as it made it way toward the ocean back through the Strait. The awaiting vessels of the 3th Fleet where brushed aside as they tried to block its escape, several destroyers paid dearly as they where pulled under like toys it raced under them to the safety of the deeper ocean. It couldn’t be allowed to escape.

As the creatures speed increased and cut through the deep water 10km out two bursts of compressed air and a high speed whines sounded the launching of two torpedos by one of the many attack submarines that was laying in wait of the coast as the creature approached. The sub made a turn and increased to full speed heading away as the small blips on the sonar made their way toward the massive contact and hit it. The two 45 kiloton nuclear tipped torpedos impacted dead centre and detonated.

The pressure wave ripped through the huge organism, vaporising a massive central part and sent other limp parts floating, lifeless toward the seafloor. A final deafening roar rippled out as the thing succumbed to mankind’s ultimate weapon. On the surface water rocketed into the sky marking the impact and destruction of the ancient life form.

In the situation room thousands of miles away, cheers went up as the images from the satellite confirmed the dual blast. Reports from the submarine approaching confirming the motionless corpse drifting to the ocean floor. Man had been victorious over nature once again.

Many hours after the battle as the remains of the creature had long settled, on the other side of the world the death cry of the creature still travelled the depths as it echoed through the Marianas Trench. Far from any submarine or camera the sound washed over a vast area covered with large objects, they stirred, awoken by the sound of one of their own. 

The long hibernation was broken and after their long sleep they were hungry...",mcwilg

"[WP] A small group of Crusader Knights die gloriously in battle during The Crusades, expecting to be welcomed into heaven. However, they end up in Valhalla.",BannartheBeserker,"He ducked under the swarthy man's clumsy swing, bring his sword pommel up and striking the man in the jaw. The satisfying *pop* and *crack* of shattering bone was drowned out in the sounds of violent battle.

The crusader stepped back, leaving the man stumbling and clutching at his now useless bottom jaw. With a quick thrust, the crusader drove his blade into the man's ribs, piercing flesh and organs and killing the man instantly.

The crusader stepped back, turning to face a new target. The arrow that struck him was forceful, barely missing the protection of his helmet and burrowing deep into his skull. It entered through his left eye, sank deep and stopped at the inside of his helmet.

The crusader dropped to his knees. Then fell forward.

The others could not help him, they fought bravely. Dodging and slashing and thrusting with long blades at the dozens of ambushing enemies. A good fight, a valiant defeat. They would not be remembered as they died in the back alley of Acre, thrust into battle by an enemy that had slipped into the city to open the gates.

The last stood his ground, panting heavily under the heavy armor even in the cool desert night. His sword tip lay in the sand, exhaustion threatening his muscles and limbs. The much lighter Saracen soldiers were not weighed down so heavily, they could dance through battle rather than wade.

Two of them sprang forward to attack. He raised his blade with surprising speed, swiping the first attacker's blade off to his left. Just as smoothly as he had raised the blade he pivoted on one foot and swung it sideways with all the force he could muster. It slid through flesh and bit deep into the gut of the second attacker. Blood poured out and the man screamed in pain.

The crusader tore the blade free, bring it in an upward arc. It cut through the first man's thigh, groin and stomach as it moved, biting only an inch deep but deep enough to spill guts and blood.

""Who else?!"" he roared, raising his blade. His strength waned with the weight, the sweat, the battle. As it did, just for a moment, a figure slipped under an unwieldy strike. A knife flashed a half dozen times in the moonlight, striking in and around the crusader.

It bit under the joints of armor, tearing at his neck, his armpit, the back of his knee, his heel. He stumbled under the flurry of attacks, stepping backward with each blow.

His sword fell to the sand. He dropped to a knee. Blood spilled freely over his sand crusted armor and dirtied cross. He muttered something.

The figure closed in, cautious.

""You die,"" the figure hissed.

""I'm ready to meet my God,"" the crusader said weakly before reaching out with surprising strength and speed for a dying man, ""are you?""

The figure's eyes widened with fear as the crusader held him in a heavy hand, an iron grip, before smacking his helmeted head forward. Bone cracked, blood exploded under the impact.

Together, the two men died on a back street in a city one had never wanted to be in and the other could not leave.

The crusader opened his eyes to a vast green field. His armor was gone, his sword was gone, his wounds were gone. There, waiting for him, were his brothers in arms from the battle. They clapped him on the shoulder on a well fought battle, a good end to any true knight.

""Is this heaven?"" he said, looking at the expansive, beautiful scene before them. A hall of some kind stood in the distance with raucous laughter pouring from it's open doors. The smell of roasted meat filled his nose, mingling with the smell of wine and ale.

A massive man with a beard to match strode to them, standing at least a foot taller than the tallest knight they had ever seen. His shoulders were broad, a long spear resting against one of them. One eye was scarred and an empty socket but the other was bright and his smile was broad.

""Welcome,"" his voice boomed in the glade, ""to Valhalla!""

""Valhalla?""

""Only the greatest death can earn one a place here, a death in glorious battle. You have all earned your place here!""

The crusader that had died last stepped forward to speak but stopped when he saw the figure. She had died with him in that street but now she stood in the glade. He stared at her a moment and then laughed, breaking the thick tension.

""A good death indeed,"" he said, nodding to her.

""Good!"" Odin spoke, gathering them in his massive arms to guide them to the hall, ""there are no enemies here. Only brothers and sisters in blood and steel. Come, eat, drink. Celebrate! Your fight is over...for now.""",jacktherambler
[WP] The god of nightmares has fallen in love with you and tries to confess through terrifying dreams.,Deity_Of_Darkness,"I sit in bed, staring at the wall. The sky blue paint is draped in the shadows of the night, the familiar chips and scratches evading my sight in the dark. My gaze settles on the pot just on my windowsill; a dragon rose I'd plucked no to long ago, the fiery red mixed with the pale white. They were always my favorite flower. 

I take a slow breath in, tugging my blanket around my body. Every night was the same. Waking up in screaming. Days of being exhausted in the waking world only to find myself too terrified to fall asleep.

I breath in, pressing a hand to my chest, feeling my heartbeat. They're just dreams. I can make it through another night to the morning. I allow my eyes to flutter closed, envisioning a picturesque sunrise scattering sunlight across the hills visible through my window. Yes, the morning always comes. There's no need to worry. 

I'm walking through the woods, breathing in the smells of pine needles and late summer flowers. The moonlight illuminated the scattered foliage that covers the ground, glittery greens and browns meeting my eyes. The occasional coo of an owl resonates in my ears. 

I pat my body down, feeling my breathing rapidly increase. My rugged breaths are hard to manage, winding me as I frantically look around. The dark, black silhouettes of trees loom over me, caging me in. I pull at my hair, feeling my scalp sting. This wasn't right. I was just in bed.

I know something is wrong. I know... I'm dreaming. 

Instantly I pause, letting out a gasp and falling to the ground. A dream. None of this is real. So why am I here? Why am I in the woods so late at night? Is there something in my subconscious guiding me to this setting? I press my hand against the rough surface of a tree trunk, tracing each edge and bump with my fingertips. I lean against it, allowing it to support me while I regain my senses. 

Everything feels real. I cast my gaze afar, greeted by a plethora of trees and other forest sights extending outwards as far as I could see. Why? I look down at my body, noting my apparel. Black flats with a pair of jeans and my favorite blue sweater. 

I press away from the trunk, carefully stepping forward and shoving my hands into my hoodie's pocket. I'm greeted with the crunch of leaves under my foot and the faint sounds of crickets in the distance. I would be terrified of being stranded in the woods. But I feel... safe, right now? I press my hand to my temple, kneading my brows and pursing my lips. So strange. The best I can do is walk, I suppose. 

So I keep walking, only able to admire the life like appearance of the forest. The gentle, cool breeze pressing against my neck blew strands of my hair in front of me. The smells tickled my nose and drew me closer to wherever I was headed as they got stronger. The taste of dirt brushed against my tongue as the winds grew stronger and I yawned, hoping to be awake soon. 

And then there it is. A clearing. I perk up, feeling my heartbeat quicken once more. I press onward, stepping into a brisk jog. That had to be something to help me out of this dream. My hood snags on a low hanging tree branch, nearly forcing me into the ground. I grunt, pulling off. No. I needed this. 

I gasp, stepping into the clearing. My eyes desperately search for something to lock on to, falling upon a rose. A single rose. I furrow my brows, stepping back.  A white rose? What is this, Valentine's day? 

Then it happens. Thorns suddenly snag my sides as a bush sprouts out from the nose, vines wrapping around me and cutting into my skin. I try to scream, but no sound comes out. Instead, I'm locked inside the mess of green and red, watching my own blood drip onto blooming roses and streak down the green vines. Moonlight shimmers off the slicked plant. I struggle, only to increase my pain. It stings, burning throughout my whole body. My vision is blurry. Am I finally going to wake up? 

Moonlight reflects off a woman's long, pale white hair, snow-like strands spilling over her shoulders and drifting toward me in the wind. There she watched me, engulfed in bloodied thorns, wiping away her own tears into the night. She smiles, her hands hidden behind her back. Coughing up crimson, I stare, feeling my body shake. How could this nightmare get any worse? 

Her pale hands pull out a rose. A white rose splattered in my blood, painted to look like the one sitting just aside my window. Tears flowing from her eyes, she offers a week smile, extending it forth. 

Then I wake up.

"[WP] Following a chosen deity has real world benefits, much like perks in a videogame. The more obscure gods offer more interesting gifts to those that find them.",Deity_Of_Darkness,"It was a mere expedition into a long-lost tomb discovered into Korea. It was rather dangerous as the rumor of an ancient temple to a forgotten deity who would bestow great power to those who worshiped it was causing tensions with the North and South to escalate again, to the point where the campsite outside the labyrinthine underground structure was completely destroyed by mortar fires from just over the De-Militarized Zone.

I had no choice now but to wander down into the temple with the hope of finding another way out. Now, there was always the possibility of praying to this deity for aid... but I didn't particularly like the idea of asking such creatures for gifts.

Even when exploring the temple I noticed something rather odd... There was no such depictions of it. No artwork, no texts of any kind. No, the images shown on the wall illustrated nothing but destruction, stone towers crumbling on the ground, trees splintered on wood, corpses spread all about. They were also highly-detailed, unlike the age of the temple would suggest, apparently in the same style as the frescoes on the roof of the Sistine chapel.

And wandering through, I felt more light-headed with every moment, as if the walls were coming alive or breaking apart before my eyes before returning to normal. I didn't know if I was going crazy or it was some sort of ancient curse, until I collapsed onto the ground and felt like the strength had left me.

'Require a little aid?' a voice spoke as the walls gave way, leaving me floating in a void of red as I looked up to see the creature before me.

It sat on a throne surrounded by flames, armrests made of bones and the writhing heads of serpents, its body more like the odd mating of a crab and a human. It glared down at me, not of malice but intrigue. 'It's been fifty-thousand years since a human walked through my temple. Other gods must've tried to hide me away... Tell me, why have you entered my hollowed ground?'

'Well, I didn't have a choice, since some crazy bastards fire-bombed my camp,' I said to him. 'Sorry, but if you're looking for a worshiper then I'm the wrong man. I'm just looking for a way out.'

'At least you're frank,' the deity said as a dragon flew before it, when he grabbed it out of the air and shattered its spine within his palms before a chalice appeared before him, forming itself out of lava. 'Ever drink the blood of a dragon? Can bestow the strength of ten elephants to a human and you appear to need it.'

I didn't know precisely what to say as the cup appeared before me so I just cautiously drank the sickeningly green drink. Almost immediately I felt revitalized, a strength completely unfamiliar to me. 'What the hell?'

'Gods ask for worship and devotion in exchange for gifts, correct?' he asked me. 'Sorry, it's been a while since last I've done this. Anyway, I don't bestow gifts freely to anyone, just those who I consider... Interesting.'

I merely gulped when I heard that. 'Oh, no,' I groaned. 'The last time a deity chose to gift me for being ""Interesting"", I spent a century reliving the same day and being pestered by a groundhog. Utter cunt, that one.'

'Oh, I hate the Outsider as well,' the deity said to me. 'But I'll make this straightforward, instead of him. I'm a deity of war and conquest with a difference. While most gods of my type want followers who will form an army... I want a true champion, one that can never be defeated, can never be stopped, an unconquerable strength... Maybe even immortal.'

I scoffed at the idea. 'Those who seek immortality are doomed to failure. Also, I'm a pacifist - never enjoyed the idea of killing.'

'Even if your life depends on it?' the deity asked. 'Because right now, it does - you need my blessings in order to escape from this temple, I need someone to free me from this prison realm...'

I was wary, of course. If other deities had banded together to seal this entity away, just how dangerous was he? 'And those murals on the walls?'

'The actions of my last high priest,' he said willingly. 'I'll give you a rather impressive form of free reign. Want to conquer a country, take countless concubines or slaughter a city for fun? No problem. But when I give you a task, say every... two, three hundred years, ***I expect it to be done***.'

I sighed, a moment of weakness. 'What must I do?' I asked.

'There's a ruby dagger deep within this labyrinth,' the deity stated. 'Ram it into your heart to break the seal.'

Reality shifted back to normal, leaving me in a stone hallway. I soon found myself marching with a newfound rigor, climbing deeper into the earth until I found an altar with the weapon in question.

'This isn't a dagger,' I commented as I saw it. 'It's a fucking Buster Sword. It's bigger than me...'

Nonetheless, I picked up the weapon then held the tip to my chest. Even though I couldn't see him, I knew the deity was watching me carefully, hoping for the moment when the seal was broken. 'You had better not have lied to me,' I said to him before pushing it in through a rib.

'And why would I do that?' the deity asked as he appeared before me, grabbing the hilt of the blade and my shoulder before ramming it deeper in. 'Henceforth this very moment I, Cyttorak, proclaim you my champion, forever more... a juggernaut!'

I cried out in pain as I saw the blood pouring out from my body, a geyser which soon began to pool onto the ground. Even in a delirious state I knew that there wasn't enough blood in the human body for me to stand to my knees in, but before I knew what else to say, I had fainted onto the ground.

"[WP] Following a chosen deity has real world benefits, much like perks in a videogame. The more obscure gods offer more interesting gifts to those that find them.",Deity_Of_Darkness,"When I came to, the blood had completely disappeared. I gave only deep breaths as I rolled onto my back. I tried to reach down, feeling the hole in my chest before seeing that it wasn't there anymore. And as I looked down, I saw precisely why.

'It's been so long since I've shaped a mortal's flesh before,' Cyttorak said while sitting atop the altar. 'Normally I'm afraid of going too far in terms of enhancements but with you... Oh, I am so grateful to be free from the crimson realm I decided to go all-out.'

I staggered back as the scale of my gigantic frame became clear to me. Huge pectorals, magnificent slabs on my gut and hulking arms hanging from my shoulders were all evident upon me. And from when I was last awake in this room, I knew instantly that I had also been made taller as well. 'What is... What have you *done* to me?!'

'You could say it's an ascension,' Cyttorak told me. 'Or promotion. Either way, there is no equal to you now. Anyway, I have to ensure that my own personal corner of Pandemonium hasn't been taken by some weaker god. I'll speak to you later.'

'Wait!' I said as I stopped Cyttorak from disappearing. 'What am I to do now?'

'You need me to explain it again?' he asked me. 'Whatever you want. Go have a coffee somewhere or crush an army. I don't care. Although...'

'Huh?' I asked.

'You could start by getting out of here,' he said. 'But I wouldn't recommend overthinking it. You are the unstoppable force now.'

Then he disappeared, leaving me to wander along the halls of this maze of a temple.

Soon, I found myself within a large room which I assumed had to be a private bathing area. The water was still but free of contamination of any kind, a perfect mirror for me in this time. I managed to get a better look at myself like this.

I hadn't even noticed the helmet I was wearing, covering my head completely but also surrounding the muscles of my neck and upper frame. On my shoulders were thick pauldrons which struggled to hide the sinery fibers which fed my strength, and on my wrists were leather-and-steel gloves which groaned as I balled my hands into a fist.

In fact, I was entirely covered in thick leather, which had a reptilian quality. It hugged my powerful frame, somehow restricting my body from tearing itself free through an equal amount of effort and strength. And on my feet, laceless leather boots that went all the way up to my knees, somehow worn into despite myself never seeing them before.

I turned out of the room with no reason to stay, soon stomping down the halls of this temple. The sense of scale began to hit me, as before I wasn't even tall enough to stand even halfway up the wall, now I was crouching down to even fit inside. If I wasn't wrong then I'd have to have grown to... twelve, maybe fifteen feet in height?

I was so caught up in speculation that I didn't even notice the wall until I kicked it in. I gasped in shock as the thick bricks, as large as a human's torso, fell down all around, including on my toes without even hurting. For a moment I was shocked, staggering back wildly as I saw what had just happened...

And the next thing I knew, I was punching the walls beside me down to allow my hulking frame to move more freely in these confining halls.

For the first time since I came in here, I smiled. I did so while crouching down, one foot behind the other and both hands on the ground with fingers spread out. I didn't know if I looked more at home at the Olympic running tracks or weightlifting competition.

And I was then in a full sprint down the hall, footprints cracked into the stone with each step. It didn't matter to me anymore if I was too tall for this hallway, I was digging into it and pushing it around me like it was a cloud of fog.

The walls didn't mean anything to me anymore. At first I was fearful of running into them at such speeds, holding my arms in front of me as protection. But soon my bravery and confidence rose enough to lower them and I was then running head and chest-first through each failed excuse of a barrier.

I was quite surprised when I was suddenly in daylight again, having ran through the entire maze in about 10 minutes. I looked around my campsite to see the people there - researchers, priests, soldiers sent as escorts - all accounted for. All slaughtered by the mortar fire.

I didn't truly feel this sensation at the time. At first I thought it was grief, maybe even anger. It could've been fury or sadness, or melancholy.

But no. It was desire. Not just a desire to crush those who murdered my friends, a desire to crush everything they held dear. Their ideals, their very concept of self-worth, of joy.

And as I began my march north, I knew precisely what to do. Even though I said I was a pacifist, Cyttorak would love the irony of what I was about to do. Was he influencing my mind through this power? Was he pushing me to do this?

I didn't know, and to be honest I didn't care. In fact, I doubt he had any involvement in this decision. I was going to conquer North Korea and there was no-one that could stop me.",res30stupid

"[WP] Following a chosen deity has real world benefits, much like perks in a videogame. The more obscure gods offer more interesting gifts to those that find them.",Deity_Of_Darkness,"If enough people believe, they are real. But the interesting detail is, the fewer that do believe in a particular deity the more benefits they receive in return for their fealty.

Because of that first rule, there are a LOT of Gods and spirits and really really powerful VIP things out there. From Lovecraftian Elder Gods, to popular myths from history, to whatever marketing gimmicks gained enough support to essentially be ascended to Godhood.

And because of the second rule there are a LOT of individuals who make it their purpose to uncover or even invent extremely rare and obscure Gods in order to worship them and enjoy the membership perks. Even more odd than this, too much faith in a God would lead to their extinction. It's become no different than popular fashion or trending styles. They get popular, then they die.

If I were to be a God, I would choose to be one of those ""situational"" ones. They are best prepared to survive for a long time since certain situations would always happen, but not so much they risk over reaching. Like the God of Bad Breakups, for example. That God is always assured offerings of tear soaked tissues and cut up photographs, and will always hear the heartbroken pleas ""God I miss them so much, why did they do this!?"" and so on.

And if you want an example of a bad God to be, look no further than the meme pantheon. The lifespans of those poor things can be measured in minutes sometimes. They're either dead on arrival or they are used up when their message goes viral and everyone references it for everything.

""I know.  It's a big choice, man; I'm just giving it some thought.  That's why I called you.  I want to bounce some ideas off you.""

Dedication was a serious thing, after all.  First dedications are even more so, since the fresh devotion gives extra perks.  Steve watched a lot of his friends in high school squander their firsts to the obvious ones: Bacchus, Aphrodite, Hercules (demigod, but amazingly popular), and the like.

""OK, shoot.  I'm listening.""

""Well, I'm in my late 30's, so party gods are out.  Not to mention what happens to them.""  While the rare follower of Venus or Dionysus ended up being a model or celebrity, those are the most dedicated; typically they end up being strippers, whores, or strung-out junkies.

""Well, you've always loved animals.  Why not a nature god?  Green Man and Artemis...""

""One, I'm not 'into' animals, I just like my pets.  Two, Artemis would kill me-I've got balls, remember?""

""Oh yeah, super man-hatey.  Well, mercs make good money.  Ever thought of that?  What about Lugh?""

""Lugh?  He's spread so thin with the Fomorii-worshippers taking up arms he can barely keep the Garda supported.  Plus, I'm not Irish.""  Lugh Lamhfada had become instantly popular amongst the Irish, but that train pretty much passed after the first thousand or so devotees ended up with the wit and all the wishes the god of leprechauns (among many things) had to offer right out of the gate.  Now, he's sort of the official god of protection and warfare for the Irish and Scottish.

""Well, let's narrow it down some more.  I'm no good at medicine, so we can count out the Dagda and Asclepius.""

""What about wealth?  Hermes and Pluto are pretty popular.""  They were, too; Hermes' worshippers invariably ended up investment brokers or high-dollar sales and consultants.  Small wonder that a statue of Hermes has been in nearly every major focus of commerce since the 1600s.

""Have you ever seen a Hermes worshipper that's really happy though?"" Steve asked.

""...no, can't say I have.  Not unless they're on the move or making a deal.""

""Yeah, that's not me.  I like what I've got right now.  The job is good, and I'm putting away a nice bit of cash.""

""Well, there's still Pluto.  How awesome would it be to be a CEO?  Or a spy!""

""Ugh.  Have you seen what worshipping him does?  Zuckerberg looks like a goddamn goblin now.  Sure, money and secrets, but it warps you.  No thanks.""

""Well, what?  Egyptian?  Hindu?""

""Nah, those are too mainstream; they'll be spread too thin.  I'm thinking, if I do dedicate-""

""*When* you dedicate.""

""-it'll be to someone smaller.""

""Well, how about Zoroastrinism?  Ahura Mazda and the Amesha Spentas seem to do their followers pretty well.  Plus, immunity to fire!  Aaaand, I think you'd be a great cop; you're honest, and the whole 'good thoughts, good words, good deeds' bit seems right up your alley.""  Unsurprisingly, Ahura Mazda and the spentas have gained quite a bit of popularity recently, with the influx of corruption charges from police forces and the big corporations; having what amounts to an incorruptible cop or compliance officer on the payroll really smoothes  things over.  Plus, you get most charges dropped for vigilantism if you can prove your good standing in the faith in court.

""Mmmm, yeah, but have you seen the absolution ritual?  Scary as fuck.  And to be honest, branding isn't my thing.""

""Well shit, Steve!  We're already on the fringes here.  Who do we have left, Pikkiwokki?  You want to be a goat-shifter and have endless pigs?  The fuck do you want out of a god?""

""Well, here's the thing.  I've watched people make shitty choices when they're young, and regretted it.  Some people, I've seen dedicate out of fear: fear of danger or pain, fear of financial ruin, fear of being alone, or just afraid of being left out.  But 'm not really afraid of any o those things.  I mean, I've got a good job, a nice enough house-""

""Yeah, but look how *hard* you've had to work compared to other people!  Think how much easier things would be for you if you did pick a god!  You're an account-why not just worship Apollo and get all that wisdom?  Or Thoth?""

""I suppose I've never really felt like I needed a god, you know?  I'm happy with my own accomplishments.  I don't need Hercules or anything like that, because sports and fighting aren't interesting to me.  I'm content.""

""Oh c'mon man.  Everyone likes a leg up.  Shit, even criminals get some us out of Loki.""

""I just don't feel like I need them.  I've done it all on my own up to now, and I'm just as happy with my life as anyone else.  Maybe, I'm even happier *because* I did it on my own.  I suppose,  I suppose though...""

""Yeah?""

""I suppose I believe in myself.""  And with that, Steve vanished before his friend's eyes.",echisholm

'We bring you in for a ""Delicate"" archaeological dig and you take an unknown god's power and conquer North Korea?!'

'Well, it could've gone a whole lot worse,' I said to him. 'Imagine if the deity chose a North Korean.'

'I enjoy homicide and wanton slaughter, maybe the enslavement of a good thousand people, but I have *some* standards,' Cyttorak said to me. 'Mindless sycophants? I want some independent thought in my champion.'

'I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH WORSE IT COULD BE!' Arnoldson yelled, the sweat beading on his ebony skin. 'You invaded another country, systematically destroyed its central command and you ripped them apart with your bare hands! All except Kim who you punted to fucking Tokyo! And we only know it's him because of DNA testing.'

'How'd you get his DNA?' I asked.

'His dead half-brother in Malaysia,' Arnoldson said. 'That's not the point! Did you even consider what would happen with China or Russia? They believe you did this under United States orders. Did you even think of the consequences?!'

'Uh... Actually, this power clouds my judgement,' I explained. 'I was overcome with rage and... It's an effect of this.'

'Oh, so it's a symptom?' Arnoldson asked. 'Is another symptom the desire to march into Beijing or even Moscow? Are you thinking of punting them as well or just crushing them under your big, fat feet?!'

'Actually, the idea of doing just that is creeping into my mind with every second and I'm trying with all my might to *not* consider doing just that,' I said to him sternly. 'I asked you to come here because I need to focus on doing the right thing, so will you *please* help me in unifying the North and South before I do something stupid? And *don't* get the CIA involved?'

'Yeah, I'll get as much help as possible,' Arnoldson said. 'Only because I know if I leave you alone for two fucking minutes, you'll balls that up!'

He grabbed whatever he could get his hands on - a broken piece of concrete - and hurled it right at my face. It struck hard and true upon the metallic hull surrounding my head, causing a muted ringing within.

I sighed, stood at full height and cracked my knuckles as I glared down at Arnoldson. 'I want to make three things perfectly clear,' I said angrily to him. 'One; I've been transformed into a giant, from five foot four and one hundred and twenty pounds to sixteen feet and just over five tonnes. Two; There is video footage of me taking mortar and gun fire to the chest as well as hurling a fifty-three floor building weighing around two-hundred and fifty-thousand tons, although that's just my estimate. Three; The deity that gave me this power - his name is Cyttorak - advocates that I single-handedly rape, pillage and burn to bring the entire world into my iron-fisted rule and has altered my personality accordingly as well as given me the power to do so. I still don't know yet if he's given me magical power but given the size of the US military, he'll probably find it fun to send me to fight my own people, and if he does tell me to do so *I can't stop myself*. So keep those in mind the next time you think you suddenly have the right to belittle and abuse me. Although I won't kill you.'

'And what will you do?' he asked in a sarcastic tone.

I rammed my fist into the ground mere inches away from him, my face now right next to his. 'I'm going to beat you like a runaway slave,' I whispered harshly to him. 'Nice and slow.'

I didn't just pull my arm out of the crater I made, I instead swung it upwards to dig as much of the earth up as I could before standing up, the debris landing all around. I then stood at full height before I began to walk away, to Arnoldson's confusion. 'Where are you going?!' he demanded.

'Like I said, I'm compelled to rape, pillage and burn,' I said to him. 'I'm trying to keep that in line so I need to have women crawling over me and such.'

He and his entourage were left confused, praying to their gods and whatnot. I, however, was again being pestered by the astral shadow of Cyttorak.

'You're lying to him,' he accused me. 'It's not an addiction to do so, you're avoiding responsibilities. The same reason why you're heading to the Kim's private pool.'

'He doesn't have to know that,' I said with a smirk.",res30stupid

"[WP] Following a chosen deity has real world benefits, much like perks in a videogame. The more obscure gods offer more interesting gifts to those that find them.",Deity_Of_Darkness,"When I met her, she proposed a very intriguing deal. I don't know much about the devil or any of that spirituality bullshit people are starting to believe with every day passing, but if the devil is real, she most likely is it.

""Anything?"" I asked.

""Precisely."" she answered.

Maybe I should had said no. But can you blame me? Who would've said no? What person in its right minds would say no to a half-deity telling you that anything you wish can be made a reality if you are smart about it. Sure, it was not that simple and of course there was a catch but for a brief moment I felt everything is now possible. 

People have all kind of gods and they worship them in various forms. Some build temples and some go in exile and dedicate themselves to them. Some do it in secret while others try to gather huge masses of followers. There are stories, most considered just legends, of people who achieved great things in life by having the right god. But nothing is certain and nothing was ever proved. Recently a teenage said she's able to speak 26 languages because he found the one true god and his faith was rewarded. Over night, thousands of follower started to worship it and yet, no one managed to get rewarded. One won the lottery the next week but people are skeptic about it being a reward. I never believed any of this. One of the few people who just had no faith at all.

""And what do I have to pay in return?""

""I require nothing of you. This is not a fairy tale. There are no souls for me to collect or underworlds where I can capture you once you die.""

""I don't believe you.""

""No reason not to. I am unable to lie. My very existence is conditioned by me always telling the truth. Especially when I am bounded. I am not part of your world, merely a manifestation from a different plane of existence. The only thing that keeps me anchored to your world is the truth. The moment I lie I turn into nothingness. A random thought going through someone mind just to slip away moments later, forever to be lost.""

""Why would you help me, then? What do you have to win?""

""I want to go home. Escape this world. Alone I am unable to. With help, I might succeed. But I require nothing for you.""

""Where is home?""

""Not here. Not in this universe. Is not a place I can describe especially with your  way of communication.""

""Why choose me?""

""I don't choose with whom do I bound but I need to always bound to someone. I stay alive when I link with a living being. When one dies, I link to another. Again. And again. They solidify the anchor I keep in this world thus keeping me alive. And now I bounded to you. Before you, was a cat. Despite what some of you believe, they have just one life. Hers was over.""

In hindsight, it took me a long while to realise what the right questions were, what I should have asked from the beginning. I did forced myself in a blind spot and she took advantage of that. That was her plan from the early beginning. I choose to believe what I wanted to believe without questioning anything. I stumbled right into her trap. 

""James Adam Weghner, you are accused of arson, impersonating a police officer, kidnapping, torture and acts of terrorism against the state. How do you plead?""

""Guilty, your honor.""

What were the right questions to ask, right there in the beginning? I should had asked how can she return home. And the answer would had been once the last soul in the universe is gone. I should had asked why she doesn't need me to help her and the answer would had been that through us she is more than capable of helping herself. Is not like she can go around and ask people kindly to wipe all the living beings off the face of this planet. Always telling the truth doesn't mean what I thought it meant. I learned a lesson; sadly it won't help me anymore in life. There are so many truths to any given problem. She knew what truth to pick in order to allure and manipulate. It's hard to find an individual strong enough to wipe the entire human race. But she has an eternity and she does it with small steps. I was never a bad person but I became one of her steps. So many died. All I wanted was to travel through the universe. She promised that she can help me with that. We can build the technology to do it. Never did she lied. All she said was true but she relied on my flaws as a human, she relied on my mistakes and she relied on me being blind to her nefarious ways. What is getting a bit of info through illegal means when the purpose is so great. What is stealing something once you already stumped someones privacy. And kidnapping someone that would expose you feels like the right thing to do, in the right circumstances. Killing is easy when someone is whispering that this would make things easier for the next step of the plan. Of course, it would make it harder further along the road but the next steps were easier. So many died.

""Jamed Adam Weghner you're hereby sentenced to the death penalty. You are remanded into custody, who will deliver you to the National Department of Corrections. The death penalty will be carried immediately. This decision is final and irrevocable. May the gods have mercy of your soul.""

"[WP] Following a chosen deity has real world benefits, much like perks in a videogame. The more obscure gods offer more interesting gifts to those that find them.",Deity_Of_Darkness,"In the days, long ago, before the three white sun stars erupted into nuclear entropy, consuming their entire galaxy, there had lived billions of small, sentient creatures. The creatures varied, from self aware, compassionate or destructive, to beings which felt, but did not search for purpose. Before their worlds had been instantly incinerated these simple beings lived in constant struggle, not only with each other, but also with the inanimate means on which they required to survive. 


Few of them could communicate with us, what many of the creatures would refer to as “gods”, and the ones who had tapped into the cosmic radiation, conversing with, and adoring us were looked upon with a queer sort of fondness. We had, for these special creatures, the type of affection which reflected that of the human’s who had acquired animal companions of a lesser intelligence. But the humans were fickle, and unwise, as we observed some denied affection and instead sought to inflict abomination upon other creatures, so the same was the relationships between some humans and their gods. 


When a human was capable of receiving the affections of a god they were imparted with a gift. The gifts they received took no physical form, instead they were astounding feats. One human had been given the gift to spread open seas and oceans, given to him by the god who found solace in the river Nile of the human’s home planet. He had saved the boy as a baby, tossed into the dangerous waters, his cries immediately spoke to this god, who followed him through his life, leading him to free the poor and enslaved. 


One of the gods who favored earth often deceived the humans who favored him. He had become greedy, like the humans, and in turn became lustful towards their ways. His worshipers could often find themselves impregnated by him. He would disguise himself and force himself upon the young and beautiful, and eventually came to father many demigods. These humans had strength, intelligence, and bravery far beyond that of the typical human. These extraordinary being became the catalyst for the evolution of mankind, for better or for worse. 


But the most interesting of tales is that of a human who found his ability to communicate with the most unlikely of us. A boy named Dexter, Dexter Douglas. His interest in all things odd and bizarre were magnified by his love of technology, at the dawning of the age of information for the human’s. His oddities and strange behaviors made him a favorite of the god called Freak. Because Dexter so loved and praised Freak he made for him one day a sacrifice. 


This sacrifice was not of flesh, or food, nor was it in song or praise, but in code, typed into a computer. ""@[=g3,8d]\&amp;fbb=-q]/hk%fg"" - this magnificent sequence of illegible characters, which flowed from the fingers of the young boy, who desperately yearned for the approval of his chosen god were so very stunning to the god Freak that he could contain himself no more. 


He had taken the boy into the multiverse and bestowed upon him gifts of speed, agility, strength, and above all else an all encompassing knowledge of every item of information which had been submitted to the ether of the internet. 


He so loved his god that he took it upon himself to right all the wrongs which were being carried out against the good and the worshipers of Freak. He was the champion of the “freaks”, “weirdos” and “failures”.  He, being reborn through his god created for himself a new identity, by witch those whom he saved could call out in gratitude and praise in thanks.  They called him Freakazoid. ",ashfrorenfro

Cheesecake me."" Kevin snapped his fingers and a slice of blueberry cheesecake appeared in his palm. He gobbled it down. ""That's my fifth slice tonight."" 

""No cooldown huh? Guess I should convert. Zeus offers a lightning strike wherever you want, but only one per month."" Fred tossed Kevin his phone. ""Hook me up?"" 

""What would you even use that for?"" Kevin asked, punching Matton's name into the contacts list. He hit a dropdown menu and scrolled down. Friends, family, acquaintance, current god. There it is.

""You wore that freaky emo makeup. I'm glad you grew out of that phase."" Kevin looked through the files on his phone. ""Yeah I still have that pic of you kicking Mr. Evanson."" 

""It wasn't a phase. I was actually depressed. So much that I don't know what I would've done without the internet. I hated my dad. I hated my mom. I had no friends. So I spent all day on a forum with kids like me. And we found Belun."" Pauline's voice quivered as she recounted her past. 

""So what did a bunch of emo kids find? Was he some sort of murder god? Parent controller? Human sacrificer?"" Kevin shrank back.

"[WP] The High Priestess, glowering at you with every piece of annoyance she can muster, informs you of a prophecy delivered earlier today: Apparently the fate of the world depends on her falling in love with you. She ...doesn't approve.",Dracon_Pyrothayan,"I've handled rejection enough times in my life not to be too bothered by it now. People have their own tastes, whatever. We both move on and that's that. I've been at the old dating apps, swiping left liberally and getting one or two matches per week. I never thought I'd actually match with ""Quadira"". Eccentric name, I thought to myself, that's fun. Her pictures had her glowing with incredible teeth and bronzed hair cascading down her shoulders. Her bio didn't have much, and none of her other social medias were linked. I thought she might have been a bot or something, but I sent her a 'hey' nonetheless. No reply. Thought that was the end of it.

It didn't immediately click that she was connected with the three hooded monks that broke into my house at eleven at night. It didn't click until they took the blindfold off me half-an-hour later to reveal her sitting on a mammoth, jewelled throne, both arms stretched along the throne's arms to expand and exaggerate her presence. She had a face like she just took a hefty bite from a lemon as she explained the ""prophecy"" and conclude that she wasn't impressed with me. 
""Right."" I said, my eyes feeling like dumbbells were hooked to the bottom of them, ""Did I fall asleep without noticing? Is this a really deep dream?"" I looked around at the twenty-so monks circling her and me in the domed, golden...cathedral? ""Did I eat some cheese or something?"" Quadira looked displeased.
""Your charisma and wit was foretold throughout generations."" she announced, her voiced echoing and bouncing around us, ""Since neither of these traits coincide with you, this planet shall now suffer.""
I scoffed, scratching the crown of head to relieve this annoying itch that started. ""Alright, love. The world don't revolve around you.""
""No."" she quickly snapped back, ""The world revolves around the sun of Sol, which hangs in the universal balance of which I control. And the fate of this world, as with many others, hung on your shoulders.""
I found this quite amusing for a dream. I played along and shrugged. ""You could always not?""
""Excuse me?"" Quadira slowly questioned, her tone reeking with detest.
""I mean, like...you could always not destroy the world. If you just need someone to give you the old one-two, you can meet someone in a club, or...""
""The prophecy specified it was you"" Quadira cut in. She peered down to one of the monks and ordered, ""Cleric White. Recite.""
One monk stood forward, his face hidden behind the shadows of his hood. His voice was deep and gravelly, probably in his early 50s. From the sound of him, I'd guess he'd read audiobooks or bingo call on the weekends. He announced; ""The stars of High Priestess Quadira and Lord Michael of Bolton will align through the cosmic connection of Tinder. They will create a universal bond that will fill the universe with peace and safety. Should the bond break, shall will life.""
I pouted my bottom lip out in an impressed manner. ""Alright."" I said, slipping out a yawn, ""What's wrong then? Why can't the cosmic bond be-""
""The universal bond made through the cosmic connection."" Cleric White corrected. 
I turned to him, holding a hand up to him and raising my eyebrows. ""Alright, mate. Simmer down."" I turned back to Quadira and sunk into my trouser pockets. ""What's wrong with me, then? Might as well tell me, nobody else will.""
""Cleric White,"" Quadira boomed again, ""Read the opening approach.""
""Hey."" Cleric White announced, turning slightly to Quadira, ""The High Priestess should note no capitalisation not punctuation was used.""
""Oh, fuck me."" I moaned, my eyes rolling and dragging the rest of my head with them, ""That's it? What is this, the yearly gathering of the grammar Illuminati Nazis?""
""Your general demeanour, manner and smell also could be more favourable.""
Of course the smell's not favourable, I thought. Bloody dragging me out at eleven at night, not giving me a chance to shower. I sighed, rubbing the bridge of my nose.
""I'm an alright person once you get to know me. I mean...I like football, I like a drink. I like Spain. ELO. What about you? What're you into?""
She looked down at me, the look of disgust fading from her face, melting into one of bemusement. An expression I saw before when my sister's hamsters fell off its running wheel. She answered, ""I like overlooking the universe and destroying planets when suitors aren't acceptable.""
""Right."" I said, nodding. It felt like talking to a living bomb. ""How about...y'know, NOT doing that...just yet? I mean, if it's all on me...which is an honour, by the way, uh...yeah, thanks for that. But...y'know, we can test the waters or something first?""
She raised an eyebrow in interest. If I could win over a high priestess and save the world in one go, that'd be great.

[WP] Your neighbor wages war against noises only she can hear. Her weapon is a stick and a chime that the rest of the neighborhood can definitely hear.,Dracon_Pyrothayan,"I sighed, looking at the time on my phone. About a quarter to 10 p.m... My neighbor, the Widow Rawlins.. Usually she came out and did her whole thing earlier than this, always stopped before 10 p.m. which was the earliest I or anyone in the neighborhood could make noise complaints.. Believe me we've checked..

I stepped outside for a cigarette figuring I wasn't going to get to sleep until she was done anyhow. Also she was amusing to watch sometimes.

She was carrying some sort of rough-hewn stick or staff of some sort... And a chime that she would hit with the staff every few steps. As she passed close I could heard hear her usual muttering as always about how..

""..We have to beat the sounds, the sounds that sound now, and until an hour hence.."" 

(Might edit this as or after I smoke a cigarette irl)  

Susie Rogers from a few houses down told me once while we were smoking a joint together, she told me, ""Danny, stay away from the Widow Rawlins... She's a witch.""

She'd collapsed in a fit of giggles after the last word but a chill finger had run down my spine..

Of course, Steve Hawke from across the street told me that he heard the old lady was just schizophrenic and forgot to take her meds sometimes. I puffed contemplatively on my cigarette and considered asking her if maybe she needed help. I didn't want to alarm her though.

She crouched down behind my trash can, her eyes wild and nostrils flaring..",WeAllFloatGeorgie
"[CW] Repeat the first or several paragraphs for several times, with only a few changes. At the end paragraph, explain what happened that causes the loops.",MyNameIsNotClyde_,"“WAKE UP!” Fleur screeched, terror twisting her voice until it was nearly unrecognizable. “Demon Swarm!”

I flung myself to my feet, my sword in my hand before I was fully aware of what was happening. There was a sea of diminutive creatures closing in on us. Their red eyes shining out of the writhing mass of their dark bodies. Fleur tried to run towards us, she had been the last watch of the night, and sat a little away from the camp fire, but in seconds the swarm was on her.  She struggling against their clawing hands, batting the demons away with her staff.

I charged towards her, past the still sleeping forms of Bram, and Tulli, wondering for the briefest of moments how they could have slept through the roar of demons, and our shouts.  I swung my sword, slicing through several of the tiny creatures, their bodies dissolving like smoke.   It stung my eyes and my lungs as I breathed it in, like burning hot peppers.  I coughed, trying to reach Fleur, trying to buy the others time to rouse.

I was nearly at her side, when they pulled her under, the dark mass of their bodies surging over her like a wave.  I cried out in rage, but I couldn’t hear my own voice, the noiseless sound tearing at my throat.

They were at my feet, the others were gone too. They were all dead. Surely, surely, I would follow.   The smoke of their destroyed bodies closed in on me, burning at my eyes, my nose, my mouth, making it impossible to see or breath.  I swung my  blade blindly. Feeling no resistance.  They pulled at my feet, my cloak, pulling me under. 

There was only pain.  I was nothing. There was only nothing. 

“WAKE UP!” Fleur screeched her warning.  “Demon Swarm!”

I flung myself to my feet. My heart beating hard and fast against my chest.  My sword was already in my hand. The sea of demons surging towards our small hunting party. Their clicking voices like locusts in the darkness. I ran towards Fleur. She was sitting apart from the rest of us, the last watch of the night.  There hadn’t been time to warn us quietly, for us to regroup. The writhing mass of dark bodies was overtaking her already, their hooked claws pulling at her dress.  Her pale face was shining with determination as she batted them away with the butt of her staff.

“Bram!” I called towards my companion, hoping for their aid. How were they still sleeping? This swarm was as loud as a hurricane.  My sword sliced through the mass of bodies, the severed pieces billowing into a thick smoke that blinded and burned when it wafted into my face. “Help us!” The words were a cough in my throat.

Fleur reached out to me, falling to her knees.  In a moment she was gone.  The swarm billowing up over her, and then surging smoothly towards me. They were on me, their claws tearing into my flesh. I struggled against them, my blade clattering to my feet. Pain burning through me.

Blackness enfolded me, as stifling as dreamless sleep.

“WAKE UP!” Fleur screamed, her voice breaking in panic.

I was on my feet again. The blade in my hand.  The swarm was closing in on us, an iris that was about to snap shut.  I threw myself on Bram and Tulli, the dwarves that slept hand in hand.  “Help us!” I screamed at them, seizing Tulli about the shoulders and shaking her. She was a powerful mage, only she could save them now. Tulli’s eyes slid open but I could only see the whites of them.  Her face was slack and empty.

“Bram!” I shouted, dropping Tulli and moving to her companion. “Bram!” Fleur screamed long and high pitched.  I looked, but she was already gone.  The demons were upon us. They were tearing my flesh apart.  Fire and salt in my wounds.



Tulli’s face was twisted up in pain as she turned away, unable to watch her friends live and die and live again, blood dripped freely from her nose. “I can’t hold it!” Her voice was stiff, nearly silent. Bram’s hands fumbled shakily over the bottles in his hand. Desperate molotov cocktails rigged in the space of just a few minutes. 

The demons had attacked days before, and Tulli had bumped the two of them ahead in time, but now their friends were trapped in a pocket dimension, dying endlessly. They had to break the loop, and do it now, before Fleur and Eli went mad. Already they had spent days looking for their friends. Already the two of them were deviating with each loop, aware of their torment

Bram lit the alcohol soaked bits of cloth, standing with two in each hand.  “Okay!” he shouted at his love, his eyes filled with tthe burning window into a different time.  They didn’t know what would happen when she punched through, broke the loop, but they had to try.

"[CW] Repeat the first or several paragraphs for several times, with only a few changes. At the end paragraph, explain what happened that causes the loops.",MyNameIsNotClyde_,"My eyes met those of the stern-faced man before me, his frown showing beneath his thick beard as his eyes narrowed almost to the point of closing. I leaned back in my chair, resting one foot atop another, attempting to radiate calmness. Inside, my mind was twisting about itself in panic and terror. The confrontation was risky. I blinked, longer than one usually would, trying to subdue my inner chaos. The man's gravelly voice rose amidst the silent room, his towering bodyguards watching noiselessly from either side of the table as I gulped nervously.

""The deal's off."" I tried to push my chair back from the table, but something blocked its path. A body. A huge body whose muscles tried desperately to burst from their constraining clothing. The bodyguard had moved behind me silently, without making a single sound to alert me to his presence. Before I could utter a word, his hands, wider than both of my arms pressed together, wrapped around my neck. There was a pulsing, a sound louder than any I had heard. My heartbeat. It faded, as did the world. Everything became black.

Blackness was all that was. Then, suddenly, the world returned in a breathtaking flood, leaving my breath caught in my throat.

My wide eyes met those of the stern faced man before me, I knew his frown showed beneath his thick beard as I watched his eyes narrow to slits. I leaned forward, resting my head in my hands. The world spun. I blinked, a long blink to try to reshuffle my thoughts and realign them in some sort of sensible way.

""The deal's off."" I tried to rise, to run from that room. A body blocked my way. It pushed my shoulders down so that I was slumped on the chair once more, holding me there. Before I could utter a word, the man had pulled back his massive fist and thrust it forward, sending a fiery burst of pain flaring from my nose and leaving me spiralling into darkness. The sound of a blade being unsheathed echoed in the darkness. Everything became black.

Blackness was all that was, encasing and absorbing me entirely. Then, in an instant, the world returned in an icy wave of cold reality, leaving my eyes clenched shut.

Once forced open, my eyes met those of the stern faced man before me. I barely noticed the frown that graced his mouth or the glaring of his eyes. I leaped upward, shoving the table towards him, it impacted with a sharp clunk. The stunned man shouted a wordless cry, jumping backward and away from me. Before I could utter a word, there was the feeling of cold steel at my throat. No mercy was given to me. I felt the warmth of my life force spill onto my shirt, drenching and ruining it. Everything became pain and black.

Blackness was all that was, drowning and dissolving me, leaving none of my self-hood behind. I was nothing. Then, I was something once more.

My wide eyes reached those of the stern faced man before me. Before his face could morph to one of fierce decision, I practically screamed my message, leaving his expression fearful and confused.

""NO! IT HAS TO STOP! PLEASE!"" The room froze, no one uttered a word. I rose from my seat to run, yelling my plea to the sky.

""STOP, PLEASE, MAKE IT STOP!"" As I tried to leap from the window to the darkened streets below, a gunshot rang out. I looked behind me in a moment of panic only to see the man at the table holding a revolver, its muzzle releasing a whisper of smoke. I fell. The crunch that emanated through the streets as my back hit the concrete became everything before fading to simple black.

Jason threw the controller to the other side of the sofa in frustration as Tom entered the room from the kitchen, cradling an over-heaped bowl of chocolate chip ice cream. He spoke through a mouthful of the sugary dessert.

""I told you, it's bugged. I spent, like, four hours trying to beat the level yesterday."" Jason nodded sullenly, crossing his arms.

""It's so stupid. It's like your character just does whatever the hell he wants. What's the point in playing if the game just gets you killed over and over?"" Tom shrugged, wiping a drop of ice cream from his lip and moving to sit beside his roommate, grabbing the second controller as he went. As he plopped down beside him, he pressed a few buttons, returning to the game selection screen.

""You wanna play Mario Kart?"" Jason continued pouting for a moment, before allowing a grin to spread across his face.

"[EU]A bird flies out of a mysterious blue phone box. It lands on your porch, and says ""Huh, I have wings now. I'm the Doctor, by the way.""",Scott_Pilgrim_Fan,"I vomit across the cracked wood porch floor that I'd put off cleaning for two months in hopes of letting it happen on its own.

I tell myself ""birds don't talk. They have feathers, and they fly. But they don't talk"". I look up at the bluejay sitting in front of me and I remember hearing its nonchalant, high-pitched, very much unsettlingly normal voice that I wish I could remember being less real than it was. Which was totally.

I stumble out into the uncut grass of my garden and vomit twice more.

The next morning, I wake up, and I think, ""wow, that was a weird dream. Good thing it wasn't real, and that my life as Hal Jordan, most kick-ass Green Lantern ever, is actually awesome"".

I leave the planet to go fight my nemesis.
 
The stars shook as the dazzling spectacle of light screaming from Hal’s ring collided with his mortal enemy, Sinestro. The photons, which in this case would be a vehicle for fear for any other being, were fed back to his pupils and passed through his mind without initiating the slightest sign of intimidating the Greatest Lantern of Them All in the least.

Constructs of energy danced formed from the strongest of will and most intense of fear danced around while Hal smiled to himself.

""You can’t win, Sinestro. I have the high space"", Hal speaked.

Sinestro sneared and said “that’s not possible, jordan. We aren’t on any two-dimensional plane to relate our positions, we’re in three dimensions with nothing else around except the lack of anyone to help you.

Jordan said “too bad that doesn’t work because I’m too awesome to let that make sense”.

“BLAST YOU” Sinestro said with loudness and anger.

All of a sudden space ripped open. It was the work of Darkseid. Darkseid said “I think I have someone who could settle this petty meaningless dispute”.

And out from the really really dark hole of awesomeness/terrifiingness he threw batman, but with a space suit, so he could breath and stuff.

“Bat-“ (this was said by Jordan) 

“-Man?!?!?!?!” (this wasn’t said by Jordan. It wasn’t said by Jordan because it wasn’t said by Hal, it was said by Sinestro, not jordan)

Sinestro says to Jordan “wow Jordan, if it weren’t for the fact that we are sworn enemies, that kind of conradic teamwork would make us friends.

BUT WE ARE SWORN ENEMIES, AND SO….. THAT CANNOT BE!!!!!!”

Jordan does a bunch of awesome flips and says “fine by me, bro” and unleashed a dazzling spectacle of light screaming from his ring, which makes Sinestro like fall over and stuff, except not on the ground, because they’re in space.

[TT] Your Astrology sign determines what kind of job you're allowed to have,SilhouetteOfLight,"“Push!” Nurse Pam yelled at the young woman on the bed, bits of her hair plastered to her forehead by the sweat that poured from her.

“I said push!” Nurse Pam yelled again. Beside her, Karen grimaced, secretly glad the surgical mask covered half her face as the woman gripped her husband’s hand, which was slowly turning purple, like a lifeline. 
Karen gave Nurse Pam a sidelong glance. She had yet to figure out why a woman so fierce, so stern, had become a nurse. Every Taurus was assigned to occupations from the medical field by birth. A Taurus was gentle, reliable, patient; Nurse Pam was none of those things. 

The young woman on the bed gave an earsplitting scream and with a final push, her child, a boy who Karen secretly thought resembled a giant pink prune, entered the world, wailing at the top of his lungs. 

“Congratulations” Nurse Pam said, in a tone that suggested she did not really mean to congratulate the young parents “a few more minutes and your child would have been put on the shuttle headed for the Moon Colony.”

The Moon Colony, that was where they sent the children born under the sign of Sagittarius. Nobody was sure what occupation the children who were sent there were given; the Moon Colony did not allow visitors. The young woman leaned back into the many pillows propped behind her to keep her upright. She turned to her husband, tired, but no less excited.

“A boy” she said, smiling. 

“A boy, soon to be lawmaker” her husband said proudly as he massaged his hand, now free.

“Nurse Karen,” Nurse Pam barked from where she stood in the corner, holding the crying newborn.

Karen joined her colleague, pulling the mask away from her face.

“What is it?”

She noticed Nurse Pam had not bothered to swaddle the newborn in the traditional blue blanket. He squirmed, giving the occasional indignant howl as Nurse Pam covered him with a rag that had been lying on a nearby table.

“I didn’t want to say anything earlier, but it turns out I was wrong. It’s half an hour past midnight, the child is not a Scorpio, he’s a Sagittarius.” 

“Well that’s not terrible! Think of all the opportunities he’ll have on the Moon Colony.”

Nurse Pam ignored her “I need you to tell the parents that they didn’t make the cutoff time, then you can come join me at the Send Off Station”

She did not wait for a response before she turned on her heel and left the room, the door slammed shut behind her and Karen suddenly found herself alone with the bemused, exhausted young parents.

“Er-” she said, unsure of how to begin the news.

“What is it?” the woman asked.

“I’m sorry, you actually did not deliver your son within the set timeframe for a Scorpio, he’s a Sagittarius” Karen said apologetically. 

“But the nurse said -” the man protested.

“I’m sorry, she was mistaken, you son is boarding the shuttle for the Moon Colony as we speak.”

The woman began to cry. Her husband patted her shoulders comfortingly “It’s all right love, just think, the Moon Colony! Not every child gets to go! Maybe we’ll be able to visit him when the President passes that law that allows free travel between planets!”

“It’s completely possible” Karen said, nodding her head vigorously in what she hoped was a comforting manner.

“Thank you nurse,” the man said, giving her a dismissive nod as he turned to comfort his wife. 

Karen turned to leave the room, she had just turned the door handle when the young woman finally spoke up “Bernard, his name is Bernard. Please tell the caretaker of the Moon Colony.”

“I will” Karen promised. 

She hurried down the hall toward the Send Off Station. She had never been allowed in herself, being a newcomer at the hospital. Nobody talked about what happened at the Send Off Station and very few were given the responsibility of sending the newborn children off to the Moon Colony. The Send Off Station was located behind two sets of heavy sliding glass doors. Karen saw Nurse Pam standing beside another set of doors she assumed led to the Send Off Platform.

“Why didn’t you wait for me?” Karen asked her, irritated that Nurse Pam had sent the boy off on the shuttle without letting her see, “did the shuttle leave already?”

Nurse Pam gave her a long penetrating stare, then her face turned almost sympathetic.

“Nurse Karen, there is no shuttle, there is no Moon Colony, and there are no surviving Sagittarius children.”

Karen stared at Nurse Pam as she felt the words sink in. She felt her stomach roll and she ran for the nearest trash can. She dry heaved into the large gray container which smelled strongly of bleach. 

“I’m sorry, I thought you knew” Nurse Pam said as she stood beside her, her voice devoid of any emotion. 

“I’ve heard rumors, but didn’t think -”

“It was done to prevent overpopulation. There aren’t enough resources.”

Karen nodded, her eyes closed, disgusted. 

Nurse Pam finally put a hand on her shoulder.

“The first send off is always the hardest, and you didn’t have to see this one. It gets easier if you don’t think of them as people” she said as she turned to leave.

Karen pulled herself away from the trashcan to watch Nurse Pam’s retreating figure.

“His name is Bernard” she said clearly, her voice rang through the empty hall.

Nurse Pam stopped. She turned slightly to look at Karen, her face had become hard.

“I’m sure it was, but that doesn’t matter anymore, now does it?”

[WP] The fate of mankind rests on you and your ability to make a sandwich.,CommodoreFiftyFour,"I used to work at Togos.  I've got this.

 Surrounded by friends and family, I take a 9 inch piece of parmesan bread and slice it through the middle.  My hands shake.  I take a deep breath as I reach for the low fat italian vinegarette.  I breathe, and my hand steadies.  I run the bottle back and forth longways down the roll.

""I got this,"" I mutter to myself.  ""I fucking got this.""

Next comes the ham.  Four slices.  Capicolla.  Three slices.  Salami.  I look in the tray.  There is no more salami.  I gulp, take another deep breath, and clear my throat.  I ascend my gaze to the humble customer, who stands across from me, business suit shrouded in shadow, eyes illuminated by a light source that I can't quite locate.  

""I need to go to the fridge to get more salami.""

The air hangs still, dense, almost humid.  I can feel myself start to tremble as his tight mouth cracks a subtle, amused smile.

Barely an effort given, gruff and commanding, he replies.

""You do what you gotta do.""

I feel a wave of relief wash over me.  I back away from the counter.  My mind travells as I speedily step towards the walk-in fridge.  I open the door, step inside, and collapse against the wall.  Breathing heavy and wiping the sweat from my forehead, I enjoy the few seconds of cool air and solitude that the refrigerator grants me.

""Focus man.  Focus.""

I reach for the salami and find it in my palm.  Its time.  My world needs me.

I walk out the fridge, a new invigouration of confidence and precision coursing through my body.  The crowd releases a collage of whispers as I stroll back to the counter.  I've done this hundreds of times.  Whats one time more.  The customer's eyes narrow, yet somehow burn brighter.  His lips twist into an impressed grimace.

""Proceed"" he says.

 My coworkers stare in awe as I assemble the meal with a southeast Asian sweatshop level of efficiency.  Salami.  Four slices.  Mortadella.  Three slices.  Parmesan cheese.  Four slices.  Now time for the produce.

""Lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, or pepperoncini on that, sir?"" I professionally inquire.

""You know the stakes?""

He's trying to throw me off.  I meet his stare again, and the wrinkles in the corners of his eyes spread.

""I want it all.  Togos style.""

Another deep breath.

""You can do it, sweetie.  I know you can.""

I look over to my sweet mother, tears forming in the corners of her eyes, and I smile.  I don't dare open my mouth.  I don't trust myself to keep it together.

I look at my parents, my two brothers, my friends, my ex girlfriend, my cat...

Ok, back to business.

I toss on a pile of crisp iceberg lettuce, the bed in which the rest of the garden ensemble will fornicate on.  Next come the tomatoes- three juicy slices.   A little late to the party, the commanding spread of onion, and pickles on top.  Finally, I pop off the stems of the four juiciest, crispiest pepperoncinis, and they join the near-incestual produce orgy.

""Will that be for here or to go?""

I see something near-unrecognizable cross over the customer's face; a cross between satisfaction and craving, with a touch of uncertainty.
A bead of sweat travels down my forehead, and I notice condensation building up under my vinyl gloves.

""To go, please.""

I do my thing.  One wrap, cut in half, second wrap, napkins and the sandwich in a bag.

I put it on the counter and release a sigh of relief.

""Great job, son,"" I hear my dad say.  ""You did a great ass job.""

But the sound is distant.  My concentration is purely focused on the customer in front of me.  A smile passes over his face.  His mouth opens, slowly, and then a deap, low chuckle escapes, spreading until maniacal laughter encompasses the room.

""Close,"" he says, trying to catch a breath. ""Close, but no cigar.""

His chuckles echo in my ears.  My brain starts vibrating.  Confusion floods my head.  Mumbling coming from every direction, worried whispers from my coworkers and the crowd around me as I try to recall where exactly I went wrong.

""You got the prodice right kid, but I asked for Togo's style, did I not?""

My head spins.  The tips of my fingers and toes go cold.  I scour my memories.  The bread.  The sauce.  The meats and the produce and the-

""Fuck.""

His mouth widens to the size of a bowling ball, creating a vaccuum as it expands larger and larger.  The sandwich is the first to go, propelling itself off the counter, bag and all, strait into the deep cravasses of his throat.  Tables and chairs fly up.  The windows break with a furious crash.  I see my parents, holding my little brother to no avail.  He goes in, and they follow not soon after.  My friends scream as they, one by one, are forced to the end of their existence.  My world breaks around me, and the black hole that used to be my customer's face expands bigger and bigger, pulling in the roof around him.

I caused this.

My mouth trembles.

I caused this.

My eyes sting, but the tears lift off my cheeks.

""I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.""

I hear the words, but I don't feel myself saying them.  I look up at the sky and see it falling down around me.  Then I too am flying towards the abyss.

It was a super buff man with larger arms than my head. He runs up points to me then states make me the worlds most delicious sandwich in ten minutes or I'll destroy your planet.

It hits mars then explodes turning mars into smithereens. I run into the kitchen.  I started to hyperventilate. I have no idea how to make sandwiches this is my first time at the job. I decided to just chuck random ingredients onto the sandwich. I chucked pickles, lettuce, cheese and ham on some white bread,  I looked below and saw a bottle of vinegar, it smelt somewhat but I squirted it on regardless. I served him the sandwich. He swallowed the entire sandwich whole.  ""This tastes awful!"" He yelled, ""I'm destroying this disgusting sandwich making planet."" I begged him ""please don't, I can make a better sandwich."" He pulled his fist up then started his blow. I hid behind the counter. He fell over. I came out from behind the register to poke his body. He was dead.

""It's great. Thanks for helping me out.""

""What about you, Tommy?""

""Man, I just want to sleep...""

""Trevor? Bad day?""

""Bunch of kids kicked the shit out of me, man. It sucks.""

""Damn, want me to call the cops?""

""Nah, I'm fine. I think someone's knocking.""

I sighed and stood up and headed for the door, glancing at my watch. Three in the morning. Who was showing up so late?

I opened the door, expecting either a police officer, or some bratty teenagers playing yet another prank, but instead, I found a pale-skinned young girl standing outside the door, shivering in the snowfall. She must have only been sixteen, and had jet black hair, long fingernails, and her teeth were chattering non-stop. 

""Hello, Mister. I'm looking for a-a place to s-stay.""

""I'm sorry, homeless shelters are divided by gender. This is a male homeless shelter. There's one just a bus stop away..."" I mentally scolded myself. No buses would be moving so late at night, and in the snow.

""Please, Mister. It's cold, and I'm only staying for one night."" She pleaded.

There was little hesitation. There was no way I was letting some poor homeless girl wander in the cold for hours. I had always believed in welcoming those in need into the shelter. And the girl would only be staying for the night.

""Alright come in Miss...uhhh...""

""Rachel.""

""Nice to meet you, Miss Rachel. My name's Thomas Harding, but just call me Thomas."" I shook her hand as she walked in, shaking the snow off her thin coat and onto the carpet as I closed the door.

""Now, since this is a male shelter, you can't exactly stay with the other men, so I got a little guest room where some of my employees nap in. They're not here, so you can stay there."" I told her.

Rachel gave me a nod and as I turned, I could have sworn I saw a little smile from the corner of my eye. Probably just my mind playing tricks on me. It's late after all.

I led Rachel to the guest room. Not exactly the nicest room around, but it was fairly large, with a small coffee table at the side, a desk, and even a bookshelf with a couple of old books I lent to some of the homeless people. Trevor especially liked *The Odyssey* while Timothy always kept reading *Journey to the Center of the Earth* over and over again.

""So...are you going to sleep now or...?""

""No,"" she replied, ""I used to help work the night shift, so I always find it hard to fall asleep at night.""

I raised my eyebrows. ""Work the night shift? How old are you?""

She let out a small chuckle. ""Older than you think.""

""Right...I'm going to make some tea. Would you like some?"" I asked.

Rachel gave me a friendly smile. ""Yes, please. A teaspoon of sugar, and no garlic please.""

I went down to make the tea, and the smell quickly got complaints from both Tim and Travis. Both hated the smell of tea, and I made a lot. I popped into the room they were in and just told them all to shut it and get some sleep.

When I brought the tea up, Rachel was still sitting on the bed, in her hands, a copy of *Dracula*, which she seemed to be silently laughing to herself as she read. Strange. I didn't think that book was all that funny.

""Having a good time?""

She shrugged, putting the book down. I poured a cup of warm tea and passed it to her. ""Who were you talking to downstairs?"" She asked.

""Oh, just the homeless guys. Especially Travis. He was a mean one. Got kicked out of his house, got fired from multiple jobs, and he just used the money to buy alcohol."" I pointed at my waist. ""He even kicked me multiple times.""

Rachel's eyes widened. ""Why didn't you kick him out?""

I waved my hand dismissively. ""Everyone has made mistakes in their lives. Travis, it's just in his personality. I'm not going to throw him into the snow because he kicked me a few times. Trevor, on the other hand, he's a good man. Loved to read the old Greek and Roman tales, especially the Odyssey. It's about a guy undergoing a tough journey to reach his home, his wife, and his son. Trevor said he likes the parallels of Odysseus and himself. He saw the book as inspiration to reach his goals, which are getting a house, a wife, and a kid.""

We paused to drink our tea. Downstairs, I could hear Travis start arguing with Trevor and Timothy. Rachel finished her tea just as I stood up. ""Alright, Rachel. Good night. I'm going to sort out a dispute below, then I'm going to bed.""

""Good night."" She replied, sucking in some air in a weird fashion. Whatever. I took the tea and went downstairs, placing the cups and kettle besides the sink before walking to shut the homeless guys up, but they seemed to have settled the argument, though Timothy was still grumbling.

""Alright, keep it down, gentlemen."" I ordered, before climbing into my bed.

&amp;nbsp;

I woke up suddenly. Not again. It had been happening a lot recently, though I doubted it was anything serious. I stood up and walked over to the sink to wash my face. The cold water temporarily pushed my sleepiness back. Glancing at my watch, it as four in the morning. One goddamn hour of sleep.

Walking over to the stairs, I noticed that the guest room's door was ajar, a tiny sliver of light peeking out. Huh. Pretty sure I shut the door when I left. What...what if one of the homeless guys had gone in. 

Quietly, I sneaked up the stairs towards the room, my heart pounding in my chest, sweat starting to form on my palms. Anxiously, I used my finger to push the door open. 

There was no one inside. The bed still had creases, so Rachel had been here. So where was she?

I looked around. *Dracula* was still on the bedside table. Maybe she had to go to the bathroom? No, something was wrong. What if she had...

The minute was a blur. I had practically sprinted down the stairs, past the room I slept in, down the hall, and the short amount of stairs to the basement. The locked door had been somehow broken open. There was no way someone like Rachel would be strong enough to do that, so what the hell happened?

I gingerly squeezed in between the door frame and the broken metal door and quietly as I could, walked down the stairs. I entered the dark basement, with only a yellowish lightbulb illuminating part of the room. Hung on the walls with ropes and hooks were all the homeless people I had met. On the left, with a cut straight down his body, was Travis. His eyes had been gouged out and his jaw was missing. There was Tommy, Tim, and Timothy hung, each with their own injuries. All were dead.

In the centre of the room was a about fifteen years old, kneeling and crying, and besides him, stood Rachel, torn ropes strewn across the floor. She turned to face me as I walked in.

""Who the hell are you?"" I seethed.

""I'm a vampire. I came here in search of food."" She said, taking a step towards me, and blocking the boy with her own body. ""And who the hell are you?"" She asked.

""I'm Thomas Harding."" I replied, my fists clenching.

""I don't believe you."" She crossed her arms.

""So you took advantage of my kindness, came in, and killed all my friends.""

Her face briefly turned into surprise, before returning to the anger. ""Me? I think you have some issues. You killed them.""

""Fuck off."" I said. ""I take care of the homeless, I would never hurt a fly.""

""Then why are you holding that?"" She pointed at my right hand.

""I'm not holding any-"" I raised my right hand to find my hand clutched around a short, sharp metal pole, its point bloodied. 

""No, that's impossible. I was just talking to them an hour ago.""

She shook her head. ""My hearing is excellent. Nobody was talking to you just now. Besides,"" she moved to point at the dead bodies, ""do these look like homeless men?""

""What are you talking about? Of course they-"" I stopped again. They were teenagers and young adults, in their street clothes. No. No. These-these weren't my friends. But...they were. They were.

I lunged forwards, stabbing. Rachel pushed the boy back and dodged, but I managed to stab her arm with the pole and I rammed the pole into the pillar, pinning her arm there. She screamed and reached out to grab the pole. I turned around and picked up the dented wooden baseball bat and advanced on Trevor. He cowered, covering his face and head with his hands as he whimpered.

I snarled and took a swing, but  from behind. I heard the sound of the pole detaching and in just a second, Rachel tackled me from behind and threw me to the ground next to Trevor. I yelled and roared, struggling to attack her, but she possessed superhuman strength, flinging my bat away and pinning me to the floor. I tried to twist my body to kick her, but after a brief moment, she punched me in the head and everything went black.

&amp;nbsp; 

""Jesus Christ. What the hell happened here?"" A strange voice.

""He's waking up. Cuff him, quick!""

I felt metal click around my wrists and someone pulled me to my feet. He was dressed in blue. A cop?

""Excuse me? Can you hear me?""

I struggled to speak, but I was dazed and some of my teeth were broken.

""I think he's concussed. Any sign of the girl that called us?""

""No. Let's get this guy in the car. If he's the killer, then he's going to jail for a long time.""

[PM] I'd like to work on my characterization.,PhantomOfZePirates,"Ivan dragged his sword through the churned mud of the earth, watered by the blood of the enemy. He pushed his damp brown hair out of his shimmering green eyes as they roamed the ruined land. The battlefield was a far cry from the farm he had grown up on, where he'd spent the first sixteen years of his life. 

""Grim sight, aye, lad?"" his dwarf companion, Häldrik, grunted, cresting the brittle brown hill beside the young hero. 

Ivan knelt and ran the brilliant silver blade across the dead grass, before straightening and sheathing the unbreakable sword - a gift from his now deceased mentor. ""If I'm to be the Chosen One, then it's a sight I suppose I must get used to, until the Darkness is gone from the land,"" he said, his voice full of bravery he didn't quite feel. He sometimes wished he could return home, to the life he once knew. Tilling the land, feeding the animals, picking on his kid sister. He wasn't sure if she was even alive. 

""Aye. I 'spose. It'll be dark soon, boy. We best return to camp,"" Häldrik advised, pulling Ivan from his thoughts. 

Ivan's supple leather boots sank into the mud as the pair descended the hill to the valley where they had set up camp. On his way to his tent, a massive red pavilion swaying in the evening breeze, Ivan spotted the Princess Isabella. She looked stunning as ever, even with the blood and gore coating her bronze skin and her dark eyes full of fire. Ivan instantly felt the heat rise to his cheeks as he approached. She was a year older than he, seventeen, but that and her noble heritage was not enough to make his heart stop beating frantically for her, yearning... If he could but taste those full, sumptuous lips- 

""Ivan, you're staring again,"" Isabella said, crossing her arms. 

Ivan blinked, turning a deeper shade of crimson. ""Sorry, Princess. It's just that - my feelings for you have only intensified. The more you say it cannot be, the more I yearn for it. When I restore balance to the realm, I know I can win your fair heart."" 

Isabella sighed, lowering her arms in defeat. ""Look, Ivan... I know you're the 'Chosen One' and all that, but you bore me. You're a total Mary Sue,"" she said. 

""Mary - Mary Sue? You think I'm *boring*?"" he repeated, aghast. 

""Well yeah, a bit.  I mean, you're soo sweet, and incredibly brave. I saw you out there on the battlefield-"" 

""And? So what's the problem? I'm not really following."" 

""Well, just think about it. You were raised poor on a farm, you helped provide for your family. And when the Wizard Galbatroth came for you, you took the unbreakable sword and consented to the journey with minimal grumbling,"" she pointed out. 

""Yeah, I'm the Chose-""

""The Chosen One, I know. But everyone just adores you, especially your witty sarcasm and easy rapport with all the races."" 

""Again, not really seeing a problem here."" 

""And now you've fallen for me - the unobtainable Princess, separated by class. But it will all work out because you're the hero who will save the realm. But only after the Dark Lord nearly breaks you in body and spirit."" 

Ivan puffed out his chest, indignant. ""He can try, but-"" 

""You're everything the author wishes he could be.""

Tessa stared out of it with unseeing, bloodshot eyes as the bus slowed and came to a steady stop. She shifted and grabbed her bag, stiff from the twelve hour journey. 

Faces blurred past as the other passengers shuffled off the bus and into the early morning dawn, the sun's rays just cresting the horizon. The air was crisp, grasping at Tessa's lungs with greedy, icy fingers. Though it was nothing compared to the pit in her empty stomach. Nausea and dread roiled through her shrunken gut, making her gag. 

The journey had passed in a lethargic, hazy daze, but it was nothing compared to what was coming. She could already feel the comfortability of her usual comatose state fading, her veins constricting and on fire with their ever burning need. She couldn't do this, she knew she wasn't strong enough to last. She'd tried before. It never lasted. She was weak. A coward. 

She stopped short on the sidewalk, paralyzed. The people of the city parted around her like she was a rock in the stream, not even registering her presence on their way to work. Maybe next month. Next month she would be ready. Next month she would return. 

Pushing the purple knit cap back on her dirty, lank blonde tresses, she turned to leave. The anxiety began to dissipate the moment she moved to get back on the bus, but his hand on her shoulder stopped her. 

""Tessa. You can do this,"" Jack said, his voice a gentle rumble. 

She chewed her chapped, cracking lip and glanced around at him. ""I can't,"" she whispered, tears welling in her blue eyes. 

""You can,"" he assured her. ""It'll be hard, especially at first. But you deserve this, Tess. You *can* get better,"" he promised. 

She released a shaky breath and nodded, allowing him to lead her into a taxi to take her to her new home for the next three months. Clutching at her bag with white knuckles, she slid across the worn black leather of the cab. The future was uncertain at best, but compared to her past and the people and vices who had ruled it, surely there was hope for her.

After a day of just looking at it one young man begins to climb…",Rememberthisname24,"Seeing that Calvin was willing to listen to him, the man seemed to recover a little of his countenance and nodded. He looked down and took a deep breath, and the excitement and madness in his eyes were replaced by something else. He looked up at Calvin again and started to talk.


“I created this dimension so that we could meet. I…” he frowned seeing the look of surprise on Calvin’s face before continuing “Well not you specifically boy! Someone in your world. Anyone!”.


“Oh ok” Calvin answered.


The man shook his head as though Calvin was a child “Focus boy. This is important.”


“Right” Calvin nodded apologetically. 


“I know it’s rudimentary. A ladder, I mean. But it was the simplest and best way to make it happen.” he said. “Like I was saying… I come from a different dimension…” he stopped and frowned again. “Keep in mind that what I’m saying when I talk about dimension and ladder and such is just a gross oversimplification of course. I don’t have time to explain physics to you.” He paused and his frown deepened “I doubt your kind would be able to understand it anyway”.


Calvin wanted to say that he had always been pretty good in science and that the man didn’t seem to be from another *kind* than his own but he decided it probably wasn’t a good idea and held his tongue.


The man shook his head from side to side as tough he was trying to wake up and continued “We don’t have time for this.” He looked intently at Calvin and said “I created you. Your kind, your world, your universe. I created everything.”


Calvin felt his eyes and mouth open wide. “You… You mean you’re… god?” 


“Well, that’s another gross oversimplification but…” he looked down and murmured “Yes…”


Calvin had never been a religious man and had spent most of his life not believing in a higher power. And it seemed he had been right because whatever that man was, it definitely wasn’t the god that most religion spoke about. But still… God was a madman?


The man looked up again and now Calvin understood what he saw in the man eyes – guilt, sadness. “You have to understand. I didn’t know what I was doing. I didn’t know…” The man was almost pleading now. “Time passes differently for me. One second in my dimension is almost a century in your world now, and it was even worse during the birth of your universe. By the time I realized what I had done…” 


He looked at Calvin with intensity again and said “You have to tell everyone. Tell them… tell them I am sorry…”


Calvin felt a chill run though his spine “Why? Are you going to destroy everything?”


The man eyes went wide again “Of course not boy!” He paused a moment and continued “I have to let it run its course now. There is nothing more I can do.”


Calvin hesitated “Why are you sorry then?”


The man looked down again “I… I had no rights. It wasn’t right boy. I should never have done it. You can’t understand…” 


Calvin felt a *shift* again and the substances forming the floor and the ceiling of the strange place they were in started glowing.


The man gripped his shoulders tighter and looked at him with that same intensity he had shown before “Just tell everyone. Tell them I am sorry.”


“Now go boy!” the man said throwing Calvin away from him. “Down the hole, quickly before this place implodes and us with it.”


Calvin didn’t try to argue. He went to the door and carefully put his feet on the ladder. He took a last look at the man.


“The ladder will disappear when you reach the ground” the man said. “Go boy. Tell them!” God said, crying.


Just when he had started climbing down, Calvin felt another *shift* and looked up. The door was no longer there.


Calvin paused and took a few deep breaths. He probably would need the rest of his lifetime to digest what had just happened to him. But in the midst of all the feelings going through him at this moment, one was clearly prevalent: *anger*. God was a mad scientist and mankind, the world… The entire universe was just a failed experiment.


*Tell them* he remembered God saying. *Fuck that* he thought. If he went down that ladder and told the world what had really happened, people would either think him mad or a liar. And those that believed him would hate him anyway for the message he brought.


*Fuck that* he though again. He looked down and smiled. He knew what to do. 


He would tell the world he’d met God alright. But the rest would be his own story. He felt his smile broaden as he pondered the possibilities. There would still be people to think him mad or a liar but those that believed… Yes, he could use them to make the world better for himself, and maybe even for everyone else. And if they liked the message he brought, they would be much more to believe in it.


He smiled again. He already had the first few rules.


&gt;&gt; First commandment: you shall not work more than 4 hours a day.


&gt;&gt; Second commandment: you shall not work more than 4 days a week.


He laughed and started his way down.

Eventually news stations call it the ""ladder to heaven"" and people from across the country come to see it. After a day of just looking at it one young man begins to climb…",Rememberthisname24,"Calvin could feel his pulse beat stronger than it ever had in his life. At 24 years old, he had never felt anything like what he was experiencing climbing this stupid ladder.


As he lifted his right arm to grip the next rung, he realized he was smiling, and he started to laugh. It seemed as though he had truly gone mad, he reflected. Had he known that madness was so enjoyable, he would have tried it sooner.


Climbing another level, his laugh increased in intensity. He wasn’t laughing without any reason – it was the thought of all those people down there looking up, looking at *him*.


*Seven days*, he thought. Seven days since Ritchfield, Utah, USA, and middle of nowhere had suddenly become the center of the world when the “ladder to heaven” had appeared behind one of the city motels in a little field usually occupied by a few horses. 


Strange how much – and how little – could happen in seven days, he mused. Calvin had been among the first to see it. He had been walking home late at night when he had noticed people getting out of their home to look toward the sky behind him. He had turned around and seen it. 


It had been a very exciting week since. Seeing the trickle of news reporters, various authority’s representatives, intrigued scientists, and curious folks of all kind transform into a flood of people had amused him incredibly.


The quiet little field behind the motel had been transformed into the hottest spot on earth. The poor horses had been relocated and given way to a massive crowd several times the size of Ritchfield itself. The authorities had managed to take a certain degree of control in the perimeter around the ladder. Strangely enough, they had decided to allow people to move around the ladder and even touch it briefly – they just made sure that no one stood in front of it all day and that people kept in motion so that anyone would have their chance… Chance to do what exactly, he couldn’t say. Most people just stood there, starring upward with their mouth open.


But not him. He didn’t know exactly why he had done it. It certainly wasn’t something he had planned to do, but standing in front of the ladder he had had a case of those strange thoughts that sometimes go through people’s mind. Like when you’re meeting someone for the first time and then suddenly, you have this image of you striking them, or spitting on them, or doing something ridiculous in front of them. He had read about it somewhere; French had an expression for it: *L’Appel du Vide* which meant *The Call of the Void*.


But this time he had actually fulfilled the crazy idea passing through his mind. He had taken a step and then another, and before he knew it, he was climbing the freaking ladder.


He climbed another level and felt something shift around him. He looked down and realized that he couldn’t see the ground anymore. Nothing surprising there tough, the ground had disappeared a few hours ago. What *was* surprising was the weird atmosphere surrounding him. The wind had suddenly stopped and there were no longer any noises to be heard. He looked up and saw that some kind of horizontal door was now visible a few meters above him. *Well, I’ve come this far…”, he thought. 


When he went through the door, he felt another *shift* and looked around. The ladder stopped at the door level and he was now standing on a solid substance that span as far as the eye could see. A cloud-like substance floated a few meters above him and stretched all around to meet the substance he was standing on in the horizon.


“You!” The coarse voice made him jump, scared out of his mind, and he almost fell down the door. The voice had come from behind him and he now saw the source: a middle-aged man with unkempt beard and hairs, who was looking at him with wild eyes as though Calvin was the one who had just almost sent him down to his death and not the other way around.


“You came!” the man said now starting to move toward him. “You really came.” He moved around the door – which really was just a hole in the ground from where they were standing – and put his hands on Calvin shoulders. Calvin first instinct was to get away but he decided to avoid any abrupt moves and study the man. If you ignored his beard and hairs, he was average looking. His clothes were a little more startling – some kind of weird suit.


“Listen, you have to tell them!” said the man. He was still looking at Calvin with his eyes wide open and a determination you only saw in men who suffered a special kind of mental illness.


“Uh wait…” said Calvin trying to put distance between him and the man. But the man gripped Calvin’s shoulders tighter and brought him closer “No, you don’t understand boy!” he said.


“We don’t have time… I need you to pass a message to them!” he said.


“A message to who?” said Calvin frowning.


The man came even closer before he answered. “To everyone boy! Every living thing in your universe!”. He looked around frantically “We don’t have time, this dimension won’t last much longer with both of us here. So I need you to listen.”


“Ok, ok” said Calvin. He didn’t think he could step away from the man without fighting and he would rather try to calm the man down and listen to him. Besides, he was more than a little intrigued as to who the man was and what he was doing at the top of the most bizarre thing to ever happen in the history of mankind.

He was about halfway up and hear the excited reporters or nervous chatters of his neighbors.

He saw something falling to his side and breached his hand out to catch it. He look at the item in his hand. A guitar pick.

He looked at it confused before continuing up the ladder. Up and up, but surprisingly no drop in pressure as he passed through clouds.  He almost tripped as he made it up the final rung. 

He looked around and in the distance saw something resembling a city.

""Cloud people?""

He adjusted the camera attached to him and walked a little forward. 

""What?""

Sitting at the desk in front of The Pearly Gates was a cat. A tabby to be precise. Chubby little thing with grey fur. It locked it's leg aimlessly basically ignoring the young man.

He stepped up to the desk and the cat stopped and hopped down. He heard the cat purring under the desk. He looked over but the cat returned to its postion on the desk with a sign in its mouth that read 

""On break. Be back soon. Check in with Mary.

He looked at the cat confused and the animal gently poked the lens of the camera. 

""Jeremy!""

The young man jumped a little and turned to see St. Peter and Elvis. The King looked at the pick in the young man's hand and he handed it over. Elvis thanked and reentered the gates.

The cat purred tail swinging as St. Peter pet him.

""How many times do I have to tell you to stop knocking the ladder down, you little troublemaker.""

The cat meowed in response and St. Peter looked at the young man. 

""Huh....""

Peter reached out and checked the man's pulse. 

""Ok so you did come up the ladder. ""

""W-w-w""

""What's it's purpose? Guardian Angles occasionally sneak down to provide a helping hand if needed. Now if you don't mind please close your eyes, put your arms to the side and hold your breath for four seconds. ""

Everyone stood around muttering. The man had a note attached to him.

For years he'd searched for an enemy that would be a challenge, yet to no success and now he had finally found a battle that could not be won with a single punch. 

However, something had changed within him during the past few months. Why did it have to be a battle of strength? What if it was a battle of wit and intelligence? Why not a game of chess?

Indeed, as he stared at the opponent in front of him, he knew that his brutally devastating punch would be of no use here. Instead, he would have to make use of the training he had gone through for the last 3 months. Strangely enough, this training had an odd effect on him, he was still bald yet now he was graced with a thick handlebar mustache the likes of which you have never seen before.

The crowd of people sat watching around the arena stayed still in anticipation. 

Cautiously, One Punch Man looked at the chessboard which sat on the table between him and his foe with great focus and he slowly lifted his pawn forward.

What followed was a chess battle of the sort that the world had never seen before, sweat dripped down his bald head, which shined brightly, as he pondered every move. At last, he came to a realization... If his opponent remained oblivious of his tactics, then he was only 3 moves from victory...

He leaned forward to move his bishop but as he did, he slipped... Out of instinct, he dropped his chess piece and his hand turned to a fist. A sonic boom erupted throughout the room as the crowed awed in shock...

One Punch Man looked up to see the one worthy opponent he had ever faced at the opposite side of the room, slammed against the wall, while his chess board had been flung to the side. ""NOOOOOOO!"" He yelled. Once again, his battle had ended in one punch...",SkezBomb
[IP] New Beginnings,SpotlessEternalSun,"Her eyes open slowly, becoming accustomed to the harsh glare of the white lab lights. A face appears, fuzzy and unclear.

""Oh! Sorry!"" his voice mutters, disappearing for a moment. The lights dim and the face hovers again. He becomes clearer with each passing moment as her eyes adjust. He smiles.

""You're the first I've woken up and I...well I didn't think about the light."" He blushes and she can't help but smile. She remembers him. He's so much older now but still clumsy as ever.

""Doctor, good to see you,"" she says, managing through a mouth that feels full of cotton. He places a hand beneath her back and lifts her up, offering a cup with a straw with the other.

She drinks desperately, trying to sooth her throat.

""I wanted you to be first to see it!"" he says, his voice quaking with excitement and nervousness. She lifts herself up, swinging her legs off the medical table to the cold floor. With a yelp she draws her feet up.

He shuffles his way to a pair of white slippers, kicking them over to her. He shrugs, his body is so much older than she remembered it. He his hunched with the years, his hair is gray and thinning, his beard thick but the reddish brown she knew is long chased off by the white.

She slips her feet in and he offers an arm. He was always clumsy but he was the most delightful young man she had ever known. She took his arm and they took off at a bare shuffling crawl, her body adjusting to the artificial gravity and waking from cryo.

""How long did it take?""

He furrowed his brow as he thought. It must be a blur for him with only the android crew for company. Their cryo tubes had not been retrofitted in time to allow easy re-engagement into sleep. Someone would have had to be awake for the entire trip. So he had volunteered rather than waking crew every few years to be on his own. To give everyone else the chance to live a full life at their destination.

""Seventy eight years.""

He leads her without words, the clumsy doctor is gone for a brief moment. He is instead a man bent by the years of travel, the burden of his position and loneliness.

She stops and turns to him, wrapping her arms around him. She doesn't acknowledge the tears when she pulls away, just takes his arm and they continue.

He leads her to the enormous viewing room, a room filled with dozens of chairs and tables for the colonists to gather at. He leads her to a space before the massive blast door that protected the viewing port. He shuffles to a computer terminal and mutters as he enters in the commands. The door begins to slide open, a slow process as it rises to reveal the emptiness of space.

Natural light spills in through the gap as it raises, brighter than the lab lights that had blinded her just a moment ago. The view screen automatically darkens to filter it out, dimming it to a more manageable level of bright.

He watches with her, taking in the sight as she does.

The door rises further and her mouth drops open.

It's beautiful. Beyond words.

She can see the blue and green of a perfect world below the colony ship. Swirling white clouds in the atmosphere, scattered landmasses covered with lush plant life and broad deserts and snow covered poles. It's exactly as they hoped.

He takes her hand in his, wrapping his thin fingers around hers.

They stand there for a long time. Neither speaks. Neither can speak. When she turns to him it's with tears in her eyes, tears of joy.

""Is it...""

He nods.

""Can we?""

He nods again.

She wraps him in a hug. They had found a new world. A world without black toxins in the air, without choking smoke, without the fire of war and death spreading across its surface. Their world was dead. Long dead.

As they break the embrace he smiles, again that little boy she remembers.

""I started the landing sequence before I woke you. Now it's time to wake the others.""

""What do we call it?""

Just before he leaves the viewing room, leaving her to continue to stare at their new home, he pauses and turns to her.

""Earth, mom, it's called Earth.""",jacktherambler

[IP] New Beginnings,SpotlessEternalSun,"I take a look for the last time at my home. Earth. Earth, our origin. Earth, who nurtured us into a mature species. Earth, who we raped time and time again until we could not do so anymore. I watch from the viewing platform, trying to take in every last detail. It almost looks like it could still sustain us. My wife weeps silently at my side. My children are playing with the other children. They aren’t old enough really to understand what this means. Ah, if only we could set aside our differences. But no, there is no use regretting what was. 


Ours is the final ship to evacuate. Evacuate is a strong word, really; it took decades to get humans off the planet. We found a nice planet about 8 light-years from us long ago, but we didn’t think we needed to act upon that information until a certain nation tried and succeeded in starting a full-blown world war. Scientists knew what that meant. Our weapons technology was too good. We did not want M.A.D., so we jumped onto the bandwagon that Elon Musk restarted, and launched our very own ship, called Ark. We found many people willing to be a part of Ark, but relatively few were qualified. Finally, we were able to gather a crew of a few hundred, armed with staple crops and livestock, all with state-of-the-art cryogenics. These would be the hard-working scientists and farmers that would pave the way -- in some cases literally -- for the rest of humanity to follow. By the time Ark Launched, we did not think we could even convince humanity that Earth would not be hospitable much longer. They changed their tune quickly.


We are the last to forsake our home. The ones who could keep the infrastructure running. The ones who could shut it all down. I pity the life we had to leave behind; but I remember that it was there before us, and it is only fitting that it shall remain after us. I take my wife’s hand. She squeezes it like a life preserver. I take a breath. “It is time. We need to get the kids prepped.”

[IP] New Beginnings,SpotlessEternalSun,"My hands dangled by my sides. Just like our ship hung outstretched from the blue and green stalwart that would become our new home. The holy new ground spun in a beautiful orb just for our living, and the elegance of its entire species. We - the first generation of people coming to extend our far from perfect, but capable of beautiful progress, genes. The tyranny of men had won out, its savagery stuck in the greed pot, tore at Earth until it wanted out, but could only help but destroy the pot with it's claws. We the first generations were far from perfect, but we wanted good wealth in good means – and we all had the genes to prove it. The hardest thing was looking back at Earth as we left, and sadness became tears – as it should, we were all good people making a decision nobody should ever have to make, but God. Perhaps he did though, I thought.

We proud 36, the first organizers of a ‘crazy group,’ so the headline (and soon headlines) ran. Now while we stood 36 proud on the atrium to the landing pad, we had 6,000 with us ready to begin a new dawn of decent morals. Come to build plantations not of terrible gasses and waste pushing into the oceans and atmospheres, but of families where fathers and mothers taught their children well. We would teach right from wrong, not just to humans now. One gross and arrogant mistake caused the deaths of nearly 50 billion humans – that is why we cried as we left Earth. We cried for the beautiful boys and girls, the babies and infants, who wondered why we were leaving them, and not taking them instead. We hoped they would find their way off the dying planet, and if they found our new home, we would welcome them in our new home. But they would not find us. 

John smiled at us as the Atrium view lined up with our new home. John would take care of us well. He was the first of the 36, and it was his mind that had saved us all. The planet from space resembled earth without distinction, except it was living, not dying.

[WP] You are The Spawn of Satan. Rather than be Light Bringer the Second. You just go by Dan. Today is Parents Day at your university and you've received word that your Dad is going to be there.,SpotlessEternalSun,"I went a bit younger than university, but here it is. This is my first submission to this subreddit, so please let me know how I can improve.



I'm 12. Mom says I'm smart for my age. She says it's cause Dad's so smart. I guess she's right, but I never thought I took after him that much. I know he's the Devil and that makes me the Anti-Christ. Mom and dad were pretty honest with me growing up.

I'm in the 6th grade at St. Peter's Middle School. Catholic school. Dad thinks he's so funny. Anyway, today some of the parents were invited in to talk to the children about their jobs. Guess who jumped at the chance?

I was seated at my desk when he came in. He looked my way, smiled at me, and went to greet my teacher.

""Sister Heather! How are you? You are looking gorgeous, as usual.""

Always the charmer, my Dad.

""Hello Mr. Olnick"" she replied. I could see her blush. ""I'm doing well. How's Mary?""

""She's great. Before I forget, she gave me strict instructions to invite you over for dinner and I wouldn't dare disobey the wife. My Mary can be vicious as a jackal.""

Sister Heather laughed. She is nice, but I have a feeling I'll see her in hell. Dad has a way with people and he loves the clergy. He's fucked three of my teachers so far: Sister Carolin, Sister Francine, and Father Murray. They still come by now and again. By the time I graduate the entire administration will probably be having swingers parties at my house.

After my fathers shameless flirting, Sister Heather got the attention of the class and introduced him.
""Okay class, as you can see we have a guest today. I would like you to give your full attention to Mr. Olnick.""

""Hey there kids! How're we doing today? I'm Dan's dad and he begged me not to embarrass him. I'll try not to, sport.""

He winked at me. I sunk down a bit  in my chair.

""Anyway, I'm here to tell you about my job and, hopefully, encourage you kids to be your best. Some of you probably already know what I do, but for those of you who don't, I'm a local businessman. I like to think I'm a bit more than that, but when you get right down to it, all I really do is sell things. I happen to be very successful, but I wasn't always. 

""When I was young I was miserable. I was working absurd hours for just a tyrant of a boss. One day I told myself 'enough' and I took a chance. I quit my job and went into business for myself. I even took a lot of my former colleagues with me when I left. Now, because I had the guts to take that chance, I'm active in the community, I make my own hours, and I'm doing work that I really enjoy. I'm making dreams come true.

""My company doesn't build cars. We don't drill for oil. What we do is help people reach their true potential. We give people the means to realize their goals. I've personally worked with musicians, artists, politicians. I've even helped one or two of your parents.""

He looked at the disinterested faces of my classmates and pretended to see interest and incredulity.

""That's right, I've worked with the parents of more than a few of you. In fact I'm working on something with Suzy's father right now. You're a lucky lady Susan; your father would give anything for you to succeed. I think you will.""

That dick. He knows I like Suzy. She'll never forgive me if my dad burns her dad in a lake of fire for eternity.

""And kids, I don't think Suzy is alone. I think each and every one of you is going to succeed. I believe that wholeheartedly. There isn't a single one of you I don't see greatness in. So remember, when you are going out into that big world to make your dreams come true, if you ever need help, come see Mr. Olnick at Faustus Solutions. I like to help people. I do what I do for that soul reason""

Today is Parents Day at your university and you've received word that your Dad is going to be there.,SpotlessEternalSun,"The sky was clear and blue, and the sun was bright and shining, so the dean had decided to hold our annual Parents Day outside. My friends, fellow students and I sat in rows of fold out chairs in the courtyard of Yale University. In front us was a large portable stage, and behind us were more rows of the grey and tan metal seats, there for arrival of the parents of university students.

I looked around at my classmates. While many of wore looks of excitement at the thought of seeing their dear old moms and dads again, I sat hunched in my seat; my arms folded and a scowl on my face. It wasn't like I didn't love my dad, but he could tend to be... embarrassing. Hopefully he wouldn't show at this event; I had been extra careful not to mention it to him. 

As we watched more and more parents find their seats in the sea of grey metal, one my friends, Kyle, playfully punched me in the shoulder. 

""Hey Dan, is your dad showing up this year? You hardly mention him, I wanna meet the guy!"" I gave him a smirk. ""Trust me man, you would not like my dad.""

He shrugged. ""I dunno, considering I get along with you, there gotta be some hope, right? I mean, he can't be that bad.""

""You're logic is flawed, Kyle,"" I argued. ""I am nothing like my dad and never will be."" 

""Whatever, dude."" He grinned. ""The apple doesn't fall far from the treeee..."" he teased as he turned his back. 

I laughed and slugged him in the shoulder. I quickly glanced behind me and scanned the growing crowd of parents. From what I could see, nothing yet. 

Soon, the crowd quieted as the dean walked on stage, and approached a podium at the center of the platform. When he was satisfied with the silence, he started his speech.

""Good afternoon students, and a warm welcome to all of the parents who have decided to take a day to visit their hardworking children here at Yale University!"" The crowd clapped at the remark.

""I'm so happy to be celebrating our annual Parents Day here at the University, and pleased to announce that this is the 50th anniversary of the tradition!"" More clapping.

""Yes indeed. September of 1967 was the first-""

Suddenly the ground started to shake as if we were having an earthquake. A loud rumbling made the dean stop in the middle of his sentence, and look around worryingly. Many of the people around me looked scared and confused. I, on the other hand, knew exactly what was happening, and all I could do was stuff my face into my hands and wait for the embarrassment.

The cement ground beneath many of the chairs in the parent audience began to break with a loud cracking sounds. Parents shrieked and began running down the aisles of seats as somewhat of sinkhole started to open up, shallowing half a dozen of the fold up chairs. From the hole, a brillant red color shone, turning the smoke and dust, which had gathered around the hole, turn an eerie crimson. Horrid shrieks from which was not from the living could be heard from the depths of the gaping chasm. 

Then he emerged, twice the size of any of the other parents. He red scaly skin was partially covered by a suit jacket and a bow tie. He wore thin rimmed glasses over he beady eyes, and his horns shimmered evilly. A red pointed tail flicked upwards, shaking off debris and dust. He shook of the rest of it from his suit, then found a metal chair that had not fallen into the hellish sinkhole, and took a seat without saying a word. 

Great, my dad was here. And his name is Satan. 

The crowd kept dead silent as he sat there, looking as though he expected the dean to continue his speech. He glanced around, then noticed me peeking over the edge of my chair. He grinned and waved, then shouted in voice that bellowed loud and menacingly, ""HELLO LIGHT BRINGER!""

Everyone around me simultaneously turned and started at me with wide eyes. All I could do was slink farther into my awkward seat. 

Eventually, the dean stood up from his cowering position behind the podium, and hesitantly sole into his microphone.

""A-a-a-ah y-yes... um... er... hello t-there, sir... um... you m-must be... uh... Dan's father."" My father looked at him quizzicality, then spoke as though he was commanding an army. 

""WHO IS THIS 'DAN' YOU SPEAK OF, MORTAL MAN? I AM FATHER OF LIGHT BRINGER THE SECOND!"" 

""Y-y-yes o-of course... er... P-Prince of Darkness... sir."" He stared at my father, not knowing what to say next.

""WELL? ARE YOU GOING TO CONTINUE, OR MUST I SUMMON A CREATURE TO TORTURE YOU UNTIL YOU DO?""

""N-no I... uh... I mean... t-that's quite alright."" He stood a little straighter, then leaned forward again to speak into the microphone.

""T-t-the tradition of... um... er... p-parents day originated... uh... back i-in the t-t-time of-""

Kyle looked at me with a startled look on his face. ""Please tell me that the devil is not your dad, dude. Please.""

I couldn't help myself as I turned to him and smirked. ""You know, I think you were right, Kyle. You'll probably like him ton. As you might have guessed, he's a real people person. Why don't you go introduce yourself?""

[WP] You are The Spawn of Satan. Rather than be Light Bringer the Second. You just go by Dan. Today is Parents Day at your university and you've received word that your Dad is going to be there.,SpotlessEternalSun,"I sat outside on the balcony of my apartment overlooking the ocean, it was a beautiful day in Cape Town. My friends had always wondered how my parents could afford to buy me an apartment in Camps Bay as a student. I told them my dad is in the insurance industry, pretty much the same thing right? I was smoking a cigarette whilst reading the packaging on the box:

“Warning: cigarettes can kill you.” 

I smirked as I read this as no matter how much time I spend up here I will always find mortality humorous. Don’t get me wrong, in the last three years I’ve spent being a surface dweller I’ve come to love humanity. So much so that it has caused a gaping rift between my father and I, a rift even bigger than the one’s he comes out of but I’ve always wanted to mend that. He’s always been one for grand entrances. I understand where he’s coming from though, I mean if he didn’t do it someone else would and to be honest whenever I’d see the look on the damned’s faces whenever I’d bring out cookies only for them to realise they were littered with raisins was a highlight of my childhood. We had some good times down there. But after spending some time up here and seeing some of the atrocities that happen you begin to question if cruelty is as funny as you think it is or if it’s just… cruel maybe? 

“Hey Dan! Are you ready we’re going to be late!” I heard from beneath me. It was my friend Ryan; he is a terrible person. Some might even say scum of the earth, that’s why I hang out with him. He reminds me of home.

“Yeah I’ll be down as soon as I’m done with this cigarette.”

“You know smoking will kill you right? If the chlamydia doesn’t first!” I got chlamydia in first year and he posted my test results on the dorm notice board as a joke. He’s really shitty but I love it because I know he’s going straight to Home where I’ll be in charge of torturing his soul. I can’t wait to see the look on his face. I made my way downstairs to meet up with Ryan and head to parents day where I will see my dad for the first time in three years.

“So apparently your old man is actually coming this time? Has he finally gotten over the disappoint of having you for a son eh, Dan?”

“Maybe he has but I’m sure once he meets you that disappoint will resurface almost instantly.”

“Ha! Good one Dan, you’re sharper than you look.” 

A normal reaction to this would be a sigh but knowing what’s in store for this guy I couldn’t help but laugh. We arrived timeously at the University of Cape Town’s Jameson Plaza but Father was nowhere in sight amidst the lawn chairs scattered across the cobblestone floor positioned in front of the grand Jameson Hall. Maybe he’s not coming after all? I couldn’t help but feel a little despondent. 

The Vice Chancellor began his longwinded speech about the history of the university and its role in combating Apartheid when out of the blue grey clouds infiltrated the sky and the roar of thunder began to bellow throughout the heavens with lightning striking every few seconds. I could see the fear on people’s faces as the ground began rumble and crack creating a fissure next to the front row of lawn chairs neatly seat out before the steps of the hall.

Really Dad? Lightening? He hasn’t changed one bit.

Suddenly the fissure grew in size and an unidentifiable cacophony of sound beset us from below. After a few moments later the noise was recognisable, it was Highway to hell by AC/DC. I have never cringed so hard in my entire life; this was a seriously kitschy display. Out of the cataclysm peered two horns as a red figure larger than any other at the function emerged in its Sunday best. There he was, Beelzebub, Tokoloshe, The Devil, Satan aka Dad. As he emerged from the depths below as lawn chairs began to fall into the cataclysm with most people managing to escape the plunge save one.

“OMG! Oh my fucking God dad! My dad just fell into that abyss wtf!” shrieked a girl seated in the student section.

“Oh shit my bad, I didn’t think that would happen. But I mean how many years did he really have left anyway? But don’t fret darling, you’ll be seeing him really soon. You may think no one knows what you did last summer but I sure do.” smirked my father. She immediately went pale and sat down.

“Ha ha! Always with the zingers, this guy still has it.” I laughed in reply.

“Ehhhhhh this guy gets it! Light Bringer the Second I’m so happy to see you!” bellowed my father.

“The entrance could use some work and I go by Dan now but boy am I happy to see you too pops!”

All the animosity between us vanished in an instant as vacant stares set upon us as the crowd, who’s notion of reality had just been shattered, gazed at us in disbelief. The VC being the leader that he is tried to regain order.

“If… if.. we could… um… maybe all just… take our seats and err… continue with the ah… pro… proceedings.”

“I’ve only been here two minutes and this is already a drag…” sighed my father.

“To be honest seeing you reminds me of how much of a drag being a surface dweller actually is, let’s head home and bake some cookies?”

“That’s my Light Bringe… er I mean Dan, let’s get out of here!” he exclaimed. 

I hopped on his shoulders and we slowly began our descent back into the depths of Home. As we were going I could not help but derive great pleasure from the scared and confused faces. The last face I saw as we descended was Ryan’s. I looked him in the eyes, smirked and shouted:

“I’ll see you in eight months and two weeks Ryan!”

“Wait… what’s that supposed mean!?” he cried out. I said nothing.

This made things increasingly complex for Dan as he had not mentioned his family to Samantha. She had already introduced him to her parents during last christmas. 
As Dan entered her apartment he could over hear Sam talking with her parents. 

""Yep. Uh huh. Around about. Sure I'll ask. Yes i know. Alright love you too. Bye ""

As she emerged he gave her a peck on the cheek.

""Hey so as you know parents day is tomorrow, my parents just wanted to know if we could have a family lunch. You can bring your parents too""

Thinking this was a bad time to mention his dad kinda is satan he tactifully dodged the question.

"[WP] It turns out that the moon landing was faked, but for a much more sinister reason that conspiracy theorists might have believed.",The_Spicy_Memelord,"Michael Collins felt the breath catch in his throat as he watched the Lunar Module slide away from the command module. He was truly alone now, nothing but himself and the command module and the vacuum of space as he started to slide around the orbit to the far side of the moon. Primal fear mingled with relief after so long in such cramped conditions, and he found himself looking forward to a moment of quiet to appreciate the majesty of the universe, even if a tiny voice in the back of his head was still screaming in terror at the series of terrible decisions that had led to this moment. Then the module slipped over the far side of the moon, and Collins began to learn what true fear was. 

------------

Richard Nixon could read the reports, but he had no idea how to process the information he was seeing. He leveled his gaze on the Secretary of Defense, ""Need to know only Melvin. Code word classified. You so much as breath a word of this to anyone, anyone, who doesn't already know before we get Collins into quarantine and I will leave parts of your body strewn across this continent by sunrise. If the Soviets catch a word of this.... if our own people catch a word of this... It. Will. Not. Happen."" 

Laird nodded, Nixon knew the man had decades of experience in professional lying from Congress, but this went beyond any of that, ""I very much mean what I am telling you Melvin. This is bigger than anything. This is Manhattan on steroids, it makes CHAOS look like a fucking joke. As soon as that module hits ocean, you're on that fucking boat, and you're the first and only person Collins talks to. Are. We. Clear?""

""Clear sir, of course. We can take care of it."" Nixon waved him away, and started reading through the reports again. Little more than the crazed ramblings of the poor controller who had talked to Collins first. Nixon had already made his move to get to him, he just had to hope the Soviets hadn't heard that particular squeal. He had no interest with a prolonged conversation with Malenkov right now. *Damn it* screamed Nixon in his head, banging his fist on the Wilson Desk, *how the hell do we control this? What do we do about it.*?

-----------------

Collins hadn't said a word about anything he'd seen after the first brief transmission to mission control as he'd come back around from the first orbit. Some time over the course of the following twenty six orbits the shock factor had numbed, but there was no denying the gleaming metallic disc clearly visible on the far side of the moon, nor the laser silently tracking his module that was his only companion on each pass. He'd never gad a more euphoric moment in his life then the re-docking of the lunar module thirty-two mind numbing hours later.   ",victorged

This was the literal End of Times.  The Great Destruction of Yggdrasil the World Tree.  The Eternal Darkness.

*If* Valhalla fell.

Loki's wild eyes reflected the madness and chaos in his soul as he slew warrior after warrior.  The night sky burned red, silhouetting Thor's bloody corpse, as it lay mangled and torn at Fenrir's gaping maw.  Odin braced his tired body with his weapon, slowly bleeding out.  If his wounds were not treating soon, he would die along with his children and his Kingdom.

At the edge of the battlefield, far removed from these ancient and powerful heroes, stood a solitary man.  The final hope of Valhalla.  All that remains, the last vestige of sanity.

Or so they told me.

""Accountant Ted, first of your name, son of the Harold of Smiths, step forward!""  Heimdall's commanding voice pierced my skull, demanding obedience.  I may have wet myself.  No, I totally didn't do that, that would be weird.  Heroes don't wet themselves.  I stepped in front of the giant of a man as he held out a small parcel of items to me.  ""Your weapons, as foretold by our ancient prophecies.""  He gazed upon me with all the confidence of a Norse god.  I wet myself again.

I mean, I didn't do that.  I *absolutely* stepped forward with full grace and poise, and accepted the godly gift of-

Oh, shit.  ""Lord, uh, Heimdall, sir?""  I barely squeaked, before asking him about the contents of the package.

The man laughed, in that hearty, Nordic way that warmed your soul while simultaneously terrifying you to your very core.  ""What was that, Accountant Ted?  Speak up, lad!""  He leaned in closer and I repeated my question.

Have you ever done something so insanely stupid that your mother, or your boss, or some authoritative figure had no response for you other than to stare at you in utter disbelief?  Imagine that, except for your mother is Heimdall - the far-seeing - whose gaze *literally* pierces time and space, and instead of, say, breaking the cookie jar, you're in the middle of a battlefield for all of creation and you've asked a Norse God if he was mistaken.

You might have an inkling of what happened to me.  He simply patted me on the head, and nudged me forward, muttering something about my destiny and how silly humans can be.

And suddenly I was in front of the God of Tricks, Loki himself.  I looked back, Heimdall was miles behind me.  I fought the urge to retch at the scent of death and battle around me.  Honestly no description is enough for how bad it is.  And this is coming from the guy who won the ""Mystery Crisper Item Challenge"" in the office fridge three years in a row.

Fenrir *literally* crushed the skull of a man three times my size not twenty feet from me, and my knees buckled.  Loki stared down at my quivering form in disbelief and mockery.  ""What's this?  A tiny morsel for my son?""  He laughed.  I didn't blame him.

I mean, I'm *Ted the fucking Accountant*.  What the fuck was I supposed to do against a Norse God?

*Your weapons, Hero Accountant Ted!  Your weapons!*  Heimdall's voice was somehow projected directly to my consciousness.  With shaking hands and barely enough strength to lift the items in my hands, a sudden realization dawned on me.

But it couldn't be.  No.  It couldn't be that simple.

What else did I have at my disposal but what I knew best?  The same strategy that had resolved the Titan crisis on Olympus only three years ago?  And had led to several months of delayed peace between heaven and hell.  Could this be why they had called upon me, again?

It must be right.  Loki's confusion at my sudden confidence was the last signal I needed.  After all, I'm *Ted the fucking Accountant*.

I pulled out my pen, a stack of papers, and the clipboard in the parcel.  ""Excuse me, Loki.  I'll be needing to see your Ten-Ninety-Four W for public destruction of galactic property before I can allow you to continue.""

""My what?""

""Your Ten-Ninety-Four W, sir.  Also, you'll be needing seven forms of identification, none of which can be a driver's license or birth certificate - which I will also need, if you would, thanks.  And I'm sure you've already registered your cute little dog, er, son under the Mystical Creatures and Beasts Registration Act?  I can see by the look of confusion on your face that you haven't.  You'll be needing a Seventeen-Forty A, B, and D for that.  You may want to pick those up on your way back.""

""I am Loki, Destroyer of Worlds, and I will n-""

""I appreciate your position, sir, I really do.""  I interrupted.  ""Now if you will kindly grab those forms.  OH!  And you'll be needing to register your staff with a Seven-Thirty-Three C.  Wait.  Is it ensorceled itself?  Oooh, you'll be needing a Seven-Thirty-Three ***D*** then, that's a nasty one!""  I gave him an apologetic chuckle.  ""You can pick those up at the Valhalla Office of Magical Acquisitions.""

""Listen, you pathetic human, I will not be interru-""

It took my brain a moment to register Loki's head as it toppled from his body.  Heimdall's bloody sword arced through the air as Fenrir's maddened gaze softened, no longer under his Father's spell.  All of Valhalla - what remained of it, at least - erupted in cheers and joyous celebration as Heimdall nodded to me in respect, grabbing the Allfather.

Valhalla vanished in a lazy haze, and I found myself once again at my desk, staring at my sandwich.  The only evidence a small note written in Nordic script - which I handily discovered I could now read, pretty neat!

""Valhalla will sing tales of your bravery for eons.

""-Your friend, Heimdall""

In all my years I've learned two very important lessons.  One is that heroes don't necessarily come in capes, they don't always carry swords as weapons, and their size is not indicative of their bravery or their capability.

The other is that you should never - and I mean *never* - fuck with accountants.",LedgeEndDairy

Except instead of rising to a glorious land, it rose to the gruesome remnants of a civilization, so crowded with corpses that it was impossible to see the ground.

Now I know what you're thinking. If Valhalla is a heaven for warriors, how the hell did so many people die twice?

Loki found a way.

In fact, Valhalla had so many corpses that the only people alive were a group of warriors who happened to be out at lunch at the time, including Odin.

""O mighty Asgardian warriors, this is the darkest day we have ever faced. Many of our brethren have died, and many more will follow. But fear not, for our savior has come, and his name is Ted!""

Imagine a twig in human form. Your mental image perfectly encapsulates Ted.

""Hey guys? This job has a little too responsibility for me.""

""You guys don't need to do this for me. I told you, I'm over Vanessa-""

Where once my eye did sit.
It's a dumb tale,
But I know you'll ask it.


When I was young
I took a hiking trip.
Trip's a good word
Since down a cliff, I slipped.


As I sat there,
I spied me an acorn.
Tales remembered,
The hat becomes a horn!


I pried the nut
Away from the small hat.
It shot my eye,
And that's really all that.


I lost my eye

"[WP]: Every day on your way to work you pass a house with a sign in the window. ""WE DO NOT HAVE A DRAGON. PLEASE GO AWAY."" Written in crayon.",actually_crazy_irl,"A few months, a few lawyers, and a few lies to government officials later and Amelia is all mine.

Since her parents had left no way to contact them, there was no way to settle who owned the house and it's contents, so it still belonged to them despite them wanting nothing to do with it. Me and Amelia didn't mind, my little house had room for the both of us. And my paints as long as I was willing to give up using my garage as a garage.

After that was settled and Amelia was in school I knew I wouldn't be able to stall any longer. We would have to go see Mike, and that meant I would have to spend a day in a cave in the woods. But a promise is a promise, and I have to set a good example for Amelia. So we mark off a Saturday and just go.

Since Amelia only knows the way to Mike's cave from her old back yard we start there. From there we trek over logs, branches, boulders, and animal poop for what feels like a hour before we arrive at a hole in woods that Amelia assured me was where Mike lived when he wasn't taking care of little girls.

""Mike! We made it! Please come out before Martha gets bored and wants to leave"" Amelia shouts into the cave.

For a few moments there is silence, but just after I come to the conclusion that we have the wrong cave we hear a loud **wumph** and then suddenly there is a dragon behind us.

""Amelia, Martha, good of you to visit. How long have you been waiting out here?""

""Not long. And even if it was, it's my fault for not setting up a good time to visit before you left."" I reply, relived that he arrived when he did so we didn't assume we had the wrong cave.

""Well come inside, we have a lot of catching up to do.""

I don't know what I was expecting when I went looking for a dragon's cave, but what I saw wasn't it. The walls and ceiling were made of stone so smooth it shone. The floor may have shone at one point, but months of claws moving back and forth across it had created a series of scratches that gave it an interesting texture. There where sparsely placed torches providing lighting, the smoothness of the walls allowing the light to travel much further than it should have.

We reached the end of the tunnel, which widened out  into a large circular room. There was no proper furniture, but there where several rounded stones of the same texture as the walls that we could sit on.

""It took some redecorating, the bear who used to live here had no patience for interior design. Or fire breath, that was very helpful.""

""I can see why you like it. And I can see why you decided it wasn't a suitable living place for Amelia.""

""Yes, grand as it is, it lacks many things you humans find necessary. Running water and refrigeration being chief among them. But it's just fine for a visit on a Monday. Why are you visiting on a Monday? Shouldn't Amelia be in school?""

""It's Saturday. Remind me to buy you a calendar.""

""Ah, yes. So, how is school Amelia?""

""It's great! There are teachers and students and books! I can read the letter E now""

""She can read a lot more than the letter E, and her teachers tell me she's doing well considering she's missed a whole year of school.""

""That's wonderful, and how is life with a mother?""

""Martha's nice. She lets me cook noodles, but she makes a lot of food too. Did you know you can eat hot dogs and mac'n'cheese *at the same time*? She also cleans the house, did you know houses don't actually smell like smoke? And she makes me take baths. That's not fun""

""But it makes you smell much better, and not smelling bad makes making friends easier."" I add. The moment I mention friends Amelia's eyes light up, and she decides to share the next part of her new life on her own 

""I have friends Mike! And not dragon friends, but other kids like me! There's Susan, and Lisa, and the other Susan, and George. They don't believe I know a dragon but that's ok because I'm not allowed to tell them I know one""

""They sound like good friends. Well, that's enough catching up for the day. We need to save some time for the game you brought. Don't think I didn't see you trying to hide it Amelia.""

Amelia takes the box we brought with us out from behind her back.

""I didn't have Clue, but I do have Parcheesi. Amelia says it's an acceptable substitute as long as you remember your peice's names.""

""Then I shall cheat and name them all Rodger.""

We played a round and Amelia won. By the time we finished, it was time to leave. We said our goodbyes and then I used my phone to find a way from the cave to our house that didn't involve cutting through someone else's yard.

We got home later than expected, so I let Amelia make us some ramen. After that I get her to bed and get back to work on my latest painting. Anyone would say it was a wonderful fantasy piece, in reality it was a very bad portrait of Mike.

After I had enough of trying and failing to get his horns right, I checked on Amelia and found her sleeping soundly from a long day of walking through woods and utterly destroying two adults at Parcheesi. Then I head to bed myself.

As I got changed and settled down for night, all the worries about Amelia and work and a million other things ambush me at once, and I have to remind myself that everything's going to be OK. Sure things are confusing and messy, but right now everyone is exactly where they need to be.",Gregamonster

I've walked by this house a dozen times, and that sign always makes me smile. However, as a representative of the Homeowners association I have a job to so, and today that means asking the owners of this home to take it down.

*knock knock*

""We do not have a dragon, please go away""

The little girl who answers the door immediately parrots the message on the sign, as if that was a actual concern.

""Hello sweety, can I speak with your mother?""

""No""

""Why not?""

""She's in Canada""

""Well then who is taking care of you?""

""Mike""

""Can I speak with mike?""

""No""

""Why not?""

""Because he's moot""

""Think you mean mute.""

""He's that too""

""Well I know sign language, so I can still talk to him, can I come in?"" I do not know sign language, but at this point I am more concerned about verifying that this child has some kind of guardian than communicating with them.

""No, I'm not allowed to let strange ladies inside the house and we don't have a dragon""

""I never said you had a dragon.""

""Good, cus' the sign says we don't""

""No it doesn't, it says you're having a bake sale.""

""What, that stupid dragon said he could read and that it said...... oops""

""Sweety, I really need to talk with whatever adult is charge of you. We have important adult things to talk about.""

""You can't tell anyone about Mike!""

""Why not?""

""Cus' he's a dragon""

""Ok, I won't tell anyone."" This dragon business is getting old, I need to talk to an adult as soon as possible.

The little girl, whose name I failed to ask for in my rush to speak with an adult, leads me through the home. The whole place smells like ash, this Mike must be a chain smoker. 

Or a dragon.

We reach what may have been a living room at some point. I can't tell, because the whole thing has been rearranged into a makeshift nest. And there at the center of it is a dragon. Not a little lizard, a massive, green, scaly beast venting smoke from it's nostrils.

""This is Mike, he's a dragon""

""Amelia, who is our visitor?"" The beast's voice is like sandpaper over stone.

""I don't know, she said she had to talk to my adult and she tricked me into telling her you where a dragon""

""I'm Martha Jamison, I'm with the Homeowners association. I was here about the sign in your yard, but clearly there are bigger matters to discuss.""

""Amelia, why don't you go get our guest some water?""

""Real water or stay-out-of-the-room water?""

""The second one"" Mike chuckled as Amelia left the room, and then turned his attention to me. ""I was wondering how long it would take for someone to notice.""

""I'm not sure what I'm noticing right now.""

""I would have thought you would know a dragon when you saw one, you humans draw us enough."" Mike had sat up now, his long neck arcing to fit under the ceiling.

""How did you come to be Amelia's gaurdian? Where are her parents?""

""That is a long story, but the short version is her parents left her here and I found her here. Obviously I couldn't just leave her alone, but going through the proper channels is difficult when you are a dragon.""

""Who is providing for her? How can you keep her fed when your hiding in here?""

""You would be amazed at what you can get done over the internet without letting anyone see your face."" He moved one of his wings to show me his work station, which consisted of a small computer and a large stack of various trading cards.

""She does most of the typing and packing, her hands are much better suited for it. But I assure you I am the one  dealing with our customers, she's much too young to be speaking with strangers online."" 

There is a long pause while we wonder how to deal with the question we both know has to come next.

""You know she can't live in hiding here forever.""

""I know, but it's just so hard to say goodbye. That and I'm a dragon, so there isn't much I can do to change the situation."" Mike was either sulking or hungry. It's hard to tell with someone whose head is made of angles and horns.

""I can see what I can do, but I can't in good conscience just leave her here. She needs a better life than hiding in here to keep a dragon secret, and she needs to be in school.""

""Are you married, Martha?""

""I'm still searching. Why?""

""I was hoping you might want to adopt her, sending her to a home that already knew about me would make a great many thing easier. But if you have no husband I don't want to burden you with a child.""

""Who says I need a man to have a kid?""

""Basic biology.""

""Biology doesn't work with social services.""

""So you are willing to take her?""

""I'd like to get to know her better first, but I don't see why not. She's seems like a sweet kid."" It took me a few moments to process what I had just agreed to. I was a busy woman and a child was a lot of responsibility. But I couldn't just do nothing, looking at the shredded living room, and the cluttered and smoke stained rooms leading to it it was clear a dragon was not a suitable guardian, no matter how well meaning.

""Marvelous, I'm sure we can arrange some time for you to spend with her.""

""Mike, I got some stay-out-of-the-room water"" Amelia walked into the room with two cups of water, and one metal bucket. It was an acrobatic feat to behold.

""Amelia dear, do you still miss your mother?""

""A little""

""Would you like a new one?""

""Not her, she's sneaky""

""We haven't decided who it should be yet, but Ms. Jamison here is going to help me find you one.""

""You said you wouldn't tell anyone about Mike"" Amelia scowled at me for my perceived betrayal, clearly trying to imitate a cross dragon.

""And I won't, but Mike isn't a human and there are a lot of things you need that humans have to give you.""

Amelia through about this until she could come up with a counter argument.

""If I go then who will help Mike sell braceball cards? No one because he's a dragon and people are scared of him""

""I was taking care of myself long before I was taking care of you child, I will be fine."" Mike grumbled, slightly amused.

I made plans to come see Amelia the next day, and got her permission to take down the sign that started this little adventure. 

As I walked home I thought about what I had gotten myself into, worried of it really was the right choice. My own mother's advice rung in the back of my mind: *The best we can do is rarely enough, but if we let that stop us then we end up with nothing at all.* Then I recalled some slightly less helpful advice: *An art studio is a waste of a bedroom. Houses should be full of people, not paint.*

Guess I have to find somewhere else to keep my art supplies.",Gregamonster

First off, Every day I pull out of my drive way I'm met with a small sign as I pass their front yard.


'We DO Not Have A Dragon. Please Go AWAY!'


Written, in red crown, by my daughter...I told them they could take it down but...well...they seemed to like it. They Even got it made in special plastic board so it wouldn't melt or get ruined in the weather.

&amp;nbsp;


Second; the noises coming from their house every night are somehow a mixture of children's laughter and the nightmarish noises dinosaurs made in Jurassic park. If I have to explain why this is troubling then i might as well not bother with the rest of this story.

&amp;nbsp;


Lastly, On the odd weekend, the pyrotechnics they hold in their back yard would make most 80's hair bands jealous.

&amp;nbsp;


But they don't make bad people. Like I said, we're pretty close for neighbors.

&amp;nbsp;


John Smith, the Husband, neat guy. Works at the bank. Got me set up with some awesome account perks when I switched over to them.


Susan Smith, the Wife, Nice enough woman. Has never looked a day over 25. She works at the Library. My daughter, Penelope, loves her summer book readings there. 


And their Son, John Jr,  Smart Kid. Hes in the same class as my Penelope, 6th grade. Hes her BFF, He spends Weekends over at our house or she goes over there for a night. They love the same cartoon shows and do the same summer programs. I worry Penelope might have a bit of a crush on him, what with how much she gawks over him n' all. Most of the other boys in class still have cooties, but soon she'll be in middle school, Should I be worried?

&amp;nbsp;


Anyways, So, Every Summer they leave for a week. Some sort of  out of state Family get together over the Solstice. I never see them leave, but they often have me and Penelope water their indoor plants while they're gone, pick up their mail, y'know...Neighborly stuff.

&amp;nbsp;


Well, the 'event' occurred during that solstice weekend.  I went with Penelope to get their mail. Water their plants. Today their Door was unlocked though. Seeing as how I was the only person I knew they gifted a key to, I mean, I can be forgetful, did I just not lock it when I came through to water their plants the other day? Best to do a small check. I set Penelope to water the plants while I did a small check. Nothing seemed missing. Not that I would know where they held their valuables. But I mean, no harm no fowl right? Would hate if they lost trust in us because I forgot. As I walked back into the hallway though. I noticed the sound of metal clinking, coming from the room I used to hang with John and a few of the other guys in during our Fantasy football league meetings.

&amp;nbsp;


Creeping up I look in. There's no one around but the book shelf is...open...leading into a deep dark space. Some sort of hidden room? Wait...Did John have some sort of...Porn Dungeon? I would hate it if I had entrusted my daughter with some sort of...sicko...So I looked in.

&amp;nbsp;


Behind the hidden door was some sort of natural cave structure. It went in pretty deep, and it was so dark I could barely make out anything. But well, there was a shape, Looked almost like a Guy in...... a guy in...knights armor? walking down deeper into the darkness?

&amp;nbsp;


So...Intruders? DO I call the cops? Suddenly. I hear Penelope behind me. 


&gt;Daddy?

&amp;nbsp;


I look Back, God she was my Pride and Joy. Ever since I lost her mother. Do I send her home? Take her with me?  Why did she look like she was worried? 

&amp;nbsp;


Before I can figure out my answer shes already sprinting past me, down into the dark 

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;**PENELOPE**

&amp;nbsp;


I Scream, my echoes loosing her to the darkness.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;**SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT**

&amp;nbsp;


I Start the sprint into the cave myself. 

**DAMN ITS DARK. SO DAMN DARK SO DAMN DARK PLEASE LET ME CATCH PENELOPE. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASEPLEEASEPLEASEPLlllLLLEEeeeeeeease**


Panic rushing through my veins, my heart pumping so fast that I don't even care if I can see or not. 


I'm running so fast I don't see the pitfall.
And man is it a fall

&amp;nbsp;


I don't even have time to scream before I hit the ground and all the air gets pushed out of me.


When I awake, I'm a little groggy, how many moments have passed? Penelope? God Penelope...I...Where are you Oh god I lost you, I lost you, please Penelope no noo-?
NO YOU CAN""T HURT THEM! YOU'RE A BAD MAN! EVIL WICKED LET GO OF ME.
Then I hear her voice, and it doesn't matter how sore I am. How cloudy my head. But I pull myself up and I drag my ass across the stone walls towards her . At some point I see a light. Soon that light grows til I'm able to see where its coming from. Its like a big Flaming starm sitting at the very peek of a Dome Stone room. The Floor is littered...with....jewels? and gold...and....God knows what else. 
Whats more important, is whats on top of the Jewels. Yeah...Theres the knight armored guy alright. He's got some sort of glowy sword. He's lost his helmet, and no...hes got Penelope in his other arm and shes kicking and screaming. 

&amp;nbsp;


And on the other side

&amp;nbsp;


Three Massive Lizard like Monsters. One Red, One White and One smaller one Flecked With Both Colors. All of them have Long necks, Reptilian eyes, sharp teeth. They're staring the knight down but aren't making a move. Just looking, the smaller One looks pretty beat up.

&amp;nbsp;


And Penelope is screaming


&gt;LET ME GO
&gt;THEY'RE GOOD DRAGONS
&gt;WHY COULDNT YOU READ THE SIGN

&amp;nbsp;


And I'm trying my best to piece whats happening now...but well...that fucker has my daughter. Take Care of that first. Work out The Lizards later.
In the mess of...Should I call this treasure? I find something blunt and heavy. Which isn't too hard...As I figure most of this stuff has to be pure freaking gold or something. The statuette I'm holding has to be like 100lbs at least. 
And The guys too busy with the dragons to bother looking behind him. 
I raise the Statue, and

&amp;nbsp;


**THUP** 

&amp;nbsp;


right into his temple. He Drops His sword and Penelope, and Tumbles pretty succinctly unto the pile of treasure he was standing on. I then Quickly Pick up his sword. Grabbing Penelope by the wrist and pulling her behind me. 
The Dragons just blink. As If they're surprised I just did what I did...hell...I surprised myself. We just stand there til I feel Penelope shake from my grasp, before I can catch her shes running to the flecked one. Wrapping her arms around her its neck crying.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Wait, Penelo-


&gt;Its Okay Mike...

&amp;nbsp;


I look over, it came from where the Big Red One was. But Instead of nightmarish Dinosaur I'm met with John, the manager of my local bank, Fantasy Football League Competitor... and Guy generally good at making Guacamole. 


When look over, I see Susan...and Penelopes tearing over John Jr... who looks pretty beat up.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;....Fuck me


I drop the sword, and fall on my ass on top of the gold, next to the guy Im thinking I may have killed.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;You Okay?...I'm sure you have some questions?


John Asks, Reaching down to pull me up.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Yeah...Like...What The Fuck is this?

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;...Maybe Ill explain that to you...over drinks?

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Yes....Yes Please'

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
And well...As I Find out. My Neighbors were actually some sort of fire breathing lizard species. One that's often confused for Mythical Dragons due to their similar well everything. It Just so happens that professional 'Hunters' like to try and slay them for their skin. My daughter found out like...4 summers ago and I'm just getting into the loop.

&amp;nbsp;


Now...Standing On my porch...Looking over the fence as I hear them play What has to be Jurassic World over movie quality speakers...I Can honestly attest.

This time Mike properly introduces himself as ""Mikrollthen"". Apparently Amelia couldn't pronounce that. I try a few times until he tells me he's grown fond of being called Mike. Then the three of us sit down for a game of Clue, which Mike tells me is her favorite game. 

""I'll start, I will be the beautiful Madam Peacock"" Amelia declares, retrieving her pawn with a flourish.

""You realize all the pieces look the same."" I protest.

""Madam Peacock is blue, and blue is the most beautiful of the colors, therefore she is the beautiful Madam Peacock"" she replied, not backing down from her stance.

Mike looks over the board, as if who he chose could determine the outcome of the game. ""I think I shall be Professor Plum, would you stick him on the board Amelia?"" 

She puts the purple pawn on his square, and then looks at me to analyze my choice.

The remaining pawns all seem interchangable to me,  so I just pick Mr. Green because I was sitting the closest to where he starts on the board.

When the playing starts I begin to see why it's Amelia's favorite. Every time she makes an accusation she lays out a wild scenario that explains just how and why poor Mr. Black was killed. Mike plays along and gives equally outlandish reasons for his accusations, along with describing his proof to counter her's instead of simply stating that he had one of those cards.

It isn't long before I start playing along, until I finally end the game by proving without a doubt that Ms. White killed Mr. Body with the candlestick in the conservatory after he rejected her request for a raise. 

As the winner I get the honor of putting the box away, and then we have dinner.

Amelia makes us some ramen in the microwave, I offer to help but she insists that she has to do it or it doesn't taste right. Looking around I can see the remains of the days other meals, it's apparent she's doing all the cooking.

""Isn't that bowl a little small for a dragon?"" I ask, seeing that Amelia has prepared three normal sized bowls.

""Mike says he can get his own food from the woods, but I like making him food anyways, deers don't taste as good as noodles""

As we eat I begin to wonder how Mike is able to fit through the sliding door in the back of the living room to hunt. It's large, but Mike is easily the size of a Clydesdale even with his wings tucked in.

Over dinner we discuss everything from Amelia's favorite movie to how we could go through the adoption process without mentioning that her previous caregiver was a dragon. Eventually we get to the real question: what is a dragon doing in North Carolina?

""My brood lived in the mountains, by the one that looks like a small mountain placed on a larger one."" He explains. I recognized the description of Pilot Mountian, I drove past it whenever I visited my mother. 

*I should do that again soon, she'd love Amelia to peices.*

The thought caught me off gaurd. I kept telling myself I hadn't decided anything yet, and yet I kept making plans assuming Amelia would be a part of them. I refocused on Mike's tale to distract myself from my own indecisiveness.

""After the last of the whelps where old enough to need their own hunting grounds, I had determined to find a new place to nest. The old one smelt too much like Sarcelthia, and it was far too large and empty for an old widower like me to be keeping for myself. I flew South and found a nice cavern North of here. The bear who currently lived there didn't seem to keen on moving, but I was able to persuade him to leave"" Mike vented some smoke from his nostrils to demonstrate just how the bear was persuaded.

""Then not more than a moon later I hear a voice shouting in the woods, it was little Amelia looking for her parents. I normally make it a point to stay out of the affairs of Humans, but an old father can't ignore a frightened child for long so I went to see what the fuss was about.""

""Amelia was startled at first. But she was also very young at the time, and so a giant flying lizard asking what was wrong didn't seem to be any stranger to her than another human asking. She told me she had woken up to find her parents missing, and when they hadn't returned by lunch she decided they must be in danger and she would have to find them herself.""

I try and fail to avoid tearing up at the thought of anyone being able to just abandon their own child like that, and how frightened Amelia must have been. Amelia must have noticed because she moved over to give me a hug and assure me she doesn't die at the end of the story.

""I'm not entirely familiar with my hunting grounds yet, but I'm sure I would have noticed a pair of humans stomping about it. I promise to tell her if I find her parents and escort her back home. Fortunately she lived at the edge of the woods, so I was able to do so unseen.""

""As I turn to leave Amelia stops me, and asks if I can read. I'd never been to one of your schools, but you leave those ridiculous giant signs all over the place, and after a few hundred years of them I was fairly confident in my ability to puzzle out at least the general meaning of anything she needed. She rushed inside and came back with a note that had apparently been the only thing left in her parents room.""

""The print was small but my eyes are sharp, so I read the best I could. The note had been left for Amelia's nanny, and described how her parents felt 'trapped' by the burden of a child, they had run off and left little Amelia in the nanny's care. Apparently they didn't realize that their nanny hadn't shown up for work in almost a month, and Amelia was taking care of herself while they where away at work.""

""Amelia was heartbroken. It was all I could do to keep her from running off after them, despite the fact that she still had no idea where they actually where. Feeling anything she tried to do to locate her parents would only result in her hurting herself I promised to stay with her until this was all sorted out.""

""Unfortunately this may have done more harm than good. Because now that there was a dragon in the picture my own safety had to be considered, and anything I could do to find her a new home meant speaking with humans who were old enough to be afraid of dragons. After it became clear my options where either to hope Amelia could find the right adults to be placed in a new home or stay here and take care of her myself I chose the later. It may not have been the best choice, but it ceartaly felt like it was at the time.""

From what I had seen I could tell that living with a dragon had been less than ideal for Amelia, but I also understood how hard it would have been leave her alone without any assurance that she would be ok.

""Fortunately the bills has just been played, so I had time to work out a way to provide for Amelia from her. The only television station she was allowed to watch was primarily educational in nature, and it allowed me to fill in the gaps years of reading billboards could not. Then we set out to find a way to make money to keep the lights on.""

""Amelia found a box full of these cards in her parents room, and informed me that her father had always said they where valuable. Then she showed me how he used the computer to get more, and I puzzled out how to do the reverse and sell them ourselves.""

I looked back at the small computer in the corner of the room, it's parts haphazardly placed on top of each other. Clearly they had been moved to make it more dragon accessible.

""With some trial and error I was able to guide Amelia through the process, and we began buying and selling these little cards to scrape by. We had to cut a few things out of our budget, the television hasn't had any channels for a few months now, but we've managed quite impressively all things considered.""

When it seems like the story is over I look back out the clear sliding doors to see the sun had gone down quite some time ago. I get up and begin saying my goodbyes when Mike stops me to ask something.

""Have you made a decision yet Martha? I know it's only been two days, but the sooner Amelia can get back to living something resembling a normal life the better off she will be.""

""I keep telling myself I haven't, but I think I may have already decided yes before I left yesterday.""

""That's wonderful. I know this may be hard for the two of you, but I know that her life can only improve if she goes with you.""

Amelia stood up suddenly, as if she had finally proccesed what today's visit was about.

""You can't leave Mike! Who will help you with the braceball cards if you go? Or who will cook you noodles""

""I will be fine dear, and you need to be with someone who can take care of you properly.""

""But *you* take care of me, I don't need another you""

""Child, I have been taking care of you, but I haven't been doing a very good job of it. I promise you the very first night you spend with Martha will show you just how much you have been missing.""

""I don't want you to go away Mike, I'll miss you.""

""I won't be going anywhere. My cave is still there in the woods, I'm sure Martha will let you visit of you show her the way there.""

I am not a 'in the woods' kind of person, but one heartbroken stare from Amelia is all it takes to convince me to say yes.

""I still don't want you to go""

""Neither do I, but as you get older you will learn that what you want to do and what you have to do for the good of those you love are two different things. Now I want you to behave, it will take some time to arrange things so Martha can be your mother and I will have to be gone for most of it.""

""Can I still be here tonight, I don't want to have to go till I have to go""

""Of course you can child, now it's well past your bed time so you should get ready. Say goodbye to Martha""

""Goodbye to Martha"" Amelia says with a grin as I head out the door.",Gregamonster

That’s a saying to live by, especially when you’re speeding away from a planet you just killed, and you’re *still* being told you’re the good guy.
	
To be *good* is to be *flawed*, as too often we achieve the right things by doing the wrong things, burdening our souls with a thousand pains. It’s a job nobody should want, but if somebody doesn’t step up, everyone will fall. I never thought that somebody would be me, but I just pressed that button, I just ended everything we’ve ever known.
	
“We’ll be there soon,” captain said over the com. “Everyone strap in, because once this baby kicks up we’re gonna be in for one hell of a dangerous ride.”
	
The reason I…killed everyone, is because Earth is a smoldering wreck. Years of abuse turned it into the sun’s punching bag, and without any water, people went *nuts*. We’d discovered a habitable planet a few years ago, and though we aren’t ready to capitalize, we *have* to.
	
This ship is humanity’s last hope, and as such, was made using the last resources we could scrounge from earth recesses. It’s a spare part junker but the smartest minds put the worst parts in the best order and *bam,* we’re flying, baby. Over ten thousand people are in the back, sleeping quietly in pods. They’re the future. They’re the only hope we have.
	
*We’re* the only hope we have.
	
So in this world where good and bad don’t exist, I’m just a man doing everything I can to ensure the human race survives, and if the people we left behind must claw at my soul until the end of time, then so be it.

Keep in mind, for others, I may not be. I may be a villain to some, a simple man to a very few. But I *am* the protagonist. The protagonist is the one who saves the girl, banishes the evil, and I did that. I did all of that.

I did all of that to everyone. With no one left on Earth, I have gotten rid of all evil, without it being necessarily shown or not. I am a protagonist, not a miracle worker. If I were a miracle worker I'd have made sure evil never truly existed.

Where are all the evildoers now? I'd like to tell you, but you really don't need to tell you. In fact, I'm sure you'd be there to- you're human. you're evil.

I, however, am the protagonist. I'm not allowed to be evil. I was locked up by some deadbeats who claimed to be 'putting me to justice.' Can you believe that? Justice is what I breathe off of! That means I really AM justice!

So yeah. I'm the protagonist. The best part is, I knew that I couldn't get rid of *all* evil, not alone anyway. So, I spread my name. 'Cleanse the Evil!' I shouted at random people. They were evil, too. They ignored me.

Then, I met Mary. She wasn't evil. She listened to me. I knew someone would. I only knew her name because she told me it as I spread my lessons to her.

I am the protagonist- the protagonist needs a sidekick, so Mary and I spread our word together. Then I had to kill her too. She tried to tell me I was evil. Can you believe the nerve?

So yeah. Now everyone is dead. Everyone dead, which means no evil. I am the protagonist.

Wait, what's this?

The planet. It's repopulated. I missed two of them! How could I be so careless... Man and Woman. I've no clue how I can prove it, but they are evil too. I'll set up a little test, maybe. Get them thinking about who they are, and whether they should exist too.

I am THE protagonist. I deserve retribution amongst these damned humans. They've all got evil in them, I swear. It's like they all wanna die!

I am the protagonist. I may not be the only protagonist amongst history, but right now I am the protagonist.

"[WP] The protagonist kills everyone in the world, but they aren't a villain.",jimbotherisenclown,"He walked through empty streets, the light of the sun was fading and street lights flicked on around him, but not all many of the stubborn lights could not  wake. Above him flew cars, carrying their loads to places determined long ago, to fulfil needs no longer needed. The cars too were stubborn, but they could not last without purpose or repair they fluttered to the streets, leaves from an Autumn tree, not fast two or three would fall each day despite their diligence, one  day he would look to the sky and the tree would be bare. 

The man stopped at a door, set aside from every other door the man had walked past by the ray of light that shone through the small rectangular window, set just at the right height for the man to look through, or for someone else to look out.

He stood still content to wait rather than announce his presence, this was his daily task, repetition can breed boredom and frustration, in this man it bred patience. A face appeared made strange in the frosted glass, it squinted through the glass for just a moment before a wide hatchet smile split it, and the door swung ajar.

""Sorry doctor I wasn't sure who it was for a moment.""  Said the short old man smile still plastered to his face but his voice shook"" Who else could it be George?"" came the reply. ""Yeah,"" George paused long enough to rub a hand through his short grey hair and scratch just twice at the back of his head.  ""It's so easy to forget. It shouldn't be I know but every day I set down my book and look to the kitchen door for my Molly to walk in with a pot of tea. Every sound in the street I think it's that bastard Pete come to complain about my garden again?"" His voice cracked at the mention of Molly and a little bit when he mentioned that bastard Pete. ""It is very easy to forget George."" Said the doctor, with no mention of what he forgot or what he didn't.

""I should get you some Tea Doctor."" ""No thank you George. Are you ready?"" ""Not a man to beat around the bush are you Doctor?"" ""I prefer to get right into the bush when I can George.""  For the first time George's smile reached up to wrinkle the corner of his eyes, he let out a little snort of almost laughter. ""What do you need Doctor?""  ""Nothing George, just sit down and relax.""

George reclined in his chair, like he did dozens or hundreds of times before, at least enough that it had shaped to fit his body, he was tense in the way of a man who was trying to force himself to relax. The doctor reached into his pocket and withdrew a needle, ""are you sure George?"" George turned his head unwilling to look at the needle but when he spoke his voice was steady ""I am Doctor time to be with Molly, do it fast so I don't have to think about it. ""Don't worry George I have some practice with this  situation. "" He slipped the needle in as he spoke, George's body relaxed.

The Doctor stepped into the street through a dark doorway the same as Every other door on the street, his work done for the day and time to head home to relax. Tomorrow he will walk in through bright doorways and out through dark, mettalic leaves will drift down to the ground, stubborn lights will fail to light, one day no light will shine, the tree will be bear, and the doctor will not walk out through that dark doorway.

While stare blankly at the pocket of space where a planet had so recently been, I couldn't help but feel a little cheated. For years I lived thinking I could die at any moment, of seeing ships with thousands of people disappear, and this was all it built up to? There were still a few visible rocks left. Rocks, where an entire civilization had grown for thousands of years. I should be happy, I know. But why is it I feel so numb instead? So withdrawn into reflection and questions.   

Maybe there's some sort of lesson to take from this, so that we live differently. Some catchy phrase to teach our children, so this does not become our planet someday? I decide to try a few:
*Species that bring destruction to others, bring it unto themselves.* 
*Life is short, go out with a bang!*
*Rocks and dust are the true inheritors of our universe.*
I give up. There is no lesson that I can create - I don't even understand what reasons, what forces of nature, led us to this war. 

Do you think I'll get a refund on my xenoculture courses that covered humanity, now that they're gone? Those months I spent learning their languages, their history, their culture. Worthless. I'll never have a chance to use that knowledge again. 

I give a final glance through the hull, and for the last time in these dozen years, wonder how it came to this. What truly led them to declare war after being peaceful neighbors for so long? To inhabit and pillage the resources from our worlds without warning, to attack our ships and settlements? Was it greed that drove them to it? Did they think that they were sure to win? That they understood us and knew us to be lesser in strength, intelligence, or adaptability than themselves? Or could it have been something else entirely? 

I feel the first pangs of hunger and break myself from my trance. It doesn't matter now, I tell myself I should focus on the future. Slowly I make my way towards the ship's canteen and wonder what the celebrations will be like.",alteern

Ten years later you are on top of the world, but bored. Time to see where the red line leads.",ElPresidenteCamacho,"I remember when I first noticed those fateful lines before me. I was in 7th grade, just got out for the summer, and was beginning my daily after-school ritual(Grab a pop, get some Doritos, and head up to my room for some Dragon Ball Z and video games). Suddenly, both my house phone rang, and I heard the unmistakable romp indicating that someone was trying to get ahold of me on AOL. I’ll never forget it. I spilled my chips out of my lap in my childish excitement that someone wanted to talk to me! In an effort to sweep the evidence of my mishap under the bed, I saw what appeared to be a fresh splash of Vault soda on the carpet. Thinking nothing of it, I raced up-stairs to the phone and just pulled it off the hook before the message machine took over. It was my buddy, Chris; he was inviting me over for a weekend of paintball and Gamecube. That sounded awesome. But reserving for a possible invitation from Instant Messenger, I told him that I would call him back once I knew if my parents would let me or not. We hung up, and I swiftly carried myself to the pc, filled with anticipation for what I would read online.

As I strode across the kitchen, I spotted a thin red line that began from the basement stairs, ran to the computer chair, and then lead up to the front door. I immediately assumed it was the doings of my toddler brother(who was in his wall doodling stage with permanent marker) and went on to access the computer. I saw the blinking, blue light, highlighting “Purplepimp1” on the bottom dash of the desktop. My childhood friend, Colten said, “What’s up you wanna do something tonight”. I lit up with wonder at what he might be planning. “Hell yeah what you gonna do”, was my response. His idea was to go to the teen dance at Jillian’s(A nearby activity center) and start our summer out with a bang. That idea also included us trying this drug called Ecstasy for the first time. I wanted to, but was scared. He wanted me to come over. I looked over, that red line almost beckoning for me to open the front door, leading to his house. I lied, gave him some good-sounding reason for me to get offline, and quickly called my Mom to see if I could go to Chris’ for the weekend.

That splash of Vault, and Red permanent marker, both ended up being way more than trivial novelties of my childhood. My weekend at Chris’ was great. We had innocent fun. It went without a hitch. It’s my belief that he and I became best friends because of that weekend. We did everything together; had similar girlfriends, took the same classes in high school and even in college. Sadly, throughout the years Colten had descended further and further into drug addiction. I would see him a lot at first, the Red line seeming to be parallel with his path. Then less and less as the days, months, and years went on. He bounced from jails, to rehabs, back to the streets, hospitals, until one day, when I’m hugging his Mom and reminiscing with her about the good ol’ days, trying to bring up happy memories of her son.   And the whole time that faint Green line was always there, always right in front of me, my Guide.

I’ve continued to trust that Green line. It’s so subtle. I’d almost forget it was there at times. Plus the first few feet of it usually get blotted out by the loud, thick, Red line. I’d notice that first, when decisions were tough, but the paths would eventually diverge and I remained on the Green beam. I have lived a good life so far, thanks to my Guide. It steadfastly lead the way for me to meet the right people, go to the right places, do the right things. But many of times I would see the Red Line. Sometimes it lit up like those neon lights that you see, inviting me in to sordid places. It would call for me to follow it into the casino as I walked past with my buddies on late nights. I could spot it during hard financial times when I would question skipping on bill payments in order to get by. My Red Tempter would appear when I was indecisive about what route to take on the road. It never failed to make itself look attractive. Luckily, I never trusted it either. Until I did.

On throughout the years, I have been given material success, happiness, praise from colleagues, love and affection from family and friends, more money than ways to think of spending it. A man can’t ask for anything more. I owned an Empire in oil, I was the leading contributor in innovation for technology, I have been given the Nobel Prize in Economics for my analysis in market power and regulation. Life has been good to me- too good. I began to realize that I never had to deal with adversity. I’ve never met with any kind of resistance. Slowly, I admitted to myself that I wanted more in life. I was bored.  The Red line finally seduced me into following its path.

The consequences from my actions were gentle at first; practically rewarding. The first couple times were just petty thefts. I’d steal candy bars, then sodas. Writing bad checks, using the credibility of my business became a rush. Gambling crept its way in as a mainstay in my life. I had so much fun; waltzing in with my pretty wife, throwing money left and right. Drinks were on me! I skipped the slot machines, the Craps and Blackjack tables, and went right to the card tables with the high rollers. I’d win and lose, and win and lose. It was so exciting. Just weekends at first, then I’d drag my love with me on Wednesday nights, then Thursdays. Soon she had enough and would stay home. Harping on me about my loose cannon lifestyle was routine for her. After a while, I felt lonely at the Casinos, spending all this money by myself. Eventually, I was walking tall with two beautiful, young women under each arm, into those fast and loud rooms. Those girls were my escorts, or hookers, or whores, as some people called them.

Not even in my wildest nightmares could I imagine betraying my wife of 23 years. But my nightly expeditions created a wedge between us. She distanced herself. Or maybe I was the one making it that way, chasing my floored Tempter with leaps and bounds. During one of my nights of vice, the girls I was with complained of being tired, after a whole 4 hours of spending and drinking and laughing and betting. Unsure of what my next move was to be, the Red line revealed itself, leading to a nice Holiday Inn, not too far from the place we just exited. Taking my usual course of action, I had got us a suite for a night, with just one king-sized bed. I’ll leave out the particulars. Next thing I know, I’m waking up in-between two naked women that are nearly half my age. I had never felt so literally cold in my life. Shivering uncontrollably, I quickly got dressed and zoomed out of the hotel, hoping to make as much space between myself and that hotel as possible, as quickly as I could.

I couldn’t live with my secret for long. The gambling stopped but the strangeness between us in the household continued. Along with my heavy drinking, I managed to pick up smoking as well. These things only gave me temporary numbness. Every morning though, I woke up to replays in my mind of that night in the suite. This went on for about 6 months. Hoping to save myself from despair, I sat down with my wife and remorsefully revealed what had happened. She didn’t react how I had imagined. I had figured she would cry, would sob even. Instead, she had received my spilled guts as if she were just hearing a distasteful commercial on the radio. She simply got up and resumed her daily routine on the treadmill. I wasn’t surprised. We had hardly spoken in the past month or two. What really hurt me though was her dramatic telling of our children about their selfish and disloyal Father. She was out of the house not even a week afterwards and took the kids right along with her. My family was gone.

Within a couple more months, I followed the damned crimson Snake into a strip club and was thrown out with a broken neck and fractured spine just an hour later. One hospital trip after, and I had found a new dragon to chase, with painkillers. On most days you could find me melting on the couch in front of my big flat screen, in my mansion, alone. This went on and on for a couple of years: First, I sold all my luxury cars, then went most of my furnishings, and my beach houses had to go. This stuff and more, was all in an effort to feed a belly that just wouldn’t get full. I knew it had to stop after my second electric bill had lapsed. So I sold the house real quick for half of its value and then got an apartment. Once all of my oil stakes were sold, then the real fun was on.

For a good two years, I lived as fast as I could. The Line took me everywhere; from state to state, one casino after another, strip clubs, bars and bars, I event went to Amsterdam and spent a month in a brothel. I drank and I smoked, then I popped pills, and even tried crack once, for 6 months. Before I knew it, I was a drug addict; a homeless one at that. The Red Line ran me through the mud. Yet I continued to follow it. I went from being a millionaire with everything in the world, to an intervenous junkie. But that wasn’t all.

I am writing this as an autobiography of sorts. It’s a decent way to kill time in a 21 hour lock-down, medium security penitentiary. I am wrapping up on serving a 16 year sentence for bank robbery. I figured this might give me a good reminder to choose the path of my Guide, rather than follow my Tempter, for the remainder of my life. I get released tomorrow, to a sober living house. All I have is one more night and a wake up, then I will be a free man once more. An old man, but free.

If there is anything about those Lines that I have learned, it’s that they will always be there. I don’t know where they came from, or why they appeared. I never heard, in my 55 years on this Earth, of those Lines in anyone else’s life. But they remained a constant in mine. I’ll never forget them, even if I could.

"[WP] A crazed astronomer undergoes a quest to shut down the entire state's power grid, in an effort to force the population to behold, for the first time, the beauty of a starry night sky.",Insertusernamehere5,"""Astronomer here!""

I paused a minute, pondering the next words. The path I had taken to get here was crazy if you thought about it. Start posting astronomy comments on a message board. Gather a following. The following grew- thousands became tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands and millions around the globe, conditioned to perk up at a catchphrase. From there it was easy- come meet her in person at AstroFest! Room for all and a great chance to rally behind science outreach!

""Astronomer here!"" I repeated, after the crowds in front of the podium calmed down. ""You know my love of the stars! But my friends, we are here in the shadow of The Enemy. Those against seeing the stars and truth for what they are! We are nothing in the universe, the stars will outlive us regardless of our problems on Earth!""

Another roar from the crowd. It all came down to this moment. ""Astronomer here!"" I shouted again, hoping the reverberations in the sound system would send the subliminal signals appropriately. ""We must lead the way to solving these problems!  We have gathered here in the shadow of The Enemy, beside the State power station, for a mission! Our course is true! We must blot them out and bring back the night!""

The roar intensified, and the chants of ""astronomer here! astronomer here!"" let me know my mind control invention worked not only online, but in vocal recognition as well. The crowd moved from the festival grounds towards the State power station as if of their own accord, tearing at the fence and approaching the building. Once we had the power station, in the chaos dominated by only light from the beautiful shining stars above my army would stoke fear in the local government. Who controls the energy in a society controls its power. 

I smiled. ""ASTRONOMER HERE!""",Andromeda321

It wasn’t right, it was never right.
Atop the summit’s height, my telescoped looking far beyond; the heavens before my very eyes.

It wasn’t right, it’s not right!
The lights, the color, the sense and the spirit they were all wrong!

None could see what I see here in this putrid place, corrupted and vile they filled their homes and cities with all man’s envy for that above; they copied it, then they replaced it.
Yet I’ve seen true; what wonderful things, truly wonderful, all seen serene high above.

There as a boy, upon moonlight hillock far beyond civility I saw it.
My dream. A dream to bring this to all who could not see, blind to that merely hidden above.
I would remove the shroud, give them sight, that I intended.

So I begin my final step now. To return sight to all, bring about the wonder of the universe beyond. The heavens so bright, so beautiful... 
The only light we’ll ever need.

How I’ve strained over the years, the setting sun all that remains to fall.
How I’ve anguished, suffered I spoke out, most a soul without a care or whim they could not see.

They had not seen, not all that I see no… They were blind; but I will change that here tonight, show them exactly what it means to see…

But not all were like them, blind and ignorant, knowing not the beauty of all that could be seen above no… There were others as me, drawn my suffering they came to my call; where there was one now there is many.

But not enough, never enough… Not until they see what I see no… Not enough, not enough yet…

I bring them a new realm, a god from above I take their envy and their pride and make them humble!
To bow in it’s majesty, to realize just how small we truly are!

From Higgins to Harry Allen, the true seeing await the dusk’s fall. Man’s envy of the light above to explode in a storm of triviality; their power’s homes to vanish in an instant.

From Creech to Nellis we already control, the armament of man at our behest. The sky our own, their once jets deployed at our command, the land our own, heavy tracks and arms borne ready to protect our new realm to come.

Here I stand before Hoover, the greatest instrument of their resistance secured at my whim I stand above it my eyes to the heavens.
Change placed, charges set and ready spanning all man’s creations length. All I need is to hold the trigger prepared; I push us into a new age, a domain of our own. The heavens own.
I press the trigger knowing that to come.

To give sight to all The Meadows, the City of Sin to sin no longer; they are subject to the heavens above.

And this way it will stay, man’s envy never to return this we intend, this we will see true.
Or die trying, beneath the most glorious lights above. The sight of the stars I return to man at the flick of single switch.

The night sky to be seen once more.
So I begin at last, the final step of my journey.
The starry night finally be just right.

Beneath them, the neon-night of the city sprawled into the distance.

""Why are we up here?"" asked Isabella, giggling a little as she raised the bottle to her lips. 

""Because!"" said Martin, before taking first the bottle, then a long swig. He let the bubbles dance inside his mouth until they became flat. It might not be champagne, but it was the best someone like him could afford.

""What do you see, when you look up at the heavens, Izzy?"" he asked.

""Oh, not this again,"" she replied, playfully rolling her eyes.

""Come on. Humour me.""

She bit her lip and looked up at the endless darkness. ""Well, there's the moon.""

""And...""

""And, nothing. There's nothing else up there, Martin. Just, the same as always.""

Martin sighed and sat down on the building's ledge, placing the bottle on the ground by his feet. ""There is something up there, you know. *Our future*.""

Isabella sat down next to him, resting her head on his shoulder. ""I know, sweetheart.""

""Did I ever tell you why I became an astronomer?""

""I... I don't think so?""

""When I was six years old,"" Martin began,  ""I saw the stars for the first and *final* time. There had been a power cut where I lived.""

""Power cut?""

""Yes. There wasn't enough energy, I suppose, to keep the buildings lit. The city around me blinked twice, and then rested its eyes in the darkness.""

""Sounds kinda scary.""

Martin smiled and draped an arm around Isabella. ""It wasn't scary, because the darkness had revealed something beautiful within it. *The heavens*.""

Isabella picked up the bottle and raised it to her lips. ""And... did you see God up there?"" she mocked. ""In the heavens?""
 
""No, not God exactly... but the stars up there were so *plentiful*, it seemed to me that God must have knocked over a jar of sugar, spilling tiny, sweet crystals all over the heavens.  I sat on top of the apartment roof for the next thirty minutes gazing open mouthed at the wonders that hung above - until the lights came back on, snuffing out the sky."" 

""Okay. I guess that sounds kind of romantic.""

Martin smiled. ""Yes. And it was thrilling, too. Some used to say that looking up at the stars only made you realise how insignificant you actually are. I didn't feel insignificant - I just felt... *lucky*.""

""To see them?""

""To be part of them.""

Martin hugged Isabella close to him; she snuggled into his coat, as harp-strings of moonlight bathed them in a pale glow.

""I wish I could have seen them,"" Isabella said.

Martin nodded. ""As the stars above were extinguished, something inside of me was lit. Since that day, I've studied them through pictures taken back when the land had been something other than just a sprawling mass of endless cities.""

""It must be frustrating for you. To know they're up there, but always just out of sight. 

""Yes. It is. I've often thought of doing something - *anything* - just to see them again.""

For a moment, they were both silent as the cool evening breeze brushed over them. Then, almost abruptly, Martin stood up and reached into his jacket pocket, pulling out a small, frayed box. He flipped it open.

""Will you, Izzy?"" he asked, falling onto one knee. ""Will you marry me?""

Isabella raised a hand to her mouth. ""Yes,"" she whispered through her fingers. Isabella shook as she took the ring from the case. There was a tiny *click* as it left the box, but she didn't notice. ""Yes,"" she repeated.

A distant rumble ran through the air like far away thunder. The city around them blinked twice, and then rested its eyes in the darkness.

""*What - what's going on?*"" Isabella asked.

""Look above you,"" Martin instructed.

Isabella gasped as tiny specks, like a scattered jar of sugar, began to appear in the sea of black. Her tears sparkled with starlight as Martin pulled her toward him, and gently pressed his lips against hers.

Then, I moved to Hawaii (where my father's family is from) and had the pleasure of finding a job on Mauna Kea (for those who don't know, that mountain is the site of the best telescopes in the world like Gemini North, Keck, Subaru, so on). I got to experience a night sky unlike any other for the five and a half years that I worked there.

There were many nights where there were so many stars that I got lost in them, and I'd studied traditional Hawaiian star navigation; so to say that I got lost is saying something.

Now I work at a planetarium and I can make the stars come to me. I love astronomy, even if I didn't get my degree in it. ",sp00nzhx

It's easy to hate when you have nothing to love. Since our humble beginnings as hunter gatherer tribes, we've been capable of destruction. With each subsequent year, each subsequent century, our capabilities only grew stronger. It was not long ago that the world reached its tipping point, the point where we had a chance, and chance to save ourselves from what we have become. But despite the marches, the chants, the pacts, the truces, this worlds beauty was destroyed. The Clathrate gun hypothesis became a theory no more. 

Amongst the constant pollution, the constant pointless political battles, and wars that we didn't even remember our reason for fighting, methane poured into our oceans and our atmosphere. %90 of marine life perished, climate change accelerated at a rate unprecedented. Within 30 years the world as we knew it had disappeared. 

As the worlds greatest cities began to fall, either from flooding or social collapse, humanity began to push inland, condensing our populations to smaller and smaller areas. Instead of hundreds of culturally diverse cities and general peace among nations, intense nationalism began to build, the lights that once scattered the world began to converge into smaller areas as habitable land became scarce. 
Many countries fell into civil war, many collapsed, unrecognizable in their current state. The places that did survive had populations concentrated into dense super cities. In these locations, survival was the only goal. What progress had been made in science was naught. The affluent hung onto the capitalism of the past, their power in the past. They became the new leaders, and they wanted to control more than they wanted to progress. The earth's population has begun to forget what used to make life worth living. 

In a ten-year span, suicide had surpassed lung disease as the world greatest killer. It started out with the rural cities that were slowly dying off as the food and resources ran out but quickly spread to the super cities. The people who remembered the past could no longer take this present. The suicides only began to taper off once those who had been born into this harsh world became the adult population, they knew of no other past. I was one of these kids, the so called starless generation. In our life times, we had never seen the stars. Most of us hadn't seen green. The only thing we knew was you had to work hard to survive, to make enough credits to feed yourself, to survive in this world of cement and metal and smog. But I was different. 

I was born to a man by the name of Adalbert Etoile Astrea. In his time he was an astronomer. A great one, in his prime. He used to tell me stories of his experiences amongst what he called the stars. He said that white circle in the sky was something called the moon, and people had walked on it. He told me that when he was a boy, you could look up and the sky would be littered in a dazzling display of tiny lights, uninterrupted by the terrestrial ones. He told me that the corporations and the government were working together to reach up into the sky with rockets and spacecraft to be amongst them before everything changed. He told me I'd be the one to change that; I was part of his plan. 

I told my few friends of my father's stories. And they told they're parents. They called my dad crazy. My anonymous said they had no idea, that I'd show them one day. For a long time, I didn't know what that meant. I didn't understand how I would be a part of his plan, how I was supposed to change the world, how I would show them that they didn't know what they were missing, they didn't know that there was still beauty in this universe, the stars were still out there, and I would show them. I know my father wasn't crazy, and I'm sure he wasn't the only one that knew of this miraculous past. Or maybe he was crazy because he was the only one crazy enough to make a plan to show the world. 

He started me off young, right when I turned 16, working age. He got me into the power industry, at first, it was medial work. Engineers would tell me where there were leaky pipes and I would fix them. I came home every day covered in oil, smelling distinctly of gas. But my father convinced me to keep at it, one day I would be more. So I did keep at it. Eventually, I began to gain leadership in the powerhouses. The enormous power facilities that kept the super city running. I would oversee the engineers; I would make the decisions on how to best maintain the power in these places of forgotten hope. Long after my father died from black lung, I kept at it. I knew his plan. And I would carry it out; it was the only thing that kept me going, from not becoming another suicide. 

Soon after turning 35, after decades of hard work, I had achieved one of the highest ranks in the power facility, Regional Lead Operator. This position gave me power in this citie's power facility only out matched by the people who owned it. And it also gave me power to what my father had been planning all along, the main power grid. I knew I would have to bide my time however, the trust had to be built, they were watching. 

I was 43 when I realized I could no longer wait. The smog had done its damage. I was dying. But I had a task to carry out; it was time. The clearest nights are in the season that was used to be called autumn. The weather is good enough that heating or cooling isn't needed. Thus less smog enters the air. It was a windy night in this season when I knew the time had arrived, the smallest density of fog of the past year. The clearest night, only interrupted by artificial light. I acted. 
I showed the guard my security clearance and quickly walked through the dark halls towards one of the most closely watched rooms in the entire city. It was 1 am; the night sky was dark, it was to be darker. I slid my security card through about five security access point before I got to the mainframe door locked with an iris scanner and 26 digit passcode. I operated the door as fast as my fingers would allow me. The door was opened, and an alert was issued throughout the facility, I hoped the security wouldn't rush in, I was the Lead Operator after all. A computer terminal guarded the power; there were a lot of steps to completely black out this city, I had them memorized to a t. After only 20 seconds I had achieved the task that took my entire life to carry out. My fathers plan realized. The city was bathed in brilliant darkness, and I knew the world would see the bright stars that lie above. In seconds I was apprehended by the security force, I knew what was left of my life would be spent in a prison cell. 

I never got to see the stars. I went straight to a detention facility where I currently reside, only a few weeks left of life. I didn't get to see the starry sky my father so desperately wanted to be returned. But I know somewhere in my heart that what he was saying was true. I know that there is an unimaginable infinity of light in the night sky. And I know that, if only for a few moments, the city, the only world I knew, could see the heavens, and maybe hope again.

He was terrified and tired and so very, *very* stupid, he thought.  What had he been thinking?

He had never even *held* a gun before, but now he had it trained onto the three terrified men who sat before him in worn-out overalls and hardhats.  And the one calm man in a business suit, a badge clipped to his lapel that displayed some alphabet soup of an agency's name on it; not EPA and not FBI, so it was one Brent had never heard of.

""You're being unreasonable, Mr. Haywood,"" the man said in a voice calculated to relax.  It was like a fingernail scraped up the back of his spine.  ""You can still get out of this with only a little jail time, and you can be back to your old life before you even realize it.  Maybe you can get a book deal out of this, and, five years from now, you'll laugh about it all with your friends.""

The doctors had given Brent two months.  That was a month ago, and he could feel the cancer eating away at him, the same way it had eaten his mother in his last year of grad school.  She had died, withered and pitiful, and he had resolved not to go out the same as her.

""It's a gift,"" He said--begged--hoping that the men would understand.  ""Just for a bit.  A few minutes.  Long enough for people to *know*.""

""But everyone needs this power, Mr. Haywood,"" the man continued, pouring words out with a calm that wore away at the hard edges of Brent's fear.  He hadn't thought it would be this difficult when he started planning; it had never occurred to him, as he poured over hundreds of pages of documentation about how the Grand Coulee plant had replaced 98% of its staff with automated systems.  Even when he had snuck onto the property three hours ago, the terror had only just started to grow.

But now, everything was covered in a white haze of all-consuming dread, and the only anchor he had in all of that was that last image of his mother's shriveled, cancer-eaten husk while the hospital's machine screamed its flatline drone and a single sob tore itself from his father's throat as the long year of suffering was finally capped by the indignity of death.

""Press.  The.  Button.""  The words came out of Brent like sobs of his own now, the gun shaky in his hand, but the distance close enough that a trigger pull would certainly end in a corpse.

Not that he *would* pull the trigger; he wasn't even sure the safety on the pistol was off.  He could never bring himself to kill a man right in front of him.  Brent maintained no illusions of his own willingness, even at this desperate moment.

His mother's love of the night sky had been what guided Brent to his chosen career, away from the lights that had distracted his peers.  Screens held little interest to him when compared to the vastness of the starscape that he had learned while camping in the ever-shrinking wilderness of America.

All he wanted was to share that wonder--to share his mother's passion--with the population of the Pacific Northwest.

One of the men reached out slowly, finger hovering.  They had stalled as long as they could while disabling the safety functions, until the man in the suit had shown up, heralded by the whirring blades of a helicopter and the police booming at him through bullhorns.  The man had approached, showing no fear of Brent's gun, and tried to talk him down.

But you can't talk down a dead man.

The hum of the generators slowed, leaving an aching silence in the white noise that Brent had stopped noticing, conspicuous now only in its absence.  The sluice gates began to shut on the great dam; it would take the better part of a quarter-hour to safely reopen them, even if they started immediately.  Not that it mattered.

The gun clattered to the floor, the three workers flinching away from it, but Brent was already sprinting, running, panting with an exhausted, near-sexual release as the tension flooded out of him.  He half-slammed into the plexiglass window that comprised the office's western wall, face smashed up against it as he strained his eyes skyward.

Even now, the lights in Grand Coulee and Electric City were blinking out, and soon the lights of Brewster and Ellensberg and Hood River would join them.  A sweeping wave of darkness as the grid struggled at the sudden drought of power, automated systems rerouting what little energy was still limping into the grid, prioritizing hospitals and police stations and the stations where emergency vehicles were left to charge.

America's modern, computer-controlled infrastructure would make sure that nothing too terrible happened when the clawing reach of darkness found Seattle and Portland, or when it made it as far east as Bozeman.

""Look up,"" Brent whispered, tears stinging his eyes as he did so himself.  He could feel the presence of the man in the suit coming up behind him.

And there, brilliant and glorious, was the luminous wonderland of the starry s-

Several stars winked out.

Several more.

Then dozens.  Hundreds.  Like a rolling blackout, a massive swath of the sky darkened, until the luminous tapestry of stars surrounded a square-sided patch of darkness that had to have dominated a tenth of the night overhead.

Brent tried to say something, to ask, to shout, to beg.  Nothing came as his knees weakened, making him slide towards the ground on trembling legs.  Outside, the police had ceased their constant, megaphone-magnified squawking.  Even they were transfixed by the sight of that illimitable blackness; ignorant as they were of what a true night should be, the *wrongness* of what loomed above was inescapable.

""Well,"" the agent said with only the slightest hint of resignation in his voice, ""You've gone and done it now.""",lordnequam

I already had my astronomy degree, so going back for another degree would be all right.  Five years of study.  Every co-op job planned, all at the same place.

Then a corner office.  They named me the head electrical engineer at the biggest power company in town. 

Finally, the perfect day.  The skies were clear.  The traffic was light.  It was dark early and looks like the dinner hour was almost over.   

""Everyone, it's Christmas Eve.  Everything's automated, I'll stay here and keep an eye on everything.  Go home."" 

Finally.

Alone.  

Just me and the controls -- anyone who could stop me was an hour away.  The cursor blinked at my terminal.  ""Yes,"" I said, ""I'm sure.""  Enter.

Then back to my office, opening the hidden bar fridge.  (Who said I didn't learn anything?)  Champagne on the roof.

From his duties at the electronomer

Day 2, he thought 

a second chance at last 

to give the public a view 

of a night as clear as glass 

Day 3, behold, he exclaimed 

Pointing to his telescope 

A magnificent instrument

That magnifies the stars 

No one would join him, looking through it 

He begged, he pleaded, ""That view is *our's*!""

Day 4, defeated, he packed his bags and left 

He hoped that the sight of stars wouldn't be turned into a memory left to forget

As he climbed over mountains, northwards, looking for salvation

His face lit up in rejuvenation  

The sight of lights dazzling from the heavens

He almost believed his eyes to lie 

When he saw how bright they shine 

He knew the memory would never die.

It read 21:27. In just 3 minutes the group of hackers he had hired would shut down the power grid for the entire state of North Carolina. He just wished he could have done it for the entire United States, however their services were not coming cheap.

John knew that lack of perspective was behind many of the worlds greatest issues; people being overly self-important and acting in selfish ways detrimental to others. A lack of unity and solidarity between neighbours, neighbouring nations and the human race as a whole. 'If only people would realise how insignificant we truly are, tiny organisms floating through a cold and stark but also beautiful universe' james had thought in the weeks prior. It was then that this plan started to form, this stroke of genius.

He had figured that if people were not willing to travel out of cities and witness the beauty of the great expanse above and gain the self perspective that he has, then he would have to take it to them. Sure, people had seen stars before and seen the moon but the true enormity of the universe can only be appreciated when the sky is truly filled with stars. Layers upon layers of stars, hundreds, thousands, millions.

The lights of john's apartment turned off, only the glow of the lit candles remained. The clock read 21:30. He had seen the night sky countless times but never had he been as excited to see it as he was now, reaching for the door handle to his balcony.

He turned the handle and flung open the door, ready and eager to share this phenomenal view with his fellow statesmen in their various towns and cities. As he looked up his jaw dropped at the sight before him. There was nothing but cloud.

Your eye has cones for seeing colors, but they don't do well in darkness. You also have rods, which give black and white vision, but are more sensitive to light. This is why you have a hard time telling colors apart in the dark -- your rods are doing most the work. 

The center of your retina is more densely populated with cones, at the expense of rods. This gives clearer vision in good lighting, but makes a ""blind spot"" at night. If you look to the side of something dim, the light is falling on part of your retina that's more densely populated with rods than the center of it.

We weren’t give much information on who we were after. Intel was pretty light, as our target had opted to stay off the grid for the better part of a year now. There were two small buildings that needed to be cleared before we could enter the main part of the plant, which is most likely where our target would be. As I glanced over the briefing one last time before we made our way in, I reminded myself of what we were getting ourselves into.  

Intelligent, mentally unstable, and a threat to society.

Just another day in the office.  

I grabbed my M4 from the back of the van, and ran my hand over the pistol that adhered itself to my side. Hopefully I wouldn’t have to use either of these. 
But I was ready. Just in case. 

The door opened without a sound. I made my way in followed closely by the rest of my team. We were swift, and silent. Mere whispers alongside the loud hum emulating from the control room. The rooms were pitch black. Lit only by the flashlights from our scopes. 
“Room 1 clear.”
“Room 2 clear.”
We quickly made our way to the second building. The door was open, and this time the interior was dimly lit by a single lamp in the middle. Drawings and maps littered the walls. Paintings of the North Star and what looked like every planet in our solar system littered the room. 

Definitely not what I was expecting. 
I cautiously entered the room. 
As we progressed through the desks and warn down office cubicles, the drawings began to multiply. There were hundreds of them, maybe even thousands. We didn’t really have time to count them. I continued making my way through the mess when something stopped me. 
A simple painting seemingly like the rest. 
But this one was different. 
It was.
Me? 
“Boss, take a look at this.” I walked over to the area of interest and noticed that there were paintings of all 4 of us scattered among the ground. There were even paintings of us entering the very complex we now stood in. 
What is this?
“Let’s keep moving.” I said, unsure of the words as they came out. 
We made our way outside and moved cautiously. An elderly man was sitting down about half way down the grid. 
Interesting. 
He made no signal of noticing us, so we continued to move closer to him. When we were a mere 10 paces away, his eyes opened. 
“Welcome my friends, we can begin.”
He pressed a button on what looked like a remote, dropped it and rose to his knees with his hands behind his back. The humming of the grid was replaced by complete silence. 
No one moved.
For what now littered the night sky we hadn't seen in years. 
Stars.

With thoughts of serene parallax drifting to my blood-filled brain, I shook, too. Just a little tremor, though.

I walked up to the switch, and pulled it down. That, like getting through security and finding the main breaker room, was near-effortless.

After the switch was pulled down, the security monitors in the room began feeding me a video of Col. McIntyre. 

""Bill. Come on. You thought that would work? You ever think about the traffic lights? The accidents? The radios the police would use to respond to those accidents? All the patients in the hospitals and palliative wings, relying on that power to survive?""

""Yeah, uh. No...sir. I really didn't.""

""Bill. Buddy. We got word of you doing this. It doesn't even make sense. It's nowhere near practical.""

""Yeah. No. You're right, Bill.""

(Both our names are Bill, by the way).

""Alright. Bill, just go home. Have a good night. Say hi to your wife for me.""

""Alrighty, Bill. You too.""

And so I left. And made my way home. I got out of my car and looked up. The moon was this beautiful orange, so huge and so bright. I smiled. I walked into my house and saw my wife. She was hooked up to her heart moniter. The irony hit me like an iron.

""Where have you been been, honey?"" 

""Just out at the observatory, looking at the moon, sweetheart."" 

She smiled. I kept smiling, too.

Astronomer has a monologue on why people need to see the nights sky. You consider him the protagonist. 

He sets out to shut off all the city lights without killing anyone. He paints all the windows of the hospital black because they have a generator.

He has all the windows washers sent to a fake job in another city 

He ties up the security guards of the electric plant. He turns off the connection to the city. 

He looks into the city And all is black and he is excited.

But then light grows and grows. He must have missed backup generators at smaller businesses! He's angry now and smashes the control panel to the plant. He drives to the city bent on destroying every last generator. 

He sees a man outside and screams at him to look up!

He gets into the city and realizes all the lights were candles as everyone is helping eachother out during the blackout. They are singing songs and stuff. He realizes hes some kind of nerdy grinch.  His heart grows 3 sizes that day but the plant goes supercritical and everyone dies in a blast of light",Mobely

The portly man asked, giving his bearded chin a scratch. If someone were to put this fellow into a category, it would most certainly be ""redneck"".  Of course, the man did not care much for labels or titles; he was taught very well by his mother (rest her peaceful soul) that the only titles a man had were the ones god gave to you.

While the chubby electrician was certainly no fool, and he had years of experience in his field (it was a family tradition to fix things that the rich folks did not know needed to work), he was a bit worried about the plausibility of this job. He'd known Earnie for years, and had a lot of respect for the man; he'd done more for his family than anyone. But this one seemed a bit off. A little dangerous.

""Earnie, you can't just cut the power to the whole of San Antonio,"" the fat electrician chided, dabbing at his head with the strap on his overalls. ""It ain't gonna happen, even for a few minutes. There's people who need the lights at night. There will be accidents. What about the hospitals...""

Earnie sat up a bit and slammed his hand down on the table in front of him. ""Now, old friend, you know that there is a backup in place. I've known how it works decades less than you, and even I understand that. It'll be about two minutes before the power comes back, and there are backup generators for public service. You know..."" Earnie then broke into a coughing fit, but steadied himself, muttering about how the weather was awful here, before continuing, ""you know that the only danger is to your pride, and that's why you are so afraid.""

The electrician, of course, realized that the danger was also to his job, and his family, and the rest of his existence outside of prison for manslaughter, but he said nothing. Earnie was a great friend, and he knew that. ""Just this once, old chap. I'll never ask again.""

He realized that was probably true.

----------------------------------------------------

Our blue-collar hero set out on his certainly unheroic deed the next morning. He knew a lot of people in the business, and knew exactly who would help and who would ruin the plan, and adjusted his list of friends accordingly. He realized that Earnie would be of absolutely no help, but was pleasantly surprised when Earnie called in a few of his big-wig friends to help with the deed. 

They were not without challenges. At least twice, our overall-wearing friend was found tampering with important electrical equipment on the main power grid, gear far above his pay grade. However, Earnie always had a backup plan, and through extreme countersuing measures (things that went against a good-old boys values, but they had to happen) his sabotage was kept secret. A month passed, and Earnie wondered if there would even be time to finish it.

Hope prevailed, however, as the chubby electrical engineer finally had re-routed, re-wired, and re-furnished his way to industrial espionage. With the flick of a giant switch, the power in the residential district of San Antonio would be dark... for a little bit.

The engineer took a quick look at his handiwork. It was a little past two in the morning, one of the least active times of the day. He hoped that there would be very little trouble with traffic. He had sort of went against the plan, and kept the business district lit up. While he didn't know a lot about how light worked (despite making it for forty years) he knew that going dark would cause a lot of problems, and hopes that it wouldn't pollute the starry sky too much.

He took a final glance at the switch, and gave Earnie a call. After a short bout of cursing for calling at such an hour(which he expected nowadays), Earnie finally calmed down enough to realize that the deed was to be done. ""Y... y'know, it ain't the end of the world, Earnie. There's a lot of... of other options."" The electrician said, his voice giving way a bit towards the end. ""You've got a lot. Don't give up on it, pal."" 

Earnie would only say, ""I'm tired. Get it over with.""

The electrician sighed. He figured there was another reason behind this, something he was never told about. Probably tax fraud. He had a sneaking suspicion that Earnie was a criminal, but never said it out of respect. He had a lot of respect for him;he'd done more for his family than anyone else.

He wanted to say goodbye before he hung up,but knew Earnie would hate it. He wasn't a very emotional man. So he just told him to enjoy the stargazing, and let him go.

----------------------------------------------------

About a kilometer across town, Earnie looked happily out his bedside window. It was still the same bland darkness he had come to expect over the years, with the same view he had known since the diagnosis, at least that's what he thought. If Earnie was a hateful man, he'd have cursed his parents genes. But he didn't remember how to hate anyways.

A moment later, the neighbor lost power. He heard them yell at their late-night LAN party being suddenly cancelled. He heard a car screech to a stop outside. He saw shadows suddenly running in the street. Around him, monotone beeping slowly drones into silence, and he suddenly felt very tired as the machine helping his body survive stopped.

Earnie sat up in bed, the best he could, and looked out at the sky. It took a few agonizing moments before the first star showed itself. More began to come out of their blankets, showing themselves to the world. Suddenly, a cacophony of light, an opera of beauty filled the sky, light blues and whites being connected by celestial dust. A painter wiped his brush across the sky, and made a painting just for Earnie. He could hear the excitement outside as his awful neighbors went outside and took a look at the view. It made him smile, to see the next generation interested in something, just as he was when he was young and could still live.


This was how his nurse found him only a few minutes later, when his vitals signature came back on to a flat line and alerted the system. Smiling.",OpossumBoy

It doesn't take a fucking genius to realize that the light pollution has obviously gotten out of hand. I dare you to look into the decaying night sky on a clear Chicago night, and attempt to see anything but yellow and brown. It's a stain on nature. A cloud over a cloudless city.  Living in Chicago within itself is uptight, quick, and leaves little time for observation, and at the base level the inhabitants are already disregarding the beauty in the architecture. It doesn't come as much surprise that little to no attention is being payed to one of the most gorgeous sights an individual can rest their eyes upon, the ever unwinding cosmos. Sure, some may be terrified to rest their eyes upon the one sobering image that may immediately confirm in their little sycophantic minds that they are nothing, perhaps that reality check is needed. Years upon years of campaigning for some kind of light reform has given me a permanent migraine, having to sonically assault the ears of the drooling public has taken it's toll. It confounds me to even consider the minute possibility that maybe, just maybe, they don't fucking care. If that's the case, I'm going to make them fucking care if it's the last thing I do. 

Now of course being in the field of astronomy has it's many perks, like an *cough* *cough* appreciation for the marvelous BIG outside, the BIG outside of course being the ""unwinding cosmos"" or whatever pretentious bullshit I can spew out to try and get someone interested. Oh, I also know some people, who know some people and guess the fuck what, it seems like I have set in motion a plan of elaborate events that will make EVERYONE appreciate the BIG outside. I can't give away too many details right now of course, who ever wants to hear a spoiler? Do keep in mind this: soon you will begin to realize that there are two things that are out of your control; the ability to neglect the wonderous sights that could potentially be right before your very eyes, and the concept that you can't tune out a brilliant mind.

"[WP] A crazed astronomer undergoes a quest to shut down the entire state's power grid, in an effort to force the population to behold, for the first time, the beauty of a starry night sky.",Insertusernamehere5,"I did the calculations. Lots of math, lots of weather-watching, and lots of not-particularly-legal blueprint-searching. I'd spent years - no, decades, now - searching for the perfect moment, the perfect timing for everything to come together in one grand display.

And that moment was *now*.

Well, not *now* now. Thursday, two and a half days from now. I had plenty of time to prepare. I grabbed my coveralls, slipped on a fake name badge, and climbed into the utility truck I had, uh, acquired. As I drove, I thought over my plan...

As civilization had expanded, so had their need for power. First it was power stations for cities, then for counties, then whole states. Now, the whole grid was linked. And if you screwed up a station here and a station there, you could start a whole chain reaction. This station goes down, so that station takes over, but it can't handle the sudden load, so it goes down too. If you take 'em out in the right order, they don't even have time to signal the other stations. Better yet, some of the stations overcompensate; they ramp up power, then have no place to dump it, and end up taking out other power stations. It's like a complicated ballet, only the dancers are caring handguns and C4. Lots of C4.

Did I mention I may also have planted some devices of specific destruction?

So yeah. I'm going to turn the stars back on.

The sky is like a one-way mirror; it lets light through, but if you have too much light on your side, it looks like it just reflects it all. These days, all the fancy city lights drown out the stars. I haven't seen stars since I was a kid, and that wasn't any time recent. But kids these days... they're going to get a treat.

---

Two days of prep. I didn't even need half of that; I was ready to go. Today, it was clear over 90% of the country. Perfect star watching weather.

I sat back in my truck, just another guy in coveralls, and pushed the button. Click. Such a small noise, and yet...

The Main Street Station went first, just so I could see the other lights going out. I watched as a tidal wave of darkness spread out over the city; occasionally, lights would flare back up, then go dark as their backup generators went offline again. They'll figure out it was a virus in a couple days. Probably.

For a moment, I smiled into the darkness, then closed my eyes and tilted up my head. The first view of stars people hadn't seen in half a century... I sighed, happily, as I let my eyes drift open...

The stars glimmered in the darkness. There was... uh... hmm.

I searched for familiar stars, but came up empty; I couldn't even find the Big Dipper! Confused, I craned my neck; where was the silvery band of the Milky Way? The familiar figures of the zodiac? What... what was going on?

The stars were wrong. The stars...

This was the fourth similar incident in a week and I did not want to go into the weekend with a psychopath running wild. What happened to this city? People used to look you in the eye, smile when you passed them on the street. Now you're lucky if you don't get jumped outside your door. 
My partner hands me a coffee, dark, oily, and bitter to match the rain. It's only his third month on the force and the kid's just too damn eager. This city will eat him alive.
""What do you think, Kowalski, same as the rest of them?"" He asks, knowing full well what I think, about this and the rest of these incidents. Some asshole on either not on enough meds or many far too many has been robbing fire stations. He only ever takes the hoses and axes. A couple firemen say he grabbed their sunglasses too, but they're probably as full of shit as my dads colostomy bag. Fucking firemen, if they had any balls they'd be cops...
""Same description, Caucasian male, 20s, 6'2"", 200 pounds, butt-ass naked. What do you think he's doing with all those hoses and axes?"" My partner drones on like an old landlady telling a pointless story. My eye is drawn to the corner of the station house, to a dog bowl full of food. 
""Rookie,"" I say to him, ""does it seem quite in here to you?""
""Well, aside from us and the uniforms taking statements-"" I cut him off.
""That's my point, there's eight strangers in a dog's territory and we haven't heard so much as a bark, growl or whimper out of him. That seem strange to you?"" I make a bee line for the fire chief. I know him from the softball league our daughters play in, name is Marty or Mickey or something.
""Kowalski,"" he says to me, ""tell me you've got a lead on this sick bastard.""
""Calm down Mack, nobody got hurt and it's not like you can't get new equipment."" I tell him. ""I'm curious though, where was the dog during all of this?"" The color in his face dies like a snuffed candle. His jaw tightens, and I can see he is fighting back tears.
""That's the thing, this fucking weirdo took him, he took everything but the goddamned engine! Our hoses, our axes, my ray bans, and even Scooter! You find this man, you find him and you bring that dog back!"" He starts shaking with rage. 
Perfect, not only do I have to deal with a lunatic ripping off firemen but now I gotta throw dog-napping into the mix. With six months til retirement this is not how I wanted to spend my time, until this piece of shit got the dog involved. I check my sidearm and chamber a round. The rookie looks up from his clipboard.

The echoes reverberate around the ghostly hall, only darkness and the occasional patch of moonlight through the sparse windows greets his voice. 


Apparently no one is, so G swaggers from the shadows. He looks around the empty space and decides that the party hasn't begun yet. In the middle of the parquet flooring stands a alter, the bottom is formed like an eagles claw that twists and wraps until the top opens like a book. Fumbling in his pocket G grasps a battered note and smooths it out. It had been in his pocket for months now but he had never had the courage to pull it out. Maybe now was the time, maybe the Mod Gods would hear his requests and smile down on him with their blessing. 
 

Tentatively he places the note upon the podium and glance around the darkness. Maybe somewhere in the unfathomable blackness one of the Mod team was listening. A single spot light streaks through the darkness and pins G to the supple gym flooring. He clears his thought and smooths out the paper again. 


""Um, I would like to ask, ah, what makes you human?""

“He’s coming for you next.” The voice came from behind her, hoarse and ragged. Sia paused, discreetly palming the watch in her pocket. She set down her bag of groceries, and channeled magic into the it. The watch grew warm in her hand, and an almost imperceivable shimmer separated her from the stranger.


“Who is coming?” Sia turned around to face the stranger. It was the same pale hair, cut unevenly at chin length. The same dark eyes. Staring back at her was what seemed to be her doppelgänger. It was hard to tell in the darkness of the night, but the voice and features matched. She was sprawled on the ground.


“No time. You have to get away.” Her doppelgänger attempted to rise, but one arm was bent wrong, wrong in a way no arms should bend. She collapsed to the pavement, breathing heavily. “Run as far as you can. Perhaps that’ll buy you some time.”
 

Sia glanced around her. The street was empty at night, with only the brightly lit storefronts lined at the side of the road to guide the way. No passerby. No help. She stepped towards her counterpart, trembling. Sia ignored the slight flinch of her doppelgänger as she moved closer. “I can’t leave you here. You’re hurt, and in no condition to do anything but rest.”


“Fuck it, Sia. I came here to warn you, not damn you. At least you have a chance.”  Her voice was only a whisper now. ""Please.""


Sia reached to touch her metal bracelets, activating all the charms on her person. She swayed, dizzy, and waited a couple heartbeats until her vision steadied.The magic eased their surroundings into mist, muted sound, until they were nearly invisible. From sight or scent or mind's eye.


""That won't last long, you know. You don't have the reserves.""


""I know. I made it.""


""Mmm."" Her doppelgänger stopped her attempts to stand up. She looked nearly dead: ashen and still in the dim light. ""Better hurry up.""


Sia took a marker from her left pocket, and extended a hand. ""May I?""


There was no answer. Only the stuttered rise and fall of her chest. Sia took her grimy arm, the unbroken one, and scrawled a few runes on it. Stasis. Then she hauled the girl onto her back. She was as light as a bird.


Sia walked down the street. Her legs hurt and her head felt heavy, but each step was resolute. Before her, a hotel materialized, a blossoming of color within the mist. *Hotel Anywhere*, it read. ""A place for anyone in need."" She walked towards it without hesitation.

One day a bloodied, wounded version of you crawls in front of you and says ""He's coming for you next.""",PMmeMovieWorldTicket,"For Alan, every day was a unique day, once the gates of the Multiverse opened everyone began travelling the universes meeting their doppelgangers and exploring alternate realities with themselves. 

This led to a handful of problems for doppelgangers, for one, the longer doppelgangers spent together the more the dominant doppelganger would literally absorb their weaker half. The result was an overload of deja vu, all the moments of the doppelgangers life that dont perfectly match your own pound at your skull until you're begging for morphine and oxy to numb the pain.

Or so he'd been told by the people that run the multiverse gates. Not that Alan ever experienced it, having never once met a doppelganger.

Since he was 18, the legal age required to travel the multiverse, he had been hunting for a doppelganger of himself. All he'd found in 22 years of searching were missing/wanted posters and grieving loved ones. It seemed in every universe but his own, Alan Arturo was dead, missing, or being hunted by Police.

So, on Alan's 40th birthday he quit hunting and decided to settle into his life. He was getting home from his job at the Multiverse Gates as a Jump-Screener, basically a Multiverse Security guard, he noticed his door was broken in and a streak of blood down his door.

Alan pulled his standard issue handgun from his glove box and entered his house with caution.

The sight that greeted him made him pause, sitting on his arm chair with a gun shot wound to the shoulder and a rapidly paling face. Alan saw his own doppelganger for the first time ever.

""Please listen to me. I don't have a lot of time. He's coming for you next. He's been hunting us for years."" Alan watched his bloodied clone choke up a cough as crimson poured from his mouth. ""He's killed us all. It's just you and me now. We did everything we could to keep him away from you. But the more of us he killed the more he learned of our plans."" Alan watched in shock as he watched himself bleed.

""Listen to me Alan. When he comes, he's going to come friendly, try and convince you he's the good guy. Please Alan. Promise me you'll kill him. He's evil. Pure and simple evil. He killed my family. He had my wife drawn and quartered in front of me. Please kill him."" Alan watched the light fade from his own eyes as he stood in a state of unpronounced shock. Just moments after he watched himself die. There was a gentle knock on the door.

Alan opened the door with apprehension, greeted by his own face, a dapper version of himself in a pinstripe suit with gelled back hair and a forward tipped fedora.

""Good Evening Alan, may I introduce myself? I'm Al, but everyone calls me A.1."" Alan couldn't believe the turn his life had taken. Just two days ago he'd given up finding himself, and in ten minutes two of himself managed to find him.

""May I come.."" A.1 stopped as he noticed the dead Alan on the arm chair. ""I see he made it here first. They put up a good show. The A.A.A fought a good fight, but in the end they never stood a chance."" A.1 laughed darkly as he strode in without invitation.

""What exactly did you fight about?""

A.1 sighed as he sat next to the dead Alan and stroked his face longingly ""You mostly."" A.1 took his time and remorsefully crossed the Dead Alan's arms and closed his eyes.

""Why me? Why am I special?""

""Special? You aren't really. Not you specifically, its more so what's inside of you."" A.1 stopped his ministrations and turned to Alan. ""Did you know Multiverse travel has adverse effects on the timeline? The strain it puts on the universe?"" He did know, working at the Jump Gates he knew that jumping sometimes brought back people wrong. Sometimes their minds would go, or they would begin to age rapidly but what did that matter to him?

""Well, when you were just a bit smaller than a peanut, just this Universe 616 version of you. You had a gem fused into your DNA. That gem not only stablizes the universe, it allows you to jump universes at any moment. This was first discovered when you were born. As you know, due to the multiverse there is and always has been versions of everyone throughout time. Since the dawn of time the A.A.A, Alan Arturo Alliance has protected you from the people that wanted that gem. People like me.""

""Oh. So I suppose you want to kill me for the Gem?"" Alan had kind of accepted this moment. He was facing the version of him that killed literally every other Alan Arturo ever to exist. He stood no comparison.

""What? No. God no. That could possibly destroy this universe and everyone in it. No. See the perk of you being the Gem is that you can transend time. You can take me back to my wife before she died."" Alan paused, A.1 didn't seem to be lying. A perk of talking to your doppelganger is you know their twitches, what to look for when they lie. And all Alan saw was honesty. Painful honesty. 

""See, my wife and son died in a car accident, and by some torture of the Multiverse, I cant find a version of my wife that loves me like she did. I've tried everything."" A.1 looked at his dead clone and sighed pitifully, ""I tried a universe where I died in the accident, a universe were I died before the accident, a universe where the accident never happened and that Alan left his wife for another woman. No matter what outcome I tried I couldn't find another doppelganger like her."" A.1's forlorn look drove a spike through Alan's heart. He may never have known love, but A.1 clearly did. ""So I turned my attention to you. See, you're the universe's big secret. The A.A.A hid you away, they buried your universe and refused to acknowledge your existence. So when I started looking for you, I became the Villain. The A.A.A turned on me, they tried to kill me, so I killed them. It didn't matter how much I begged or pleaded, they wouldnt let me find you. Please Alan. I don't want to hurt you. I just want to see my family again.""

Alan stopped. How could he not help him? The last Alan beyond himself, the Alan that killed countless versions of himself just to find his way back to his wife and child.

""Okay. I'll help you."" Alan smiled to A.1 whose shoulders slumped in relief. ""How do I do it? I've only used the Jump Gates before, I dont know how to activate it.""

""Simple. You just have to hold onto me and let me do the work."" A.1 smiled as he opened his arms to embrace Alan, the first and only time he would hug his own doppelganger. Alan stepped into his clones embrace and felt the shift of the universe as A.1 concentrated on the face of his wife and child. Their last moments at a restaurant before the accident that changed everything.

Alan felt the jump gate open in his living room the same time he felt the knife slip through his rib cage. A.1 felt his first moment of peace as Alan stepped back in shock.

""Why?""

""Because, the ability is triggered but only by death."" A.1 stepped toward the jump gate as Alan bled out beside his recently dead clone. ""So thank you Alan. I'll name my second child after you.""",Mckegg98
"[WP] For some reason, despite every you know having dozens, you have never found a doppelgänger of yourself in the multiverse. One day a bloodied, wounded version of you crawls in front of you and says ""He's coming for you next.""",PMmeMovieWorldTicket,"I sighed as I saw my friend walk with his doppelganger. He was the last one to meet    his. All my friends...No... Everyone has their ""twin"" or doppelganger. Someone who looks *exactly* like them. By physical appearance, They're all the same - The only way to differentiate them is by psychology. Behavior is the most effective way to tell them apart.

But what's the point in knowing all this? It's useless information, Only useful if I meet my doppelganger. I've scoured the multiverse, Trying to find one. Of course, I failed. I failed to find my twin.

*But I didn't fail to accept that fact.*

I lived my life ignoring other's twins. Years have passed, And it occurred to me that I was actually lucky. Without a twin, I only have one identity, And it's all mine. I didn't have to share my name and credit. Some will disagree with me,But we have different perspectives.

My life was smooth sailing 'til now. It was nighttime... 11:00 PM. Cloudy and windy. I can barely see the road. Fog is everywhere. Unsettling isn't it? Not for me. I'm okay with this.

The road seemed darker and darker as the minute passed. My headlights started to run out of batteries. And worse, It started to rain. I saw an old house by the distance and there I went. There must be someone there. I saw a shadow.

I opened the door and to my surprise... I saw myself. My doppelganger. I ignored doppelgangers, Not hated them. Normally I'd be happy, But I was horrified. He's wounded, Bloody, His arm severed...and about to *die*.

He still managed to utter some words despite his mouth being filled with blood: ""H...he's coming...""

I was confused: ""What? Who?""

He's about to die. His last words were: ""For you... He's coming for you... next.""

""What!? Who?! Who's coming?!""

I was asking questions to a corpse. I don't know anything. Only one thing: Someone wants me dead. I picked up some batteries on the floor, covered with blood. I walked towards my car, When a figure among the field caught my attention.

I retreated towards the house. I started to panic, But then I saw a note on the floor covered in blood.Inches away from the corpse.

""You cannot let yourself die. Either fight or leave. Killing yourself is better than them killing you.""

I looted the house for anything. I found useful items. Lots of them. The figure in the fields appeared by the window. Using blood from a head of another version of me, He painted the words: ""You're next.""

He approached the locked front door. 

I loaded my gun. This seems interesting.

[WP] Write the longest dad joke you can.,UserNameeCheckssOutt,"I started working at my most recent company a couple years ago in the spring. It's a pretty generic software company- spit out some code, debug some code, cry when shit doesn't work, repeat. Everyone's assigned to a team, and those are the people you're supposed to bother when you need help (cute, right?). Well there was a guy on my team, let's call him Mike, who was the go-to for the kind of stuff I was working on. There was a bit of an age gap since he's nearing forty and I'm not that far out of college, but as soon as I found out he was a gamer too I knew I'd made a friend.

Mike's cubicle hunched over the hallway, between the door and my desk. The walls on the thing were low, so he'd always see me when I walked by. It was nice to be greeted every day on my way in and out. He seemed to live here, always there before I was, always leaving after I did. He was a good worker, too, so I was surprised when I got invited to the company seminar and he didn't. It was this big trip once a year, and though this was my first time I'd heard it was actually decently fun. Apparently over half the company's new ideas came out of the sessions during the week-long trip.

""It's fine, it's fine, I've been to plenty before,"" he'd assured me. I had stopped by on my way out the day before my flight to say goodbye. It was damn exciting; I spent the whole plane ride fantasizing about coming up with some crazy good idea, shaking the CEO's hand, riding the hype all the way to the top. Of course, since I couldn't sleep on the plane, I passed out as soon as I dropped my stuff off in my room. I awoke, groggily, to the sounds of the door opening.

""Alex, you awake?"" It was one of my coworkers who were sharing the room with me. I groaned into the bed. ""The social starts in five minutes... you might want to get ready."" Oh, crap! I sprang from the bed, red-eyes wild and searching for my suitcase. The social was the most important part of the trips, where us peons had a chance to mingle with higher-ups. I'd heard that last year the CEO promoted one new-hire he'd talked to on-the-spot. If I was ever going to make the effort to schmooze, this was it. I threw on my best clothes, combed my hair with wet fingers, and took the stairs two at a time.

The complex we were staying at was massive. It had three separate towers filled with rooms with a building in the center housing large multi-purpose rooms for events. There were sky walkways from each tower to the center, but I knew a dash outside was the quickest way to get to the social. I pushed out the front door of Tower B and power-walked as professionally as I could along the curving sidewalk. I could see the double-doors in the distance, but was distracted by a huge wall of windows stretching along the building's flank. Floor-to-ceiling, I could see straight into a room full of men and women in suits and dresses. Everyone had a glass in their hand, and waiters walked with platters of finger foods. I suddenly became aware of the sweat beading on my skin from the muggy outside, the way my hair stuck up in the back from the way I'd slept on it. If I hurried I could stop in the bathroom first and still have plenty of time to mingle.

I did not look where I was going when I sped up.

I did not see the trash can, tipped on its side, until I was upside-down with one foot twisted under it.

I did not see anything after I hit the pavement and blacked out.

I'm told that, apparently, everyone else saw everything. Great.

When I woke up in the ambulance, the paramedic told me I'd tripped and rolled my foot and half my leg in the wrong direction, and hit my head on the way down.

Needless to say, I did not make a good impression on my boss. Or his boss, or anybody's bosses. I was sent home early, the only impact I made that one moment where everyone saw me looking like a complete idiot. 

When I went to the doctor back home, he told me I had sprained my ankle and would need to stay off it for a few weeks. That meant working from home. Fine. I needed some time before I could show my face at work again. The day everyone else got back from the trip I got a message from Mike. Apparently my fall had been Big News. He thought it was hilarious. ""Remind me to whack you when I get back,"" I said.

But after a few weeks my foot still hurt like a bitch. I went to the doctor again, he said everything was fine. I asked if it was normal for the bottom of my foot to be bruised a solid purple. He paled and ordered an X-Ray.

And so I found out I actually had a broken foot that had gone untreated for nearly a month. They set me up with a massive boot and shipped me home, prescribing several months of rest. I couldn't drive and could barely walk, and the pain medication they gave me barely helped. The only thing that helped was knowing nobody would remember a thing by the time I got back. At this point I was just happy to fade into obscurity, my dreams of rocketing to the top a distant memory.

Finally in late August they took the boot off, and in September I was cleared to drive and go back in to work. Aside from Mike giving me a hard time when I walked in, nobody really mentioned it. They just said they were glad to see me back in the office.

And so I forgot about what happened until next spring rolled around and I received a message in my inbox. I'd been invited to the seminar again. I groaned and went to Mike to tell him. ""They're gonna make me do this every year, aren't they? It's even at the same hotel."" Mike was surprisingly excited. His eyes lit up and he told me he was sure people would have forgotten by now, but to make sure I stopped by the day before so he could say goodbye (once again he was not invited).

So, when the dreaded day before the trip arrived, I made sure to walk past his desk on the way out. I leaned over the walls of his cubical, chatting about his kids before I said I really did have to go. ""Have a nice trip,"" he called out. I glanced over my shoulder. He looked me dead in the eyes. ""See you next fall.""",AmbiguousPenguin
[WP] Write the longest dad joke you can.,UserNameeCheckssOutt,"It started off fairly innocuously. I had gone in to see my doctor for a yearly physical. Perhaps it was a year or five since my last one, but life can just get so busy, you know? Besides, I wasn't too worried. I was in pretty good shape with no major health complaints. Just a little stiffness of the joints in the morning when I first woke up. But my wife had gotten it into her head that I should go in to see the doctor to get it checked out. I was mostly going in so that she would stop pestering me to get a check up.

The doctor gave me the usual disapproving lecture about how important it was to get a yearly checkup, but he did agree with me that I was mostly healthy and that a little stiffness of the joints was pretty common at my age. As I was getting ready to leave he did suggest that I stop by the lab to get a little bit of blood drawn, just to run a few tests. You know, just to be safe.

Two days later as I was driving the kids to soccer practice I got an apologetic call from my doctor's office. It seemed there had been some kind of contamination with my blood sample. They would need me to stop by the office to get blood drawn again. I made an appointment to stop by the following morning.

This time they walked my blood sample right over to the lab while I waited. I thought it was nice of them to get me the results so quickly, seeing as how it was their screw-up in the first place. I was making small talk with the nurse when the doctor came bursting back into the exam room. I will never forget how pale his face looked. 

""We need to get you to the hospital. Right now. Get this man on a gurney.""

They already had an ambulance waiting. I kept asking what was wrong, but only got a half muttered response about metals in my blood.  

I was taken straight over to an isolation ward in the hospital. I was met there by my doctor. He was hardly recognizable in head-to-toe hazmat gear. He tried to explain that it was just a precaution. That didn't exactly reassure me. 

I was even more nervous when he started introducing me to the half dozen doctors, all equally indistinguishable in protective coverings, that would make up my ""team."" I really didn't like the sound of that. I didn't know much about medicine, but I did know that having a ""team"" was not a good sign. They were all very friendly and concerned about my well-being, and they went about running all kinds of tests on me. I was scared. But I was even more scared when they wouldn't let my family come into the room with me. My crying wife and family had to talk to me through the floor to ceiling glass window that made up one end of the room.

The first night I spent in that white hospital room I didn't sleep a minute. I was scared, I was worried, and I was alone.

The friendly doctors didn't have any good news for me when their test results came back. I refused to believe them. I shouted. I threw a tantrum. I threw their printouts across the room. But I knew they were right. _Something_ was very wrong. I could feel it already. Their was a metallic taste in my mouth that wasn't just the fear and adrenaline. There was something very wrong with me. 

Those stark white walls and florescent lights were to be my home for a long time. I could have visitors, but they had to watch me through the window. And eventually, as my symptoms progressed, I didn't want anyone to see me. I sent my family away. I refused to see them. 

The friendly doctors tried to understand what was happening to me, but they had no answers. Eventually, one by one, they stopped coming by to run tests on me. But a case that was as unusual as mine eventually attracted the interest of others. 

Instead of friendly doctors that wanted to heal me, I was now being visited by cold, dispassionately interested scientists that wanted to study me. They would note the changes in my skin. They would take pictures of the strange growth that started to form on the top of my head. Every day they would take measurements of the changing shape of my skull that was becoming progressively more cylindrical, and compare those measurements to previous day's measurements. They would scrape off tiny specks of my skin and run mass spectrometer tests to determine that yes, the metallic content was becoming more pure by the day. They thought that they could understand what was happening to me if they could just collect enough data. So every day they would take measurements and scribble them down on their clipboards. All their data collection never did give them an answer to the question of why this was happening to me. Or at least, if they had that answer they never shared it with me. But they were able to track the changes to by body and extrapolate what the outcome of my metamorphosis would eventually be. 

The first time they showed me the artist's rendering I thought it was a joke, and not a very good one at that. I laughed at the sketch that I was holding. Until I reached up and touched the top of my head. I traced what my hands had become along the strange growth at the top of my head, and felt a shape that I had seen thousands of times, but never given much thought. I looked at the sketch with rising horror. The scientists just sadly nodded their heads and proceeded with their measurements. I sank into a depression that lasted weeks.

At this point my eventual fate was all but known, but no progress had been made in either treating or reversing my condition. And that was when I attracted the attention of a new kind of visitor: Hospital administrators. 

They never spoke to me, or even entered the room with me, But they would huddle together outside the glass window in their dark suits muttering to each other about ""unrecoverable losses"" and ""completely exhausted insurance."" They would compare charts and graphs and spreadsheets while arguing about a need to ""right the bottom line."" One day I over heard one of them call me ""little more than an expensive curiosity,"" and for some reason one of the other administrators suddenly got very excited. 

I might have been concerned, but by that point my condition had progressed to the point that I was mostly immobile. I would lay on my bed most of the time, occasionally rolling from one side to the other as the scientists needed to take measurements. It was while rolling towards the window for a circumference measurement that I first saw the man with the beady eyes and the showman's smile. I could tell that he saw dollar signs when he looked at me. I would have shivered if I was still capable of it. 

The administrators were clearly torn about what to do. Several loud arguments where had on the other side of that viewing window. Some of the administrators wanted to accept the offer made by the man with the beady eyes. The others were clearly uneasy with that decision. They would shout things about human rights and ethics. But the administrators in favor of the offer would say that human rights no longer applied in my case. Through out all of this the man with the beady eyes continued to stare at me through the window with his appraising smile. Finally the arguments of the administrators died down, and the impassioned pleas were replaced by monetary negotiations. The man with the beady eyes pulled out a checkbook.

I was quickly moved out of the isolation ward and into the back of a truck. Men that clearly worked for the man with the beady eyes moved me out of the truck with a dolly. They set my upright inside a large canvas tent. There was sawdust on the ground and hay bails set around me in a circle. 

And that was how I began my career in show business. For $3 each members of the public could come into the tent to gawk at me, The Incredible Giant Soda Can.

[WP] Write the longest dad joke you can.,UserNameeCheckssOutt,"I once had the extended acquaintance of a man whom his parents gave the name Joseph O’Daugherty. Joseph was an interesting fellow, and became somewhat of an enigma following his abrupt arrival in town. Tales of his impulsive escapades spread through the town, and he soon became a bit of a local sensation. His buoyancy and unique appearance often drew large crowds, and he would frequently start dance parties in the town square, the most popular jig being one of his own design. 

The most intriguing thing about Joseph, however, was his right eye. It was a pale, cotton-like white, the usual black pupil being entirely absent. Though in our conversations he never did reveal its cause, he did seem to wear his strange eye as a badge of honor rather than a shameful scar. Despite his quirks, Joseph was a good man. With his quick wit and kind-hearted demeanor, I could not help but call him my friend.

Unfortunately over the years, like many celebrated figures, Joseph began to fall into obscurity. On his daily struts he got naught but a glance, and his parties became nothing more than infrequent and frankly disappointing get-togethers. He became a pariah in the town, and by association, so did I. Everyone I knew in the town cut off all interaction with me, save Joseph and my parents. My parents begged me to abandon Joseph so I could regain my reputation and start a family, but I could not renounce a friend so easily.

During the next year I did a lot of talking with Joseph. And to put it bluntly, his becoming a social outcast made him extremely bitter. His anger began to rule his life, and the friend he decided to turn to was alcohol. He let the loss of his fame destroy him, and he refused to accept any of my help. He became increasingly distant, and I eventually stopped seeing him all together.

A few weeks after Joseph’s disappearance, many of the townspeople started to accept me again. Joseph began to fade out of their memories, and I came to win back my social status and respect in the town. It’s now 3 years since Joseph’s departure, and I still think about him from time to time. The one gift he unintentionally left me was my wife. By becoming a societal leper for those years accidentally led me to the girl of my dreams. If it hadn’t been for Cotton-Eye Joe, I’d have been married a long time ago. But where did you come from and where did you go? Where did you come from Cotton-Eye Joe?",Fauznaut

[WP] Write the longest dad joke you can.,UserNameeCheckssOutt,"“Daddy, Daddy!” My son cried. Running from his room towards me, he slammed hard into my thigh. With short chubby arms flung around my waist, he sobbed, “Daddy, I can’t sleep.”

Letting out a sigh, I picked him up and put him on my lap. He was going through one of those monster-under-the-bed phases. Every other night, he would climb into my bed, claiming to be running from ‘the monster under his bed.’

‘Comeon, Nick, wheres Browny? Didn’t he protect you tonight?” I asked, gently caressing his cheek.

A few weeks ago, I had bought him a stuffed horse. I told him that Browny, as Nick had so affectionally named, would be the one to protect him from the ‘monsters’ at night. It worked- I guess- every night following that, he would wake in the morning, sprouting imaginative stories of Browny.

He would tell me how amazing Browny was, his mane igniting with a glorious fire. He would tell me how he flew into the air, smiting all the monsters that crawled out from under his bed. He would tell me tales of his brave stead, donning on the greatest armor, and taking on the darkest enemies.

“They got him, Daddy. The monsters got him!” Urgency crept into his voice as he continued talking, his little hand gripping unto my shirt. “I was about to sleep when the monster came, but Browny told me to trust him and go to sleep, so I did, and I slept, but when I woke, and I wanted to hug him, I asked him to come but the woudnt so I searched for him, but he…” he paused to take in a quick breath, “he wasn’t there. So I thought at first he was playing hide and seek but… but he’s still missing and I can’t find him and I…. I….” his voice trailed off, tears welling up at the corners of his eye.

“Hey big guy,” I said, a finger wiping the tear away, “I’m sure Browny is okay, comeon, let’s go have a look.” I picked him up, letting him cling unto my neck as I stood up to go to his room.

It was in shambles.

The bedsheet was thrown across the table, books and stationary lying on the floor.  The cupboards were open, the clothes strewn all about the floor. Even the pillows and blanket were across the room.

What the fuck happened in here?

Putting him down, I gingerly made my way to the bed, stepping over the strewn clothes and pillows.

Slowly, I bent down, looking under the bed.

Browny was deep in the corner under the bed, way out of reach of a 6 year old child.

Probrably why he couldn’t find the toy.

Reaching under, I grabbed Browny, passing the toy to my son.

“He… he wasn’t there before! What about the monsters, Daddy?” He asked.

“Well,” I said, kneeling down on one knee to look him in the eye, “It was all just a Knightmare""",Wolfwailer1

Steve quickly shuffled to the spot Chris was pointing to, his ice shoes crunching with every step.

""What is it?"" Steve said out of breath. 

""I'm not sure"" Chris said as he took off his gloves. 
He reached down and touches the black goop. ""It's thick and has the consistency of tar."" He put his hand up to his face and sniffed, his expression changed from curiosity to absolute disgust. 

""And our survey says... It doesn't smell like roses"" Chris muttered. 

""Chris, what the hell are you doing? You have succeeded in failing the Golden rule of science, DON'T CONTAMINATE THE SAMPLE. "" Alice snapped at her boyfriend and colleague.

She took off her glove, reached into her backpack, and pulled out a sterile tongue depressor. Alice slowly pushed the tongue depressor into the black pool.

""Strange, this is a neutonian fluid. Getting a sample with this depressor isn't going to happen."" She let go of the wooden stick and watched it slowly sink into the fluid. She reached into her pocket a grabbed her knife. Alice sliced a thin sliver off the edge of the pool and placed it into a glass tube she had in her backpack.

""So much for 'Dont contaminate the samples'"" Chris bitched. 

""I see marriage in your future""  Steve hypothesized.

""Both of you shut it"" Alice said as she wiped her blade off on her pants.

Out of nowhere the wind kicked up and snow began falling out of what was clear sky only minutes before. 

""We have to ride this storm out guys. It must've snuck up on us. Set up your habitat shelters"" Alice ordered.

One by one the three cold weather tents began to pop up, and one by one their orange color was swallowed by the wall of white as they each retreated into their tents.

...

The storm began to subside a few hours later and Steve exited his tent. 

""Chris, Alice, it's clearing up out here."" 

When he didn't get a response he walked over to Chris's tent and patted on the top. 

""Hey guy, wake up."" 

Not hearing a response he opened the zipper. Chris wasn't there. ""Not surprising"" he muttered walking over to Alice's tent.

 ""Hey love birds wake up"" he said as he shook thier tent. 

Nothing....

He opened the tent and popped his head inside. There was no one there. Curiously​ he picked up the blanket, thier clothes were there as if they were never taken off and thier bodies just vanished. Chris winter parka had is sleeves wrapped around Alice's. He reached down and grabbed the cloths in disbelief. As he wrapped his fingers around Chris's pants his hands touched something, it was black and tar like, just like the stuff outside. 

""Fuck!"" Steve yelled, he fell to the ground and began sobbing. It will all be over soon.

""How much longer? Weathers' supposed to go south within the hour. We need to head back soon.""

Nathan pulled back his glove and stared at the bright indigo screen. 

""20 more minutes. We're almost there. Doc wanted me to take several samples from down below. He thinks there's something big down there.""

Chuck glanced down at the ice below him and shifted uncomfortably. He thought about the events and actions that led him to take this expedition, and the connections he had severed back in Idaho. Most of all, he wondered why he was even here. If anything, he was glorified muscle, or a pet. 

""What kind of something?"" Chuck said, his mind elsewhere. 

""Something unusual."" Nathan replied simply. 



Time passed without either speaking. A faint howling began in their ears, as the wind began to pick up. 



Then, suddenly, the younger of the two leapt from his place squatting over the small whirring machine. 

""What the hell!"" Nathan exclaimed.

""What's going on?"" 

""There's something bubbling up through the ice, and it's not water.""

They both gathered around the tiny cracks forming around their Intelligent Sub-Surface Drill, or I.S.S.D. 

""Looks like we found 'something unusual'"" Chuck coughed. 

""The readings don't look like anything I've seen before, it's almost like an active volcano down there."" Nathan raised his voice as the air in their ears grew louder. 

""Yeah, interesting. Let's pack up and regroup with the others at Camp. This storm is coming in hot"" 

""Five more minutes"" 

""They don't pay me enough for this"" Chuck mumbled. 

The cracks surrounding the drill began to ooze. A thick, comatose-blackness that could only be described as the color of the outer reaches of nothingness and death. Nathan yelped.

""Have we just struck oil?"" Chuck yelled over the decibels of wind now pounding against them. 

""No, you imbecile, that's not oil."" Nathan began to pace backwards from the drill, now half submerged in sludge.

""What is it?"" Chuck said, following Nathan's lead.

""I don't know. This isn't supposed to be here!"" Nathan yelled.

""What do you mean it's not supposed to be here?!"" Chuck yelled back, frustration growing in his voice.



""I think...I think...""

Snow began blanketing everything, a cocktail of screaming wind and no visibility. Yet like a huge cancer on the landscape, the blackness grew, and the white could not pierce it. 

""I think we...woke something up""

"[WP] Imagine a younger species of man, one that didn't have their parents repeatedly tell them ""Don't play with fire."" How did the world end up?",possibly_pretentious,"**The Blackfoot Tribe**

The fire crackled in the blackfoot leader's pit, lighting the night with angry flames. The youngling squirmed and wriggled in the hands of the warriors, who held him down. They sang a guttural song for him, to soothe his nerves, to calm his fright. For this was the day of him becoming a man.

""The fire gives, the fire takes."", the blackfoot leader roared over their song.

""May it give us warmth and burn our enemies."", the tribes people echoed his prayer from many throats.

""May the flame burn ever brightly!"", the leader ended the prayer and the crowd responded by humming ""Mmmmmh""

""You! Youngling. This is the day of your ascension."" The leader walked over, the pit of fire standing between him and the boy.

""But you first must take the test of the flame."", he said and threw something in the flames to entice them to burn higher and more fiercely.

""I ask you: Are you ready?""

""Yes!"", the boy screamed with all force he could muster, while his face was a grimace of fear.

""I ask you: Is he ready?"", the leader asked the people of the tribe, men and women, old and young, who stood around the fire to welcome a new adult member to their society.

""Yes!"", they said.

""Then you shall take the test of the flame."", the leader announced.

The youngling fidgeted around, but the warriors pressed something on his lips, that was lit by fire on the other end, and forced him to inhale. The boy erupted in violent coughs, but his limbs calmed down. Slowly, they inched him closer to the fire, until his feet almost touched it.

""Begin!"", the leader shouted.

Like in trance, the boy stretched his feet into the fire. Flames started to dance around his toes and the smell of searing flesh spread across the clearing. His skin started to crack open, where the fire touched it. At first, the boy endured the pain, but then he screamed from it and tried to pull his feet back, but the warriors held him in place and sang their song to the fast beat of the drums.

When they were finished, they pulled him from the fire. The boy's cries died down to a whimpering.

""Rise."", the leader commanded and his warriors helped the youngling up. As he touched the sand on the ground with the blemished sole of his feet, he screamed from the pain again. The sand melted under his feet, fusing with the burned flesh.

""Now walk."", the leader commanded again and pointed to a bed of coals, that the youngling was supposed to cross. The warriors let go of the boy; he had to do it alone. At first, it looked like, the boy would fall over instantly, but he regained his balance on his own.

The boy walked on the bed of coals, crying out from the pain at the bottom of his soles from time to time. But he mastered it, falling into the arms of his new brothers and sisters, who welcomed him into adulthood with a smile.

""Now you are one of us! May the flame burn ever brightly for you!"", the blackfoot leader announced and the whole tribe erupted into song and dance.

""How absolutely fascinating!"", Professor Heynes uterred, as his captors had joined the rest of the tribe in celebration.

""Seems stupid to me. They're literally burning their feet. Poor boy never gonna take a walk in his life without painkillers again."", Lorren said next to him, but Lorren had never been one to appreciate the finer points of anthropology. He was more the adventurer type, more interested in women and not what culture they belonged to.

""Self mutilation is widespread among primitive tribes."", Professor Heynes lectured him.

""Doesn't make it less stupid.""

""We have to take a picture of it as soon as we can."", the professor said, ignoring Lorren's comment.

""Anytime, Professor. Just cut me lose from these and I'll get right to it.""

The professor looked from Lorren's tied up hands and feet to his own.

""Oh. Right. Maybe we can barter our release?"", the Professor suggested.

""With what?""

""They seem to be invested a great deal into fire. Perhaps your box of matches could interest them?""

""My box of matches? The whole place is practically on fire. I don't think they'd be too thrilled about lighting a tiny stick of wood. Besides, I left it in the camp."", Lorren explained.

""Well, then we have to wait for the guide to come back with Yosemite and the others.""

""If they don't burn us before in that fire of theirs, that is."", 

""What reason would they have for that?"", Professor Heynes asked.

""You're the anthropologist. You tell me, if they'd do something like that."" Lorren shrugged.

""They probably would."", the professor answered calmly, watching the tribe of fire lovers celebrate by dancing around the flames with these black feet of theirs.

"[WP] Imagine a younger species of man, one that didn't have their parents repeatedly tell them ""Don't play with fire."" How did the world end up?",possibly_pretentious,"Boiwun gazed up at the enormous, white cone-shaped fruit hanging from the highest branch of the big tree. He stood directly beneath it, mouth open and tongue hanging down his chin, as the strange fruit dripped delicious warm golden goo into his mouth.

""Mmm,"" he said, smacking his lips succulently. 

He liked that. Had no idea what it was, but he liked it.  Boiwun decided he wanted to eat that fruit. 

Now the big question: how to obtain what Boiwun already thought of as *goofruit*. 

It was up high. Real high. He didn't want to climb that high. But, for some reason, that was the only *goofruit* on the whole tree! 

Boiwun went down to the stream, grabbed a clothful of rocks, and went back to the *goofruit* tree. 

Boiwun tossed a large, flat rock up at the *goofruit*. The thought of aiming hadn't occurred to him yet. The rock hit the trunk of the tree, bounced off, and came back down on top of his head. 

Boiwun howled with pain, and slapped a hand to his throbbing head. Which, of course, only made it hurt worse. 

He glared at the *goofruit* angrily. This was its fault. Stupid *goofruit*. 

He tossed another rock up at the white dome, and this time the pulsing bump on his head encouraged him to throw with purpose. 

**Clunk**

The rock had hit its mark! More goo dripped out as the strange fruit rocked back and forth. There was a loud humming now, and Boiwun saw little bugs circling the *goofruit* in the air. 

He screamed at them. That was **his** *goofruit*! 

He threw another rock, this time at the bugs. He couldn't tell if he hit any of the bugs, but he hit *something*. 

A moment later a stringy blue-green blur toppled out if the tree, and landed on the ground beside him. 

""Gah!"" he shrieked upon realizing what it was. Danger squiggle! 

It twisted and coiled and hissed at Boiwun, revealing its pink double-tongue. 

""Gah!"" Boiwun shouted again and threw a rock at the danger squiggle. It missed, and now he was out of rocks. 

He jumped on the big tree and began clawing his way up. He laughed victoriously, before he remembered that danger squiggles could climb trees, too. 

The danger squiggle started squiggling around the tree behind him, snapping its long jaws. He climbed furiously, barely managing to outpace the slithering thing. As he got higher he could hear the humming getting louder.

He had forgotten all about the *goofruit*! 

He climbed over to the side of the tree where the fruit hung. Thr bugs circling it were bigger than he thought, and colorful. They were orange and black like tigers. Weird little tigerflies. He stretched out over a branch, gripping the tree's trunk for support. He could almost reach it!

A tigerfly landed on his nose. Searing, white hot pain shot through the front of his face. He screamed, his eyes watered, and he let go of the trunk. 

Boiwun fell out of the tree. 

-----

Boiwun came home that night with a big gooseegg on his head, a swollen red nose, and a limp. 

His brother, Boitu, indicated through a series of gestures and grunts that he looked like he had been in a fight with a monkey. 

Boiwun thought Boitu signed that he was a son of a monkey, and promptly punched *him* in the nose. The boys started fighting, so Ma took to them with a stick. 

Da came into camp holding something red and glowing on a stick, which captured. everyone's attention. He was smiling. He gestured for his family to make a pile of wood and sticks. When they did, he put the glowing end of the stick to the pile, and it also turned red and glowing and hot. 

Magic! 

It was magic. Da got the magic from their neighbor, Krum.

""Fire!"" he half-shouted and pointed at the glowing red magic, which was now producing a black mist.

""Ooh. Fire!"" the boys chanted in unison. 

Then, Da did something crazy. He held a leg of the hog Ma had butchered over the *fire*. He waited, and a delicious aroma filled the camp. After a few minutes he handed the leg to Ma. She took a bite and laughed, mouth full and hog juice running down her chin. She handed the leg to Boiwun, who took a bite, and then handed it to Boitu. They relished the taste of the juicy, warm hogmeat. 

They started putting other things over the red-magic. 

Da held the rest of the hog over it, then handed it out to the others. Ma held a spear over it, when popped and melted and fell into the fire. The boys giggled with delight. Boiwun peed on the fire, and Ma yelled at him when it almost disappeared. Boitu put his ass on the fire, and then screamed and ran away. Da chuckled long and hard as Boitu ran in circles holding his bum. 

Suddenly, Boiwun had an idea. 

He contemplated hiding this idea from his brother and keeping the *goofruit* for himself, but he decided it might be better to have an accomplice this time. 

-----

The next day, Boiwun and Boitu went to the big tree. 

Boiwun pointed up at the *goofruit*, identifying the enemy that had caused him such anguish. He spat up at his tormenter, which rose up into the air a foot or two, and then came back down on his forehead. He wiped away his own spit, grumbling. 

Boitu giggled at this and then approached the base of the tree. He was holding a stick with the red-magic (*fire*) on it. Boiwun joined him, and then they brought the glowing point of the stick to the base of the treetrunk. 

The boys watched with glee as the *fire* raced up the tree like a danger squiggle, and gathered beneath the *goofruit*, ready to catch it when it fell. 

The tree began to pop and hiss in protest, as the red-magic consumed branches and leaves. Suddenly, when the *fire* climbed a branch that was close to another tree, it jumped over to the other tree! Now the red-magic was quickly consuming both trees in a hot, angry feast. 

The two boys were so fascinated by this that they forgot to catch the *goofruit* when it fell. It landed on the ground between them with a *splat*. They gathered the goo with both hands and shoved fistfuls of the stuff into their mouths as they danced around the angry tigerflies. They sucked their fingers and licked the sweet golden goo from hands. 

Then a *fire*y branch fell next to Boiwun. Then another. Then a burning leaf landed on Boitu's arm and he howled with pain. 

The boys looked around.

The red-magic was eating up all the trees! Thick blackmist began to fill the forest like fog. All around them, trees were red-hot and falling apart. 

They ran back to camp. When the got there they looked back to see the world burning around them. ",Aaron_Abysmal
"[WP] Imagine a younger species of man, one that didn't have their parents repeatedly tell them ""Don't play with fire."" How did the world end up?",possibly_pretentious,"A man stood near a flame. It yelled and roared with heat and light. Courage overtook the man, and he challenged the fire, screeched at it, waved his hands about; the man plunged towards the fire, stopping just before it.

The heat overwhelmed the man and he stepped back. Sweat formed on his forehead; beads began to race down his face and then to his neck, and then down his chest and body. But the man stayed erect and confident, not wanting to back down.

The man collected himself, and when he was rested and good he screeched once more. Then again. Several times more. And again. The fire was still strong. The man became very angry, for he had met his match.  

The man started to wonder and then fear - fear the fire wasn't his equal, the fire was his superior. Then he dropped to his knees and the man wept to the spirit of the fire.

In the midst of his prayer a strong wind formed. And the breeze of the wind killed the flame.",useruseher

"[WP] Imagine a younger species of man, one that didn't have their parents repeatedly tell them ""Don't play with fire."" How did the world end up?",possibly_pretentious," I juggled the small ball of fire while my professor talked about how people had trouble controlling the elements in the second millennia. She went on to explain how  we had then evolved over a millennia slowly learning the art of controlling the elements. First through machines, then bio-augmentation, then it had slowly started occurring to us naturally, like riding a bike. I stared at the ball of fire in my hands and wondered what it would've been like to get burnt. My friends that learnt to control other elements like water told me that it was kind of like a strong itching sensation.

 Suddenly we heard a loud *bang!*. Everyone paused and listened. No possible way, I thought. Then it happened again only louder this time. The Forsaken would never mount an attack against us, the biggest guild in North America. The ball of fire in my hands grew larger, to the size of a baseball. Then I made it hotter, burning blue at the core. The wall exploded, and in came Notsus Pishus, shadows whirling around him like writhing snakes.

Everyone leapt out of there seats and there was silence. Notsus laughed and spoke ""I'm just here to make an offer, I harbor no ill will towards any of you."" his voice came from every corner of the room. ""My offer extends to a couple of students in this room. Everyone who is specified class A and up may join me sometime for some tea and biscuits to listen to what I have to say to them about joining a guild I'm forming. You'll get your invitation soon enough I just thought I should appear in person, so as not to be rude."" he exclaimed heartily. Screams and shouts broke out and our professor called up an icy wind. The dark aura around him formed into an old fashioned top hat which he tipped towards us. The wind hit him but he was already gone into the shadows. As we were ushered into the main guild hall I thought, I'm an S class manipulator.

"[WP] Imagine a younger species of man, one that didn't have their parents repeatedly tell them ""Don't play with fire."" How did the world end up?",possibly_pretentious,"Of course it was stupid to play with fire. Even our younglings learned so after the fire’s first bite. But the elder’s looked on, smiling, as if we would soon learn the truth to such a curiosity. 

“You’ll understand when you need to,” they told us. “We hope it isn’t too late by then.”

So we kept at it, reaching through the flames only to feel that familiar bite. Most gave up, chalking this ritual up as a way to trust common sense. Others claimed it was to separate the suicidally dim from the *at least smart enough not to kill themselves*.

That’s where I belonged. The suicidally dim of course.

---

The fire snapped up and nipped me. My hand shot back to my chest with another red welt. I no longer yelped when bitten. It only drew more attention to Serra, the girl who still played with fire. Unfortunately, nobody needed a voice to find me, they only needed to follow the smoke.

“Serra.” The voice belonged to Michael. Back when we were younglings, we played together with the flames, but he grew out of it. “Please tell me you’re not still burning yourself.”

The bushes to my left moved and some more footsteps followed after Michael. I sighed. By himself, Michael was an okay guy, but as soon as you throw in anything else with a pulse, he completely changed. Especially toward me. Really, only toward me.

Of the many theories regarding our village’s strange ritual, Michael was a believer of the one about the suicidally dim. It was a theory that I found myself believing too. And then every so often, it felt as if the flames would respond to my touch, like I was communicating to it. When all it did was burn me again, I truly felt like I was suicidally dim.

 “Are you stupid or do you just enjoy hurting yourself?” he asked, appearing from the shrubbery into the small clearing in the woods I had purposefully found to avoid him.

“What’s it to you?” I snapped and returned my gaze to the flames.

“I’m just curious if you’re the biggest idiot in the village or just a masochist.”

His two cronies chuckled and high-fived each other. They were stereotypical ax-wielders. So for them to understand a three syllable word, I nearly congratulated them. Michael trained in swords, though he lacked any of the nobility of most of our tribe’s swordsmen. It was obvious simply by the company he kept.

“And you walked into the Forbidden Forest to find me. You in love or something?” I shot back.

All three of their mouths scrunched. 

“With you?” Michael rolled his eyes, glancing back at his friends. “The girl obsessed with flames, with hair as red as fire, and a temperament like it too.”

I raised a brow. A four syllable word. He’s been reading. “And here I am, hiding out in the middle of a god damn forest and who shows up? I’m not sure I’m the one obsessed here.”

Michael burned a bright red and flicked his eyes to the ground. “The elders told me to get you. We’re not allowed in the forbidden forest.”

A lie. His two human laugh tracks might’ve missed it, but I’ve known this kid since birth.

My lips spread into a smirk. “You scared of a few beasts? Perhaps Nana’s stories are getting to you. Think The Hunters will come get us?”

They were the forest’s Boogie Men, shadows that stalked the Forbidden Forests with ravenous dogs darker than the deepest night. As their name implied, they hunted anything that moved within the forest. One day, they would finish hunting everything inside the forest and move onto us.

“I’m not scared!” he declared.

My smile grew. I had him. “Then you’re worried. For little ol’ me?”

His fists clenched. He opened his mouth but only got through the first syllable, but cutting himself off. “You’re insane!” he finally shouted. “Play with your fire you stupid fire-girl.” He turned and disappeared back into the shrubbery.

I watched him go, the entire time smiling at his back. When he disappeared, so did my smile. Once again, it was just me and the flames. It crackled to comfort me. Or because it was a fire and that’s what fire sometimes did and I was truly an idiot for believing otherwise. I clenched my own fists. Would the elders really watch us all burn ourselves for no reason whatsoever?

No way. They had to have a reason. I just needed to find it.

---

The forest darkened and the shadows stretched. I looked up from the flames and saw that the sky had turned into a purple haze. Another day spent playing with fire and I was no close to the truth than eight years ago, which accounted for half my life.

I was just about to put out the flames when a shrill howl echoed through the forest. My back immediately straightened and I looked toward the noise. All I saw were more trees and shadows. Somehow, between me looking down at the flames and the howling, the sky had completely darkened, enveloping me in a blackness battled only by my fire.

Another howl answered the previous one, this one ear-splitting. I plugged my ears and twisted toward it only for another to answer, right behind me. One by one, howls sounded from all around. Then, silence.

A chilling breeze blew past me, whisking the flames in a small dance. It sounded the only noise beside my pounding heart.

“Michael?” I whispered with stuttered breath. If this was a prank, I was going to kill him. I dearly wished this was a prank.

A figure stepped out of the overgrowth, but none of the bushes moved. It looked like a human shadow, standing on its own. Even stepping up to the fire did not reveal it from the darkness. By its side trotted a dog the size of a wolf with eyes red as blood. It growled and a chorus of baritone growls followed suit.

“Michael?” I tried again, though I already knew my fate. 

“Serra!” the bush’s rattled and Michael popped out, sword already mid-swing. Silver flashed and The Hunter disappeared, leaving only his hound behind.

Michael snuck a look back and illuminated by the flames, I saw the furtive glance he had given me since our days as a youngling. Of course, only now did I recognize it. Worry. He really did follow me into the Forest because of it and now, he was trapped by The Hunters because of it.

The beast growled and pounced. Michael caught its teeth with his blade. It snapped at the sword, grinding its fangs into steel. He wrestled his sword out of its grip and kicked it back. It hit the ground and rolled back up, unfazed.

The rest of the hounds stepped out of the shrubbery. I counted four plus the one Michael was facing.

“Serra,” he said, slowly backing into me. “When I say so, run.”

I nodded. The Hunters were mythical beings our heroes fought in fairytales with flaming swords. There was no way two teenagers could do anything but run.

“Run!”

I launched off the ground and ran. The dogs pounced. Somehow, none hit me. We were doing it, we were going to make it!

I glanced backwards and found Michael standing beside the fire, his shirt tattered and ripped with claw marks. One arm dangled useless at his side while the other trembled with his sword. I dug my heels into the ground.

“You’re kidding me,” I muttered. After all this time, and *now* he chooses to be noble. Now of all times!

My body moved on its own. My legs were pistons carrying me back toward him. It wasn’t as if I wanted to be a hero. Hell, I spent most my life being called the village’s biggest idiot. But an even bigger idiot was under my nose this entire time. Like hell I was letting him die.

“Michael!” I shrieked and the flames responded. They roared to life and grew into an inferno, snapping at every shadow within their reach. “Michael!” I commanded. They responded and surrounded him. 

The dogs yelped and ran away, leaving only me, the fire, and Michael clutching his arm in awe.

I stopped in front of him, gasping for air. “You must be the biggest idiot in the village,” I told him.

He grinned back, wobbled backwards, and collapsed into the ground. Of course, every weapon The Hunter’s had was laced with their poison, including their dogs. And if the stories were true, that gave Michael about three more days to live.

"[WP] Every morning, an object would appear on your nightstand that helps you get through your day. Except this morning you find a cooking pan and minutes later, you start hearing gunshots and screams nearby.",whycantichooseausern,"""The random objects that began appearing on my nightstand always seemed to be exactly what I needed at some point in the day. Usually a spare pen or a dollar bill, there were always the odd times when something really cool would be there, like a waffle or a bow-staff. Perhaps my favorite thing to wake up to and find sitting on my nightstand was the woman who became my wife... but that's a story for a different time. 

""When I woke up this morning to a gunshot, I figured that my nightstand would have a gun, or a phone with the SWAT team on speed dial, or even a vial with some concoction that would give me the abs of Thor. I wasn't so lucky. The fates instead offered me a frying pan. 

""I heard another shot, and then the screaming started. Every few minutes, another shot would go off. I always thought I was in a good neighborhood, but I figured some gangs were fighting over new territory or something. I tried to block out the noise of the fighting, and figured I would put the frying pan to good use. 

""As the bacon began sizzling, I opened the kitchen window so that when my wife woke up- yes, that is the same wife who I found on my nightstand- the house wouldn't smell like burning pig. The gunshots seemed even louder, but I was getting in the zone. The fat was dripping off the bacon, I was flipping each piece over and they were just starting to reach that point of crispy perfection where you bite into it and you...""

The police officer glared at me. 

""Sorry, I guess you don't need to hear that part. But, as I said, I'm getting in my bacon zone, when suddenly I hear a gunshot outside the window. Before I could do anything, I have a rifle pointing through my window, in the hands of a small asian man. At me, might I add. The man holding the rifle asked for a bite of what I was cooking. I consented, and as I watched him chew that bacon, his eyes lit up.

""He lowered his rifle, and sauntered off. The gunshots stopped, and then a few minutes later I heard sirens and you guys arrested me.""

At the cop's skeptical look, I added, ""I swear, officer!""

In response, he left the room, muttering something about checking out my explanation with his boss. 

Four and a half hours later, the door to my cell opened again. Before I could complain about the injustice of the whole situation, my jaw dropped. 
Donald Trump shook my hand and said, ""On behalf of the United States of America, I would like to offer you a Medal of Honor for appeasing the threat of North Korea only twenty eight minutes into their invasion. Your excellent cooking has caused Kim Jong Un to... errr... declare an alliance with us, thus ending all difficulties we had with them.""

When my facial expression only went from being simply shocked to being completely and utterly flabbergasted, he explained, ""Well, you see... Old Kim seems to want some of your bacon every Friday morning, and... there would be certain difficulties in acquiring that from an inconscpic- previously inconspicuous- citizen in the middle of an enemy nation. So, he said all bets are off, and is now disarming the whole of North Korea and opening the borders.""

I sighed as the President patted me on the back and walked out. They took the handcuffs of me, and I was escorted home. After I walked through the door, I collapsed on my couch. Being arrested and meeting the president in the same twenty four hours made for a very hectic day. 
Out of the corner of my eye I saw the frying pan sitting on the kitchen counter, still dirty, and muttered, ""Why couldn't I have just gotten a waffle today?""",captainminnow

If I had to assign a taste to [electroswing,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eco4z98nIQY) which is like my favorite genre ever, It'd taste like a full three-course meal, made by a close friend who's pulling recipes out from their grandmother's recipe box.

[OT] We Are the Mods! Ask us anything!,WritingPromptsRobot,"You write.

And I know this is stupid, shitty, advice, but you write. I know this firsthand. My father died two years ago, in late 2015. The months leading up were dreadful. He had been admitted into the hospital several times before, as his kidneys and heart were just... failing. He was on oxygen tanks the last month of his life. When he died at 4AM in the morning on the last day of November, I had to hold my dog so she didn't get in the way of the paramedics fruitlessly trying to revive my father. I watched for 45 minutes. I made myself an English muffin afterward. It was the probably the most tasteless thing I've ever had to eat. 

November is also National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo). I basically spent that November and those months trying any way possible to escape my life. I binge watched Rick and Morty and Superjail. I took way too many naps. More importantly, I wrote 30,000 words, only stopping during those final, precious days before my dad's departure. I'm probably never going to hit that level of writing productivity ever again. 

Nearly 2 years have passed. I'm in the same boat as you. I'm going into my first year in college, and while I have a majority of it paid off thanks to student aid and scholarships, there's about 4,000 in cash that I have 0 clue where it's going to come from. The second year, I assume, will be worse than that. My mom can't help, as she's completely broke (and aging)

But it's not all bad. Those 30,000 words over time have developed themselves into 60,000 words of decent writing. Just yesterday, I received the cover for it. I'm going to self-publish that work soon. It's a reminder of how far I've come despite the odds. And, at the recognition page?

*""To Dad.""*

Writing isn't going to solve all of your problems, and it's not going to save the day by making boatloads of money. 

But it's better than stopping to suffer.

If you haven't already, check out Justice's Phantom pt 1, 1.5, and 2. It's basically a shorter version of Daft Punk's Alive 2007 (which IS THE BEST.) that combines a bunch of their songs into one long live jam. 

As for other bands, I'd suggest Digitalism. My favorites from them are Idealistic, Echoes, and Power Station. ",Samjez
[OT] We Are the Mods! Ask us anything!,WritingPromptsRobot,"Those are some good questions.

For the song I like that other people don't, I'm going to go with The [Postal Service's Natrual Anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69jvJwLhkFE). It's different from their other work, takes forever to build up, and there's no way I'd play it in say, like a roadtrip setting. But man, once it hits the few lyrics at the end, it becomes perfection.

 **EDIT:** I totally remembered another song that would fit. [I'll Believe in Anything by Wolf Parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdgmU8ug0tE) is grating. The singer and the synths are super grating on the ears, but the drums somehow ground it and turn it from an annoying song to an emotional one.

For the song most people like that I don't- I want to say Look What You Made Me Do by Taylor Swift. This isn't me hating on pop music or anything (I actually keep a close eye on the billboard 100) but the song sounds bad. It sounds like someone threw together a bunch of instruments without thinking. Swish Swish by Katy Perry sounds the same way, but at least every opinion I've seen of that song has been negative.",Samjez
[OT] We Are the Mods! Ask us anything!,WritingPromptsRobot,"Ooh, can I make some suggestions?

The ""genre defining"" bands are Parov Stelar and Caravan Palace. Booty Swing and Catgroove are Parov's defining songs, while Rock it for me and Lone Digger are Caravans, although all of their music is amazing. 

Then there's bands like Goldfish, The new Tuesday Weld, and Caro emerald that have been doing this for a while, but are lesser known then they should be. My personal favorites from these bands are Fort Knox, Me and Mr. Wolf, and Stuck (respectively). 

All in all, it's actually a really big genre. Some bands lean more towards English, while others lean towards their lyrics being in French (where a lot of these bands come from). Some are ""electro"" then ""swing"" while others sound straight from the 1920s.

"[WP] The other gods laughed when you said you wanted to be the god of science. Now, your gamble has more than paid off.",alegonz,"At the risk of being rude -- and I don't intend it that way -- and at the risk of being downvoted to oblivion -- I was a bit disappointed here.

This started out wonderfully written, and that continued through the whole piece. It's an interesting story, the characters feel real. I was getting pretty into it. 

And then it just stops. The ending doesn't give the resolution I crave when I'm reading, and it's not long enough to hook me strongly enough to be panting for more. 

It feels rushed at the end, like some of my stories do when I just get sick of them, or want to stop writing.

I don't know if you had other things to do, or if you were just tired, or worried no one would like it... but it's a shame, because if the story had reached the end, I think it would have been a beautiful thing.

And, like I said, I'm not trying to be rude, it's just that I recognize something I do myself, and, as I said, I was a little disappointed.

&gt;Let me know if you're interested and I can write more!

Because I would have been interested enough to read more, if there had *been* more. Like... it could have been a great first chapter? But it isn't complete, even that way, if that makes sense?

And it gets me wondering, in an academic sort of way, how far I need to go, when I'm writing, to hook readers into reading on.

So I'm replying, more to organize my thoughts, because this made me determined not to do any ""bbl"" or ""if people are interested"" posts, because it's quite irritating, to  me personally, and I don't want to be hypocritical.

So thank you, for teaching me something. And I'll go ahead and turn the tables here.

He'd put himself between the house and a would-be invader so he obviously wasn't one of them.

He'd been there before, being neighborly. It's kind of hard-wired into people to be civil in those sort of encounters.

Also, they obviously want to *avoid* suspicions and curious looky-loos, and well, sometimes the best way to avoid those people is to confront them. Refusing to answer the door again, when she'd already demonstrated that someone was home, would have made him more suspicious/curious/nosy.

And, after all, if the knight hadn't run in, she could have just said something along the lines of ""look, I appreciate you reaching out, but we don't want to be pals, and right now you're trespassing"" and that could have been the end of it.

Idk, people don't always react in entirely logical or predictable ways.  Personally I read it like she'd just opened the door cause she's a teenager, and she's exasperated and just wants to be done with them both. :P",JDKipley
"[WP]: Every day on your way to work you pass a house with a sign in the window. ""WE DO NOT HAVE A DRAGON. PLEASE GO AWAY.""

And while those other lizards might be more common to people who keep lizards as pets--they aren't necessarily more well-known to those who don't.

When the girl in the story said ""lizard"", I thought ""iguana"". My dad had one, in a huge cage, when I was small, and I thought it looked  quite like a dragon. Because that was my most formative experience, that was what I thought of. 

I think that makes it work well in the story. Another character might have assumed ""chameleon"", but it would still be an assumption, and lead to the assumption line in the story. The very point of the passage was that she hadn't named the type of lizard--and people *do* tend to assume.

It doesn't matter if it makes sense or if the plot has enough holes you could call it sinkhole city, the only way to get better is through practice. The more you write and the more you read (yes, the reading bit is important!) the better you'll get at writing. 

And as MajorParadox said, we have some great writing resources in our wiki! :D ",Syraphia
[OT] We Are the Mods! Ask us anything!,WritingPromptsRobot,"Honestly, you do what works for you. If you need to focus down onto something specific to get to writing and that works, you do that. The only thing is getting that pen on paper to actually do the writing instead of getting lost in the details of what you ""should"" be doing. 

Best of luck to you! :D ",Syraphia
[PI] We finally get men on Mars and they discover an old Soviet flag placed down decades ago. The Soviets won the space race but for whatever horrifying reason didn't say anything.,dannedadon,"“Yes, Commander,” replied Viktor and the rest nodded somberly. Ellis and Sara got into Harleen together and set off towards the mysterious object between them and what Scott had started calling ‘Mount Doom’ from some old story he had read in his youth. The name had caught on and they had all started referring to it as Mount Doom. Harleen traversed the Martian terrain easily and they both watched the little highlighted dot on the display that represented the unknown object move closer and closer to the dot that represented Harleen. Last time that the vehicle had been out here on her own, it had passed about 200 meters away from the object, close enough to determine that it wasn’t part of its mission at the time but far enough out to not get any good holographic projections of the object. Their plan now was to reach the same distance and wait a little while, just in case anything happened. 

When they were about a kilometer out Harleen picked it up on the long range sensors and they had a live reading of the object now and not just a geographical representation on the monitor. It still read as unknown and artificial, the chemical composition came back and the analysis concluded that it was Nylon and anodized Aluminum that made up the object. They tried cross-referencing that with the limited database on board the Harvester but even that came up with too long a list to go through that contained those materials.

“Doesn’t seem to be anything that contains any electronics at least,” said Einarsdottir. “Perhaps it’s not anything of importance but simply some debris from any number of Mars missions?”

“Perhaps…” responded Ellis.

They continued to near the object and when they were little more than 200 meters out they stopped the vehicle and tried to observe the object. It was hard to see anything with the Martian winds blowing streaks of red dust everywhere and looking through the vid pickups of Harleen they couldn’t really make out what it was. It seemed to be something that stood up about a meter and a half from the ground and resisted the strong winds. Even at this distance they couldn’t gather any useful information about what it was and after doing another electromagnetic sweep and finding no electronics on it they decided to chance it and move closer. As they neared, the object became clearer and clearer and when they finally reached it they couldn’t explain what they saw. They exited Harleen to get an even better look and as they walked around the vehicle and stood in front of the object, their jaws dropped. It was a small statue of a man and woman wearing space suits and adorned with large pieces of cloth that were frozen around them as if caught in a great wind, they were standing shoulder to shoulder and had their arms raised above them almost as a greeting. The man who stood to the left had in his left hand, a hammer and the woman mirroring him to the right, carried a sickle in her right. In the middle there was a long pole which they both clasped with their other hands and at the end of that pole was a flag, a more vivid red than the sky above them, adorned with a hammer, sickle and star in the top left corner. There was an inscription at the base of the statue and it seemed to be translated into five different languages. Thanks to the complant they could translate and read any of the languages but their eyes rested on the English translation and their shock and astonishment grew even more than when they saw the statue, it read “We came her as the first of our species to lay claim to this world for our Motherland in the hopes for a future where we are all one people ruled from Moscow. – August 9th 1982.” They stood there for a moment, not knowing what to say to each other about what they saw. The scene in front of them spawned so many questions in their minds and finally Sara spoke.
“This can’t be right… I refuse to believe this, we’re not first…” 

“Indeed, it appears we’re not first, and by quite the margin if this date is accurate,” replied Ellis looking at the inscription on the statue. Even this last honor of being first on the planet had been undeniably stripped from them and somehow this unknown enemy had struck another blow that felt harder to get over than the missiles. They had spent years in preparation and in transit to reach Mars only to find that they were second, or perhaps third, how many more people had been here? It was impossible to tell since the date on the statue preceded the global tracking system by at least 50 years. There could be a whole colony hidden up here and they wouldn’t have known about it from Earth.

“Let’s document everything and get back to the habitat, we have the answer we came here for.” Ellis sounded bitter even to herself but she couldn’t help it, through all of this the pride of doing what no one else had done had been her badge of honor and now that badge proved to be fake. They got into Harleen and took off at full speed towards the habitat, unsure of what to tell the other when they got there. The mood in the vehicle was if possible even more somber than it had been during the ride to the statue.

As they pulled up to the habitat Ellis reached out to the house using the complant, these short distances were safe to use as the signal didn’t cross kilometers of possibly not so empty terrain, and informed the other that they were back and to gather up in the common area and go over their findings. They disembarked Harleen and made their way through the airlock inside, took off their suits and relaxed into the couch there. The others joined in as they finished up whatever they were doing and settled down in the common area.

“First things first, how’s Månsson doing?” Asked Ellis. 

“He is better, the medunit is reporting that he should be up tomorrow even if he will be disoriented and will have some memory gaps. He woke up twice while you were gone but he was pretty out of it and quickly fell asleep again,” Kapoor informed the others.

“What did you find?” Asked Viktor who couldn’t contain the curiosity they all felt.

“We are not alone on this planet,” answered Ellis. She let the others absorb that for a second and then continued.

“What we found was this…” she added and showed them a holo recording of the statue they had found complete with the inscription.

“I don’t believe it!” Said Scott. “How can this be? They beat us to Mars by 110 years?”

“There is no way that can be true,” said Kapoor. “This must be some kind of trick by… by… someone,” he finished tamely without knowing who he suspected could have pulled of that trick.

“It appears, according to that inscription that the Soviet Union, that’s Old Russia before they joined our Alliance, sent out manned missions to Mars shortly after the US landed on the Moon. Why they didn’t make it public knowledge is unknown. None of the satellite captures ever picked up the object because it is so small, we only noticed it now because it was off towards Mount Doom and that missile came for us.” 

“But I mean, over a hundred years ago? How would they have the technology to do this? And without anyone knowing? It just can’t be possible!” 

“Have you ever heard anything about this Viktor?” Ellis asked of the only person on the crew who came from that region.

“Nothing, growing up I knew that the Soviets considered themselves the super power on Earth for a while and that they rivalled the US when it came to space technology, but when they lost the race to the Moon I have been taught that they focused inward instead and made the point that the soviets focused on their people while the US wasted resources on the stars. Nowhere I know has there ever been mentioned a manned mission to Mars over a hundred years ago,” he sounded shocked.

“At least we keep making progress. We now have a name to our attacker and a location, what we are missing is why they attacked us and what kind of capabilities they have of doing more damage to us. As we approached the habitat I accessed the library computers on near scan so it wouldn’t be detectable and read up all I could about the soviets. Why they wouldn’t let the world know they had made this unimaginable achievement is beyond me, it doesn’t make sense. They were in the forefront of technology if they could sustain, what must have been more than, a seven year journey back then,” said Ellis. The room once more fell into silence as they all thought about what this discovery meant for them and their chances of survival. An enemy that had been here for 110 years surely must have detected the habitat landing and the automated setup procedure ten years ago. Why hadn’t they attacked the station as well when they blew up Revelation?

“Did you find anything of importance here while we were gone?” Asked Sara.

“Nothing of note really, in fact, it’s almost suspicious how little we have found about our neighbors if they’ve been here for such a long time. There are no indications anywhere from any sources that they are here. I’ve gone through all the information about Mars from the Agency when it comes to known structures from other Alliances as well as satellite reports or other kind of readings. None of them mention anything out of the ordinary, so either they are really good at hiding themselves wherever they are or they haven’t gone out onto the planet. Both of those possibilities carry large implications with them,” answered Viktor.

“I also found nothing about them,” added Kapoor. “It is like they do not exist here, and it is likely that if we had not been shot out of the sky we would not have noticed that statue since it is well outside our mission area.” They carried on the conversation for a little while but made no more progress. Scott limped into the room and joined them as well, he had been listening in to the conversation from his improvised work area.

The first one to wake up was Kapoor. At first, his mind was a blank. He couldn’t remember where he was or even who he was. The concept of a time and place didn’t exist in his head as he searched his brain for any kind of answer. It started to come back to him, he worked with something to do with science, and he had been on some sort of mission, going somewhere… He slowly became aware of his surroundings and with a flash the memory of the crash landing came back to him. He started getting up but immediately a pain shot through his right arm, he looked down and saw it bent at an unfamiliar angle, not quite grasping what was wrong with it. After a few seconds of bewildered staring at his arm he slowly started remembering what he should do. He queried his complant for a medical check, it reported back that even though his heart rate was elevated and he had some internal bleeding, nothing was at a critical stage and it instructed him on how to get his arm into a proper position and brace it. Instead of following its instruction, he turned around and started looking for his crew.

“Commander? Månsson? Anyone?” He croaked out between some coughs, his suit had held and he still had enough air on him for another 14 hours. “Is anyone there?” He asked the silence. As he looked through the debris of the shuttle, his complant started throwing up visuals of potential hazards. Luckily the Space Agency had a thing about sending out flammable materials in space so there was no direct danger of the shuttle exploding as its fuel caught on fire since it couldn’t really catch on fire. He caught sight of a suit hanging limb, still buckled in its seat and rushed over there, cradling his arm. The label on the chest said ‘Månsson’. “Johan! Hey! Wake up!” He shouted over the suit’s com radio rather than the complant in case there was any head trauma. “Are you alright?”

“Ugh…” Was the response from Månsson has he woke up.

“What… What happened?” He asked. His eyes had trouble focusing on Kapoor “What’s the…” Was the last thing he said before he slipped into unconsciousness again. Kapoor stood there, unsure of what to do. Was there not a rule about letting people with potential head injuries not go back to sleep again he thought to himself. The complant confirmed it and he shook Månsson’s slack body and shouted “Wake up Johan! I need you up!” But it had no effect. He connected his complant to the others suit hookup and accessed Månsson’s bio readings. Stable heart rhythm, minor lacerations and an unknown head trauma was the result. He didn’t know what to do and as he was standing there trying to decide the next course of action he heard a voice over the radio.

“Anyone else there?” It was the voice of Scott.

“I am here Scott,” he responded into the mic. “Where are you?”

“Kapoor, is that your beautifully accented voice I hear! Thank God! I’m by the tail section, I see you on the near scan, about 30 meters north of you. It looks like I’m pinned down by some debris and I can’t get loose. Would you mind swinging by and helping me out of a tight spot?”

“Good thing you didn’t lose your sense of humor in the crash,” Kapoor responded although he couldn’t help suppressing a smile. They might be marooned on an alien world but at least it was not so bad that Scott stopped kidding around.

“I try, now get over here and help me out.”

“Kapoor! Scott! It’s good to hear your voices!” came the Commanders voice over the radio waves. 

“Commander! Thank the heavens, are you alright?” asked Kapoor. 

“I am. I also found Sara and Viktor, they’re here with me. What’s your status and have you seen any sign of Månsson?” she asked.

“I am alright, I have minor injuries according to my complant and a broken arm that need attending to but I was about to help Scott who is trapped, I will ping you his position. I also found Månsson but he is unconscious, I tried waking him but I dared not use too much force so that it would hurt him. He needs medical attention”. 

“Hang on Scott, we are on our way!” Everyone converged at Scott’s location and saw the massive beam pinning him in place, it was part of the ships framing and was built to be relatively light weight yet extremely durable and right now it was wedged between the ground and the tail section of the ship. It didn’t move an inch to their combined efforts and they quickly gave up and tried to find an alternate way of getting Scott loose.

“I had a plasma torch with me in the engine room, if you find it we could use it to cut out small sections of the beam and it might be enough to get me out of here,” said Scott. 

“I’ll go check,” offered Sara.

“Take Viktor with you as well,” ordered the Commander. “No one goes alone.”

“Take me to Månsson please, Kapoor, I want to see how he’s doing and try to figure out what our next step should be.”

“I think I’ll just hang back here,” said Scott as Kapoor and Ellis left together to find the co-pilot. As they approached Månsson the Commander carefully examined the body and hooked up to the bio readings from the suit. She administered some chemicals through the suits support system as directed by the emergency first aid section of her complant. After a couple of minutes Månsson started to come too.

“Eh… What happened? Did something go wrong with our ship?” He asked as he started to look around, not quite seeing where they were or what lay around them. 

“There has been an incident,” responded Ellis. “What do you remember?”

“We were getting close to Mars, just a few more days left until we would take out the shuttle. I had finished the trajectory calculations to take us in for the final approach and… and then… I can’t quite remember what happened,” he said searching his mind for some answers, the complant yielded no information at all, it seemed to be disconnected from him and he started panicking.
“I’ve temporarily put your complant on lock down,” said Ellis as she read the reaction from her co-pilot. “I suspect a head trauma and didn’t want to add its interference to your regular healing as well as the fact that I didn’t want it to spit out images of what happened before you get a chance to breathe first.” 

“Thank God, I haven’t been plantless since I was a kid and my parents installed the training computer implant, wouldn’t really want to go without one now at all. So… What’s going on?” He said and took another look around him, this time seeing where they were and the state of the shuttle. “Did we crash!?” He yelled. Månsson’s suit gave a small beep as high heart rate increased with quite a few BPM in an instant and Ellis remotely set the suit to keep the chemicals flowing into his body for a little while longer.
“It’s all right, we’re OK. Everything is going to be all right,” was the Commanders response.

“Try to stay calm while we get you out of there. I’m just going to unbuckle this…” she said and pulled the release mechanism and Månsson fell into their arms. “There! Now, how do you feel? Can you walk?”

“Yeah, I think I’m OK, hard to tell without the complant feed.”

“Don’t worry about that right now. I’ll restore it as soon as we’re sure you’re OK. Let’s join the others and I’ll fill you in on the way,” said Ellis while steadying him carefully over her shoulder. “The last thing you remember was several days ago. Since then we launched the shuttle from the main ship and prepared to get down to Mars. On approach we discovered… something… we’re still not quite sure what we found, a large deposit of titanium where there shouldn’t have been one. A short while after that something attacked us.” 

“What! Attacked? Like… Like aliens?”

“No, of course not. Although I see why you would ask, there shouldn’t be anyone or anything out here that could attack us. Yet something did, as we were getting into a stable orbit around Mars a missile approached, we managed to dodge it and then two more appeared. Only… they weren’t aiming for us the second time, they went after Revelation and blew up the ship.

“I… I don’t believe it…” The blood had drained from his Scandinavian features and what was already a pale complexion turned ghostly white as he realized they were stranded on the planet.

“We managed to get down to the planet and I hope they didn’t track us but just in case, I would rather we get out of here as soon as possible and head for the habitat. There, we’ll have shelter and supplies and can think of our next move without being this exposed,” she said with a bitterness to her voice. This wasn’t how she had expected to reach Mars, the first people on another planet, and this was the welcome they’d received.

“But Commander, how do you know that whatever fired upon us do not already know the location of the habitat and that it will be safe? Perhaps we are walking into a trap?” Asked Kapoor.

“I don’t really see that we have that much of a choice. We are working with limited air supply, we can’t eat rations except stims while in these suits and they are not a real substitute for food anyway, they’ll keep us up and active but there is basically no nutrition in them. We have to get away from here and the habitat is our only option. And in the months it took us to get into final approach we haven’t had any indication that the habitat has been disturbed. It’s our best bet.” They reached Scott again who waved to Månsson from his trapped position under the beam.

The station was made for a considerable larger population than us. I think we could stay here for quite a while without running into any issues with basic necessities. And the solar panels still work great so energy isn’t an issue,” replied Einarsdottir.

“I found some interesting information about the colony structure,” added Viktor and turned around to grab the latest folder he had found and accidentally knocked over a few folders. He bent over to pick them up and as he did so Månsson eyes focused on something behind them and sounded surprised.

“Did that ca…” Månsson started saying.

“Did that can of food you found taste like shit or is it something we can eat?” Interrupted Scott in the middle of Månsson’s sentence. He had a slightly worried look on his face. 

“It was alright, I tested it to make sure. I mean, it is not a gourmet meal but I did not think it tasted poorly,” replied Kapoor.

“Great… Great….” said Scott absentmindedly.

“By the way Månsson, could you grab me the device I have in the workshop? I would like to show the others the progress I’ve made.”

“Sure, I’ll be right back,” he said and moved off towards the workshop.

“What exactly did you say you found Viktor?” Asked Scott right away.

“Well… I found some info about…” and he continued explaining more about society that used to live there but Scott opened up another channel over the complant with Ellis, Sara and Kapoor while Viktor was speaking and he had a very urgent tone. Sending over thoughts, without verbalizing the words, took a great deal of concentration as you had to focus hard on the words you wanted to send, otherwise it would arrive as a jumbled up sentence of random thoughts and impressions that you had in your mind. The message Scott was now transmitting to them wordlessly through the complant said “YOU ARE BEING WATCHED. I DIDN’T INCLUDE VIKTOR IN THIS MESSAGE SO THAT HE WOULD CONTINUE TALKING AND NOT GIVE AWAY THE FACT THAT I’M TELLING YOU. AS HE DROPPED THE FOLDER, THE CAMERA BEHIND YOU MOVED TO WATCH HIM. BOTH MÅNSSON AND I SAW IT. HE WAS ABOUT TO ASK ABOUT THE CAMERA BEFORE I INTERRUPTED HIM. IT WAS CLEAR THE CAMERA WAS CONTROLLED BY A HUMAN BASED ON THE MOVEMENT PATTERN. YOU SHOULD GET OUT OF THERE AND HEAD BACK TO THE HABITAT.” Ellis, Sara and Kapoor all froze as they heard his voice in their minds and understood the message. They glanced over at Viktor who was oblivious to the message and continued talking about their history and customs. Scott interrupted again.

“Yeah, yeah, that’s all fascinating but I want to know when you come back here and help me finish up with the communications thing. I’ve hit a block and I need your technical help to solve it,” he said.
“We’re just going to pack up and get going. We’ll probably come back here tomorrow and see whatever supplies we can find,” responded Ellis, going for a voice that sounded as natural as possible but it felt fake to herself. They packed up whatever they could into the Harleen’s storage space and set off towards the habitat again. When they were a couple hundred meter away they informed Viktor what Scott had told them. He was shocked to hear that they could have been watched ever since they came to the station. He suddenly remembered the sound he had heard and told the other about it.

“At the time I didn’t think much of it. It sounded like a small thud with a metallic sound. I thought it was you guys coming back to the control room but no other sounds came. I stepped out into the hallway and listened but didn’t hear anything else so I thought I’d imagined it and walked back into the room. But I guess it could have been someone farther down the hall.” He shuddered as he thought how close he might have been to someone lurking the station, watching their every move.

Chapter 3

As the sun rose over the Martian vista, the mountains in the distance cast long shadows over the empty desert. There was nothing in the area of note. That was why this location was chosen for the habitat. Mars had several category 5 storms, almost as many as Earth as a result of the impact humans had on their home environment, but you didn’t want to be close to a mountain full of small boulders and have then shooting by like bullets during one of those storms. It also made it easier to get the location of the habitat if you were out on the surface without any rock formations blocking the line-of-sight signals back to the station. One by one they all woke up and gathered in the kitchen to share a meal and discuss their next moves. Commander Ellis spoke first when everyone but Månsson was there, most were preparing a bowl of cereal with some dried fruit as their first meal in their new home.

“Let’s start, can someone get Månsson so that we can decide what we are going to do about this unknown enemy,” she said. Viktor pushed his chair back and started off down the corridor back to the dormitories to wake up his friend but when he tried to wake Månsson, he wouldn’t move. As Viktor got increasingly worried when Månsson showed no sign of life, he called for the rest of the crew to get there. After several failed attempts of waking him, they carried him over to the infirmary where he got some general ‘feel good’ drugs and was put into the medical assist unit, a casket sized machine that monitored his vitals and was able to perform a wide variety of medical procedures. Commander Ellis activated Månsson’s complant at that time so that the medunit was able to interface directly with him, after a short while the results of the initial tests appeared on the monitor: The concussion he had suffered yesterday had led to pressure building up in his head and while the machine had taken steps to make sure there would be no residual symptoms, Månsson would be out for a day and his cognitive abilities would be reduced in the coming days.

“Thank the heavens that he’s going to be all right,” exclaimed Sara after reading the status on the medunit’s display. After making sure that the system would alert them to any change in Månsson’s status they went back to the kitchen to resume their discussion, strangely none of them had the appetite they had when they left the kitchen.

“So, what is our next step Commander?” Asked Kapoor.

“We’re missing data,” she responded. “We can’t figure out what to do unless we have first figured out who or what else is on this planet, what their mission is and where they’re operating from. It seems we are safe here for the time being so I think we should go over all the data the station has gathered while we were on route and see if we can learn anything about what else is here.”

They spent the rest of the day inside pouring over whatever data they had available about Mars. None of the logs from any source showed the trace of titanium and neither was there any mention of anything that resembled a launching station for missiles or any other type of artificial structure. Communication with Earth was still cut out as the habitat only had juice enough to send a signal out through the atmosphere to the ship that was supposed to be orbiting the planet which would then relay that transmission to Earth. Scott thought there might be a possibility of hotwiring something together from the parts they took from the shuttles communications array and hooking it up to the habitat but Ellis thought it might be too much of a risk sending a signal out into space that could perhaps be picked up from the planet. Whatever help they could get from Earth would arrive far too late if they got hit by another attack. Nevertheless, she agreed that Scott should make the preparations and try to assemble the setup just in case they got an opportunity to contact the Space Agency again, perhaps they could also just enable the receiver and listen in on any broadcast transmission they could pick up. After a day marked by disappointments and with making no progress on figuring out what the mysterious reason for the attack had been, they met up once again in the kitchen to share their findings. 

“The only thing of note that I found was a small unknown object, perhaps only a meter high according to the Harleen’s logs. She was looking for something else at the time and the object didn’t match the criteria of the search so she just tagged it as unknown and continued on looking for minerals. The reason I bring it up is that it is about half way between us and that titanium deposit that we detected yesterday,” offered Einarsdottir. “Could be nothing or it could be something, no way to tell without getting some more data. We could send Harleen out again to the same spot, but for all we know it could be an outer perimeter and we would just be announcing ourselves. On the other hand, Harleen was out there about four months ago and nothing happened to her then or even since then.” 

“Anyone else found anything?” Asked Ellis.

“Well, I didn’t find anything in the old logs, but yesterday’s log from the stellar observation data proved useful. I can confirm that the missiles did originate from the mountain with the titanium deposit. Since this station is so close the outbound missiles showed up on pretty much all frequencies that we monitor. And after matching the timestamps from our shuttle and the station and calculating our shuttles position based off of these readings, it’s clear as day that whatever fired upon us did so from that mountain.” He put the logs down on the table in case anyone wanted to double check the data but they all sat silently digesting the new information. It was one thing to imagine an enemy somewhere on the planet but now they knew where the shots had come from and it was uncomfortably close when all doubt had been removed.

“Well, at least we know more than we did this morning. We know where the enemy is and that there is something between us and them, it may not be all the information we were looking for but at least we’re making progress,” she tried to sound hopeful and not let the unanswered question in her mind drag her down. If they were going to make it out of this alive it was paramount that they didn’t lose hope. She took a moment to work through the new information silently, they needed to know even more. Someone had to go there, if not to the mountain right away, at least to that object in between. The Harvester had made it, it should be able to make it again. If they read the logs and made all the same moves as it had the last time there shouldn’t be any reason for it to act differently right? She was trying to convince herself as she thought it. But what other options did they have, the moment they arrived at the habitat they had started the clock. They had food and water planned for a four week mission and with the Agencies generous math it was easily enough for eight weeks without rationing, they could probably stretch it out to twelve if they started cutting back right away. But what was twelve weeks on a hostile planet? There was nowhere to run, they hadn’t been planning on running from anything, and there was no way of adding supplies to their stores either. The problem stared back in her mind, how to survive on a planet where nothing out there could sustain them. The only way forward that she saw was getting to that mountain and if there was a station capable of supporting human life, use it until the Agency could send relief. She explained her reasoning to the others and they agreed, the prospect of working slowly forward and trying to piece together what was going on wasn’t so appealing with the threat of starvation in the mix.

“Alright then, since Harleen can carry two people, Sara and I will go. If there is anything out there regarding the deposit, our geologist is the best person to investigate it, and I would rather have Scott here working on the possibility of communicating with Earth if we find it safe enough. Kapoor and Viktor, you should continue sifting through all the data and see what else you can find. I know the other Alliances have sent things here pretty routinely as they investigated the benefits of travelling to Mars, and as we talked about before nothing has seemed to contain military material but could you go through what information we have accessible here and try to piece together what could be used to create those missiles or anything else you find important. Don’t use the radio to contact us unless its life or death, we don’t want to broadcast that we’re here and even though communications through complants boosted by the habitat should be undetectable, we don’t want to chance it. So just sit tight until we get back. Viktor, you’re in command until I get back. Check on Månsson from time to time, will you?”

Chapter 5

“It’s all in this operations log,” Viktor exclaimed. “It’s the last one I could find, dates back 47 years and reads like this ‘February 24th 2045. This is the last word from New Petersburg. The creatures woke again from their hibernation yesterday, this marks the 260th iteration. They wake every three months, like clockwork, and attack. The station has lost too many souls to those demons, they are unlike any creature we have seen before on Earth. Earth Command knows nothing about it as we stopped all communication transmissions to them shortly after we arrived on the station. It became clear to us that they had lost their way and fallen prey to corruption and internal political struggles, it was not the Russia we left. We came here as a beacon of hope, to ensure that Man would find a place among the stars as brothers and sisters. To keep the bond intact between us and Earth would have mean the desecration of our values and so that bond had to be severed. They did not tell the world about us, they meant to prop us up as an example of Russian engineering, Russian ingenuity, Russian spirit… They had hoped to unveil a full, prospering Martian society at the turn of the millennium. And if the Americans arrived here before then, what better humiliation was there to arrive full of pride and prestige only to discover a planet of Russians. But the soviet fell before the year 2000 and shortly after that fall we fell into oblivion since only the high command knew of us and we stopped alerting the world to our presence. We had hoped to live a peaceful life here, hidden away from the rest of Mankind, but these beasts put an end to that. The first sighting of them was five years after we landed. The settlement had just been completed and we were preparing for a life on the red giant until one day, one of our Wayfinders discovered a cave we had not known about. He entered together with his team and found creatures in there, his initial report did not mention much detail beyond the wonder of finding evolved life on Mars, but spoke of something the size of a cat with wings like that of a bat. They were highly aggressive and he had not spent more than a minute in the cave before they woke from their hibernation and killed him on the spot. The others started to flee but in doing so they sealed our fate as the creatures hunted them over the terrain and were finally led back to the station. They have haunted our life since then, they arrive every three months to attack and harass us, and we suspect the timing has something to do with their mating season. They seem to have the ability to burrow through the mountain rock and we have tried to coat our station with a layer of titanium in a desperate effort to keep them out yet they always seem to find their way in. Today, another child was taken, we do not know where and it is for that reason that we are enacting our last defensive option. Our old leaders of Earth prepared us for what they thought would be the next theatre of the war, space. We have enough arsenal here to blow away a small fleet of ships, much less these creations. I have enabled the defensive subroutines of the computer and set it to target any life forms it can find outside this station and hopefully we will take these abominations out. If that fails and they continue to attack I have ordered everyone that we will execute Operation Zvyozdochka immediately. If you are reading this then we have left this station and I pray that evil is not here to haunt you. If it is, get out while you still can. Fare well fellow space traveler, know that, even if we did not come as a united mankind all were welcome to the fruits of our labor. – Major Laza.” The silence that followed was profound.

What does ‘Operation Zvyozdochka’ mean Viktor, do you know?” Asked Kapoor.

“It means Operation Little Star,” replied Viktor thoughtfully. “But I have no idea what it could mean beyond that. I’m pulling up the defensive subroutines that he mentioned as well… Ah… I understand,” he said to no one in particular.

“What is it?” Asked Ellis.

“The subroutines he talks about were developed during a time with increasingly stressful relations between the West and Russia. It appears that when he targeted any life forms outside of this mountain he simply set the target but let the computer decide the type of attack. And during that time they were worried about an attack from the west, even up here, so they set up the computer to first attack the target and then to try to isolate them by attacking any nearby structures that were not identified as USSR structures, basic ‘shoot the target and anything around it’ strategy. So it locked on to us, being life forms, and then when it had fired on us, scanned our vicinity and found the Revelation. Since the station was not transmitting a USSR signature it was swiftly tagged as hostile and the other missiles were shot with our ship as target. As our shuttle lost power shortly after, it couldn’t lock onto us again since we were too far out of range when we regained power. The reason it hasn’t attacked us while we were in the habitat or on our way here is that we’re outside of this three month window he mentioned which ended the day it attacked us.” 

“So it could have blown us away in the habitat if we arrived a day earlier?” Asked Kapoor nervously.

“Yes, in a sense we were lucky… Even if I don’t feel particularly lucky these days,” responded Viktor.

“So it seems the habitat is safe for another few months,” said Ellis. “I think this answers the question if it’s safe enough to contact the habitat as well. Whoever was here at the station had no idea that we would arrive and it looks like they were not intent on hostile action towards humans anyway. Kapoor, can you see if you can manage to contact the habitat using this old equipment. Fantastic work Viktor, finding all that out, could you try to see what that ‘Operation Little Star’ was, if there is any more mentions of it or what happened to everyone else? I’ll continue reading through the logs and learning more about the station while you two do that.”

She walked around Major Laza’s desk to see what else the old Commander had to offer. There was an old picture on the desk of what was presumably the Major in his Russian uniform together with a woman and a small boy. She wondered briefly if he had left them behind on Earth or if they had joined him on the station and imagined his despair at either option, having to leave your loved ones behind or have them next to you during a nightmarish existence where people were killed every few months. She did not envy the Majors position then and were thankful that she had no ties back home, her crew was her family and she was 100% focused on making sure they made it out of there alive. As she rifled through the stacks of paper on the Majors desk she found several things of note, a more detailed description of these ‘demons’ that had haunted the station. They seemed to be four-legged creatures of anywhere between 30 and 60 centimeters length. They appeared to have small wings that were still capable of flight in the reduced gravity of Mars, their front legs were almost hand like and their ‘fingers’ ended in sharp talons. The face most closely resembled a bird except for the fact that it didn’t have a separate beak under its’ small beady eyes, but an elongated jaw that ended in a mouth that opened sideways to reveal a full set of teeth. The entire creature was covered in some sort of scale that made its hide extremely durable and hard to pierce, regular gun fire had little effect on the creatures and the colony had apparently reverted back to using axes and other large tools as weapons against them. Attached to the biological description was also a calendar where he had marked out when the creatures were active, they followed the three months schedule almost exactly and they would appear next time in 89 days according to the calendar. So when it came to priorities, this was their next biggest problem as they would run out of food slightly after the estimated attack date. She saw that Laza had written some notes in the margins of the document. It looked like he suspected these creatures were some form of biological experiment done on Earth and that someone had brought them to Mars without his knowledge, apparently there were only rumors but it seemed like the Major was sure of it. Kapoor interrupted her musings with a triumphant “Ta-da,” as he smiled at the others. “I have gotten the local communications equipment back online. It looks like they destroyed the array that could communicate with Earth but left the one they used for local communications intact. And thankfully they started out with a nuclear reactor as a base power source but has since improved on the solar panels so the station’s batteries are fully charged, we could have the whole station up and running in a couple of days if we wanted to.”

“Let’s wait on that until we know that we are the only ones on the station,” replied Ellis. “Can you patch me through to the habitat please?”

“Of course, one moment and we should be connected. I’ll reach them on the vid channel,” he replied and the monitor in front of the Majors desk where Ellis was sitting flashed alive. She could see her own vid pickup in the bottom left of the screen but the rest was static. After a few moments the static was replaced with Scott’s surprised face as he stared into her face on his monitor.

“Commander? Is that you?” He asked into the audio pickup. “Eh… Is this safe?”

“Yes, it’s me. And yes, we believe it’s safe to talk. It looks like we don’t have that much to fear from the Russians,” she said and smiled into the surprised face on screen.",dannedadon

Harleen, being an excellent piece of machinery according to Scott, practically flew over the Martian surface with minimal turbulence to those inside. Scott had explained the importance of keeping the vehicle leveled at all times in case it carried sensitive samples that shouldn’t be knocked around, so they sat and waited out the ride, each thinking about what could possibly wait for them at their destination. They were prepared for a fight, but of course they didn’t carry any weapons with them on Revelation and neither was there anything that could be called a weapon on the habitat, yet they were not completely defenseless. The makeshift defense gear that they brought with them consisted of a few syringes of sedative in case they overpowered someone and wanted to hide them away for a few hours while they lurked around the hostile station, they were hoping that it was as sparingly manned as their own. They also carried two flare guns used as a visual indicator if they were ever to get lost on the surface and the radio equipment failed for some reason. Lastly, Viktor had also found a pipe that wasn’t vital to the habitats function so they pried it away and he had been carrying it like a baseball bat, ready to hit hard and fast. They once again reached the statue and paused for a moment by it so that Viktor and Kapoor could see it for themselves first hand, and then they were off again, quite literally moving closer to Doom. The mood inside Harleen was tense as they continued on and passed another arbitrary line in the tracking software of the vehicle, suddenly Viktor let out a chuckle and the other two looked at him with raised eyebrows.
 
“What is it?” Asked Kapoor.

“I was just thinking… How the hell are we going to explain this to Månsson when he wakes up? So… Yeah, we were attacked by a hundred year old colony of what used to be a country long ago and were picked up by a smart car that took us to our temporary home only to find a statue in the desert of those same attackers were they thought they would rule Earth in the future and now we are on our way to confront them armed with some needles, a pipe and a couple of flare guns. It almost sounds like a story from a book or something,” he replied. The others gave a smile and Ellis added “Don’t forget the fact that they’ve been here for hundred years yet haven’t left a single trace after themselves except for that statue, it’s like a conspiracy or something.”

The atmosphere in the vehicle felt slightly better than moments before and they switched over to talking about the plan when they arrived, they’d been over it before but going over it one last time before doing it wouldn’t hurt. They had agreed to arrive from the mountains south side as it provided the most amount of natural cover and hopefully hide Harleen behind one of those huge rocks. Afterwards they would move towards what they thought was the entrance and scout out any openings to the station, hide out for an hour or two to see if there was any action at all there and lastly try to find a way of getting in. As plans went, this one barely deserved the name but they had little choice. They had to get in and they had to take a risk while doing so. The mountain came in to view in front of them and they directed Harleen to ride slightly more eastward so that they would approach from a better angle. When they had finally stopped and disembarked the vehicle they were standing by a huge boulder not far from the foot of the mountain, it stretched quite far to either side as they looked left and right and hoped that they were in the right spot. 

Ellis didn’t quite know what she had thought she’d see. Anything from what looked like completely alien tech to something that could have been part of the habitat. What she saw was neither, it all looked like solid rock here and at first glance they couldn’t find anything that was special about the place. They continued watching what they figured must be the opening but couldn’t see any signs of human construction amidst the red rock. After an hour of waiting they had enough and instead took their chances and walked up what looked like a narrow path in the side of the mountain. They walked for more than an hour, continuously traversing the edge of the mountain higher and higher and still didn’t see anything. They were beginning to question if there was even anything here. Everything looked just like you would expect from a deserted planet and you wouldn’t think this was the site for some big space colony with a hundred years behind it. Just as they were about to give up hope and return to Harleen for some air and to continue the other side of the mountain Kapoor alerted them through the complants.

“I see something,” he said. “Off there in the side of the mountain, something shiny caught the sun and I think I saw something metallic.” They all froze in place as if whatever they saw was watching them but no reaction came. Ellis hugged the side of the mountain with her back, motioned the others back a bit and moved slowly towards the point Kapoor had indicated. She reached the metallic shaped that turned out to be a door into the side of the mountain, but the fact that she found this door wasn’t what surprised her the most, it was the fact that it was ajar. She could tell there was light spilling out from the entrance and carefully edged her way closer. When she reached the door and took a quick peek inside she saw nothing except the inner door of the airlock, she waved the other to join her and they came slowly towards her. After a short deliberation they decided that Ellis and Viktor would go in, just in case there was a fight, since Kapoor’s arm was still in healing. Viktor closed the outer hatch behind him, knowing that this might be the last time he would see Kapoor alive if anything happened to them. The hatch closed and the seals around it filled even the tiniest gap as the room began to pressurize and fill with air. After what felt like an eternity the sound finally stopped and a light glowed green. They heard a dull mechanical sound as the inner hatch unlocked and they slowly pushed the door open to an empty passage. No alarms bleared out of the speakers and no footsteps were heard running towards them, so they cautiously stepped out into the corridor and looked around. It looked much like what they had seen of old submarines, pipes going everywhere in the ceiling and bulky metallic objects and valves every few feet, it lacked much of the gloss and elegant minimalism their own habitat had but perhaps that was expected for such an old station in the infancy of human space travel. They closed the inner hatch behind them and operated the controls to vent the room and again open the outer door so that Kapoor could join them inside, they felt it better to stick together until they were sure they could use the complants to communicate wirelessly over greater distances. They watched him enter the room through the window in the hatch and then repeated the procedure to air up the section and finally he stepped over the threshold and was inside the station. Again the situation prompted more questions than answers, where was everyone? Why was the door open on the outside? Why hadn’t their entry set off any alarms? They felt like mice wandering around in a maze, expecting the trap to slam shut upon them at any moment. According to their suit sensors the air inside the station was well within normal parameters and they could have taken of their helmets and breathed in regular, ‘fresh’ air. But the Commander decided against it, before she knew more she didn’t dare trust their lives to this station. With slow and cautions steps they continued on deeper into the station. Everything looked the same where ever they looked, a dark metallic passage filled with utilitarian elements and cryptic numbers at the top of each door frame. Ellis guessed that it was some sort of identification for which section they were in but without any other reference the numbers meant little to her. As they passed room after room and didn’t see anyone they grew bolder but it also instilled more fear in them.

“What the hell is going on here…” whispered Kapoor out into the silence as they progressed deeper into the station. Finally they entered a passage that didn’t quite look so inhospitable, the walls were cleaner and the only things attached to the ceiling were lights instead of the usual pipes that they had previously seen. It also had three signs over the three different doors that they stood in front of. The signs were in Russian but the complants had no problems translating it and replacing the text with Latin letters in their minds so that they perceived everything to be in English. The doors had the signs ‘Administration’, ‘Population Services’ and ‘Security’. They looked at each other and Ellis pointed towards the door marked with ‘Security’, the others nodded and followed her as she pushed the door open. They were in a different kind of passage now with what looked like security cameras every few meters, there were still some doors along the passage but when they peaked in they saw only dormitories and smaller offices. At the end of the passage they finally reached what they were looking for. The sign ‘Main Control Room’ illuminated the passage and they pushed at the door, again surprised that it swung open without any protests about security credentials or proper clearance. They entered a room about ten by ten meters in area, filled with monitors all around the walls as well as stations spread throughout the room with chairs in front of them. The general level of technology was far behind their own and they had some trouble understanding what all the equipment did. In the right corner there was a small office setup with a desk, a seat and folder upon folder filled with paper. ",dannedadon

“No, get Sara and I will explain. How’s Månsson by the way?”

“One sec and I’ll tell her to come.” His expression blanked as he accessed his complant and sent the message through it to Sara who was in the other end of the habitat. “There, she’s on her way. Månsson is doing better. He is up and about but is a bit slow. We haven’t told him all that happened and he isn’t sharp enough to ask a lot of questions yet. According to the medunit it’s going to be another couple of days until he regains full cognitive abilities. I didn’t let him know that you’re calling, by the way.” 

“Good, I think this would be too much for him anyway,” she said as Sara arrived. She quickly explained what they had learned about this station and its inhabitants, and Scott and Sara listened fascinated to what seemed almost like a story tale. “So now we’re looking through the station and trying to figure out where everyone is and what happened to them. We don’t know if the creatures they mentioned are still around since the last log entry was over 40 years ago but we can’t chance it. Worst case, they show up in about 90 days and we’d better be out of here. We’re going to stick around a little longer and see if we can find anything else of note before we head back. We will be back late, I’ll get Kapoor to hook up the station with our complants and then we should be able to communicate regularly through complant as if we were in the same room. The tech here is a bit old but it should be doable I hope. Can you try to reach Earth on your homemade radio Scott? And patch it through here as well if you do get a connection,” she finished and waved goodbye to the others. “Keep an eye on Månsson for me please,” she added just as the connection closed. Having a member of your crew injured was always a heavy burden on a commander and now it weighed her down but the prospect that he was getting better made it easier to bear. But things were looking up for them, they were no longer fugitives running away from an unknown enemy but rather fellow explorers, even if the other explorer were nowhere to be found. And if they did find another one from the Russian population they would greet them with open arms, especially since they were trespassing and would probably be outnumbered a hundred to one if the size of this station was any indication.

They spent the rest of the evening going through the papers and computers and learned a great deal about the population that used to roam these halls. They had left Earth during a time where great technological advancements were common but having separated from the world, they didn’t ride that wave along with Earth so in all but one respect this tech was significantly less advanced. The only area where these Martians had surpassed Earth was in Space Technology. Since Earth had made a relatively small investment into its space agencies since the dawn of space travel there wasn’t much to compete against. This station had dedicated its entire population to advancing themselves in that regard, they had developed better and more accurate ways of detecting astronomical events, the space suits that hung by the exits where lighter, better quality and more durable than the ones the crew of the Revelation had worn. The oxygen tanks they found could hold many times more oxygen than their own as well, so they quickly discarded their old equipment and replaced it with what they called ‘Martian technology’. 

As they were about to leave their complants pinged with an update from Sara back at the habitat. 

“There is a storm coming, perhaps you could come back before it hits you but I wouldn’t recommend it. We’re safe here, the habitat is strong enough to withstand a much stronger storm but I wouldn’t chance it in Harleen.” She wired the data about the storm to them and they saw that it would hit them just as they were halfway back and continue on for many hours.

“Thanks Sara. It looks like we’re spending the night here,” replied the Commander. “Kapoor, can you check the dormitories here in the Security wing and see if they are in working condition?” She asked.

“Sure, I will take a look,” he said and took off towards the dormitories they passed on their arrival.

“How’s the communication with Earth coming along, Scott?” asked Ellis through her complant.

“Well, there were some problems that I didn’t know about before I tried transmitting. They should be taken care of in the next half hour or so, but the problem is going to be the storm. It’s going to be virtually impossible to transmit through that thunderstorm so I think we’ll just have to wait until you get here tomorrow and make a new attempt,” he replied.

“Alright, tomorrow it is. We’re going to get ready to turn in but if there is anything of importance, don’t hesitate to contact us. Otherwise, see you tomorrow,” she finished and turned to follow Kapoor towards the dormitories. She opened a few doors along the way to see what else was there. It was an eerie feeling walking down, opening doors that weren’t yours, seeing whatever the original habitants had left behind them as they apparently left the station. She saw more pictures of families and small mementos and thought back to her own parents on Earth. She had buried them years ago and carried nothing of them but the memories they had left her. She wondered briefly how they would have reacted if they were alive today, listening in as their daughter yelled that the missile had missed them and shortly after gone silent. Three days they had been on the planet now, without any word to Earth. It would have driven any parent mad with worry, perhaps it was better that they were resting safely below the ground. She finally joined Kapoor in the nicest looking room he had found as he was moving away the remnants of the people who had lived there before. The room was not completely cleared out and she bent down to pick up something that hit her foot as she approached the bed she thought looked most comfortable. It was a wooden figure, painted to look like a woman wearing old traditional clothes. It had a vertical split along the mid-section and it gave way to a small nudge. Inside it was another identical but slightly smaller wooden doll. She thought she had seen these being sold in the street markets when she had visited Russia. She opened the next one and found another identical doll and wondered how many there could be. The next one she opened answered that question. It was empty but for a small piece of paper with Russian text written in the handwriting of a child. It read “My friends: Sasha, Tanya, Toma, Nastasia, Vasily.”

Three of the names were crossed out and she wondered why that was until she saw the small drawing next to each of the crossed out names. It was a small bird and she knew instantly that it wasn’t a bird, these children would have never seen a bird in real life. The only animal they would have known was a small, winged monster that took people and, sometimes, children… She said a short prayer for Sasha, Toma and Nastasia and put the doll away in the part of the room that Kapoor had designated as the throw-away corner.

“We’ll have to sleep in shifts, even though the station appears to be deserted, I don’t want to take any chances. I’m feeling pretty rested so I can take the first shift. I’ll wake you Viktor in three hours and you take the second and Kapoor will take the last. If there is anything, ping us on the complants, don’t raise an alarm. Hopefully we are undetected on this station and I would like to remain so for as long as possible,” said Ellis.

“Yes, Commander. I think that’s a good idea,” added Viktor. “I haven’t been able to find anything about ‘Operation Little Star’. There is no mention of it anywhere and I can’t tell if the original settlers are still here, deep down in the station, if they left for another station or left to go back to Earth.”

“Well, we have some time to figure out what this mystery means tomorrow. We’ll try to reach command back on Earth and see if we can’t clear up some of these points tomorrow. Even with the communications lag we will be able to send a few messages back and forth,” she replied.

“Kapoor and Viktor each chose a bed and stretched down, as they were laying there, going over the day in their minds, they couldn’t help but feel more optimistic about the mission. Not long ago they had ‘invaded’ this station ready to face whoever lived here and now they seemed to be masters of it. If all went well they would contact Earth tomorrow and a real rescue plan would begin to take shape. As they fell into a slumber after that taxing day, Ellis stood watch by the door. She had decided to turn off all lights so she would be ready in case anything appeared in the hallways outside, she had boosted the complant to the limit so that it would enhance her regular night time vision and she saw a ghostly overlay of the walls over her normal vision as she scanned the hallway back and forth. She was so intent on watching the corridor that she missed the security camera in the corner that moved silently and watched her take her seat opposite the door to the room. 

The observer at the other end of the feed could not believe his eyes even though he had been following them on screen for the past hours. He hadn’t seen another human for over forty years and now there were three of them, walking around in the control room like nothing had happened. He wasn’t quite sure what his next step should be, he wanted to contact them, but that could prove to be deadly if he had misjudged them, perhaps safer to kill them now… He decided to continue watching and make up his mind tomorrow, if he could…

[PI] We finally get men on Mars and they discover an old Soviet flag placed down decades ago. The Soviets won the space race but for whatever horrifying reason didn't say anything.,dannedadon,"“Good news everybody! I have finished the communications array and we should have the possibility of contacting Earth through this thing. It’s lacking the power and transmitting equipment we had onboard the Revelation so there is no guarantee that they’ll pick it up as we can’t broadcast on the regular frequencies. But hopefully someone on Earth is listening in and we could send a message if we wanted to. Although the time for us to get a response is roughly 30 to 40 minutes IF something is listening and IF they send it to the Agency immediately and IF the Agency sends it through proper channels and they respond right away… I would guess the actual time it will take for us to get a response is something like three to four hours. So I don’t recommend using it unless we know that the Russians won’t attack as soon as we send out the distress call,” he finished and sat down with a grimace as he struck his leg on the small table where all the data they had gathered was lying in orderly little heaps.


They spent the rest of the evening going through old historical documents that were loaded into the habitats database about Earth history and particularly the 20th century. Not a single mention of the USSR’s achievement was to be found anywhere when it came to Mars, there were entire chapters dedicated to the race to put a man in space as well as a man on the Moon and even though there were boasts about who would reach Mars first, there was nothing of substance there. They settled into the evening meal with a mixed reaction to the day’s event, while they had learned some things, it almost seemed to present a deeper mystery about what was going on here. Each answer led to a new question which, in turn, led to ten more questions. After an evening of discussion they agreed to send out a small expedition tomorrow to Mount Doom and learn what they could about the Soviets. Månsson would come to tomorrow and Scott had to stay and make sure there were no unforeseen problems with the habitat, Einarsdottir didn’t feel up for another trip either so that left Ellis, Viktor and Kapoor as ‘volunteers’. If they squeezed in, Harleen could support the three of them, but the air supply would be limited. Yet they felt that whatever they would face would be better with three people rather than two, and they made final preparations for leaving in the morning.

They gave him the sedatives and stayed by him as he fell asleep again. They thought it best to keep him sedated until the others arrived and he was still sleeping right now. The conversation turned to what they would do next, both Einarsdottir and Scott were excited to visit the station now that it seemed safe. But with Scott’s limited range of motion and the fact that they needed someone to stay with Månsson it seemed he would have to wait before going there. They spent the rest of the evening going through the documents they had brought back and talking about the possibilities that could be buried in that titanium plated mountain.

The next morning Ellis woke earlier than the rest and got up from her bunk. “Three months of rest before all hell breaks loose,” she thought. “What can we do in three months that they couldn’t have done during the years they were here?” She wondered. And then the answer came to her, technology. They were the best and the brightest, the strongest team that the Agency could find to send out into space and face the unknown. If there was a way to beat these monster, she and her crew would find it. After all, they had somehow survived their initial attack and crash and improved on their situation many times already. They had even found, what looked like, an abandoned station they could use while they were cast away. After a short stop at the rest room she went back to her bunk and tried falling back asleep. An hour later when the first of her crew woke up she realized she wouldn’t sleep again today and got up. She and Viktor were the first ones up and they got some breakfast together while waiting for the others to wake. He was anxious to get back to the station and continue looking through the documents there about the people. He could admit, to himself, that he felt connected to the people that had been there. The same origins but born in different times. He wondered if he would have volunteered for this Utopia that the original settlers were hoping to create if he had been born in the previous millennia. The rest of the crew finally joined them and they sat down for breakfast while Ellis went over to Månsson to check on him. He had always slept lightly and woke as the Commanders soft socks made just enough sound to get him up.

“Morning, Commander,” he said, apparently all fine.

“You’re up! Fantastic,” said Ellis and hugged him gently.

“Welcome back to the land of the living,” she added with a smile.

“Thanks, it feels like I’ve been dead so I guess that’s appropriate. So… What’s going on? I do have some memories and they make no sense so I’m guessing that most of what it was dreams. I see we’re in the habitat already.”

“Yes, we are,” she replied and went over all that had happened since they were on the Revelation, viewing Mars as a distant object in space. After she finished, Månsson had a look of amazement on his face. She couldn’t blame him, this all sounded so farfetched as she described it.

“How did they have the technology to come here decades before anyone else?” Asked Månsson.

“We don’t know, apparently this was done in secret and even though it must have been a massive enterprise getting a colony to Mars, there is no mentioned of how they achieved it. We searched our own data banks for answers but Russia added very little documentation from before the fall of the Soviet Union. No mention of any mission to Mars, manned or unmanned, can be found in those documents,” she said.

“I’d really like to see it,” he added and tried to get out of bed but quickly caught his head with his hand as the pain came back.

“Of course, but when you’re back in working order,” she said. “Scott is staying here and working on trying to communicate with Earth. I think it’s best if you stay here and try to help him since he broke his leg and needs the support. I also don’t like the idea of anyone going anywhere alone until we know more information so leaving him here by himself is a no go. The rest of us are going back there to look for more info and hopefully a way of getting off this planet. There will be plenty of time for you to see the station, don’t worry,” she added with a smile and patted him lightly on the leg.

“Whatever you say, Commander,” he replied and lay back down in bed. “I’ll just take a little nap now and get up in a while,” he said as he was becoming more and more sleepy, according to the medunit that was a good sign.

They were finally on their way again. This time, four of them were stuffed into Harleen. Three had been cramped but four made them feel like packed sardines in a tin can. They tried shifting around a bit to find the most comfortable positions and finally settled in with Sara and Kapoor sitting in the laps of Ellis and Viktor. Thankfully their seven year trek towards Mars in very confined quarters had shed them of their modesty towards each other. As they neared the mountain, Sara looked out the windows and tried to see the entrance and imagined where the others had gone in. When the vehicle finally came to a halt they stepped out and began walking along the side of the mountain again. The mood automatically became tense again as they were making their way to unknown ground again. Ellis was worried that they had been lucky last time and that things would somehow get worse this time. As they rounded another cliff corner they saw the open door to the airlock again. All of them got in together and it began the airing up the small chamber. This time they moved with more purpose back to the control room and used that as a base of operations. Viktor wanted to stay there and go through more of the files in the computers, he was hoping to learn more about the people that had been there before. Sara opted to join him since she hadn’t spent any time in there yet and were happy to look through the computers and learn more about the station herself. That left Kapoor and Ellis to go out and explore the station. They were mainly looking for food but any information would also be a good find in their search. They hadn’t found a map of the station yet in the control room but made their way through the door marked ‘Population Services’ and hoped to find signs leading them to the kitchen areas. They weren’t too scared of finding nothing since a population the size of this station would have to have store rooms to store long term food. Navigating the station proved to be difficult without a map, luckily they were never really lost due to their complants always tracking their location. They had discovered that they couldn’t communicate with the others in the station due to the complants limited range and there was no way of hooking it up wirelessly with the old tech there. So they were cut off from Viktor and Sara in the control room as they progressed deeper and deeper through the station. Half an hour into their search, they found a room labelled ‘Observation Deck’ and after Kapoor’s nods towards the room Ellis agrees and they open the door. The room did not look like any kind of observation room. It was shaped like a sphere with a small metal cylinder in the middle. Around the cylinder there were seats that continued on in rows towards the walls of the room. They wondered what the Martians observed in here. They moved toward the object in the center and Kapoor gently reached out and touched the cylinder. As his fingers touched the metal surface the whole room seemed to explode in light, he quickly pulled back his hand and the room was plunged in darkness. They looked at each other and Kapoor once more, carefully, reached out his hand. This time they were ready for the light as thousands of bright, small dots appeared all around in the room. It was beautiful, like a hologram but many times more bright and lifelike. It was like standing in a miniature galaxy and watching the stars revolving around yourself. Their own hologram tech was more utilitarian, a blueish tinted shaped that conveyed shape and size but lacked any sort of realism. This, however, was something completely different and they marveled at what they saw. Kapoor noticed the controls attached to the cylinder and began changing the knobs and dials on it and saw the galaxy around them shrink and grow in size with the movements of his hands. He managed to zoom in on their own star, Sol, and zoom in until they could see Earth and Mars clearly visible. 

“What an observation deck!” Said Kapoor out into the room. “It is like they have progressed far beyond us in some ways.”

“They must have, Mars is not really a planet like our own. To survive here you have to adapt and evolve and it looks like they have done just that,” she replied and looked out into the room with wonder in her eyes as they reflected the star field around them. They spent another ten minutes just exploring the galaxy through the room and finally forced themselves to move on and wondered what else lay in store for them. They passed door after door with those same numeric markings they had seen before and guessed it to be kind of like street addresses and left those alone. There would be plenty of time to go through peoples sleeping quarters to find hints about the former inhabitants but right now they were looking for other things. They continued down different corridors, thankful that the complants were leaving a digital footprint behind them so that they could easily find their way home. One corridor ended with two large doors and they pushed them open hoping that they would find the mess hall. ",dannedadon
[PI] We finally get men on Mars and they discover an old Soviet flag placed down decades ago. The Soviets won the space race but for whatever horrifying reason didn't say anything.,dannedadon,"“That’s definitely not anything natural,” said Sara. It’s not moving randomly at all, there is definitely a pattern there. It seems to move, stop for a little while, move in a semi random direction and stop again. No idea what it’s doing though…” 
“We’ll just stay where we are, it’s almost past us,” said Ellis. “Whatever that thing is, we didn’t send it out there so we stay hidden.” Scott exclaimed as she said that and started rummaging around in his backpack, he found what he was looking for and removed a small set of enhanced binoculars from his pack and put it on his face. After a few seconds of intense staring and adjusting the knobs and dials on the side, he started getting on his feet despite his injury and proceeded to scream at the top of his voice before anyone could react.

“Over here! Come over here! We are the Revelation crew!” He yelled as the others started dragging him down and shutting him up.
“What are you nuts!?” Said Ellis through clenched teeth. “It will find us in seconds if you do that!”

“Get off me! Try to get its attention, yell for it to come here and tell it who we are! That’s our harvester! Hurry before it moves away out of range, trust me,” he pleaded as the others let go of him. Only the fact that the Commander had known him for almost ten years now and seven of those had been in very close proximity would have earned him the trust to go against her every instinct. But she did trust him and got up and started repeating what Scott had said in her loudest voice. A few seconds after she started the object stopped again, but this time didn’t move in a random direction but instead moved towards them, stopped and then took off again at full speed towards them. As it was speeding towards the foot of the canyon they asked Scott what was going on.

“It clicked when you said ‘whatever it is, we didn’t sent it’ and I realized that it could be our harvester and after I doubled checked through the binoculars I knew,” he said with a smile as if he had just saved the day.

“What is our harvester?” Asked Kapoor.

“It’s a prototype that I worked on before the departure from Earth. It wasn’t fully mission ready when it left but I convinced the Agency to send her along with the habitat and our gear and told them that I would work on her and that it was paramount to our mission,” he sounded like a proud father when he spoke of ‘her’.

“Great, so what actually is it?” Asked Sara.

“It’s the Harvester, it is a prototype automated vehicle that is sent out for long range missions and sample collection. We can program it to roam the surface in an area we define and look for anything we want, soil samples, rock samples, measure weather phenomena at different altitudes, capture radiation over time in certain locations, what-ever-we-want. I activated her a week ago and set her up to move around the immediate vicinity of the habitat, if she is out here we can’t be far away,” answered Scott.
“Tell it that we are coming down and it should stay where it is. I worked quite a lot of the natural language processing so we could change its mission parameters easily over the radio without having to write an essay in code format.” They started the descent towards the harvester, it went easier than they had feared but it was still hard work, especially with Scott’s leg out of action since they had to have someone in front and behind to stabilize him as well as someone under his shoulder to keep him upright. They arrived extremely tired at the foot of the canyon with sweaty suits and fogged up helmet visors and were greeted by a three meter long vehicle with two long and thin robotic arms coming off either side and a large crane on the roof.

“This is the Harvester,” said Scott proudly as he pointed with his arm towards the machine. “So state of the art that she doesn’t officially exist yet. She comes preloaded with any kind of sensor you can imagine, delicate enough arms to take any sample you people could take, the cleverest OS I’ve ever written, and best of all, comfortable seating for two,” he said and pushed a button on the outside panel to which the machine reacted by opening a door on either side of it. Kapoor laughed and patted Scott on the back just a little too hard in his excitement and Scott winced. 

“I guess Kapoor is out from calling ‘Shotgun’. I figured two of us can get to the station in less than 15 minutes in Harleen since she should stick fairly close to the hab perimeter.” 

“You call her… Harleen?” Asked Sara.

“It has a nicer ring to it than Harvester but I couldn’t put that in the design specs, could I?” He replied.

“You just saved the day, Michael,” said Ellis as she moved around ‘Harleen’ to the other side. “Is this the habitat?” She asked and pointed to one of the monitors inside the vehicle that seemed to have a map of the area on display and a dot with the label “H1-North Station”.

“Yeah that’s our home alright. And according to this we are right next to it,” replied Scott.

“Then I suggest we do the following. Myself and Viktor will go to the habitat and make sure it’s clear, we will wait 20 minutes with the… uh… with Harleen parked outside as if it’s just the two of us and see if anything happens. If nothing has happened in that interval we’ll send her back for the rest of you. After two hours, everyone should be here and the air supply is good for at least three but this way we can make sure that we aren’t arriving all together to a… less than desirable welcome,” she finished as she realized she didn’t know what she feared was waiting for them there. The others agreed and Ellis and Viktor both stepped onto the footholds and descended into their seats on board ‘Harleen’ and took off after a short goodbye. The ride seemed a bit surreal after the effort of the last few hours and they rode in silence as both watched the blinking dot of the habitat come ever closer. When they were almost there Ellis broke the silence.

“When we arrive, don’t open your door. Let me get out and get to the habitat. I have the codes to bring up the system to full readiness and if something is out there it’s better if they just get me. You can get back to the others and warn them. Maybe you can extract some of the oxygen from Harleen’s supply into your tanks and make for the station that fired on us, if it’s automated maybe you can get it and call for help,” she said, painfully aware of all the maybes in what could be her final order.

“Alright Commander, I’ll stay but I think you should know that I’d rather go myself. In case anything happens it’s better for the others if you are still there with them,” he replied.

“Captains privilege,” she said and opened the door and stepped out once more on the Martian soil, her mind flashed briefly to earlier the same day where she had imagined opening a door much like this and taking a step out much like she just had. That step would have meant so much to her and to the human race and instead the day had gone into a completely different direction. She walked calmly towards the habitat, trying not to be obvious when scouting out the terrain around it. Thankfully the Martian environment was equally empty, there wasn’t much to hide behind and whatever direction she looked, she couldn’t see anything that felt out of place. She finally reached the airlock and let her complant reach out to the habitat system, like digital tentacles stretching out in her mind, she could feel the station respond to her thoughts and she pushed the lever needed to open the outer lock. According to the system feed she had access to thanks to the Agencies subroutines both in her complant and the habitat she saw that it had sat there, undisturbed since the deployment vessel arrived on Mars. All systems reported in that they were functioning correctly and the O2 and H2O reserves were full as the system had been set up to prepare for their arrival. She closed the outer hatch and let the decompression and air up of the tube finish and finally opened the inner hatch and set foot in their new home. Everything was as she expected it but she took a short tour of the place just to make sure. She was now fully integrated in the network and used the local communications array to talk to Viktor inside Harleen. 

“Hey Viktor,” she said in her mind and the mental greeting was translated to ones and zeroes and reached Viktor where he was sitting.

“Commander!” He was a bit surprised to hear her voice as normal complant range was between 5-10 meters since hooking up a more powerful booster had shown to have some negative side effects on a person’s brain activity. Thankfully, using proper com equipment didn’t have the same side effects.

“Everything seems to be as it should be here. I’ve walked around and checked the insides and the system and they’re all up and running. I think it’s as safe as it is going to get here. You might as well send the vehicle back for the next two and join me in here,” she said once more in her mind. Viktor stepped out and took the short trip to the airlock after sending Harleen back to the others. They watched the vehicle speed away from them on the outer perimeter cameras and kept watch from inside the communications room as the small dot moved away from the station. The next pair arrived shortly after and finally when Sara and Månsson joined the others at the habitat they group was once again whole, even if the individuals in it weren’t quite as whole. They were all exhausted after the day’s affairs and went off towards the dormitories where they peeled of their suites and fell into sleep as the weight of the anxiety they had felt since the alarm beeped hours ago fell away.

The Soviets won the space race but for whatever horrifying reason didn't say anything.,dannedadon,"A small name tag was attached to the desk that read “Major Laza” but no further information about the Major was present there and they searched the rest of the room for any clues about what was going on. The room seemed to have been left in a relatively ordered manner, most of the items in the room were stored away properly even though some papers littered the floor.

“Well, this pretty much seals the deal I guess,” said Ellis.

“If the main control room is deserted I can’t imagine there are other areas of the station with a lot of people. It looks like they left a long time ago, judging by the layer of dust in here. I don’t think anyone has been in here in the last few years,” she concluded.

“Someone has to be here, someone who fired on us as we were about to enter the planet’s atmosphere if not someone on this station,” replied Viktor.

“Perhaps something happened and they withdrew deeper into the rocks, remember what Sara said about the Titanium scans? She said there were faint readings from the surface but as she scanned deeper there were much higher concentrations of the substance found. If there is something like a ‘Main Population’ as the sign implied, they have to be living somewhere and perhaps they do not come up here anymore for whatever reason,” Kapoor theorized.

“Perhaps, right now we don’t know much. My suit is reading the oxygen supply at 63%, if we are going to stick around here we might as well take off our helmet and breathe in the air. If the air has been circulating here for a hundred years I doubt we are in much danger of running out today,” she said and opened the clasps that held her helmet in place and with a last hesitant move she lifted it above her head and placed it on the table next to her. The others did the same and soon they moved around the control room freely without the bulky suits weighing them down. They divided the control room into different sections and began going through the information available in each section, all trying to find the answers to three questions: Where was everyone, who had fired on their ship and did they think it was safe enough to contact the habitat? It was hard work trying to get into the computers the original Martians had left behind since the operating system was completely foreign to them but with the aid of their much more advanced complants they were soon free to move around the system. Viktor had the least trouble navigating the file structure and understanding the references mentioned in the texts they found, perhaps because his birth place, Russia, had joined the Free Alliance not so long ago and he knew the language and folk lore better than the others. Russia had been one of the few countries strong enough to contend with the first, much larger, multi-nation Alliances when the world shifted from countries to pacts and Russia being so strong and independent throughout its history had insisted it would not join. But as time went on it became clearer and clearer that the benefits of joining an Alliance were greater than trying to make it on your own, they had finally joined in the year 2067 and Viktor’s parents had been the last generation to fulfill their new patriotic duty and switch out their country’s flag for Alliance’s colors. But life went on much as before for them and Viktor had grown up learning Russian from his parents instead of the hybrid mix of English and German that were the predominant languages after the German Economic Expanse. He had also been told all the old stories about Russia in its prime from his grandparents and he understood better than the others what this station represented to an empire long forgotten. It was he that finally found the first answer to one of the questions they asked when they started searching the room – who had fired on the ship.

The Martian sunrise colored the sky a pinkish red as the sun slowly rose over the landscape. There was only a small patch of blue around the sun as the atmosphere here made the dawn an inverted mirror reflection of Earths with its blue sky and red streaks around the rising star. As the sun rose higher and higher, Kapoor decided to finally wake the other two and get the day started. While it had been a disappointment not to return to the habitat in the evening yesterday, he could not help wonder what kind of innovations he would find here today. He was still a scientist, and as such he was extremely curious of a civilization advancing, not with, but in parallel alongside the rest of mankind. When the others had risen, used the bathrooms and freshened up, they decided to contact the habitat to make sure everything was OK and to assure Sara, Scott and Månsson that they were still alright. They established the connection to the habitat and waited for the response but nothing came. They tried again and got the same result again.

“Perhaps they are EVA?” Asked Viktor as they failed to receive an answer for the third time.

“They should still receive the signal, the habitat should relay the signal to their complants,” replied Kapoor. Ellis didn’t like this new development one bit. Perhaps it had been foolish to stay the night, to split up the crew for so long. There was so much that could still go wrong. She was just wondering how fast she could get back to the habitat when the light for the incoming transmission turned on and all of their complants pinged in unison with the flashing light.

“Commander! Sorry for not answering the call right away,” replied Scott who looked a bit disheveled. “Månsson woke up this morning and the first thing he remember was the attack. He worked himself into some sort of frenzy as he was sure he had been captured by aliens or something similar. He didn’t recognize us and it took our combined effort, plus some sedatives, to get him back into bed again. We couldn’t answer as we were so focused on getting Månsson back to bed. Couldn’t really do it myself, me being a useless cripple and all,” he finished.

“You gave me quite a scare, in those minutes I thought something awful had happened. But I’m glad you guys are OK and that Månsson is at least active, even if he is worried about alien attacks,” she tried for a light tone but saw the concern in the eyes of Scott who was usually the first to laugh. It had to have been a taxing ordeal, fighting a crew member back to bed and putting them under as they are trying to attack you. “What is the status of the Earth communication setup?” She asked.

“Well, it’s the darndest thing. It’s not working. At first I thought there were some problems that I couldn’t know until we turned the transmitter on,” he responded. “But it looks like there is something else, we can’t really come into contact with Earth at all. It almost looks like something is blocking the signal and we can’t get a good fix,” he finished.

“Blocking the signal?” She repeated. “I don’t think anything here is doing that unless the ones before us had some sort of communications blackout but we didn’t find anything in the logs about that.”

“And the rovers we have sent to the different areas around Mars have not had any issue from the point of their arrival,” added Kapoor.

“What are the odds that our arrival has something to do with this communications blockade?” asked Viktor.

“Can’t know for sure,” replied Scott. “But it does sound like too much of coincidence for my taste. I will see if I can find the source of the disturbance and perhaps counteract it,” he added.

“Is it possible to pick up Earth transmissions on your device?” Asked Ellis.

“Well, it should theoretically be possible but we aren’t picking up anything now, or since I turned on the machine. It is likely that whatever is blocking the signal out is also blocking incoming signals,” he replied.

“That does seem suspicious…” Said Ellis. “It could be that the system that activated the missiles also blocked out the communication, or perhaps someone else did. We can’t be sure we are alone on Mars, or even on this station yet. According to the manifest I found on Laza’s desk it looks like this station was large enough to house 2000 men, women and children. Since we don’t know what happened to those people I don’t want to start walking around like I own the place.”

“Makes sense to me, Commander,” said Sara as she came into view on the vid pickup on the habitat. “Sorry, I sat by Månsson for a little while, wanted to make sure he was alright since we had to force him back to bed. He’s resting quietly now and his brain waves look ok. I think he’s going to be himself tomorrow if the medunit is right.”

“Looks like things are looking up for us, we have two mansions in space and our crew is doing alright,” said Scott.

“Yeah, if we could just figure out the small issue of leaving before those creatures come back and the small matter of food after that we will be all set,” replied Viktor in a sarcastic voice.

“Details…” said Scott with a grin.

“Anyway…” Ellis cut in to the conversation to try and keep them focused. “Since we have another day here I thought we might spend it with trying to figure those things out. We need food and we need to figure out what to do about these ‘demons’ Laza mentioned. You can try to bypass that blockade Scott and we’ll see if the source of it is here and if we can turn it off some way,” she said. “If there is nothing else we’ll get to work and we’ll be back on the habitat before we’re forced to spend another night here.”

“Sounds good, see you soon,” said Sara and cut the connection as she waved bye to the crew on the station.

“I can go down to the store rooms and see what the good people of this station left behind for us,” offered Kapoor.

“I don’t know if we should split up…” replied Ellis. “If something happens we could be too far away. And running down these corridor shaped mazes could be risky if we need to get to you fast. I’d rather we wait until we were at least four people here. That way we can split up but at least go in pairs. I think we should focus on this control room for now, finding out where the others went and seeing if there is anything here that blocks the signal to Earth,” she finished.

“Right, Commander. It feels hard to pass up the opportunity to explore this station. It is almost alien when you think about it, something that evolved in isolation away from the rest of humanity,” replied Kapoor a bit disappointed. “But I do get your point about running around here on my own, perhaps the excitement is not worth getting lost,” he finished.

“We have time, at least three months before we should be somewhere safer. We’ll come back tomorrow or the day after with Sara and explore the area some more as well as look for food,” she said. They continued the task of searching the room for answers. Yesterday’s search had taught them the basics of the computer system used on the station. To them it seemed ancient and slow, but they were used to the instant responses from their complants and having to wait while things loaded was unfamiliar to them. Today they navigated the files and folders with more proficiency but however much they searched, they couldn’t find an answer to what ‘Operation Little Star’ was or where everyone had gone. Neither did they find a way of deactivating the disruption to their communication equipment, if this station was even the cause of it. 

After a few hours of learning more about the people that used to live there but nothing concrete about their whereabouts, they gave up for the day. They carried with them as much as they could and went out through the corridor to the door that led out of Mount Doom. As they stepped out into the bright sunlight they realized how much they had missed it. Even during their ride to Mars in Revelation, they had had windows and an unrivaled view of Sol. Almost two full days of underground research had put them in a more brooding mood. The sun’s rays, touching their faces, melted away the tension they didn’t know they carried from the past days. They hiked back down the mountain and entered Harleen again, it was even more cramped than before with three people plus several hard copies of logs and reports in a car designed for two. Harleen took off towards the station again and her passengers were all glad to watch the landscape pass them by and soon see the others. They arrived a few hours later and emerged from Harleen. As they closed the outer hatch to the airlock, Scott and Einarsdottir stood there and welcomed them through the glass of the inner hatch. Scott was still limping as he came towards them when they opened the door and gave them a hug. 

“Thank God you guys are all right. I was more worried than I cared to admit when you left for the station,” said Scott and let go of Kapoor gently so that his arm wouldn’t hurt. They sat down in the common area to share all the information they had learned on the station. They repeated the log entry from Major Laza again as well as going over the schedule of the monsters attack and confirmed that they had a little less than three months before they had to expect another attack. Viktor explained everything he remembered about Soviet Russia and the Russia that existed before it joined their Alliance. Einarsdottir and Scott went over what had happened with Månsson that morning. Apparently they had found him awake and whispering to himself. When they approached him he shouted “You can’t hold me,” and tried to run past them towards the airlock. Luckily the safety mechanisms wouldn’t open both doors at the same time so he was in no danger of destroying the station or killing himself. But if he did have enough clarity to remember how to operate the air lock, he would have managed to get out and quickly suffocate since the Martian atmosphere wouldn’t have sustained him.

The Soviets won the space race but for whatever horrifying reason didn't say anything.,dannedadon,"“Commander, we found the plasma torch and are coming back. We also salvaged what we could from the shuttle that we can carry with us,” said Einarsdottir’s voice over the radio.

“Great, see you soon,” she responded into the receiver.

“Kapoor, can you scout out the area and get our bearings. If I got us on track, the habitat should be to our North West, stay in constant contact and be careful. Månsson, take a seat and rest for a bit while we try to get Scott out,” she said and watched Kapoor nod and move out from among the wreckage as Månsson took a seat in the most comfortable piece of debris he found. As Sara and Viktor came back they started working with the plasma torch to cut out small pieces from the beam, always moving slowly and making sure it wouldn’t give and crush Scott’s legs in the process of getting him out. After about half an hour of cutting they managed to create an opening that was large enough for him to wiggle his legs. Viktor and Ellis each took hold of an arm and carefully pulled him backwards away from the beam while Sara kept a watchful eye and directed their efforts. Finally he cleared the last of the wreck and was free but one leg was broken and the other was in no condition to hop on. While they evaluated Scott’s condition, Sara helped snap Kapoor arm back into place and brace it with some debris she found on the ground.

“It goes without saying that I’m not a hero and I don’t want you guys to leave me behind, right?” Said Scott with a smile that was just a little too fake and made it clear to Ellis that he had been thinking about it while being trapped.

“Of course you’re coming, who’s going to do all the cleaning at the habitat if we leave you behind. Now, these are our priorities as I see them but let me know if I’m missing something. You listening in, Kapoor?” 

“Yes, Commander.”

“Good, so we are out here in the open with a potential unknown enemy on the planet. We don’t know what set off those missiles, could have been some sort of defense system that the military of one of the other Alliances placed there in preparation for when they would get here or it could be something completely different, point is we don’t know. So I suggest we gather up whatever necessary supplies we find here and then head out to the habitat. There we have enough food, air and shelter to last for weeks while we figure out our next move. If there is an automated military installation perhaps we can get in from the ground in case they thought they would be first here and see what kind of setup they’ve left for us and if we can contact Earth from there.” She tried to exude confidence and a clear goal so that the others wouldn’t stop too much and think of the hopelessness of the situation. “Have you found anything Kapoor?” She asked over the radio.

“Yes, Commander, you were right. We are fairly close to the habitat, I have tracked our position using charts in the computer and without accessing the satellites in orbit, just in case someone was monitoring those, and I have concluded that we are a little less than a day out from the habitat. We should be able to reach it about five hours before our air supply runs out, if we carry supplies with us that time is reduced down to roughly three hours which should still be on the safe side,” he answered the group from his position on top of a nearby hill. “I also think there is a good chance the habitat is undetected, it was built into the side of smaller rock formation to protect it from the strong storms Mars has. It should be fairly hard to detect from scans on ground level and since we haven’t seen any other satellites than our own perhaps that is all they have.”

“Good work Nereev,” said the Commander, it wasn’t often she used Kapoor’s first name but she wanted him to know how much she appreciated his calm acceptance of the situation and his dedication to ‘solving the problem’. They quickly went through the debris once more, choosing carefully what to bring and what to leave behind, painfully aware that perhaps they wouldn’t get another chance to come back here. Most of the gear was deemed non-essential and left behind. Best case, they could come back for it, worst case, they’d all be dead and wouldn’t need it anyway. They grabbed anything that could be used for communication as well as any sensory equipment from the shuttle that was intact. They also packed a couple of extra tanks of oxygen, just in case there was a leak in one of their suit supplies but left the majority of it behind, either they would make it to the habitat and have enough for weeks or they wouldn’t and… well, better not to think about the alternative. They started towards the direction that Kapoor had indicating would get them to the habitat but after only a minute it was clear that Scott couldn’t walk, even if he was being supported by the others and with the help of Mars’ reduced gravity. Sara and Viktor made it back to the wreckage and looked for anything that could be used as a sled, thankfully the extremely light and very durable material that had been such a problem when Scott was pinned now worked to their advantage. They grabbed a piece from the hull that had the closest thing to handles they could find and dragged it on the ground towards the others. Scott got on and they proceeded towards their new home with the few supplies they could carry. It wasn’t an easy journey, all around them was an unfamiliar and harsh landscape. The Martian vista had a hard beauty to it but seeing nothing but red rocks in all direction wasn’t particularly uplifting and their minds kept drifting back to all that had happened earlier in the day. It seemed unreal that they had been attacked, an impossibility in their already impossible mission. Ellis tried to keep up the conversation and get everyone focusing on the tasks at hand, what their next move should be. But in the silences that often punctuated the short conversations her mind also honed in on what had fired those missiles. She lacked data, any sort of information on what could have reached Mars before them. She knew that the other Alliances had their own Space Agencies, the southern hemisphere had their División del Universo that had sent out probes to all the inner planets and possibly automated drones as well. Then there was the Asian Alliance’s Taikonauts that had enough of the capability and man power but they had focused more on Venus and harvesting gas for their business interests, sure they had sent satellites and rovers to all the same planets as the other Alliances but they hadn’t expressed any real interest in Mars as far as she knew. Perhaps it was one of the private entities, one of those mega corporations, like Icarus or Tjin-Zhu that spanned borders and didn’t care about the Alliances that made up Earths government but only cared for profit, but how could they have done that in secret? Space was monitored and whoever tried to sneak by was quickly caught by the others, so who had done the seemingly impossibly? The hours slowly passed as they wandered the Martian landscape, the marvel of being explorers on a new world had quickly passed and been replaced with the fear of being fugitives behind enemy lines. 


A few hours later, as they were nearing a great canyon, they stopped to take a short break and check their bearings again. Here, almost at sundown their initial wonder caught up with them again. They were standing on a small cliff that hung out over the edge of the ravine, from there they had a view out over the landscape ahead of them, the habitat was nowhere in sight but what they did see was a marvelous sight. The hills and valleys of a planet almost completely untouched by man, the blue sky from earth was replaced with a blood red hue as evening came upon them, the rolling green fields of home had been picked clean and all that remained was the dirt and the rocks. Yet it was such a beautiful sight, so alien from what they had known yet somehow familiar as all of them had imagined the moment when they would land and call this planet home, even if it was only for a short while. As they stared out over the landscape silently, all of them deep in thought, Viktor pointed out towards the east.
“Do you see that, is that a storm coming this way?” he said and pointed with a gloved hand towards a dust cloud that seemed to be getting slightly bigger.

“The weather report didn’t mention anything about a storm in this sector,” replied Sara. “I checked the areas around the habitat and we were supposed to get a good couple of days for exploration and sample collection. But I guess you can’t always trust the weather report…” 

“Perhaps it is only my imagination or is that dust cloud getting bigger and bigger?” Asked Kapoor.

“It looks like it’s… getting closer and closer,” replied Sara with some surprise. “It can’t be that localized and moving that rapidly in a straight line. It’s not coming towards us but it looks like it will pass pretty close by.”

“We better get under some cover and out of sight, just in case,” said Ellis. I would hate to getting caught by chance if that isn’t a natural phenomenon and doesn’t know we’re here.” They quickly dragged Scott behind cover and moved all the gear they had scavenged from the shuttle out of sight and waited as the minutes dragged by one by one.",dannedadon
[PI] We finally get men on Mars and they discover an old Soviet flag placed down decades ago. The Soviets won the space race but for whatever horrifying reason didn't say anything.,dannedadon,"The area that they walked onto was pitch black, they got the sense of a very large room as their footsteps took on an echo as they walked forward. They had gone only ten steps when lights blinked slowly in the distance and then flashed fully alight. Another pair of lights also flashed on and another after that and soon they were bathed in light as more and more turned on. They were standing in what looked like some sort of basketball field with bleachers lining the walls on either sides. The field itself had different markings though and they guessed it was some sort of sport that the Russians had invented, none of them were very interested in sports but this looked very alien to them. They continued walking toward the doors on the other sides and hoped the hallway continued there. When they had almost reached the middle they began to feel a curious sensation in their stomachs. As they set foot in the ring, that marked some sort of center of the field, their feet lost their grips and they were suspended in the air. They both had a look of shock as they experienced weightlessness as if someone had flipped a switch. Ellis panicked slightly and started looking around after the source but Kapoor let out a laugh and pointed towards the walls where they had come from. On it there were large pictures of athletes carrying a ball and flying in the air. Many of them were in the middle of, what looked like, spectacular maneuvers as they were flying through the air in complicated offensive moves with defenders around them. Ellis relaxed and tried to mimic one of the moves, but it was harder than it looked, even with her zero-g training. They hadn’t done those types of exercises on the way to Mars. Kapoor picked up a bundle of papers and threw them away in one direction and took off in the opposite direction trying to make a complicated flip. As he moved away from the center he slowly descended towards the floor and ungraciously braced himself with his hands. Ellis did the same and managed to at least pose as one of the posters and touch the ground with feet first and landed.

“Well, that was… something…” said Ellis and smiled. She hadn’t expected that the station would have enough power in circulation to power a device that could do that. “I wonder what other surprises the station has in store for us,” she said and opened another door.

Back in the control room, Viktor was learning more and more about the people that used to live here. By looking through the different logs, broadcasts and documents he found, he slowly built up an image of what kind of population they were. They were ruled by Elders that were chosen among the people. Since they were a small colony, the election went by swiftly because of the few candidates. Who was ruling them, didn’t matter that much in the end since they all knew what was expected of them. They were all born with the knowledge that they had to work to earn their keep. In a station on a foreign planet, air, water and food are things they couldn’t take for granted. The first generation had grown up with all of the hopes and dreams of the communistic state. An equal opportunity land where all shared the wealth and no one is left to starve. They were aiming for a true Utopia. They had heard of the West, with its greedy Capitalistic ways, where a man could own ten houses and still look at the eleventh with lust in his eyes. Such a state of mind was incompatible with their lives as every single resource was finite and carefully distributed among the population. They feared greatly that the Americans would finally reach Mars and consider it their own even though they were equals. They had chosen not to listen in on Earthly broadcasts as they feared the Western culture would influence their children, and themselves, too much so they stayed much as they had been since they arrived. 

“Did you guys notice that the surveillance system is still active on this station?” Asked Sara.

“Hmm…?” Replied Viktor as he was reading through a description of why there were always seven Elders in the colony. “Surveillance system?”

“Yeah, it looks like system is monitoring something but I don’t have proper clearance to get into the system and see what it’s doing,” she said. “It’s amazing that all of these systems are active and it could very well be something left behind by the original inhabitants but it would be nice to make sure,” she added.

“I don’t know, we didn’t find anything about it last time we were here,” he said.

“I’ll see if there is anything in the archives,” said Sara and walked into the adjoining small room that held several file cabinets with hard copies left by the former colony.

“Let me know if you find something,” said Viktor to her disappearing back as she went in there and started looking through cabinets. As Viktor looked down again to continue reading about the Elders, a very soft noise had come from the hallway. So soft that he couldn’t say if it was real or his imagination. Like a bang of metal on metal that was far away. He looked up and was expecting to see hear more sounds, perhaps the sounds of Ellis and Kapoor returning. But nothing else came. He got up from his chair and looked back towards the room where Sara was. He thought about telling her but since he wasn’t quite sure he had actually heard something, he thought that he would just peek out into the hallways and see if he could hear it again. No point in disturbing her if she was finding the key to getting real-time information of all the different areas of the station if it was just his imagination. He stepped out into the hallway and saw nothing in the dark hallway in either direction. After a few seconds of silence he turned around and went back to his documents.

The observer smiled as he saw Viktor turn around and go back into the room from the shadowy vent where he observed the crewmember. It had been risky to approach so close and stupid to not watch where he was going and hit that damned pipe but now he could actually see them with his own eyes and not through a monitor. He had been almost close enough to touch, only a few meters of air and the thin sheet of metal that made up the air vent cover was between them. He hadn’t been so sure, after they left the first time, if it was actually real people or his mind playing tricks on him again. He had imagined seeing his brothers, old friends and most disturbingly, his daughter during his years alone on the station. They didn’t seem like hostiles but there was no way of knowing for sure. He had learned about the Western Threat when growing up on this station from the Elders. He wasn’t about to let down his guard and let them take what was theirs, or what was more accurately now, his. He relaxed slightly and took his finger off the button capable of sending a wireless signal to the explosives he had attached all throughout the station. This wasn’t the day he would die. He slowly crawled back through the vent, this time more carefully, towards his living quarter hidden away in the station. 

“Perhaps we can trust them,” he muttered to himself as he crawled.

“No, no, no! They are Western. They are evil,” he answered himself.

“But what if these are different, they don’t seem to want to control the station, they just want to find their way home,” he added.

“All of them are the product of their society. The moment we show ourselves is the moment they take over.”

“We have the explosives, they wouldn’t dare hurt us or we blow it up.”

“Why wait, the Elders spoke of them often. They are only here to take over the planet and claim everything for America. Let us destroy them while we have the chance, before they learn where the others are. We have to keep them safe.”

“Not all of them are American, they have foreign names and speak of Alliances between countries. The one in there is Russian even!”

“One of the Russians that stayed behind! Remember what they taught us. Old Russia fell to greedy men that sacrificed the people for their own benefit. Can we really trust a child of that state?” 

“I don’t know, but I’m not ready to do anything yet. Let’s go back and continue watching them,” he said out into the vent and crawled onward.

Viktor and Kapoor arrived back to the now familiar hallways two hours later. They were carrying food supplies in a cart they had found in the kitchen and the treasure they carried could not be overstated. They had found a store room with supplies to feed a few hundred for years. Most of it turned out to be some sort of powder that could be mixed with water to produce a sort of porridge that supposedly had all the vitals and nutrients a human needed. And while it certainly didn’t look appealing when they had test made a batch, it filled all their needs and seemed to still be safe to consume according to the safety label. They greeted the others and then radioed back to the habitat to inform Scott of the situation.

“It was something alright, when you guys get over here we will take you to the observation deck and show you the galaxy,” said Kapoor and smiled.

“It’s a date,” replied Scott through the video pickup over at the habitat. This time Månsson was with him and they both joined in the conversation.

“So you found enough food for us to last a while?” Asked Månsson.

[OT] We Are the Mods! Ask us anything!,WritingPromptsRobot,"&gt;1. What brought you here, originally? Before you became a mod or talked to anyone, or whatever, what made you visit /r/WritingPrompts ?  

I stumbled on this subreddit about four years ago and thought to myself, ""Oh! Neat! A place to write stories and maybe get them read by others!""  

&gt; 2. Why did you stay?  

I got addicted to receiving orangered envelopes after posting stories.  Feedback&amp;mdash;good or bad, honestly&amp;mdash;is quite addictive for most writers.  I especially love writing nonsense stories that confuse or irritate people, and orangereds from those people are simply *the best.*  

&gt; 3. (If you write) Do you feel you've grown as a writer, either before or after becoming mods?   

Participating in this subreddit definitely encouraged me to take writing more seriously. I started reading more about the different aspects of writing and storytelling and definitely learned some new things by practicing them in my stories here.  

&gt; 4. Do you feel like this is a permanent ""home"", or just a step on your journey?

This was just a step for me on my journey as a writer.  I'm kinda finished with writing stories on the sub.  However, because I love the subreddit and the community so much, I decided to try my hand at being a mod so that I could continue to be a part of this great place and help it grow, even if I wasn't posting stories much anymore. (Some might say that my decision to stop writing here was more important towards helping the community become a better place...)  

&gt; Fun questions, for any/all mods:  
&gt; 
&gt;1. What's your favorite pizza topping?  

Tomato sauce, because I get it on all of my pizzas.  The other toppings may vary but tomato sauce is forever.  So I guess it's my favorite topping.  

&gt; 2. Which tongue twister can you never get right?  

That one about Peter Piper chucking wood on the sea shore.  

&gt; 3. What's the most inappropriate question you've been asked? Did you answer it?  

Honestly, I have no idea.  

&gt; 4. What meme best describes your life?

[OT] We Are the Mods! Ask us anything!,WritingPromptsRobot,"&gt; 1) Do y'all enjoy being mods? Like, do you guys view it as work, or something you genuinely enjoy doing?  

~~I loathe it~~.  Haha no but seriously, it's a bit of column A, a bit of column B.  I like to see the community growing and people being nice to each other and writing little stories and everyone making friends and whatnot.  I'm willing to put in a bit of my free time to support that.  I genuinely love this place and want it to be the best that it can be.  With that said, there are only so many horrid rule-breaking prompts/comments that I can bear to see so reviewing those things is definitely more on the ""work"" side.

 
&gt; 2) Now for the serious question: If a tree falls and no one is around to hear it, does it still make a sound?  

I'm a lot less concerned about the possible sound of the tree falling, and a lot more concerned about the tree sustaining an injury that won't be covered by the tree's health insurance.  Next thing you know, the tree is sent off to some barely-accredited tree farm, given two percocets a day by a completely indifferent and burnt out day nurse, and left to rot until the timber man comes.
