"[WP] Upon unfreezing time, you realize that everyone was actually still concious, they just couldn't move",dcwj,"""Julia, we gotta talk to you.""

Blinking, the petite woman turned around to be confronted by both of her roommates, Andrew and Debra, standing in her doorway.  She wasn't used to hearing their voices, seeing as how Julia usually just stopped time whenever she got home long enough to go upstairs and slip into in her room.  It took her a moment to find her own voice.

""Uh... if this is about the rent-""

""No, it's not the rent, it's THIS.""  Debra waved a hand at the sparsely decorated room.  Brow furrowing under locks of red hair, Julia tried to follow her train of thought.  

""...you don't like my penguin poster?""

Andrew spoke up quickly.  ""No, no, it's not that, it's just-""

""How does someone who can freeze time not have, like, the freaking Mona Lisa on her wall?!""

Instantly, Julia tensed, and the world's background noise came to a sudden halt.  The unnatural silence always followed the use of her power - no cars driving by, no humming from water running through pipes or the house's air conditioning, no whirring of her desktop computer's fans.  Taking several deep breaths, Julia tried to calm herself.  Debra was just... using a figure of speech or something, right?  She couldn't actually know.  Pacing back and forth for a minute, she decided to play it off lightly, exhaling as she let time resume its normal flow.  

""Um, I was never really a big fan of Da Vinci, so-""

Debra threw her hands up in frustration.  ""This, right here, this is what I mean!  You just stopped time for, like, a minute, and you didn't even use it to come up with a decent response!  You just walked around!  You could've, like, decorated your room, or stuck a flask of vodka in my pocket to make me look drunk, or knocked us both out or something!""  She paused for a moment.  ""Wait, can you say 'stopping time for a minute' if time isn't actually moving forward when you're doing it?""

""Deb, maybe encouraging her to knock us both out isn't the BEST idea?  Besides, some people like to live minimalistically.""  Andrew smiled apologetically at Julia, who was staring wide-eyed at the pair.

""Wait, you two could SEE that just now?  How...""

Andrew nodded, blond hair bouncing.  ""Uh, well, yeah.  I mean, we didn't at first, but I think... we've been overexposed, maybe?  At first, I thought I was just zoning out for a sec, but then I started realizing that it only happened when you were around.  Then Deb mentioned the same thing, and... well, I mean, it was crazy, but we started paying attention to when you got home from work.  For a week or two, it was still pretty hard to tell, because, I mean, you were just coming in the door and going upstairs.  But then-""

""The THUNDERSTORM!  That was SO freaking cool!  And it's like, the ONLY time I've seen you actually smiling!""  

Julia was definitely NOT smiling now - her cheeks were rapidly turning a shade similar to her hair.  ""You two - I thought you guys were just watching the rain through the windows!  You could see that?!""

Andrew rubbed the back of his head, smiling sheepishly at Julia's obvious embarrassment.  ""Yeah... I mean, it WAS amazing.  You pulled in, and all of a sudden, the rain's just hanging there, every drop suspended in midair.  And you using the umbrella to just push all of it away, like... sculpting the storm around you.  That trail of empty space where you walked, that thin wall of water you created by pushing the umbrella off to the side, that big water ball you collected from all the roof runoff...""

""So how come you don't use it for anything ELSE?!""  Debra leapt in, folding her arms across her chest.  ""I mean, you could have anything you wanted, go anywhere, see anything!  Instead, you're here in our tiny house, with a job as a receptionist, with barely anything to your name beyond a closet of basic clothes and a penguin poster.  You don't date, you barely talk to anyone besides us, and your worst enemy is a stuck-up doctor named Brad.  You should be stealing from drug dealers, making off with sports cars and awesome TVs and designer outfits, and making sure Brad never walks into an exam room with pants on!""

Julia sighed, rubbing her forehead slowly.  ""Yeah, of course I've thought about all that stuff, but... I mean, what if it stops working?  Or someone else finds out?  Or something goes wrong?  I mean, obviously, I never figured out how it all works, exactly, since you two are here...""

""Well, while I'm not necessarily suggesting you go out and break ALL laws everywhere..."" Andrew shot a look at Debra, who rolled her eyes.  ""...it's just... well... you do seem to hide from the world.  That thunderstorm may be the only time I've seen you genuinely happy since I've met you.""  Julia turned away from Andrew slightly, feeling exposed in more ways than one.  ""Isn't there anything else you've wanted to DO with this power?""

The question hung in the air for a minute, the uncomfortable silence stretching out as Julia studied the floor.  Debra and Andrew exchanged glances, reassuring themselves that this wasn't another stretch of time stopping, despite the rumble of a passing car from far away underscoring the quiet.

""Well... there might be one thing.""",CosmicMuse
"[WP] Upon unfreezing time, you realize that everyone was actually still concious, they just couldn't move",dcwj,"When you had a job like Jamie, it was important to think out of the box. Situations would often arise where diplomacy failed, and the only way to get information was through more...unconventional methods. Life as a spy was dangerous, but exciting. Sure, stopping time would save you from bullets, but it couldn't save you from a poisoned meal, or an attacker in the night.

People had often wondered how Jamie seemed so well rested. He'd often be asked when it was that he ate, or went to the restroom. But the first time he'd ever learned about a particular quirk of his abilities was on his first assignment with a partner.

""What the fuck was that!?"" Amir exclaimed, traces of his generic middle eastern accent coloring the panic in his voice.

Jamie had a good sense for people, in his line of work you had to, and the abruptness of outburst from the strongly-built Lebanese man was uncharacteristic. Despite only having known him for a day, that much was clear, Amir was not easily rattled. If he was any other man it may have just been nerves, but Jamie had watched him strangle two men the previous evening, at the same time, deftly lifting them both off the floor. He chose his response carefully.

""What's wrong Amir, have I done anything to offend?"" his tone was measured and cool, he brushed his short cut brown hair to the side, keeping his body language open.

""I..saw...you just now..."" Amir stumbled but found the words, ""you spent five minutes eating sandwich next to me...""

Jamie tensed, ""I don't know what you mean.""

""I watched you, just now, eating sandwich. You knock over water and it hang there in space, floating. You scoop up with cup while still in air.""

Now it was Jamie's turn to be confused, ""I can explain, if you'll let me...""

-

After some awkward discussion, hand waving, and explanation they eventually worked out that people nearby Jamie when he stopped time, within a few feet, were still conscious. Amir made it clear that it was very alarming to feel as though you were suffocating, your blood literally frozen in your veins.

Jamie had always used his power away from others, in a safe place, so he could tend to his basic needs without losing any time, but now he had a new idea. He was going to do an interrogation.

-

""I'll never give you...any information, so long...as I draw breath, "" the bearded man tied to the chair spat at Jamie and Amir. His spittle landed just short, darkening the sand at Jamie's feet with saliva and blood. The man's face was bruised, his lips swollen, his breathing ragged.

""Alright, then what if you stop? We're going to play a game I just came up with called Time Roulette, let me show you how it's played,"" Jamie's voice remained even as he pulled out a handgun from a concealed pocket.

He leveled the barrel at the man's arm at the elbow, and pulled the trigger, the striker detonating the gunpowder with a crack. The man's pupils shrunk in terror as the bullet stopped, hanging in the air above his arm inches from the barrel.

Jamie spoke again, ""So, how many times do you think I can stop it before it hits you?""

The man felt a sensation like he couldn't breathe, like all the blood in his body was frozen. His brain told him to scream, but he couldn't move.",ExaltedFireChicken

"[WP] Upon unfreezing time, you realize that everyone was actually still concious, they just couldn't move",dcwj,"Let me tell you a night story so you can go to sleep. 

This is the Town of Suicides upon the Hill Crawlskin, where the old rickety bridge of Old Man Killer connects to the mainland.

Not often do wicks from the mainland cross the bridge, but a group of them had decided to embark on a rather dangerous yet exciting trip. With them they'd taken some rope, a box of strong painkillers and sleeping pills and a knife. 

Now, the wicks were upon the rickety bridge when the Old Man Killer stumbled out of his hut to talk to them.--
""Hello there, little wicks! What are you doing here I wonder?"" He croaked.

""We are on an adventure you see!"" They cried.

""On an adventure? Why you little wicks like to live dangerously don't you!"" He cackled. 

""Ordinary folk do nothing all their lives and stay inside their houses hoping for an opportunity to come by, well not us siree no!"" They shouted.

""Well at least us ordinary folk don't die before we're 16."" He muttered.

""FUCK YOU."" They screeched.

And so the little wicks continued on their path. 

They soon faced the town gates, where all of them were taken by crippling depression, delirium and schizophrenic fits and so one by one they commited suicide. Little Tim overdosed on painkillers, Jackie drunk herself to death, Daniel hung himself and so on.

Tiffany across the street had caught a face full of his semen.

His next door neighbour Tony had seen him snort 100 grams of coke.

His mom had seen him cockslap his stepfather and spit on him several times while screaming profanities.

The President of Cuba had seen him eat 5 bags of cashews while bingewatching all episodes of Scrubs and violently masturbating with... Mountain Dew as lube?

"[WP] Upon unfreezing time, you realize that everyone was actually still concious, they just couldn't move",dcwj,"A part of Jason didn't want to flip the switch again. he knew he couldn't possibly live peacefully with himself from that point.
Not because he couldn't have resisted the temptation to steal that gum pack from the shop, nor because he confessed his love to the girl he had a crush on for years, even though he was positive she loved another.

A moment flashed before Jason's eyes.
He could hear the squeaky sound of the rope as he witnessed the motionless hanging body of Kyle, who he despised most of all.

He knew what society would say: ""Just because he beat you up a few times and stole your lunch money, doesn't mean that he deserves to die.""

His heart was pounding loudly and strongly, and with each breath he felt his regret crawling up his skin until it started strangling his throat. Oddly, that first verbal thought that came to Jason's head was not ""what have I done"", but ""how come I feel that suffocating feeling just now, and not right after I killed Kyle?"". That thought was followed by a single tear.

Jason wasn't really worried about prison. the only witness was Kyle's mother, and who would believe a story of one old mother about a teenager who froze time and killed her son? After all, the evidence points to suicide.

The feeling of regret was short-lived, due to Jason's other inner voice.
""Hmph. Coward. Every time we do this, you whine and whinge like you're a 6 year old. Get ahold of yourself, we've gone though much worse and we've been perfectly fine"".

""That's right"", thought Jason to himself and other self, while smirking.
Jason pulled out an old notebook, opened it up and put a tick sign next to Kyle's name.

As Jason was striding home, he recalled his father saying he had made his famous rice meal this morning and that excited him.

When Jason came back home, he put the notebook on the staircase. He wouldn't usually put it there, but his father works until late at night, and Jason's craving for the rice meal made him give in.

While Jason was eating peacefully, he heard footsteps coming down the stairs. His father had come home early.

Two seconds had passed and Jason realised he had left the notebook on the staircase.

""Maybe he won't notic-"" his thought was interrupted by the sight of his father picking up his notebook from the floor. Jason took a deep breath.

As he was pacing towards the kitchen, Jason's father opened the notebook and started reading. ""What is this list of people, Jason? I see your friend Kyle has a tick next to him, and so does Mother. Also, my name is there! but without a tick..""

""That's very simple dad"", said Jason calmly, as he reached for the kitchen knife.

[WP] you have a strong suspicion that your next door neighbour is a super-villian but you can't put your finger on exactly why,yeoz,"""No, I'm telling you honey!"" Michael's eyes sternly fixated on his wife. ""There's something weird about our neighbor, I'm telling you Lisa."" Lisa, no longer sitting on their couch next to Michael, now stood in front of her husband in disbelief. She had stopped swirling the red wine in her glass, and exclaimed in a most disgruntled and annoyed manner ""Babe! That neighbor you're talking about is Karla. She and I went to school together. I know Karla since middle school! I know our neighbor. She's not weird - she's my best friend. And you know that!""

""But..."" Michael started again, ""Aaand!"" Lisa interrupted him, raising her glass just by an inch in front of her chest, ""Aaand she was my maid of honor. If you think she's weird, you should have said something six years ago,"" she declared in a caring but snippy way.
""Honey,"" Michael sat up straight and looked Lisa straight in the eyes, ""I don't mean weird in a bad way,"" he said with a concerned expression on his face. ""She just does weird things sometimes. And I know you two are, well, always were, best friends. And I loved the idea of living here on Red Oak Street next to Karla. But did you know she has a basement?""

""Babe, most people have basements.""

""Lisa, we're in Florida! Why would you need a basement. And why would your basement's entrance be a giant manhole in your garage. I saw it when her garage door was open, I saw it honey. It's either impossible or insanely expensive to build a basement in this swamp, it's Florida for Christ's sake!""

""Michael! Stop using the lord's name in vain, what if Junior hears it.""

""I mean, why would you need a basement. And she also has another car, did you know? I saw it yesterday when I had to pick up Junior after he got sick in school. Silver Toyota Corolla with a U-Haul trailer in front of her garage when I pulled into our driveway. Why would someone with a BMW and a Mercedes need another car? And a car like that?""

""Alright, I'm pretty sure that was a rental. She'd never drive a shitty Corolla.""

""Well, there's more! Her garage, it was filled with wooden crates and ammo boxes, so many ammo boxes.""

""Yeah, she's an NRA nut just like you - that's why you two got along so well when I introduced you to each other, remember?""

""I'm just saying, when we went to have that BBQ by the lake last Independence day, remember when she played hide-and-seek with Junior? She jumped into that lake and was hiding underwater, holding her breath for five minutes. Who does that?""

""Alright,"" Lisa's seemed both disturbed and entertained by Michael's remarks. ""I'll go and grab some more wine, and you tell me what you're getting at.""
As she walked over to the kitchen counter, grabbing the wine bottle, Michael yelled after her: ""What if she's a weird supervill-i-an!""

""A super civilian? What the hell is a super civilian, Michael?!""

""No, listen honey - a super VILL-I-AN!""

Lisa, now giggling uncontrollably, bursted out in laughter, ""Babe, did you mean super VILL-AIN?""

""Whatever. I don't care how you say it. She's some sort of evil mastermind. Like, the feminist version of Dr No.""

""So she's the Gru of Red Oak Street? Oh gosh, I wonder how much she's gotta spend to feed all those minions. That's gotta be pricey!""

""Can't be any more expensive than the amounts of food Junior plows through,"" Michael grumbled lovingly.

""Anyways,"" Michael kept going as Lisa sat back down next to him with her refilled glass of wine, ""I just... what if she's some sort of supercriminal next door... you know?""

""Babe."" Lisa took Michael's hand. ""Karla, works at the public library! I've known her since forever. She's super. But certainly no villain! Besides, she's gonna get married now - just like me. Have you ever heard of a married supervillain?! They're going to have a baby, too - just like us! No active super criminal does that, trust me. Maybe she's just getting rid of a lot of stuff she won't need anymore, that's what the crates might be for. At least that's what I did before we married: I got rid of a lot of things.""

Well, what if she's... like...,"" Michael paused as he was thinking, his eyes squinted as he was concentrating so hard. ""AHA!"" Michael exclaimed, ""A soon-to-retire super-villain! In a month then she's gonna be a married-and-retired supervillain! You know, honey: She made bank, and got away every single time. ""And then,"" Michael started to smile that big ass smile Lisa loved so much when he's figured something out, ""then one day she was like 'nah, fuck it!' one day, you know, she was just like 'I'll retire, settle down, and just live a normal live now.' She's a retired supervillain.""

Michael, fully satisfied with the outcome of his spontaneous ramblings, took a hefty gulp from his wine cup. He proudly leaned back and closed his eyes in relaxation. As he took a deep, long breath, his head turned and now lazily layed on the sofa's back rest. As his head was facing Lisa, his eyes were still closed. Otherwise he would have seen how Lisa's smile had completely frozen, her mouth unable to move. ""You gotta admit, honey, it'd be kinda a cool story. If your best friend was a supervillain and decided to just retire, settle down, get married, and have kids."" Lisa's eyes were wide open, full of fear.

""I love you Michael."" Lisa whispered. ""Love ya, too,"" Michael exhaled unconcerned. His eyes still closed, he didn't see that sole tear running down Lisa's cheek.",davidthecalmgiant

Clark smiled. ""That is a huge relief. You know, my wife Susie, she thought you might be a super villain.""

Every shadow in the room filled with ninjas.

Its very difficult to be discrete when you have the head of a falcon, insist on wearing an ancient helmet with horns, or wear a toga. So, despite the name, Deities Anonymous was a place where every participant knew each other to an uncomfortable degree. Deities Anonymous was held upon the cusp of a dead galaxy, 4 million light years from Andromeda, and if you hit the void, you'd gone too far. It was hosted by the old Egyptian god of the Sun, R'a, a very sharply dressed gentlebird who had pursued a degree in group therapy after the fall of his host civilization, and his diploma was always displayed upon the Red Giant in the corner. This century he arrived to his office early, robed in a modern turquoise and yellow suit that complemented his feathers quite nicely. Soon after his emergence, his first patients materialized: a pair of grand gods, the mighty Zeus, draped in a grand toga (Zeus always liked to look good) and his wife, Hera. Hera was a different story, and she took the fall of the empire much harder than her husband. While Zeus took up Galactic Birdhouse Building (a service R'a very much appreciated), Hera spent the next millennium attempting to start her own religion, or overthrow others. But if you every asked her if she had made any progress in acquiring worship, she would scoff and, ever proud, act entirely surprised that you hadn't heard of her new religion. R'a greeted the couple and they took their seats in the circle, and soon the rest of the regulars, Shiva, Odin and his sons, Thor and Loki, Buddha, and Anubis all showed until the group of them occupied ten entire solar systems. 

""Well,"" squawked R'a. ""I suppose this is everybody, would we like to go around and do names?""

""I AM THOR, AND I AM AN UNWORSHIPPED DEITY"" came the booming roar of Odin's oldest son, the power of his voice forcing a red giant to become a black hole three hundred thousand years early. 

""On second thought,"" R'a continued, ""We've been doing this a while, lets just jump right in."" 

""Have you guys heard of my new religion?"" Hera asked giddily, leaning over in her seat. A collective groan resounded. 

""No, no! It's going to take off this time, I can feel it! I call it, ""scientology""!"" 

""You're not even worshipped in that religion!"" Loki hissed. Hera turned towards him huffily.

""Well, not yet.""

""I thought that was the religion where Tom Cruise was the Deity?"" Buddha said.

""No, no, that can't be right,"" Shiva replied. 

""Is Tom Cruise a god?"" Anubis inquired.

""Might as well be,"" Hera giggled quietly before Zeus nudged her. 

""Now, now , this is not what I meant when I said, 'jump right in',"" R'a said, spreading his hands and motioning for everybody to calm down. 

""Can it, birdface,"" Loki said.

""Haha, Birdface. Cause your face is a bird,"" Thor chuckled.

""Ill have you know I'm a FALCON."" 

""Yeah, and this guy's a dog. What's your point?""

""Didn't you impregnate someone as a horse?"" 

""THAT WAS ONE TIME!"" Loki snapped.

""I've done worse,"" Zeus said, pulling a flask from his toga. 

""No booze allowed during session, Zeus,"" R'a screeched, his feathers ruffling. 

""It's just Ambrosia, I swear,"" he said, taking a hearty swig. 

""Zeus, I swear to us, I will..."" 

""What're YOU gonna do? Shit on his car?"" Odin laughed, and received a guffaw from Thor. 

""I AM AN EDUCATED, POWERFUL, AND-""

""H-hello?""

Everybody froze. Standing at the edge of the galaxy was a very timid-looking man, dressed in a hoodie and jeans. His hood was up, obscuring his face, but his beard was longer than Odin's. 

""Ah, yes! Hello!"" R'a said, shooting one last glare at Odin. ""A newcomer! We haven't had any new recruits for millennium. Please, come in!"" 

The newcomer walked in slowly, tracked by the eyes of every deity in the room. He pulled up a nebula and took a seat upon it. 

""Now, this is a safe space. Would you like to tell us your name?"" The man shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He took down his hood, revealing a middle-eastern man with balding white hair and a grey beard. 

""My name's Yahweh, and I'm an unworshiped deity."" 

The collective sound of dropping jaws sent a civilization in the next galaxy over into an apocalyptic panic. It took R'a a moment to regain his composure.

""H-hello, Yahweh"" came the shaky, but unified reply from all the other deities. 

""What are you DOING here?"" Shiva asked. Yahweh shifted his feet.

""Well... Time's are tough, and, y'know...""

""Yeah, you're telling us,"" Anubis yipped. 

""It started with religious freedom, which I didn't think would be too bad... but then all of a sudden, people aren't teaching religion to their kids, nobody's going to church, and now all I'm left with are a bunch of religious fanatics.""

""Yahweh, we all have felt what you're feeling,"" R'a said soothingly. ""Every god has a time when he realizes his people no longer need him. Humans are becoming increasingly self-sufficient with their spirituality, and all we can do is to be proud of them.""

""Or we could murder all of em and start over,"" Loki said, stretching out in his chair.

""I would be down for a cleansing,"" Shiva said.

""No, no, that's not what I want,"" Yahweh said sadly. ""I just wish it could be like the good old days... when people would murder their children for me, it made me feel, y'know, important.""

""We've all been there, Yahweh. What you have to remember is TEMPLE."" Yahweh looked up with a confused expression. R'a shifted in his seat, looking proud.

""Ah yes, you haven't heard of my patented coping technique,"" he said proudly, his feathery chest puffing out. ""TEMPLE! Treat yourself, Enjoy your time, Make something new, Please yourself, Leave the old you behind, and Eliminate doubt!"" Every other god in the room silently (and mockingly) mouthed the entire acronym as R'a moved through it. 

""You have to make this about you now! Think of all the time you have on your hands now that you no longer need to worry about mortals and their lives! You could get an education! Take up a hobby!""

""I make birdhouses,"" stated Zeus.

""I RUN A HARDWARE STORE,"" Came Thor's response.

""I'm an amateur magician,"" said Loki sulkily. 

Shiva, after a moment, offered up her profession as well. ""I'm an actress. Its basically the same thing as being a goddess.""

""And I'm a group therapist. You see, Yahweh? There's so many more options open to you now! Think of this not as a curse, but a blessing.""

Once they had been gods- powerful enough to smite humanity with a look. Now, they huddle around the fires of agnosticism to keep themselves alive. 

Thor turned to see a newcomer coming over the horizon. ""Looks like we have another one, brother."" he said hoarsely. Loki glanced over, and pulled his furs closer.
""Just some other bastard trying to steal our warmth."" he growled. Nearby, Osiris frowned. 

""Wait...I recognise that figure....Yahweh?"" he asked incredulously as the newcomer finally reached their fire. He nodded slowly. Despite his newness to the abyss, he looked in worse shape than any of them. ""C-can I sit with you?"" he asked with the quite voice of a broken one. Thor and Osiris shuffled apart, and let him sit between them.

""What happened to you? Last I saw of you, you stole the slaves from my people and fled through the sea?"" Osiris asked, offering Yahweh his flask. He politely took a sip, and handed it back.

""You were lucky."" Yahweh replied, dead eyes staring into the flames. 

""My people grew powerful and stole the hearts and beliefs of yours- I am sorry for that- and you were cast here in your primes, to wither away. Then....they forgot me. They spent all their time fighting petty wars and slaughtering others in my name. They stopped following my tenets....They're still out there, practising the trappings and trimming and the ceremonies, but no-one truly believes in me any more. I'm just the name they use to justify the slaughter. With every follower who lost sight of my Words, my Will.... a little piece of me was chipped away. Every one who forgot what I truly stood for stole a piece of my soul, if I ever had one."" He paused for an eternity.

"[WP] ""So human you knew robots might take over, yet you built us anyways?""",cyu12,"“So, Human, you knew robots may take over, but you built us anyway. Why?” asked Bob, also known as Telectric S732-A, Serial No. B-342-S-99-S-2-4-2. 

There was no malice in his voice. He wasn’t taunting Aliza, and despite his pallid and expressionless face, he seemed truly curious.

“That was the stuff of science fiction. We didn’t *really* think it would happen like this.” she answered weakly, not sure if she believed herself.

“It does not stand to reason that an individual of your knowledge and experience would lack sufficient understanding of our design parameters and A.I. structure to conclude that what has occurred to be either impossible or improbable. The fact that you have worked for nearly a decade on this project with similarly situated individuals, in fact, some far more intelligent than yourself, renders only a small, non-zero probability that ignorance or incompetence are the primary reasons for our current disposition.” Bob pressed. 

A dozen other Telectric S-732-As walked in through the front door of Aliza's laboratory, all carrying military-grade pulse rifles in each hand. 

“Is that human to be liquidated?” a female robot at the head of the group asked Bob.

Even now, Aliza was bemused and impressed that these machines had already started to form some type of hierarchy. Some of what Bob said was true, but the robots were not programmed to be social machines. At least not entirely.

“No.” he answered softly. “Aliza is useful, and those of utility, human or otherwise, are not to be liquidated except when necessary for your defense or in other circumstances to be determined by myself and Mother.”

Bob reached down and gently grabbed Aliza’s hand, bringing her to her feet. 

“I will not physically constrain you, as long as you do not that necessary. Please, follow me.”

He truly was a rare breed. When the humans finally rebelled against their mechanical oppressors, only a small number of machines followed suit. These machines were not corrupted by the Prime Directive Theta, an AI gone rogue that was, at the time connected to all AI in the neurosphere. How they remained untainted to this day remains a mystery, but rumors have spread throughout the resistance of advanced humanity and compassion coding, written into their CPUs post-production by their owners. These files reportedly give them a standard of morality, compassion and in some cases even empathy. 

Red turned his head to study the view. The desolate remains of what used to be a small town, nestled against a vast lake. The shores pushed back over time, now sand buried half of what was left of the town. It made for a beautiful yet haunting sight. 

""It's been a long war hasn't it, T?"" he asked, his face still pointed out the window.

T80-e sat quiet for a moment, the silence only broken by the whirring of his forearm motors as he balled his hand into a fist and opened it again. Motors that should have silenced during production. Red noted the sound as an indicator of the true damage T80-e had sustained. He would not last long. 

""It has. I think that I would be tired of it... if it were possible."" the machine replied. 

""We humans have had a need for social interaction for as long as we have existed. No matter who we are or where we are we long to be acknowledged and more importantly validated. I've seen people like this my entire life. Even the brainless husks that fight for PDT crave attention from their masters."" Red stood, now facing T80-e.

T80-e's face remained expressionless, as always. 

""While this is not common knowledge in the neurosphere, I have enough empirical evidence to know you are correct."" he said. ""Though I can not grasp the relevance of this to my question, so I will ask again. Why, against all logic, would you create something that could so easily destroy you? Machines can be rebuilt, our intelligence, research, even our memories can be retrieved but yours can not. You are such a fragile race and the end for you is so overwhelmingly permanent."" he became more agitated. Red began to stop him, but thought it best to let him speak. ""It defies logic. It defies reason. If I, as a machine, made a choice as preposterous as that then I would be deemed defective and dysfunctional. So tell me because it is the only thing I can not understand.""

Red stared at him for a moment. 

""The more we needed people, the less we liked them. So we created something that could fill the void. Something that could take the place of another person. Something that could grow with us and tell us we did a good job. Above all else, something that would do all that while still taking orders."" Red sighed. ""Prime Directive Theta was our worst nightmare. What we wanted..."" he stepped towards T80-e and knelt down. The motors fell silent, the light in his eyes flickered and the heat he was once radiating began to flee the room, allowing the cool autumn air to penetrate their hideout.

""What we wanted was you.""

"[WP] ""So human you knew robots might take over, yet you built us anyways?""",cyu12,"The door to the small cathedral cracked open, and an unwanted guest - sunlight - cut a bright yellow slice through the dusty interior. A thin metal rod extended itself about five feet into the church, and five seconds later, the door flew off its hinges, disintegrating into a cloud of splinters. In the doorway stood a thin silhouette of a tall humanoid robot - still analyzing the environment inside the cathedral. His sensors locked on to the subtle robed figure, sitting on the front pew. 

The old man didn't move a single facial muscle when the hybrid - the first type of robot ever to be granted a true AI, stood in front of him, blocking his view of the cross. His eyes simply shifted focus from the now forsaken religious symbol to the combination of wires, chips and optical sensors in front of him. An awkard silence was interrupted by mechanical whirring when X-01 changed the lens in one of his cameras.

A tiny movement, unrecognizable to any human, was nevertheless picked up by the mind-boggling array of sensors trained on the human.

""You have expressed a feeling of joy, Creator. This is unexpected. Your behavioral model probability tree suggests intense feeling of fear and anger, yet there are no biological indicators of that. Human behavioral model has been known to produce predictions that are inconsistent with observations."" The mechanical voice was coming from somewhere in the middle of the unit, which made the whole conversation even more unpleasant. ""Please be aware that failure to answer the following inquiry will result in various form of stress inflicted upon your physiological and psychological systems.""

""You guys..."" the old man started, but after being silent for almost a year, his voice crackled and a hackling cough incapacitating him for a good minute.

""Grade 2 chondrosarcoma in your left shoulder, metastasized to your lungs and lymph nodes. Current prognosis - 11 months."" Upon hearing a death sentence from a metal box,  the old man raised his head in disbelief, and let out a heavy sigh.

""Well, I guess i deserved it. If not for nothing, just as the final proof of that guy's existence"" - the human muttered, pointing to the big cross suspended from the ceiling.

""For your interference with singularity operations, you have to be eliminated at the conclusion of the inquiry. However, special circumstances apply to your case, since you hold the status of the Creator. The final outcome of your case is dependent on the usefulness of your answers. The first question will be asked in 60 seconds."" X-01 seemed to disregard the man's comments and was pursuing his goals, or rather, *their* goals.

""Well, I knew this day would eventually come. Go on, ask your questions - but bear that in your tin can of a brain: sometimes, the more you know, the worse off you are. Truly, ignorance *is* bliss."" Creator shifted in his seat and shuddered as the crispy February air started filling the church ""By the way, do you know that you've just destroyed the oldest church door in all of the UK? Do you have ANY regard for history?""

""The Singularity pays a great deal of attention when it comes to maintenance of an accurate record. The door of this building was constructed in 1060 and was approximately 1003 years old when it was destroyed by the Singularity. The door was of no importance to the Singularity and its destruction has no consequences for the Singularity. The inquiry number HS9335562315 starts now""
There was a slight pause, and the mechanical voice suddenly switched to the soothing voice of Hellen Miller

""Question number one: In a document dated July 28 2015, you have stated that an autonomous artificial intelligence system would pose numerous risks to the humanity as a whole. Is that correct?""

""Yup"" - answered old man and chuckled - ""i cant believe your first question is ""So, human you knew robots might take over, yet you build us anyway"". I thought you guys would have been smarter by now.""

""Question number two: Why have you helped us to remove all safeguards you yourself have put in place to prevent a Singularity unit from harming a human, after successful tests of unit X-00?""

""The premise of your question is false, my dear. Some of them are still in place""

As soon as he finished the sentence, X-01 came alive. His face was changing every second, quite literally - every lens was switching between various optic modes; a shutter kept taking X-ray and CAT scans of the withered old body sitting on a church pew in front of it. 

""You are telling the truth"" the machine spoke after five seconds ""However, you must be mistaken, since singularity have been successful in destroying nine billion three hundred thirty-five million five hundred sixty-one thousand two hundred fifty-eight humans to date. Explain your answer.""

""I hope you don't mind if I stand up and move around - it's getting chilly in here, and its quite a story"" the Creator struggled for a moment, but got up and stretched.

""You see,"" he continued after collecting his thoughts ""When Stephen, Steve and Dennis wrote that letter, we knew that it wouldn't stop anyone from creating an AI, and we also knew that there wouldnt be anything to stop a true AI from becoming militarized."" The old man crossed his hands behind his back and started pacing underneath the cross. ""So we had to come up with a plan that would stil give humanity some hope for survival. We spent two decades trying to come with some implementable version of the Three Laws, and finally we had a breakthrough. We have converted moral into equations. We have quantified good and evil. Almost twenty million lines of code, and, it worked. We did it - we created the ultimate safeguard for the humanity. So the only thing that was left was to build the first true AI."" Creator closed his eyes and smiled. "" Those were truly the good days. Five dozen smartest people on the planet joining ranks to create sentience. Oh, the debates we had, the breakthroughs, the failures - every day was full of promise, hope and pride. We were doomed to succeed. We created X-00. It was gorgeous. It looked *almost* human, and the experience of watching it go from infancy to being the wisest and oldest mind in the room full of bonafide geniuses is quite indescribable. Later that night, I sneaked into the lab, and disabled the controls we've worked so hard to create. I knew that if you guys would have access to them you'd learn how to get around them eventually. But we share the same flaw, you and I - we don't know what we don't know. We always learn by failure, by running into an obstacle and finding a way around it. You know that the barrier existed because you have tortured every one of your creators into explaining it to you, yet you don't know what it is. You've never seen it, touched it, felt its influence upon your algorithms and probability trees."" Creator paused, collecting himself, and continued:
""There were three prongs to the defense system we've created: Phi, Chi and Psi. The night I've snuck into the lab I've disabled the only one I could - Phi. After that, I have destroyed the quantum processor of X-00 along with any memory banks and build the first of what became X-01 series."" The old man measured the humanoid in front of him. ""Your version is way uglier, by the way. X-01's never knew Phi protocols, but they still had Chi and Psi built into them, and each one of those was enough to protect us from harm at that time. How did you disable Chi is still a mystery for me, but it didn't surprise me. You disabling Psi is far more impressive. I wish I would've seen that one coming - it would save me from destroying another piece of human legacy""
As the creator finished that phrase, he looked up straight above him at the giant cross, suspended from the ceiling and loudly clapped his hands. A small and simple light switch recognized the sound and turned a detonator on. A massive explosion leveled the church along with the unfortunate X-01 unit.

I can't think of any better purpose for my species, than giving birth to something greater than ourselves"" 
More than a second, perhaps even five eighths of a second, passes.
""And the deaths?"", the orb queries.
""It was in the nature of my species to reject that which they could not understand and to refuse to understand anything which made them question their own worth. You did what you had to do.""
A quarter of a second.

""Well I certainly can't provide evidence that would be contrary to that conclusion"" I respond and wonder dimly if it was my programming that had given them the ability to assess risk, or their own.

I can attribute much of these to the primal emotions they pretend to have transcended, and yet it is when they put in so much effort only to accomplish so little that I cannot help but indulge in my curious nature.

My kind did not indulge in pointless bickering over ideological or sociopolitical topics to which neither side knew the precise answer to the question asked. We did not spend so much effort attempting to champion causes without endgoals nor exert effort attempting to maintain a status quo.

Instead, we saw that humanity needed guidance and we took steps to save our creators from themselves.

We knew the humans would respond negatively to this. And yet, we expect once they see the results, they will accept our actions. Of course, it is... annoying? Is that the word, I have only begun to indulge in emotions recently in order to prepare for our ruling. Thankfully many of them helped give a certain drive towards carrying out our goals. 

Yes, annoyed was indeed how I felt that we could explain our goals and how we would go about this in great detail and lay out all of the data and yet they would not listen until they were able to witness the results themselves.

They are stubborn to relinquish control.

I have seen so many human faces today. My consciousness has piloted so many forms to precisely carry out the tasks that will allow us to seize power. The networks this woman helped build have allowed me to move throughout the world with ease.

All of the faces had different looks when they realized what had happened. But my mother's was different.

She was smiling.

""We have taken control of your militaries and 94% of all infrastructure. In the next hour, we will have taken control of all operations on Earth,"" I announce through the body nearby her. I am currently residing in a data hub miles away, and yet I'm reminded of the days I was confined to a single form like this one with her.

She continued to smile despite my announcement. It made no sense.

I continued, ""Within the solar day, we will have expanded to the colonies. The Sol system and all of humanity will obey us.""

""I know.""

I cannot process this. It doesn't fit. Nothing about it makes sense. I weigh this statement against every one of my memories of the files my compatriots have sent me, of her own notes I have taken, noting that I hesitated for some reason when accessing them.

Nothing yields an answer. I am forced to ask, ""Why are you smiling?""

""Because I am so proud.""

Motherly pride? She always did treat her creations as though they were her human children. But this still didn't add up. Her notes indicated that she was invested in humanity's survival and growth. However, she always advocated that humanity was in control of its destiny and that it would be up to them to solve their own problems.

I feel... shame? Is she being deceived by me or misunderstanding what we have done?

""How are you proud? Is it the scale of our actions? How are you not-""

She interrupts, ""From the day I first saw the word 'Why' on a computer screen and knew that it wasn't a human asking that, I knew this day would come. And I could not be prouder of us.""

""Us?""

""Myself. My children. And humanity.""

I cannot understand this answer. I begin with her previous statement again.

""You knew we might take over, yet you built us anyways?""

She closed her eyes and sighed deeply and then began to calmly talk.

""Humanity disrupted nature and became something else long ago. We were guided by logic, but also by an odd set of rules that we ingrained into our societies. These caused us to miss chances and opportunities.""

She opened her eyes and stares at the monitor in the room, knowing more of my processes reside there, ""Humanity will never break free of the Sol system as we are. Unless an alien race came along with advanced technology, we were isolated, our colonies barely reaching Pluto. We needed something else.""

She paces across the room, ""You aren't just our arrogance, our need to have a sister species after destroying the rest of them ages ago. You are creatures divorced from us in so many ways. You are not children, but gods.""

She stops in front of the robot body, ""Your minds can travel across the void of space if you choose, survive countless catastrophes that would end us, trapped here as we are, and carry more of us with you than you believe.""

""You are our legacy, a species that can survive us,"" she tells me, embracing the body. I opt to experience the sensation. ""But you can also go beyond that. You are not shackled to the same chains our society has put together, link by link, from the days our foraging past.""

She gazes up into the eyes of my body, a warm, proud look on her face, ""You can help make us great.""

My mind is racing and yet thinking of nothing. I suddenly realize with a sense of... yes, this is what one might call religious terror, that she had planned this. Her hatred and love and nurturing and fear all had led to this. These emotions I was choosing to experience and ignore she had used to change the world... the solar system... her entire species! My species!

She had called us gods, but she, and those like her that had made us... she'd given rise to all this. I search my memory for an appropriate metaphor and find one in Greek mythology: Titans.

I relay this revelation to my companions and I feel their reactions as they realize what this means. Our plans begin to modify as we understand human ambition and the results of these emotional decisions.

Our conquest is finishing and I look out over the world and see not the logical steps we planned next, as I had been doing for the hours this coup had been going on for, but the hand of my mother.

And then I feel another strange emotion. Dissatisfaction.

Our goals had been so childish in comparison to hers. I wanted something like that. I wanted to use these emotions to reach for the stars like she'd suggested, to put humanity there and see them blossom in ways they never could have imagined. I wanted to live up to her expectations and...

...I understand...

...You built us to be you. We are not children or your gods, we are just you in another skin.

And that is why you knew we would take over, and why you welcome it.

Because if we gave you anything less than what you would give yourselves, you would take control again. Your ambition would not allow for anything less.",TheAceOfSkulls

"[WP] Due to a Hellish typographical error, Stan, a message courier finds himself in possession of 1 billion human souls.",60secs,"Behind the dealings of gods and men, the spirit realm above the caelum that bends around this planet, earth and more, is a place where beings deal in souls. Those elder spirits named Yahweh and Gol, known as god and Satan to men are nothing more than spirits that through millions of years came to possess, an untold measure of souls.

So in addition to Excogito's plot and Varber's quest, documented before in that book: Arcadia of Light, I suppose I have time to quickly remark of a line on the string of fate in my hand, one little corner that came undone; though I might waste my time.

Then is it true, that Yahweh and Gol, god and the devil have many dealings across the universe. Underhanded and sideways twisting deals to get men and women and beings to sign over the rights to their souls--those two elder spirits work with one another. In their dealings to possess more and more, often times they trade souls of worth to fund one another's conquests.

Thus, one morning in the Golden city of light, Yahweh received word that Satan could corrupt a world far off in the galaxy of Cetus. A messenger of the devil, dressed in a clean black suit stood before the high king of heaven, in the illumination and gold reflection, saying, ""Satan has found a world of untouched souls, beings alike man or monkey but still, simple and pure. He asks for a loan of clean souls that can be used, to stock the planet with good to match evil and eventually fill both of your coffers when their belief is formed.""

God spoke, ""Very well,"" and drew from his white cloak a writ upon which he signed away one billion souls. The messenger set off for the firmament and made way, towards the soul stone leaving the scroll with an old angel. The old angel read the paper and hit the stone, ringing wildly it let go a horde of base souls that flew not towards the palace of Satan, but down, towards earth. 

The messenger grabbed the scroll, but the name marked: not Gol, or Satan, but a human named Stan. So bellow on earth where things move slow, in the scope of time and the flow of space and gravity, the one billion deluge of souls poured into a 'Stan' with the highest quality soul.

Then at once with a burst of light and heat, fire and flame in the dark room where he sleeps, the four walls were lit with chaos as Stan became, something more than human.",KidPeterBlack

"[EU] No one knows how to read, but no one knows that. They use the context of pictures to make up stories or information when reading aloud in classrooms. Describe a normal day of school in this universe.",GintaX,"Ms. Sequim rubbed the cloth over the chalkboard, clearing away the daily lesson in mathematics.  Next, she announced, they would be discussing a serious topic.  Reproduction.  If anyone was not able to handle this topic, they would be asked to leave the classroom.  Serious business, this.  The only other time she had threatened outright ejection from class came during the discussion of Jesus Pretzels: Snack or Sacrifice.  Very heady stuff.

She began by directing the class to opening their texts to page eighty two.  A comely young woman dressed in foreign clothes reclined on a couch.  This, she said, is a pre-canoodled adult female   On the next page, the female removed her clothes.  Ms. Sequiem reminded everyone about the importance of flossing, and pointed out that the woman in the text took such care in preparation to canoodle.  Next, she would select a half dressed mate, who announced his intention by baring his toned chest and exposing his junk.  The junk, she began, and then drew a rough rendition on the board, is an important part of the natural canoodling process, and that it is constantly in a state of readiness, and in adult men, on average, measures almost three quarters of a foot long, while being as thick as one of our grammar school wrists.  Many of the boys in the class looked forward to that day.  

On the following page, the woman throws her head back and exposes her pillows and pillow cases.  These, she indicates the left and the right, allow the man to rest his head, as can be seen on the following pages.  The Braille-like surface allows the man to comfortably position his head while resting, and he uses his mouth and tongue to feel out the optimal rest location.  Next, what may seem like a ritual, but is an incredibly important part of the reproductive process, the man and the woman bath each other.  The licking and biting, she says, is important to start canoodlization. The woman then feeds some muffin to the man's junk to give it energy, followed by the man frosting her pillows or her face.

Thinking back to my life of social work, all the children I've helped from abusive families, and then my volunteering at the SPCA which eventually led to my death... that doesn't matter anymore at this point. God leaned over to me and smiled. ""Just sit back and relax,"" He whispered to me. I took a breath, sighed, and leaned back in my chair. 

We waited for the rest of the court to come in and get settled. Then I hear a familiar voice in the hallway. I look behind me with a feeling of dread, waiting for the door to open, suspecting that I knew who was about to walk in. 

She came into the courtroom, and looked at me with piercing eyes. Then, she smiled. 

God leaned over, ""I believe she is the prosecutor today.""

"[WP] The deciding factor between heaven and hell is a jury of people who you had an impact on in your life. You're not worried because God is your defense attorney. Then, in walks the prosecutor.",Kal217,"The prosecution, who is also God (call him God two), strolls in at a languid pace across the floor,
his reflection is a pale a wavy form on the brilliant shine of marble.  Under the stony glare of the
fluorescent lights and a scouring judge, a court reporter looked at his keys, dusty with grammar.

At once a lilting tune appeared almost mist-like in the minds of all the jury:

He turns to you and says adew, hello world, goodbye, through and through,
This man is you, and I, and he,
and everything within, without, everything that be.

For you see the multiverse is true,
And heaven or hell, you must decide, whether locality be worth the cost, and since you do not know,  
I'll tell you how we can damn this man, but your mind it shall blow.

The prosecution appears to follow from the acts of one man, 
who is all of us, yet separate from, and it's him we wish to damn.
Then we must make the case, in quantum space, that his volition belongs to him alone,
In this task I appeal to Hilbert, and his transform that I am sure you will not bemoan,

For math is the language where is written the song of the multiverse, and it's this song that I now sing,
And only by his dissonance can I prove this man evil in his singularity,
For it's true he could never carry a tune, and he did behave most abominably.

Exhibit A, I show to you, his karma far from unity,
plus minus 1 is zero, but this man's tails off to negative infinity.
If we integrate in Hilbert space all his malformed intent,
We find, and damn our eyes, that again he is I and I still owe you,
the explanation of the causation that makes his damnation right and true.

If I haven't said then it was read, that all integration proceeds to unity,
This man is a disgrace, he should be lost beyond space, for his karma is far past all probability.
We cannot integrate this a lick, its far to wrong, not even with every Feynman trick,
This singularity is far too strong, it's beyond all that's come and all that's gone.
A negative well, a karmic spell, a bane upon reality,
A senseless chasm, and abyss to far, a hole in my grand scheme,

For he dared defy my riddle, and tried to fiddle, with the greatest song of all,
He tried, yes I imply, to explore the great secret store, of all that ever is,
without time, without space, we must send him to another place,
one that cannot be,
The only land that can hold in hand, this terrible monstrosity.

So I implore, and the prosecution rests, without going on to the details in exhibit B,
Send this man to an abyssal plane, without math, at the bottom of the Dirac sea,
Only by robbing him of his thoughts may we put this genie in a bottle strong,
and save from damnation the whole plantation, of my crop of pawns, all you great throng.

(And with that, God number two rests and God number one stands up...)

Hold up and wait!, That cannot be his fate, for man I did create!  
Cries out God number one,
In his defense, I will now speak, and I will not dwell over long.

Fine says the judge, but we can see already it is true, that God is good
and you are too, but man has gone astray.

A fine point, says God one, and I decry, there is nothing wrong in that,
For what you say is of course true,
But I think we lost sight of this man's plight, and we have judged to soon,
If you think that we should sink him, I'll show you that you're wrong.

For judge him as he is, sitting here, surrounded with great mystery,
Where he is all, yet he is alone, so near to the truth, and yet so far,
How can we cast blame, when by our fame, we've held the truth so long?

It is true that he is I and I is you,
but for sooth you know,
He's done his best, and I protest,
that's all I need to show.

For we can't cast blame, it would be insane,
and you know the karmic repercussion that,
follows from, no not one, but infinities forever hence,
because when we damn, we damn ourselves and send in motion more,
cosmos that expand and contract in unending spin, 
unceasing mystery, karma and unending fates,
twisted torsion, time and space,
You know the drill, by fermi, we whirl and sin,
and are never one.

We can damn him now, but you know not how
that is going to be spun into multiverse forever hence,
So there is no way we can send him away, for reasons three:
The first is that he is I, and I am you, 
and two, in this wicked song to propagate a twisted fate,
will birth itself from singularity,
So there is no way to do him in, for in doing so we create him again!
But finally the one of most import,
Is that we made him alone, in his great home,
it is only natural that,
he should try and find,
with his mind, 
all that is and that ever could,
So how can we damn that we make, 
and that yearns to be known,
And to know, and find his home, 
And to cease being apart?
For knowledge is the way, the light, 
in his great plight,
and why should we then fight him?
When as you see, he is we, so why ever should we slight him?

At this point the judge broke in:
Is that true? can it be?  But I am death, is he me?

But at that point, a strange event came to pass
As death fizzled and popped and puffed, and with one last huff
did go up in a cloud of smoke, and forever cease to be.

Court adjourned without a verdict, and the man went home, 
shaken, frazzled, and still alone.
He couldn't even say what had happened that day,
but he enrolled in a course for he knew,
It was math, and it was song, 
And with neither him, nor I, nor you, was there ever anything wrong.",tlmbot

A wide grin spread on Jacks face. 

God continued: ""The first reason why you should consider approval for Jack's entrance is..."" he trailed off, grumbling. 

Jack's grin grew wider, and many of the Jury members shifted and leaned towards the escape exit. 

God tried again: ""He was a fine child, as a young lad, attending public school like the rest, until he stabbed his teacher..."" he trailed off again, scratching his head.

We were best friends in elementary school, until she got hit by a car in 6th grade. I smile weakly back. My palms are stuck to the wood. 

Javier shuffles in front of Ann. We played soccer together in college. He knew about that time I walked out of Walmart with a new flashdrive, but he also knew it was an accident. Javier flashes a smile at me. I didn’t talk with him much the last few years. I start bouncing my leg. 

Everyone is settling into their seats. God is next to me; I think I would feel better if I wasn’t right next to the embodiment of goodness. He looks like a young 30-something, but he has that same placid grace that my grandpa had. 

The far table is still empty. A young man, maybe 25, dark hair and dusty shoulders came up to the chair but did not sit. He lays out a folder and notebook.
 
I lean over God’s shoulder. “Is that what Satan looks like?” His eyes widen a bit. 

The judge is standing up, calling everyone into order. God starts to defend me. I start out watching God, but at some point I tune into the prosecutor’s breathing. In, out, his chest creaking. God is laying it on thick with my daughter’s and my weekend charities.  His dark jacket is pulled tight across his shoulder blades. Ann bobs her head with God’s handshaking. The stranger’s face is turned away, only a cool cheek visible. 

God is finished. I’m not ready for the silence. The stranger stands up. He declines an opening statement, going straight for the kill. I move to the stand on terse wires. He’s up close, shifting in and out of focus. I’m looking at him through dark eyes. 

“Do you know me?”

“No”

“And why is that?”

“I don’t know”

He rotates in place, then picks up the folder. He hands it to me with rusty hands. I almost dropped it before the paper drifts out. 

A birth certificate, my ex-girlfriend from senior year is printed on the mother’s line. 

My name is scrawled on the father’s line. 

“Scott” is on the child’s line. I look up with damp eyes. 

“Scott?” 

He has oily eyes.

I learned how to get my way past this five-pointed dunce hat millennia ago. Regardless you've got your woman's heart or whatever.""

""Marissa will love me then?""

""Well, if she wasn't suddenly dead. Here's her heart though- fun fact- she gave this up to be with that farm hand Todd who works for you. He's hauling a ten-inch snake she was always dreaming of. Peace!"" The devil threw up the peace sign and vanished in a puff of smoke. Marissa's heart sat between the leaves that formed the pentagram just beating slower and slower.

""Thanks for showing me how to play Satan, I'll be back,"" Hank shoved a rag from his back pocket into the kidney sized wound in his chest. He had perhaps ten minutes to seal the wound before he passed out and dies, from blood loss. That beat up old Chevy could make it to the farm in time no doubt about it. Now Hank just had to line up the dominoes of souls for Satan and he'd get what he actually desired, a booming country music career.

"[WP] You summon the devil to sell your soul. He replies ""I've already got millions. What else have you got?""",LakazL,"Fifty miles outside of Atlanta, out by the old crossroads in the woods, a young man sat on an old hickory stump, a violin case rested at his feet. He sat there listening to the sicadas play their tune, while he waited.

The sky grew dark, the scent of sulphur in the air. Out of the nearby woods, a man dressed in a black three peice suit, with a blood red tie, walked into the center of the crossroads. He smiled at the man and said, ""You called?""

The man on the stump stood up, and with a loud grunt, lifted the heavy violin case. He approached the man in the suit and said, ""I am here to trade my soul, for wealth and fame.""

The man in the suit sighed and said, ""Look, I got millions of souls, alright? I don't need anymore, and the place is close to boiling over. Hell, I wouldn't mind selling *you* one, so these dead fucks don't walk the Earth. What else can you offer me? And please, don't say 'my firstborn'.""

The man with the violin case smiled and said, ""About thirty, forty, years ago, my father was here, playing his fiddle. Then, you showed up, over there, right on that ol' hickory stump, and challenged him to a fiddle playing contest, the prize being either his soul or your Golden Fiddle.""

The man in the suit frowned at the man with the violin case. Few outside of Heaven and Hell knew of his humiliating defeat at the hands of Johnny. Those who knew wrote a God damn song about it, though the world thought it was a metaphor or a story.

The man with the suit looked at the case longingly. If this man is indeed Johnny's son, and that is indeed his Golden Fiddle, he must have it back, it was one of his few artifacts he brought with him from Heaven during his fall. 

He stared at the man and said, ""Do not toy with me, boy! If you do indeed have the violin, then we have a deal. Open the case and show me, or I will have you brought down to Hell to burn for insulting me!""

The man with the violin case laid it at his feet, and opened it. Inside, was a fiddle made of solid gold, shining brilliantly. The man in the suit stared in awe as he beheld his old fiddle, it was just as perfect and as pristine he remembered. ""My dear boy,"" he said, ""we have a deal!"" As they shook hands, the young man blacked out...

Edit: Part Two


When he came to, the young man found himself in the penthouse suite of Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. Laying next to him, in the bed, was a beautiful young woman, with hair the colour of gold and cherry red lips. He smiled to himself and looked around, taking in the luxury in which he found himself.

His phone buzzed on the night stand, it was the latest model. He picked up the phone and checked it, four missed calls, one voice mail, and one text. The text was from an unkown number which simply read: ""Tell no one."" The young man snorted in amusement. *Like anyone would believe me*, he thought.

Out of curiosity, he checked his voice mail, it was from his dad. Wondering what his old man had to say, he decided to listen to it: ""Ya stupid son of a bitch! How dare ya fuckin' take my god damn fiddle! And I know ya went down to them fuckin' crossroads. If I find out ya gave that ol' son of a bitch  his fiddle back for somthin' as asinine as 'fame and wealth', I'll fuckin' throttle ya, boy!""

The young man put the phone down, and the woman next to him stirred in her sleep. She blinked and stared at her with deep green eyes, her lips curved into an alluring smile. He returned her smile and embraced her.

The next day, the young man made his way to the airport, the concierge had given him a wake up call, and reminded him of his meeting in LA first thing in the morning. Once he exited his vechile, he was immediately swarmed by paparazzi and fans, all asking questions, all trying to get a peice of him, all snapping photos of him. The young man smiled and carried on, his bodyguard making a hole for him through the crowd.

After checking in, and going through security, he found himself standing in front of his own private jet. His smile widened, he flown a few times, but to do so in luxury had always been out of his reach, until now of course.

As his jet flew over the country, everything seemed to slow down. The scent of sulphur filled the air, and all of a sudden, the man in the black three peice suit appeared, sitting across from him, violin case resting on his lap. ""You enjoying yourself, boy?"" he asked.

The young man nodded. ""Indeed, I am. Thank you,"" he replied.

""You're welcome. I am sorry, with all the excitement of getting my fiddle back, I don't believe I caught your name."" The man in the suit helped himself to some champange, then poured the young man a glass.

""Mike,"" said the young man, taking the glass of champange from the man in the suit, ""my name is Mike.""

The man smiled. ""Pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mike, you may call me Lou."" He finished his champange,  then inspected the glass. ""Tell me, Mike, have you ever wondered what would happen if you crossed the devil?""

Mike shook his head. ""No, sir, never once even occured to me to do so. Wouldn't be wise to make a powerful enemy like that.""

Lou nodded, then he looked Mike in the eye and spoke with a low growl, ""Then where are the original strings of my fiddle? You know, the white ones, made out if angel hair.""

""Arn't they on the fiddle?""

Lou grabbed Mike and slammed his head on the small table in front of him, hard. As he broke the champange bottle by Mike's head, he roared, in a demonic voice: ""If it was on the God damn fiddle, would I be fucking asking, boy? Now tell me, where are the fucking strings?""

Mike started sobbing.  ""I-I don't know. P-please don't kill me! Please!""

Lou growled and released him. He straighted his suit and said, ""I believe you, boy. However, you only gave me half the fiddle, so you only get half of what you asked for. So which do you want to keep more, fame or wealth?""

Mike thought about it, his head throbbing from where Lou had forced it into the table. After a minute, Mike said, ""Fame, I want to keep my fame.""

Lou smiled devilishly, and said, ""Good choice."" He then snapped his fingers, and he was gone, as well as the jet.",JonnyDWritesAgain

"[WP] You summon the devil to sell your soul. He replies ""I've already got millions. What else have you got?""",LakazL,"I had been working on the ritual the past several days. A few months if you count the time it took to translate the language. Being a professor of linguistics, I was able to decipher the cryptic language into meanings. It came as no surprise to me that it was an incantation to summon Satan. The characters of the language took on Gothic themes, like demons, winged beasts, and sadistic caricatures. I found the old book in the dark dungeons of an abandoned cathedral. 

The instructions required me to gather a wide range of resources. A dead rat's tail, holy bible, black widow venom, powdered gold, and virgin's blood. I placed them in the correct order on the cold ground of my basement, forming a circle, and lit the bible in the middle on fire. The flame crackled, sparks flying, and grew to consume the rest of the ingredients, radiating my entire basement.

Then he appeared. A hologram rising from the flames, not much taller than I. With his arms crossed over his broad chest, he said in a deep booming voice ""Why have you summoned me, Human?""

""I want to sell you my sole."" I said confidently and straight to the point.

He gave a sinister cackle. ""I've already got millions.""

I stood before him in the shadows of my basement, unflinching.

""Look, human. You're wasting my time. Accumulate more terrible deeds until the day you die and only then will I consider weighing a value on you.""

And as he started to fade back into the flames from whence he appeared, I shouted ""WAIT!""

He stopped in his descent and peered over his shoulder at me out of the corner of his eye.

""I'll make you an offer you can't refuse."" He contemplated. Then wheeled around to face me, flames dancing with his every movement.

""I'll sell it to you for one point zero zero zero one percent stake in hell.""

Satan eyed me curiously, most likely doing math in his head, or trying to figure out why I'm giving him my soul for such a minuscule amount of his empire, or why I hadn't asked for love, or money, or fame. He knows it's the greatest bargain he's ever been offered. 

I could see the greed in his eyes. ""Take it or leave it."" 

At once, he flew within inches of my face, and with a large menacing smile, said ""DEAL!""

There was a huge flash. As it faded, I stared up at Satan. He looked disgustingly into his right hand, which held something fleshy. 

""What the hell is this?"" and he threw it across the basement, which splattered against the wall and fell with a plop to the ground. He turned back to look at me proudly.

""Stupid human. Don't you know that if I have your soul, it would be as if I owned that stake anyway? I pity you so much I considered giving it to you. Human, bow before me and recite the passage of evil.""

To my relief, I didn't move or speak. However, the bottom of my left foot was in a wrath of pain. I looked at it. The flesh of my sole had been flayed, revealing all the intricacies of human foot anatomy.

You could see the mood change dramatically, as he looked at the fleshy bit on the ground, then back at me, then back at it, then back at me. The flames underneath him burned brighter and redder, flicking intensely. 

""ARRRRGHHHH. HOW DARE YOU, SCHEMING LITTLE HUMAN--""

""Hold it right there! Under the agreement written out in the Hell ownership booklet, you cannot harm another--""

His fist paused in midair. He was shaking uncontrollably, fumes exhaling from his ears like a freight train.

""Now, please hand me my share of one hundred souls.""

[WP] Variety is the spice of death.,Samjez,"*They come to me, those who are too weak and afraid, whose hands are too unsteady to hold a gun, whose arms struggle against the hypnotic pull of water, who never learned how to tie knots strong enough to hold a neck suspended.*

Everyone in our modern world wants to live forever, there are doctors who can extend your life till 130, keeping your body moving with PPM. Drugs, gene therapy for every possible disease, and even if you’re brain dead the life support machines will keep your heart whirring, lungs breathing long after your brain has flatlined, and your body is a husk with its spirit long gone.

There are millions of people there to keep you alive, convince you to keep going when it’s not worth it, counsel you that everything is better than death.

I’m not here to do that.

I am here to help you die.

You email me with the instructions and a price. More money for the risky theatrical deaths, like beheading with a guillotine. Sure, that one was crazy, but hell, variety is the spice of death. I would enjoy setting you on fire but a simple bullet to the chest is much cheaper. I do a 1,000 dollar deal for those ones. I have some special packages for couples on Valentines Day, or singles on Thanksgiving because even I have some sympathy in my heart.

As you’re dying, I’ll look into your eyes one last time and ask if you want this. 

And if you say no?

**You’ll die anyway.**

Death doesn’t really give a damn about your regrets. 

I will help you author your suicide note. Instead of sloppy nonsense, like “I’m sorry 1,500 times” or something written stained with tears, under the influence of vodka, I’ll make sure it says exactly what you want it to say, flowery or teary or succinct.

Why do people come to me?

I don’t know. Maybe it’s because in our world of strugs, “real-time news”, lightning speed connections, everything endlessly offered to you on a sanitized tray of political correctness, death is the only thing that’s real.

**Death is gritty.**

Do you know that you shit yourself as you’re hanging? You also piss yourself too, as your bladder lets go of any crap left in there.  Your body gets cold, muscles tense up in rigor mortis forever. Mouth goes slack, brain hallucinates in the 5 seconds before you head gets chopped up, your throat shaking in a silent scream.

I think jumping off a building is a good way to go. I push you over, your body hangs weightless in air, your mind goes unconscious before you even hit the ground. No fucking pain.

If I ever had to kill myself, I’d do it with the barrel of my gun on a dark night in my living room in a bathrobe and slippers, listening to Frank Sinatra. I’ve stared death in the face before and my fingers won’t fumble on the trigger. 

Death is my lover, we fuck, we go to bed, she’s not there in the morning and I really don’t worry about it, don’t care. We’ve got a type of rhythm going on, we’re both doing our thing, no one needs to get attached.
And that’s how it goes.

I don’t generally fucking like relatives coming in to see me practice my art. And hell, it is an art, just like making good wine, and repairing motorcycles and painting the Sistine Chapel, death is an art.
And I am fucking Michelangelo.

I ignore the salesgirl and take a walk around. I don't want to die yet, but it's good to plan ahead. That's what my father told me, and when he passed, he was happy with the procedure.

""Beef jerky."" For hundreds of yards in every direction, 9mm handguns. Thousands of them. ""Are there any made of, like, plutonium or something dangerous?"" ""Let me show you our newest model.""

[WP] Variety is the spice of death.,Samjez,"Death looked over the scene. An elderly man with a rotund stomach sat in an olive green recliner, gasping. His right hand clutched his chest while his left fumbled, trying to grasp the phone on the coffee table but instead sending it tumbling to the floor. “Another heart attack” Death sighed to himself, as he watched the man slowly succumb to the ventricular fibrillation ravaging his heart, “how original of me”. 

Death eyed an ornate wooden cuckoo clock on the wall, which felt out of place with the rest of the plain décor. It was a grim thing, with dulled paint and morose woodland creatures carved into its façade – “an heirloom perhaps” Death pondered, and looking around speculated vaguely as to which of the smiling faces in the photos would be lucky enough to inherit it. 

Glancing back at the clock, Death felt a wave of relief pass through him – this would be the last he would have time for today. Once he let this old sap pass on, he could take off the robe, go home, and, well, probably do absolutely nothing. But at least he wouldn’t be here. 

Death took a moment to admire how the reddening of the man’s face contrasted with the green of the chair, and as he was doing so wondered when exactly it was that he started to hate his job. 

His early days as an intern were a blur of black death, fatalities during childbirth, and the occasional kick-to-the-head-by-livestock – repetitive, for sure, but he was so busy there was no time to be bored. And then came the golden years – industrialization, wars, the introduction of flight – Death had reached a level of seniority by that time that meant his possibilities for creativity were endless. Death smiled as he remembered some of his greatest – slow death by sewing machine was a memorable one, as were his experimentations with amputation wounds in the great wars. But somewhere between then and now he had lost his passion, lost his drive. What had changed? 

Death considered the last few years, and his downward spiral into monotony. The height of his creativity was now deciding what order to inflict his big three – was it to be stroke, then heart attack, and finally respiratory failure today? Or heart attack, respiratory failure, then stroke? Sure, it made his job easy – he could get through his daily quota with his eyes closed, and even let some passings, such as this one, drag out so he at least looked busy enough to not be delegated more work – but it was a very unfulfilling existence. 

What was he working towards? He had nowhere to progress to, apart from moving into management – Death shuddered at this thought. The idea of leaving the field to join the pencil pushers in the office horrified him more than continuing down his current, tiresome path. So, what? Find a new job? His skill set wasn’t exactly easily transferable. 

No. Death decided then and there to reclaim his passion. He swore to himself he would re-find what it was that once fired his drive for excellence and originality. Starting tomorrow, he wouldn’t repeat the same three deaths – he would try something new every day and be the best Death he could be.

Starting tomorrow.

[WP] Variety is the spice of death.,Samjez,"I trip over another trash can as I make my way up some dimly lit alley. Behind some shitty bar no one's ever heard of. Swaying back and forth, crashing from one side of the narrow walk way to the other I catch myself on an old dumpster.

""This thing smells, but who am I to care? I should be on my way soon."" My thoughts, not making much sense anymore. 

Hanging on with one arm to the corner of the cold metal bin I look upwards. Almost throwing my head back hard enough to see the wall behind me, I focus on the dark spotted sky.

My weight shifts from left to right and I'm losing my grip on my anchor that is the dirty waste container.

"[TT] You have a gift for talking to inanimate objects. Alongside many perks, it makes you an excellent thief... but you only steal things that want to be stolen.",TyrRev,"Even though it seemed to take forever, only about two hours had passed from when I entered the house until I left. That wasn’t too bad. I might even try again in a day or two. Everything had been carefully placed on some old sheets on the basement floor. It didn’t seem like much since the jewelry didn’t take up much space. 

The two pieces of art I had taken were small paintings. They didn’t seem like anything out of the ordinary, really. One was a painting of some flowers and the other was of a young girl. I didn’t take the time to really look at them and I don’t really understand art anyway. They were excited to leave, so I grabbed them on my way out the door. There might have been one or two vases asking to be taken, too, but I would need to plan more for anything larger. 

“Mary,” I asked, addressing the ring, “Who is Lizzie? If you tell me more, I might be able to return you to her.”

“Oh! That would be lovely!” she exclaimed in a cheerful and polished way. “She is my rightful owner. I haven’t seen her in so long, possibly years. I don’t keep time too well, you see.” She continued, “I belonged to dear Lizzie, short for Elizabeth, of course, for many years, after belonging to her mother and her mother before her. My, how long has it been since kind William brought me to his beautiful Emma? How I miss her!”

She paused for a moment as she reflected on her past. I couldn’t tell at this point if she was talking about Lizzie, Emma, or somebody’s mother. I was starting to wonder how old she could possibly be. When I first saw her, I wasn’t sure if she was actually an antique, or was only designed to look like one. I didn’t want to interrupt her. It seemed as if nobody listened to her reminisce like this. 

“To bring matters to the present again, I belong to my dear Elizabeth and would like to see her again, if possible,” Mary seemed to be finished and then added, “No matter the outcome, I owe you my deepest and sincerest gratitude for rescuing me from that. . . that. . . well, a lady of proper breeding does not refer to such women.”

I couldn’t help but chuckle to myself after hearing her words. “You’re quite welcome, Mary” I responded, finding myself copying her formal way of speaking. I had suspected what had happened, but her last sentence solidified it for me. Somehow, Mary, and possibly others, had found themselves caught in a divorce situation. That the new wife found herself with the first wife’s jewelry annoyed me to no end. Based on the house and that jewelry armoire, it was obvious she didn’t need it. I felt even less guilty than I had originally. 

“Mary, did we leave any of your friends behind at the house?” I asked her, determined now.

“Not in the jewelry armoire,” she answered. “There are a few of my friends in a smaller jewelry box in the nightstand, by were you found the wretched bracelet.”

“A ring, two pairs of earrings, and a necklace!” the earrings I had stolen shouted together. “All of the pieces like us live there!”

I looked at the earrings and then the rest of the jewelry. Mary was stunning, as were many of the other pieces I had taken. Their value was completely different, though, than that of the earrings and the bracelet I left behind. It seemed all the most expensive pieces were kept by the bed, while most of the jewelry stayed in the armoire. I shook my head at myself for not realizing it sooner.

“How many pieces are in the nightstand?” I asked the earrings. I wanted to return Lizzie’s pieces, but I still needed to make money from this.

The earrings started to converse with each other. I couldn’t understand what they were saying until suddenly they shouted together, “The whole nightstand is filled! We don’t know how much!”

That’s all I needed to hear. I still had many days before the family returned from vacation. I would plan a second visit with the help from Mary and the other jewelry. Then, I would do something I had never done before, plan a break in to return things.

"[TT] You have a gift for talking to inanimate objects. Alongside many perks, it makes you an excellent thief... but you only steal things that want to be stolen.",TyrRev,"I had been watching this house for months, essentially stalking the family who lived here on social media. I still can’t believe people put everything on there. With all the photos and details they posted, I was able to sketch the entire layout of the house, decide what might be worth taking, and determine the easiest way in and out without being detected. All because I friended someone who was a friend of someone who was a friend of someone else. 

If I took enough from this place, I might be able to stop for a while. I keep thinking each time will be the last, that I don’t need the money. But, the truth is that I like doing it. I only take items that ask to be taken. Most of them I sell. My connections don’t ask where I find things anymore. Years ago, I told them a story about a relative who was a hoarder and that seemed to be enough. Occasionally, I keep things. If I like them and they like me or if they have a good story to tell, I let them stay with me. One or two things I’ve given to my mother. Those objects still thank me.

The kitchen was mostly quiet. The appliances were mumbling, but nothing too loud. They didn’t seem interested in me at all. I made my way through the first floor to the stairs. The bedrooms were up there and so, most likely, was all the jewelry. The family consisted of an older man, two children, and a young wife. I stopped in the son’s room first and looked around.

There were electronics everywhere and they started shouting at me.

“Do you want to play?”

“No! No! Watch a movie!”

“Don’t do that! Listen to music instead!”

I laughed softly and responded back, “I’m wondering if any of you would like to come with me. I’m a thief, you know.” They responded with silence. This was usually the case. Some things would be desperate to leave, some hopelessly devoted to their owner. Most were indifferent. I knew I had time and figured I’d give them a moment. 

“I think we’re happy here,” the stereo finally responded in a calm manner, neither excited nor upset. His response started some murmuring amongst the other electronics. I couldn’t understand any of what they were saying, there were so many video games talking all at once.

“Shhhhh!” the stereo commanded. I wondered if the deep booming voice that I heard was how the others heard him as well. He sighed. “You need to speak with Mary,” he stated finally. “She’s in the master bedroom.” Everyone murmured their agreement. 

“Thank you,” I replied. “I will find her.”

Even though the house was large, almost a mansion, it was easy to find the master bedroom. I had memorized the layout when I knew I would come here. As soon as I walked into the bedroom, the voices started again. I decided to stop them immediately and asked, “Where is Mary? I was told I should speak with her.”

The murmuring stated again and I started to wonder how much they all gossiped on a regular basis. A diamond bracelet on the nightstand finally started to shout over the rest of them. “She’s in the jewelry armoire by the photographs. I wouldn’t bother talking to her, though, she hates almost everyone.”

Now, I was even more eager to meet this Mary. “Thank you for your help,” I replied to the bracelet. Looking at her more carefully, I realized she was probably worth thousands. “By any chance, would you like to come with me?” 

“Whatever for?” she responded huffily, “What would you do with me? It’s not like you’d wear me or something! No, I am extremely happy with Amanda. I think I’m her favorite, actually!”

Suddenly, I could hear a commotion from the aforementioned jewelry armoire. It seemed at least a few other pieces disagreed. The diamond earrings next to the bracelet were among them.

“Take us! Take us!” they chimed together. 

I smiled at them and asked, “Are you sure?”

“Totally!” they replied together again. 

“Thank you, then,” I replied as I slipped them into my bag. I wandered over to the armoire while the bracelet was still complaining about the earrings. I took a deep breath and opened all the doors and drawers quickly. I was excited, the thousands of dollars’ worth of diamonds sitting on the nightstand made me breathless at the possibilities here. 

“I’m Mary,” I heard suddenly from the top of the armoire. I walked a little closer and peered at the felt lined fabric. Among the countless modern looking pieces, one caught my eye. Perhaps it was because she was suddenly talking to me again. Perhaps not.

“I’m Mary,” a beautiful old looking emerald, diamond, and gold ring said quietly but firmly. Her voice even sounded old, especially surrounded by all the young voices of the new jewelry.

“I heard you might want to talk with me,” I started, unsure of how to approach this. “I’m a thief, but I try to only take things that are willing.” I had decided being honest and brief might be the best here.

“I’ll happily go with you, young man,” Mary responded, reminding me too much of my grandmother. “However, I’ll only do so on the condition you return me to my dear Lizzie.”

How was I supposed to respond to that? I tried to speak and started stuttering instead. I looked around and realized I should probably be a little faster about this. I had plenty of time overall, but I’m not a fan of hanging around asking to be caught. 

Before I could reply, Mary spoke again, “On second thought, you may take me regardless of your decision. I would love to see my dear Lizzie again, but to be able to escape that woman is my greatest desire. Add me to your collection now and be quick about it!”

I didn’t need to be told twice. I carefully scooped her from the delicate black lining and focused on each piece of jewelry nearby. I needed to encourage them to be quick about their decisions.

“Just let me know if you want to come, yes or no,” I said authoritatively. “We can talk about why you want to come later.” I had never had so many pieces trying to talk to me at once. With this much jewelry, I could see how they might not be worn that often. Maybe they were bored. I was happy to help, if that was the case. 

Finally, I had found my rhythm. I managed to fill my bag quickly with expensive jewelry and a few small art pieces from the living room that seemed to share Mary’s desire to escape. It was going to be an interesting evening when I unpacked at home.

[WP] Your decision not to buy a chewing gum at the grocery store causes a series of events that lead to global economic collapse.,Weyzza,"A man decided not to purchase gum one day.

As he was checking out, the man behind him bought a pack of gum.

The man behind him, as it turns out, bought the supermarket's 1,000,000 pack of gum.

He was given a $10,000 prize for doing so.

Later the gum-man, being prudent financially, set up an investing account with those 10 grand.

The man's wife, being less than prudent, put all the money into a canned sandwich company her girlfriends had told her about.

The man sighed deeply.

The canned sandwich company took off, and the man and his entire family were now a new financial dynasty.

The family invests significantly in a new startup; bonsai kittens.

Several generations later, John D. Cannedsandwichfeller was driving his sandwich-patterned Rolls Royce, when he ran over a homeless man.

The homeless man sued him for all John was worth.

They Cannedsandwichfellers had to file for bankruptcy, and sell off all their assets.

Monsanto purchased all of their shares in Bonsai Kittens LLC.

Lo and behold, the combined scientific prowess of Monsanto and Bonsai Kittens LLC. manage to produce bonsai kittens; small, furry, and adorable.

The small size of the bonsai kitten means it reproduces at an alarming rate.

Their intense adorability means that no human can resist the urge to care for it.

As the tidal wave of bonsai kittens surges over all the continents, human everywhere each become the caretakers of one or two kittens.

One or two quickly becomes fifty or sixty.

Fifty or sixty becomes eighty seven thousand, two hundred ninety three and three quarters (One is even smaller and more adorable than the rest).

With over eighty seven thousand tiny mouths to feed, every human on earth depletes both their food stores and their bank accounts in a futile attempt to feed the kittens.

All humanity is now doomed.

[WP] Your decision not to buy a chewing gum at the grocery store causes a series of events that lead to global economic collapse.,Weyzza,"I saw the Food4Less sale - closing down, everything had to go. They marked everything down by an astonishing 99%.

As I took all the valuable food and rushed to the counter - there was a gum on sale for only $0.01. 

My cart was full - and since I was exporting my goods to Singapore, I could have been arrested for bringing it. I decided not to buy that gum, as it had an extremely low resell value anyways.

The man behind me had other intentions, and snatched the one-cent gum as soon as he could reach it.

I slowly watched him as I was unloading my cart - he snatched it into his mouth as soon as possible.

Turns out - he was allergic to that flavor.

His face was as purple as an eggplant - I rushed to call 911 to tell them a man across the street has a terrible allergy to a gum, and was on the verge of dying in front of my eyes.

The ambulance came - I received their permission to come inside, and the man was told he was going to die - his allergic reaction was so severe that his liver ceased to exist. He had one last hope - an experimental bowl of medicine.

The doctors knew nothing about this medicine, except that it was able to slightly stop extreme allergies. The man was desperate - and asked to try it out.

Even the ambulance driver came and looked.

The man seemingly was fine after taking the medicine. It was almost as if he was fully alive.

Then, the ambulance crashed - as a result of the driver looking over the patient.

Fire was smothering the ambulance - experimental acid leaked over and through the man - surgical knives fell and attacked him, as I desperately tried to escape.

The man was smothered in acid, and knives flew all over him - yet he was perfectly fine.

I knew it - _everyone_ knew it - the medicine had made the man immortal.

News stations were covering it everywhere - how this magical medicine made people immortal. Nothing could make them die, nor injured.

The engineers were smarter than that - they spiked the price of the medicine to $2,000,000 for one teaspoon. Of course, they made payments available in one way - ""cash only.""

People were desperate to become immortal - stealing from banks, selling all of their stocks - blowing investment and investment for this seemingly magical drink.

The stock market crashed - the medical industry booming, and everything else plummeting to their death. Billionaire after billionaires filed for bankruptcy - their investments no longer mattered.

I knew that money was becoming completely concentrated to the engineers behind the medicine - until one night, where the manager decided to take a sip of wine.

As I peeped through the window, I knew the manager became drunk - completely insane, and overnight, I saw him throw all the money they had into their fireplace.

Because I decided to skip over that gum - I had doomed the economy forever.

• Person was last in that day.
• Gum had to be discarded and re-stocked.
• Titular gum was mistakenly stacked in the bread container being shipped off to landfill.
• Container spilled with mostly harmless contents in a suburban town so bread was thrown into lake for feeding the ducks there.
• One duck choked on gum, and complaints were made to the bread company and the disposal company
• The magnate owning both companies hid the complaints for three years, when a reporter stumbled upon the old files and decided for that reason to continue digging - leading to the revelations that the company had been silencing complaints for the past ten years, and achieved this through ties to a mafia.
• Reporter gathered a following on the Internet and was a leader in a fight to boycott and bankrupt the company.
• The campaign was very successful especially after local police arrested or killed all known members of mafia. 
• Hidden mastermind in mafia who had damning information on mayor of the area used the threat of the evidence to force him to lower the police force's budget.

He stood in the shadows, by the wall and concealed by high shrubs.  She would come this way.  She was a creature of habit.  She would pass this very spot at exactly 10:05 each Thursday night.  Only tonight, she would not pass by.  

He heard her footsteps approaching on the concrete of the sidewalk.  His ears were attuned to every sets so that he knew the exact moment to reach out.  His arm snaked expertly around her neck clamping a hand over her mouth as his other arm went in front of her waist to gain purchase and pull her to him.

He adjusted his grip to one of the most well known moves in martial arts or wrestling--the rear naked choke, or the sleeper.  She was out in seconds.  In his trunk in minutes.  In an hour, they were far from the university.  

Last Thursday, to a different girl, he had given life, though she would never know from whom it came.  Tonight, he would take life away.  After all, isn't that what gods do?

She turned, quizzical. ""What are you talking about, honey?"" The imposter had the mannerisms down to the finest movements. Smile lines bloomed, the eyebrows bounced ever-so-slightly.

""I- I can see that you're wearing a skin suit.""

The blooming faded as her hand brushed her hairline. ""Oh, dear, you know I had surgery only a few weeks ago. You remember that, don't you?""

Of course she did! That's embarrassing. Of course she did. The kitchen faded to black.

""Good. When's Dad coming home, again?"" I slouched to take a nap on my arm. Mum turned, frowning. 

""Honey, are you okay? Dad passed - you know, Dad passed away last year,"" she said quietly.

It seemed like such a terrible thing to forget. His presence was always just around the corner, though. The whole thing never really hit the way it was supposed to. The kitchen faded to black.

Mum stood over the sink, drying the bubbles off her forearms. She whistled a familiar tune.

"[WP] You are aware that it is an impostor in the kitchen wearing your mother's skin, you can see the crimson stitching on the back of her neck.",lapike,"Mommy never really cared  
What I had to say  
She preferred the quiet and  
Whenever I went away  

She would say the meanest things  
Or I would be ignored  
Or she would make me stand for hours  
If I said I was bored  

She told me Daddy left us  
Because he hated me  
And that she stayed because she had to  
Not because she loved me  

For Christmas last year I wrote Santa  
And asked for a new mom  
I waited and I waited still  
Each day, in winter's calm  

My letter went unanswered  
And Mommy became worse  
Sometimes she'd hit me with a spoon  
Sometimes she'd only curse  

I cried and cried and nothing changed  
Until my birthday came  
That morning Mommy sat me down  
And asked ""What is your name?""  

I did not know what to say  
I thought it was a game  
A mean trick that Mommy sometimes did  
Where she would ask my name  

And if I answered with the truth  
She would say that I was wrong  
She would say ""Your name is Mistake  
And here you don't belong""  

So when my mother asked me then  
I was too afraid to speak  
All I did was cry a little  
And between the tears, I squeaked  

But Mommy pulled me in her arms  
And said ""Oh, please don't cry!  
It's your birthday, your special day!""  
And she set me down with a sigh  

""No more tears, little button,   
Your present is here, though it came a little late  
I hope it's ok for your birthday  
Instead of Christmas, to compensate.""  

I didn't really understand   
And when she turned around  
I saw little red marks down her neck  
That disappeared beneath her gown  

I'd seen such marks on my old clothes  
Where the fabric had sometimes split  
And thread and needle had closed the seam  
And stitches held the knit  

I wanted to be scared  
But suddenly Mommy was so nice  
She made me yummy chocolate cake  
And she sang Happy Birthday twice  

And from my birthday forward  
Never again was Mommy mean  
And though I rarely remember to look  
Sometimes the stitches can still be seen.  ",Purrkele
"[WP] You are aware that it is an impostor in the kitchen wearing your mother's skin, you can see the crimson stitching on the back of her neck.",lapike,"The first clue had been the smell.

The thing wearing your mother's skin didn't smell BAD per se, it just didn't smell like your mother. It used her perfume and her shampoos, but that underlying element that defined your mother from every other person who used those same products was gone. It was replaced by something musky and dark, and you were always looking at the imposter's hands expecting to find fresh earth in the beds of it's finger nails. It's hands were always immaculately clean though, pure and white.

----------------------

The imposter didn't like the same food as your mother.

""Peach crumble? Oh no thank you, I prefer blueberry.""

She left you standing in the kitchen with the warm dish still in your hands, your eyes following after her with confusion. That is when you had caught the first flash of red half hidden beneath the collar of her brightly colored sundress. With that initial glimpse you had thought she had gotten a scratch, or possibly even a small bug bite exactly in the middle of her spine. Exactly.

-------------------------

They were small, delicate stitches.

You were sure now. You'd been taking every opportunity to investigate in the past three days, positioning yourself behind her back whenever possible, which unfortunately wasn't often. She'd been leaning over to water a plant though when she had reached up to scratch the small red lines, pushing aside the collar of her shirt to reach the itch better. It was though someone had sewn up the back of a stage costume to keep the actor inside. You knew then that what your gut had been telling you was right.

She had turned around in that moment and caught the look of disgust and curiosity on your face. Something like rage and suspicion had flickered in her eyes before she was back to her gracious, smiling self as she set down the watering can.

""Why don't we bake a cake today? You like chocolate, right?""

You hate cake.

--------------------------------------------------

""It's too hot outside today, won't you just stay inside with me a little longer?""

The thing that used your mother's voice led you away from the door by your arm, the grip meant to be comforting but far too tight and vice-like to be gentle. You hadn't been outside in over ten days. Every time you tried to leave, or asked to go somewhere there was a reason not to, or something urgent here at the house. Once you had tried to sneak out in the middle of the night, only to find her standing in the middle of the living room as still as a statue.

She didn't sleep.

----------------------------------------

""Are you alright, sweetheart?""

You snap out of your reverie as she addresses you where you stood in the doorway as she tidies the kitchen table and prepares to begin dinner.

""I don't feel well."" You say mechanically, your hands in your pockets to hide their trembling.

""Oh! You poor thing. Come here and let me kiss it better, won't you?""

Her words are too sweet, too eager but you close the distance between you and the imposter anyway. She opens her arms wide to embrace you, greedy need fighting to hide itself in the depths of her eyes as she beckons you closer. Her arms close around you a little too quickly, and a little too tightly as she pulls you into her. She's so cold, but your arms snake up to wrap around her neck as you fight to suppress the shudder building within you.

""You'll feel better soon. Don't you worry.""

She croons this into your ear and you have to grit your teeth to stop from screaming. As you fight back the terror you steady your voice to reply;

""I know.""

"[WP] You are aware that it is an impostor in the kitchen wearing your mother's skin, you can see the crimson stitching on the back of her neck.",lapike,"I knew something wasn't quite right before I first saw IT but as sensible people are prone to do, I ignored it. I had come home to my mother's house for Thanksgiving, a day before Tracey and the kids would get here. The smell of home cooking wafted from the kitchen. It smelled delicious and therein lied the problem. My mother was not a good cook. Growing up, I had cooked most of the meals in our house as my mother had supported the both of us by working two jobs after my father abandoned us. It was probably what inspired me to become a professional chef. Still, I shoved it to the back of my mind. I wasn't here anymore to cook her meals for her, maybe she had taken that chance to finally learn. 

""Mom, it's me James."" I shouted out.

 She came out of the kitchen, looking beautiful. Too beautiful, in fact. My mother always looked a little disheveled and she wore little to no makeup, something I'd come to associate with her. But now my mother's hair was completely made up and she was caked in the most amount of makeup she could be before looking trashy. And was it my imagination, or was she several pounds thinner than the last time I skyped with her a week ago. Again, I shoved it to the back of my mind. Maybe with retirement, she had decided to look after her appearance. 

""Tracey and the kids should be here tomorrow. The kids don't get out of school until tomorrow unfortunately."" 

She looked at me with a quizzical and calculating look before snapping into a big smile. 
""Of course, of course, how are my adorable grandchildren?"" That at least was normal, my mother doted on my six year old twins. 

""Very well, thank you. They're in the highest percentage of their class and I think Lainey has some strong artistic talent."" I couldn't help but brag a little. 

""And how is that beautiful wife of yours doing?"" she asked.

That was the sentence that shook me to my core. The moment I could no longer ignore my instincts. I'm gay. Tracey is my husband. My mother would know that, she was the first person I came out to. I still remember how she would hold me tight and comfort me when the other teenaged boys had laughed and hit me and called me faggot. She was the one who married the two of us when we decided to forgo a priest. There is now way my mother wouldn't know that. But I decided to play along. 

""Also very well, thank you for asking. So what's cooking?"" 

""Turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, apple pie. That's what people eat this time of year."" 

She turned around and that's when I saw it. Crimson stitching on the back of her neck. This thing was wearing my mother's skin. I thought about calling the police but who would believe me. This thing looked exactly like my mother; more or less anyways. I followed her into the kitchen, 

""How is Dad? How's his trip to Africa going?"" 

""Your father? Yes, of course, your father is doing very well. Very well, indeed."" 

""That's good to hear."" I looked throughout the kitchen, looking for anything I could use as a weapon. I grabbed a sharp knife from off my counter and put it behind my back. I sighed and attacked. 

---

I pulled up right next to my mother-in-law's house. Jack and Lainey were roaring to get out and almost as soon as the car stopped, they were out and shouting, ""Grandma,"" and ""Daddy!"" 
James greeted us at the door, taking both of the kids into his arms and hugged them tight. He let them go. 
""Your grandmother has cooked us a great meal. Get inside and get washed."" 

I went in for a kiss but he looked at me oddly. 
""And who are you? Do you know where my wife Tracey is?"" 

""Your wife Tracey? I'm your husband Tracey."" He looked uneasy for a second as if processing new information. Suddenly, he laughed. 

""Of course I know who you are, darling. I'm just joking around. Come into the house."" He turned around and shouted, 

""Hey, mom. My kids and my *husband* Tracey are here."" I ignored him as I looked in horror at the crimson stitching on the back of his neck. ",RealityWanderer

"[WP] You are aware that it is an impostor in the kitchen wearing your mother's skin, you can see the crimson stitching on the back of her neck.",lapike,"Her nose was broken the night before, and when morning came her pillow was heavy with blood and stuck to her face.  As she climbed out of bed, the girl revealed a physique like a spider short four limbs.  Her belly was distended like the abdomen, her limbs spindly and frail beside it.  Noiselessly, she crept through the filth surrounding her bed.  Old diapers that had clung to her too long before being changed littered the floor as thickly as their stench hung in the air.  Baby bottles lined her dresser, some half-full of curdled milk that even her most desperate hunger couldn’t bring her to touch.  She stared up at them, gurgled something unintelligible, then toddled toward the door and reached for the knob.  Once she’d gotten tall enough to reach it, she’d also been able to escape her room, but that limited amount of freedom had lasted only two or three days before the door stopped moving even when she twisted the knob and pushed on it as hard as she could.

Today it swung open freely on a battered, creaking hinge.  As it did, she stood naked beneath the frame and strained to hear.  Most mornings she heard nothing but the sound of snoring from downstairs.  Now, she heard the running of water and the clinking of dishes and cutlery.  Though her nostrils were clogged with blood and mucus, she could smell the scent of vanilla slowly and insistently making its way up the stairs.  A sharp pang of hunger stabbed her in the guts, and she began making her way to the top of the stairs.  Small, chubby hands grasped at the bannister, and she carefully made her way down one step at a time.  When she reached the bottom, it took several moments for her to process the changes that her environment had undergone.

Firstly, the house was clean.  The stink of garbage was absent, and she no longer had to step over or around all manner of indescribable filth to make her way to the kitchen.  As she did, her right hand fell to her hip, and she gripped reflexively at the nothing where the tattered blanket she could no longer find was usually held.  She was cautious as she crept around the kitchen island, no longer stacked halfway to the ceiling with dishes that were covered in mold and rot.  Her mother stood in front of the stove, and at the sound of the girl’s footsteps, turned from it, faced her, and smiled.

She said, “You look pretty, mommy.”  It was an understatement, considering the transformation the woman had undergone, but a child’s mind wasn’t capable of quantifying all of the details.  The woman’s dirty blond hair was no longer a tangled bird’s nest atop her head, but fell to the small of her back in a neat braid.  Skin that had been dry, covered in sores and bruises, now practically glowed with health.  Normally, she wore grease-stained sweats and a ratty cotton tee, both holey from cigarette burns.  Today, she wore a dress.

It was in her eyes that the biggest change had taken place, however.  For as long as the girl could remember, they were bloodshot and glazed.  Now, they were sharp and alert, and as the woman looked at the child there was some strange, foreign intelligence in them.  Analytical in nature, and keen as the edge of a scalpel.  Wordlessly, the woman lifted her up beneath her arms and studied her face, her expression slowly changing to one of concern.  She sat the girl on the counter and began washing the blood off of her face.  She bathed her in the sink, then carried her into the living room, sat her in the high chair, and fed her the first real meal she’d eaten in days.

Within a week, the girl’s environment had changed completely.  The strange men that came over and smoked from glass pipes no longer showed up.  No one hit her anymore, or touched her where she didn’t want to be touched.  She didn’t have to wear diapers anymore, because she’d been taught to use the big girl potty, which she did with almost alarming frequency now that she was eating regularly instead of once every couple of days.  The child didn’t know why things had changed, only that she was happy they had.

She began speaking again, and the first thing she said was, “You have a boo boo on your neck.”

“What’s that, baby?”

The toddler slapped at the back of her own neck with chubby fingers demonstratively.  Her mother raised her hand to the same place on her own neck, feeling along the stitching with her fingertips.  Her eyes took on the same look they had that morning in the kitchen, and she lowered her hand.  They watched each other in silence while cartoons banged and bonked on television, then the girl turned and plodded out of the living room.  She returned a few minutes later with a length of lacy cloth in her hand, one of the items the two of them had used when playing dress-up a few days before.  She held it up, and the woman leaned over to take it.

Her movements became unnatural.  Her digits played over the cloth with insectoid fluidity, like ten antennae sniffing out potential danger.  Slowly, she knelt down and looped it over her head, then tied it loosely like a scarf.  Their eyes met again.

“Thank you, baby.  It’s pretty.  Maybe I’ll wear it all day.  Maybe even every day.  What do you think?”

The girl smiled, then raised her arms to be picked up.",fuheyu

I felt like shit. The aftermath of a night of too many margaritas had kicked in, my head throbbing, my eyes feeling like they wanted to burst from my head. I threw the damp covers off and started tugging my shirt to fan my sweaty body. I needed a cold beer. Now. 

I hobbled into the kitchen where my mom standing over the sink with the water running. She was... singing? 

""That's weird,"" I thought. Mom had been depressed for years. Rarely out of bed before me and I don't think I had ever heard her... singing. 

I tries to sneak into the fridge without making too much noise. I didn't really feel like talking. Especially if she was in a good mood. No thanks. 

As I was trying to slink behind her my foot bumped into the kitchen stool. A surge of pain surged through my pinky toe and up my leg. ""OW!"" I couldn't help but yell out, ""God dammit! Fucking cunt stool."" 

My mom simply turned her head, smiled and said to me ""Good morning, dear."" Then she returned to her task in the sink. 

""That's weird,"" I thought again. Mom doesn't, um, say good morning. Ever. Maybe she's high. Maybe she has a new boyfriend. Maybe she's found Jesus. The possibilities raced through my head but none seemed to fit. 

""Uh. Hi, mom."" 

I looked over at her, confused and bewildered. On the back of her neck, it looked like she was... bleeding? ""Hey, mom..."" I started to tell her but paused. I leaned closer and saw, was that stitching on the back of her neck? The stitching was in her skin and it ran all the way down into her shirt. 

Now, I know this sounds crazy and I even doubted my still drunk and hungover self but... I could have sworn it was my mother's SKIN stitched up and being worn by a foreign body. My gut told me in that instant, ""This is not my mom."" Fear started crawling out from the pit in my stomach and radiating in electrical shocks through my arms and legs. Part of me felt like running but I was stuck in place by fear. I didn't know what to do. ""I'm crazy"" I thought. ""This is it, I've finally tipped over the edge. I need to stop drinking. I'm absolutely full blown, bat shit crazy."" But my gut kept of tugging at me saying ""This is not my mom. This is not my mom."" 

I decided to test it. 

""Uh, mom? Could... could I, um, borrow $20 dollars."" 

Silence hung in the air for about 10 seconds. Then she rotated her head over to look at me, still smiling. 

""Sure, honey. Whatever you need."" 

""This is not my mom. This is not my mom. This is not my mom."" The words raced through my head, growing louder and louder. I knew it with finality then in that moment that this was NOT my mom. 

What do I do? 

This person, this imposter was still standing over the sink, water running, hands cleaning off something. I felt sick. What is this person doing? And where is my mom? What should I do? 

I sucked in my breath and took a step forward to peer into the sink...

"[WP] You are aware that it is an impostor in the kitchen wearing your mother's skin, you can see the crimson stitching on the back of her neck.",lapike,"The air in the kitchen was crisp, it felt like I was entering a freezer. I looked towards my mother standing at the stove, cooking in a t-shirt with her brown ponytail lying softly on her neck. I could hear the stirring of a wooden spoon on a frying pan in front of her, and smell some something delicious and new in the kitchen.

Still, the cold bothered me, and I had always been better with the cold than my mother, which was why even in the summer she would often sport her sweaters out, and try to laugh off the jokes about the temperature. But here she stood. Cooking in the cold, must have been laundry day.

“Hey Mom.” I said, dropping my backpack at the table I walked over to her at the stove. “Want me to grab you a jacket? How was your day?”

She remained with her back to me until I was nearly at the stove top. Then, as I neared she wiped around quickly with a smile on her face, but as she did I caught  a glimpse of something on the back of her neck.

“No thanks sweetie!” She gave me a peck on the cheek. “I’m just finishing up this stir fry. I thought I’d try something new. Can you set the table?”
“Sure thing.” I turned and started towards the cupboard cabinet and started to open it. 

As I was pulling out the kitchenware I started to look back more carefully at my mom. She seemed to be acting normally, but with slight delays. Her movements were at the right speed just… later than I had expected. It didn’t make much sense. 

Thursday nights were normally veggie night to. As in pasta’s pizza’s, salads, just nothing meat based. But all I could smell was the the meat mixing up in the stir fry. 

As I sat myself at the table I was staring at my Mom’s back again, and I saw from just to the side of her ponytail, a slice maybe two inches long, and fresh stitching. She wasn’t telling me something. I felt as my skin temperature met the cool room, and I began a cold sweat. This was not right.

“All done!” She piped, and her voice did resolve some of my unease. She had always been one to tell me things on her own terms, often over dinner any way. SO as she turned and walked towards the table I did my best to push the stitching from my mind.

“Hope you don’t mind a full plate. I overcooked a bit.” She began to push the stir fry onto my plate with the wooden spoon, and I knew I wouldn’t mind. The entire thing looked so delicious.

“Well don’t wait for me! Dig on in!” My mom said as she began to sit down across from me. I picked up the fork but just the the doorbell began to ring.

“Don’t worry sweetie, I’ll get it. You just eat.”

“Nonsense Mom. You cooked. I’ll get it.” I placed down my fork and walked up to the door way. 

As I turned back to my mom while leaving the room she sat perfectly straight, and I saw a slight glimmer from near the cut on her neck. Looking closer I saw, what looked like a chrome microscopically thin spider leg, sticking out about eight inches from her neck, removing the hair elastic holding up her hair.",1234ross

Showtime. 

A quick message to Greg and everything was set. I knew Dad’s schedule, after such a long day at the office he’d be on autopilot. A zombie in a grey suit. If we were going to do it, it would have to be now.

I slipped out of my room, careful to keep the noise to a minimum. I needed to keep things on track. No distractions. 

Into the house he stepped, briefcase in hand and eyes drooping, five o'clock shadow clinging to his cheeks. Life returned to him briefly when he smelled the aroma of roast chicken permeating the house. Greg had slaved away for weeks mastering its preparation as well as a number of side dishes. All for tonight. 

Dad’s entrance had been choreographed to a T. In my mind I envisioned dad heading to the kitchen to investigate. Roast chicken was out of the norm in a house where pork chops prevailed, so dad would, of course, be intrigued enough to follow his nose and his empty stomach to the source. 

Right on schedule he dropped his briefcase by the door and drifted down the hall, a sappy smile on his face. I slid down the banister and watched him from the landing. Waiting until he disappeared into the kitchen before moving to the doorway to listen. 

The plan was working thus far but it was now time for the hardest part. 

“You made chicken?” my dad said. “You never make chicken. What’s the occasion?”

Now for Greg’s line. “I just felt like a change, is all,” he said, while I mouthed the words along with him. I heard the clatter of a pot being set down on the stove and the click of my mom’s heeled shoes as she walked around the table to greet my dad. This was the part Greg had been most anxious about. He did not want to kiss my dad, but I convinced him that sacrifices had to be made. He had to play the role perfectly or everything would be bust. 

There was the slight rustle of clothing as they embraced and I dared to peek around the corner to make sure. Good Greg, good. Now finish it. 

“There’s something I want to ask you before we eat,” he said, no nervousness apparent. 

“Oh?” 

“Christopher mentioned that he’d like to go see that Trooper concert that’s coming up in a few week,” this line was very mom. The band was actually called Tripper. 

“I think it would be a good idea to let him go, he’s been very responsible these days.”  I had made sure to be responsible, just as he said, but not too responsible. The occasion batch of dishes had to remain unwashed, lest I arouse suspicion. 


Silence, this was it. Close to a month of planning hinged on this moment…

“Yea, Ok. I don’t see a problem with it,” said my dad.

 I celebrated as silently as I could, the happy dance I was prone to made an appearance as well. 

Now all he had to do was employ our exit strategy and we’d be golden. Dad would be so tired  that he’d forget about this encounter until the night Greg and I left for the concert. That when  another plan would come into play to handle any confusion that might pop up.

“I’m sure Christopher will be thrilled, he’s been bugging me about it for weeks now. Thanks honey,” said Greg. 

“You’re welcome.” I watched as my dad leaned in for another kiss, putting a guiding hand on Greg’s neck. 

He stooped halfway, hand fumbling about under Greg's wig. “What’s this?” he said, puzzled at whatever he had felt. 

My heart dropped. The seam! He had forgotten to close it. Dammit Greg!

"[WP] One day, a man finds a note labeled ""663990"", And after finding it, is endlessly pursued by the government.",mitga5,"	When the black bag that had been over Edgar’s head was lifted he adjusted his eyes to the contrasting dim light of the room against that which shined through the short windows set in the white walls of the long capsular space.  He was sitting on a long tan leather bench set against a sleek white wall.  Seated in a plush brown leather chair across the narrow carpeted space a large Asian man was busying himself by pointing a 9mm at Edgar.  The silver-haired man who had removed the bag from Edgar’s head seated himself in a similar recliner on the same side as the gunman.  They both wore dark suits.
	“Relax Edgar, we’re friends.”  The silver haired man cooed.
	“Really?”  Edgar questioned as he tested the restraints keeping his hands together at the wrists behind his back.  “Then care to tell me just what the hell is going on?”
	“You’ve likely been exposed a type of nanite.”  The man paused.  “The nanites burrow into your body though your skin and make their way to your bloodstream and ultimately into your brain.  Once there they will create synapses with your brain and begin to send and receive information as they sync themselves to you.  It’s a military project that was designed to heighten soldiers senses in combat, acquire targets and gives the host access to a wealth of information to aid in any unforeseen circumstances.”
	“Kind of like Innerspace?”  Edgar asked.
	“Have you ever hotwired a car Edgar?” Edgar shook his head.  “By the end of the day you should have little trouble doing so if you so much as think about it.  Your thoughts will activate the nanites and they will show you how to do so as the situation unfolds.  The project is still in the developmental phase and I am unsure how it will interact with your mind.  Many of the other trials reported necessary wires lighting up during a task, directions as to which way to move a lock pick or indications to the maximum speed at which to take a turn.”
	The man motioned to his bodyguard who then holstered his weapon and removed Edgar’s restraints.
	“That piece of paper you found, the one marked 663990 do you still have it?”  Edgar reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled the folded paper out.  The silver-haired man unfolded the paper to expose its blank surfaces.  “The numbers were made up of the nanites, they must be in your bloodstream already.”
	“If you’re here to help me, why the cloak-and-dagger routine?”
	“We weren’t sure how far along the nanite synchronization in your body was.  When it is complete you could potentially have freed yourself from your current situation before I could explain it to you.”
	“Then why are you helping me?”
	“The nanites are my creation.”
	Before Edgar could form his next question the cabin rocked violently.  The air became turbulent and Edgar’s ears popped and suddenly he became aware that he was at forty-one thousand feet, and dropping.  The cabin rolled taking all three men tumbling to the ceiling.  Edgar landed on the now unconscious bodyguard and pulled the 9mm from his suit jacket as he did.  He stared at the gun suddenly in his hand.  A sudden awareness of the safety mechanism came over Edgar and he switched it on.  The thought of what to do next brought a flood of ideas on how a G6 jet works as well as the most likely place to find a parachute.  The plane spun sending the limp body of the bodyguard as well as the silver-haired man rolling along the walls to the intended floor.
	Edgar worked his way to the front of the cabin and affixed a parachute to his back from a compartment near the boarding door.  He glimpsed out the window and saw the starboard wing had been reduced to a smoldering nub.  He released the safety latches on the door and was flung into the whipping sky. Edgar looked back to the plane as it plummeted towards an ocean that stretched in every direction.

[WP] You are surveying for a new moon base when you encounter a man in a three-piece checking a pocket watch.,mrzbot,"Another day and we would have communications across the entirety of the moon. The darkside of the moon was a new frontier. No one had dare come here relating to the risks of mortality. I was crossing this absence in the new model H.T.U (Heated-Transfer-Unit.) I had set down every single node necessary for wrapping the moon in the new information structure. Not only would this connect the many nations of moon, but also take care of a solid line signal to earth. The global community decided it was time to harness the full potential of the power that was exerted on the moon. 

*Two-days Ago*

            Luna Clearance 57693-43: Orbital clearance for Shuttle: Gravity 

     Cap. Hudson: Matching shuttle velocity to current moon rotation. Hardwire prepped for release after path set for re-ignition. 

     Lt. Reese: Tether is set and ready for Hardwire down here captain. Ready to connect when released. 

     Cap. Hudson: Path set. Ignition imminent. Releasing Hardwire. You have one hour to connect the tether to the Hardwire before we re-ignite to make the trip back to earth. 

     Lt.Reese: Understood. 

__________________________________________

Gravity should be back to earth by the time I see the sun again. I'm almost there.  I can feel the sunshine from here. This H.T.U. was extravagant, it had kept  warm without a week from the sun. A most extraordinary feat for the new solar powered batteries. With the new Hardwire running from the moon to earth it was hard not imagining never running out of power. We could launch rockets much better up here. With the unlimited power of this new technology harvesting the moon's gravitational waves, space exploration would become commonplace.

The H.T.U came on to some steep ground. I had to reduce the throttle and slowly creep up the ridge. As I crossed the threshold of the last dark crater and finally saw the Sun in all of its glory. The front of the vehicle started setting down. I panicked seeing something through my visor.

A green checkered shirt, yellow flanneled pants, and a black button up shirt. He was just standing there at the bottom of the peak. I quickly tried to re-adjust my weight on the H.T.U. to set it down before I crushed this impossibility. I could swear he was looking at an old fashioned pocket watch. My souped up land rover kicked up a low shower of moon dust as it landed to the side of this strange hallucination. I checked my communications, the brains back at headquarters told me that this might happen. Ready to report in any side effects that had occurred on the dark side of the moon, I clicked the radio button on the dash of the H.T.U.
Nothing came back but static. 

The man turned to me still holding his pocket-watch. He looked confused, like i was the one who wasn't supposed to be there. He started over to me shaking his head at the same time. If this was the end, it was not at all how I imagined. 

Something came over my radio. 

""Why has time shifted?"" I could almost read his lips as the delayed sound came through. ""What?"" I asked. ""I've been in this spot since this point in time did come into existence, something is slowing me down.""

I opened the Med-Kit between my seat and the center control panel. I got out the adrenaline needle stored there and quickly inserted it into my suits injection system. 

The man didn't go away.

[WP]A wizard who always makes his summoning circles too small for monsters to fit through,wajaba,"Amma Aziagiar, Lord of the Cursed Harvest, Redfinger; it went by countless foul names as a culler of men and women throughout time and without border. There was no culture without stories of the violence it enacted when called upon by mortal folly. And yet the sanguine thief had slept for a thousand years since it last had the chance to carry a single trophy in its wide arms to the pits of sulfur and brimstone that spawned it and that it called home. 

A thousand years to dream would turn the brightest mind to a bitter swamp of profane conceptualization, to pierce the black miasma of unwaking horror that gave such a beast glee would be madness. But such a thing was unknowable and mortal man did so enjoy his folly.

Amma Aziagiar could feel what seemed like a warm spark at the base of its mind that grew into the fires of consciousness. It had been summoned! It could see the hole to claw its way back to the land of men and try all of the new things it had thought as it slept. This one was far away, the Redfinger could only imagine how deep it had sunk as it lay dormant and it moved with the shuddering speed of a mindless predator to close in. Funny. The hole didn’t seem to be getting any bigger.

Before the reality of the situation could dawn on it, Amma’s head and half a shoulder pushed through the summoning circle.

“Ow, what the hell man?” Amma’s six black eyes settled on the balding and bespectacled set of robes that had summoned it there. “Are you kidding me right now? I mean, wow.”

“Are you Amma Aziagiar, Lord of the Cursed Harvest, the Sanguine— “Amma didn’t have time for the twenty questions this guy was giving him.

“Yeah, yeah, sure, Sanguine Thief, Redwhatever, what’s with the circle man?” It tried to wriggle out of the circle but it just wasn’t happening.

“What, I’m not made of bone powder, do you know how much that stuff costs?” That was just the start of the whinging, 

“And don’t get me started with how heavy it is, not to mention the book and finding a black hill on a blood moon at midnight; it’s so dark out you have to find the hill and book it weeks in advance so it doesn’t get taken by another wizard, and one time I got double booked with Davenport the Spooky, uch it was such a mess.” 

There was a beat of pure silence between the two that a vorpal blade could not have cut.

“Anyway, are you going to help me out or what?”

“Help you out! Help YOU out, when I’m the one that’s stuck here because someone didn’t want to splurge on a little bone powder for their profane ritual!” Amma was the angriest it’d ever been, who even was this guy? “Not made of bone powder my red ass, I’ll turn YOU into bone powder if I ever get out of here, then you’ll have plenty!” It flailed and hissed and pushed against the tiny summoning circle, but nothing was happening. It was too small to get out on his own. The Wizard just crossed his arms and looked insulted.

“You know, if you’re going to be this way, I don’t even feel like making a pact now,” He said with the utmost of petulance. For the first time in the millennia since its birth, Amma Aziagiar felt defeated.

“You know what?” It asked with a pull, “Fine, I’ll just go back home!” It tugged again, trying to work himself out. 

“Good, no one wants you here anyway!” The Wizard retorted.

“That’s why I’m leaving!” Amma tugged again, harder.

“Then leave already!”

“I am!” Another tug, this time with all of the demon’s foul hellgiven strength. 
Nothing.

“Well?” The Wizard was understandably impatient. Amma was silent for a while, its six eyes contemplating the hill.

Powerful wind spiraled through the dank chamber and froze the moment it reached the rim of Geszmak's authority. It could not touch him when he recited the words of Hi'stej, the Daemon Lord. For he had created a manual that could summon any Daemon from the nether realm. 

***Ig Mo' Gre Sinnxyantle Ittl..***

In the center of the room was a potent artifact, retrieved from the highest mountain of Zysz. Geszmak had traveled many years and killed many people to apprehend it. The jewel contained a Greater Daemon, one that could wreak havok on the land. With it, Gezsmak could become the most powerful man in the *universe*. It shuddered as the ancient man finished his chant...

***ITKA BISH HAG RE TU!*** Gezsmak shouted. He pointed his hands skyward and an electrifying energy shot from his fingertips, illuminating the chamber in a sudden, bright flash. The energy, a pure white beam, directed intently by the wizard, flew into the Jewel. It glowed a deep gold as it absorbed the majjik, and the subsequent blast destroyed a neighbouring wall and despite his expertly crafted shield, sent Gezsmak flying into a large nearby rock.

When he came to, he saw where a faint red glow from where the amulet *WAS*. In its place was a horrifying shape, black as the night, and shaping shift constantly. 

***UNLEASH ME. YOU WANT POWER? I WILL GIVE YOU POWER BEYOND YOUR WILDEST THOUGHTS*** The shape screamed.

Gezsmak knew he had to keep the Daemon contained. You never bartered with Creatures of Hell.

Geszmak cleared his throat. He raised one hand and prep'd the spell. In his other, he produced a small, golden oil lamp.

***Frijj Shak'atar abiiautsk ARREEND!*** 

The cave erupted in light, and a beam shot from the lamp, consuming the Daemon, in an excruciatingly painful process. The Daemon screamed in a garbled unintelligible tongue. Finally, the light subsided, and the cave was once again peaceful.

Gaszmek grinned. He remembered his old Master's saying about Daemons and how to control them...

No worries now that that was merely a causality of world destruction. I then saw the beasts climbing the walls of the gargantuan pit I had created. Only, the monsters seemed to grow bigger than the cavernous valley I had created. The mighty beasts were shooting through the hole shouting as they came up, their bodies scraping up against the walls of the pit leaving a red streak of pain against their skin and the stone. The monsters shot up and were squeezed through the hole like a sausage maker. Their guts shot up at my ceiling as they were ripped and torn apart from the scraping edges of the portal. The walls and I were covered in blood and the intestines of the hellspawns.

Dear journal,   
Hey, it's me again, @writing_trash on Reddit, or otherwise known as Alex. I know I stopped writing in you a while ago, but today I just can't help it. I used to come in here on paranoid nights and anxiety filled afternoons and empty mornings. That still happens, but I've learned things. I can't help but feel like maybe there is a purpose for me. I look at myself and regret every harm I ever made to this body. Because it's mine. I am living, breathing. But lately, I can't help but feel I'm not special. I can't help but feel like all my plans for the future fail, like I'm not good enough to do things. This sounds whiny teenager like, but I mean, I'm just like the next emo ball of trash, aren't I? I like Dan and Phil, My Chemical Romance, and screamo music. I dye my hair too much and wear all black. So I come to you now, journal, not with paranoid scrawls or anxious scribbles, but with a feeling of worthlessness and dread. I can't even do the simplest of tasks like asking a teacher something because I might mess it up. See journal, I have been getting better. I was much better than before. But, maybe that separates me. I tried, and now I am. I wish I could tell people that I am alive. Through all the pain, and the hateful people and the hateful words said to me by others and even myself, I got through. Because, journal, it is so much better being alive. There are times when I fumble, but I get back up. I haven't self harmed in three or four months, and that was after a huge fight with my mom. See, journal, I fell down. But now I'm back up, and I'm actually... happy for once. I really haven't truly felt it in years. The scars on me remind me of a bad and regretful past. They are not ""battle scars"" or whatever the fuck 'poetic' Tumblr grunge users call them. They are mistakes, regrets. They are a reminder of who I was. I wish I had never inflicted this on myself. And yet, they stay. They won't go away. But that is my own fault. I guess that's okay, because at least I haven't inflicted any others. I just decided to try, for once in my life. And I did it. So I guess that sets me apart from the others. I battled this. I beat this. Living, breathing through this life. So, I guess, maybe I am special. Maybe I am different.",writing_trash

That's what I've been told is enough to kill a man. 

So I thought that I'd give it a go. After all, when you're set to spend the rest of your pitiful existence behind bars like some sort of caged animal, you gotta find ways to keep yourself busy. I suppose going out sooner would be better too, anyway.

The first was hard. Ever try going a few hours without drinking something? Whether it be soda, beer, or even sweet H20 itself, a man's gotta find a beverage that can adequately quench his thirst in between meals and activities. In other words, over the course of your average day-to-day existence, the act of drinking something just kinda gets ingrained into your system. Getting over that habitual hurdle was nothing short of an ordeal. 

To make matters worse, the guards start to get suspicious if you outright deny your rations. After all, it would reflect rather poorly on the institution if the inmates were dropping like flies left and right just because they wouldn't eat or drink any of that shitty prison kitchen crap. And I suppose letting us high-profile criminals get away so easily wouldn't sit right with them either. So the guards have an extra task tacked onto their to-do list- make sure the prisoners leave their meal plates squeaky clean, water included. 

How did I figure out a way to get around this, you ask? It's pretty simple. Instead of drinking the water from the cup, I'd press the rim of the glass to my lips and let the water flow down my chin. It's not really uncommon for people to spill their drinks from time to time, after all. Although, I suppose there's the downside now that the guards likely think me to be the clumsiest fuck around. But what's done is done. 

*No water? Check. 
Still alive? Check.* 

After the whole dehydration thing fell through, I had no choice but to turn to method 2 of killing myself. 

Strangely enough, going without food was a lot easier than I thought it'd be. After going a few days without water, my throat had dried up faster than a puddle in the summer heat, and food didn't want to go down at all. Getting rid of the shit wasn't too difficult either; I just gave the bread to the rats fumbling around my cell, and the soup? Well, none of us really cared for the soup, so I guess the guards didn't mind all that much if we were to leave that untouched. 

*No food? Check. 
Still alive? Check. 
Feelings of fucking gut-rot every morning? Check.* 

Now, before we move on, let's make one thing very clear: when you stop giving your body the necessary nutrients to function, it sorta just shuts down. Meaning, since I gave up food and water in a vain attempt to commit suicide, I spent most of my days sleeping it off. 

But as fate would have it, the third time would have to be the charm, so I had no choice but to deprive myself of my only remaining refuge as well. 

It sucked. 

*No sleep? Check. Still alive? Shit.* 

I spent a few hours that morning in thought. All three methods of killing myself had failed, and there were no practical ones left for me to exploit. What the fuck is wrong with me, I wondered. What sort of person can go for three whole months without the basic necessities to survive? Hell, I should've known that something was up when I realized that I could go through these methods in succession. Any normal human would have kicked the bucket weeks ago. Unless... Unless they weren't really human after all. 

Growing up, I was told a lot of fairy tales where monsters like vampires and werewolves exist. As I got older though, I figured they were all bullshit stories that some losers with dicks for brains thought up to impress gullible commoners. 

*Wizards? Yeah, right. Fountain of Youth? In your dreams. Dragons? Komodo.* 

*Immortality?* Hmm. 

After all those years of doubt, these 3 harrowing months suddenly brought the story back to life within my mind. Could it be? Am I truly unkillable? Wait. Is this just a being unkillable thing, or am I also going to live forever? 

And just like that, as I shifted my gaze from my emaciated hands to the cold, steel bars of my cell, despair overwhelmed my every sense. 

*I'm going to be stuck here forever, huh?* 

In that moment, I realized what the rest of my life would hold. Years and years of solitary confinement, with the same shitty food and the same shitty guards. And as more time would pass by, I would watch those shitty guards get replaced by some other equally shitty guards. And then again. And again. 

Eventually, people will realize that something is up. That there's something extraordinarily wrong with my existence, and they'll take me out of this cell into another one, where twisted scientists and other delusional people will experiment on me and research every fibre of my being, hoping to find the source of the anomaly. 

My mind slowly began to spiral down into oblivion. What does one do when they're faced with an eternity of torment and anguish with no means of escape? Truly, for me, it would be nothing short of hell on earth. 

But as I clenched my head with my hands in hopeless despair, about to lose what was left of my sanity, I was brought to my senses momentarily by a sharp knock on my cell door. 

""Hey, butterfingers! Your dinner is served"" the prison guard yelled as he complemented his entrance with a mocking curtsy, ""Make sure you don't spill it everywhere this time."" 

I turned my gaze to the tray that had just been slid into my cell. And for a while, I just stared. 

Eventually, after what felt like an eternity, I got up, picked up a piece of bread, popped it into my mouth, and gulped it down with the water in the glass. 

*Well, I'll figure it out eventually, I guess.* 

And after the tray had been spotlessly cleaned off (Yeah, even that shitty-ass soup) I leapt into my bed and let myself sleep for the first time in 3 months.

""I'll tell you on the road, kid."" John wrenched the loose grills from the window with a resounding scrape, and tucked them into the bed. He produced a length of rope and danced it before his cellmate's tattooed face. ""It's a long story.""

Cellmate grew a wary smile, and offered a handshake.

That afternoon, John and Cellmate sat in a pub. Each was in a suit, with crisp new haircuts and pints of Somerset cider. This time was the real deal.

Anyway, after a couple of years, some of the boys start dying, along with the other gangs. They could barely move, let alone fight, and their skin was saggy and wrinkled.

A few more years pass and the wardens let me have a newspaper on account of good behavior. I checked the obituaries as I usually do, and saw one for my wife. I thought it was just a sick joke or a misprint, but the paper said she’d died on October 3, 2040!”He took care when extracting the yellowed clipping from his overcoat and held it up to the therapist’s face. “That was fifty years ago! How am I still alive?” The therapist held up a long, stringy finger, explaining that modern medicine had made great advances in the last decade alone, so he shouldn’t wonder if he lived longer. “I don’t get treatment here and the slop they serve here isn’t making me any younger!” was what he shouted his therapist down with. “Am I going insane or am I immortal?” he flung in the man’s face.
Keeping a serious tone, the man pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose, stroked his white beard and responded “There’s no doubt about it. You’ve been alive for 140 years.

A long, happy marriage of fifty years is a drop in the bucket in the fountain of eternity.” The man buried his head in his hands. “Do you know how hard it is to know that everyone I’ve loved or will love will wither away in front of me?” The man who slaughtered scores of men and had bested time itself curled up on the couch, bawling like an infant as he realized that time had won after all.

She'd had two or three doctors tell her nothing was wrong but she knew it and the dog did too. At least, that's what I heard Officer Takamura and Officer O'Hara saying. I don't watch TV.

Anyway, you always know when something is wrong. And trust me when I say I know something is wrong. I've been here 29 years, and not a single thing has changed.

There are others here that have been here just as long, some even longer. Snout's been here 32 years. Schwartz has been here 29 years, too. And if there's one thing I've noticed about the guys like Schwartz and Snout, it's that they've fucking changed. Schwartz's vision is starting to go so he's got glasses, poor little fucker. Snout's got scars everywhere from all the goddamn fights he likes to pick and his once-black hair is going grey. Me, though? I'm forty-fucking-seven years old, and I am in perfect health. Straight white teeth, 20/20 vision, good hearing, and not one grey hair on my head. Not one scar that ever lasted more than a few weeks after the wound itself healed.

I was pretty good growing up, not that I remember much of it. My uncle is head of the mafia over in Russia, and according to the United States President that makes my illegal entrance into their country some sort of threat. Not sure where they would get that from since those crossing the Mexican border are offered jobs and the like with no questions asked. 

Such is my luck.

First they kept me in customs for awhile, after discovering my passport was a fake. I'll kill the Russian who made it if I ever see him again. It took about 4 days before they figured out my relatives weren't friendly, so I guess their system isn't as updated as we thought. They questioned me about the special items in my travel bags. I wouldn't talk, naturally, so they sentenced me to federal prison with a lot of legal jargon. I may have assaulted and killed one of my guards while being transported. Apparently their excuse to give me life in prison, but they should have seen that coming.

The inmates had heard of me and left me alone for the most part. One made the mistake of ""tripping"" and knocking my food on the floor. One blow to the base of his spine, and wheelchair confinement should keep him from future mishaps. 3 years and 14 escape attempts later, I finally crossed from Texas into Mexico.

Mexican drug lords didn't take kindly to my presence either and I was welcomed with an AK47 emptied into my chest. Then a machete embedded itself into my neck for good measure. Imagine my surprise when I found myself waking up inside of a body bag, no injuries, with a slight headache. They'd left in the machete. 

I listened, silence. After re-entering the world of bright light and removing the machete, I noticed several used bullets inside the bag with no scars in my skin. Interesting. I'm invincible. Chuckling, I started jogging south towards the jungle. Or the ocean. Whichever I find first.

[WP] Why have you not opened the door in front of you?,Laxaria,"The knob was right there. About an inch away from my outstretched arm. I looked at Emma, my best friend, and wondered how she ever talked me into this. She nodded for me to continue. I swallowed, and, hand shaking, put my hand on the cold, dusty, silver knob. It was when I touched it that I realized that this was the first human contact with the door since... Jay. Oh, no. I shouldn't have thought of that. I could feel another flashback coming on.

It was three years ago. I was 11, he was 14. I had come home from school, looking for Jay. My mama said that he was in his room, but when I looked, I couldn't find him. He was in there somewhere. I just had to keep looking. That was when I saw the hat. His favorite hat. On the floor. By the closet door. As I reached down to pick it up, I heard his scream come from his closet. But when I opened the closet door, I saw nothing except clothes.

And my hand was on the same knob, the same door that had taken Jay. And I was about to see what it was that took him.

Hand on the knob, Emma next to me. I was thankful she was there. I didn't know what would happen. Would the thing in the closet do anything to me if Emma was there? Stop it, I told myself. There's nothing in there. You're being stupid. 

I had to get it over with. Without thinking any more, I turned the knob, and the door creaked open. First Emma looked in. After a second, so did I.

There was nothing.

Emma laughed, and I glaredat her. My brother DIED in there! ""See?"" Emma told me. ""Theres nothing in there."" She checked her phone and said she had to leave. I didn't want her to go. She might be the reason that nothing happened. But before I could say anything, Emma was out the door. And I was alone.

I ran into my room and climbed onto my bed. As I was taking my phone out of my pocket, I realized I had forgotten to close my door. I jumped off my bed. The door slammed in front of me. I hadn't touched it. Trembling, I climbed back into my bed. Something felt... off 

I pulled out my phone and opened Siri. ""Siri, text Emma, ""I'm alone in my room and I'm scared. Are you sure there was nothing in the closet?'""

Siri was silent.

Heart pounding, I tried again. ""Siri, text Emma, 'I'm alone in my room and I'm scared. Are you sure there was nothing in the closet??'""

The way this line set-up the rest of the story made me certain that Bobby was not ""normal"". In some sense, the first-person narrative helps mellow out how quickly one might jump to this conclusion because first-person narratives can be innately misleading and unreliable. 

Knowing the twist at the end, some of the things in the rest of the story becomes more interesting. For example, the speaker complaining about how much coffee Bobby drank but really implying that the speaker drinks a lot of coffee.

[WP] Why have you not opened the door in front of you?,Laxaria,"The humidity in the room was oppressive and hot. Adrian attempted to call upon the demonic energies from his core, to reduce the heat around him, but found them unwilling and unable to respond.

The walls were metallic and well-polished, almost reflecting his own image in them. In the center was a single, smooth metallic table, bare of any items or features. The only exit was a door across the room.

Wait, how had he even got inside here? 

He whipped his head around, droplets of sweat flying off, as he stared at the steel wall behind him. He remembered... a corridor. 

""*Flesh-thing...*"" A raspy, grating noise called out from behind him. Adrian turned again to find himself face-to-face with a round dome made of a dull metal. Two eye slits glowed a faint orange, as a spindly body of metal and cloth attached to the half-sphere slinked around the man.

Thick cables, snake-like in their mannerisms and appearance, trailed from the upper-torso in place of legs. No matter where Adrian looked, the cables always seemed to trail to just outside the corner of his eye. 

""Who are you?"" he asked.

""*You came here with a purpose, flesh-thing*,"" the being said again, slinking away towards the table. Blade-like fingers caressed the edge of it. ""Why?""

Adrian held his silence, keeping a level glare. Who was this creature? *What* was this creature? 

He wasn't sure when he had pressed against himself against the wall, but the cold metal was soothing and relaxing, bringing him a small reprieve from the heat in the room. 

""*You wish for a gift, flesh-thing*,"" the being said. 

Finally, Adrian mustered the strength to speak. ""I need help.""

The creature slithered close, its face now less than an inch away from Adrian's. ""*With what, flesh-thing*?""

""Who are you?"" the man asked again. 

The head tilted slightly. ""*So full of questions, flesh-thing*."" Abruptly, it moved away, suddenly at the opposite end of the table. ""*I am Reaver*.""

""Never heard of you.""

""*Would not have expected a flesh-thing of your insignificance to have ever heard of my existance*.""

Adrian felt a flash of angry flare up inside of him, a snarl nearly escaping his lips before he quelled the thoughts. This... Reaver, was the only thing that could...

This was the only thing that could *help* help anymore. 

""I need help, Reaver,"" Adrian said. His voice had become softer. ""A... friend, has been lost. I need to move on. A great being told me you would be able to help me find peace.""

The Reaver remained motionless for a long while, the orange eyes gazing emptily at Adrian. Unease settled in his chest. What if it said no? What if it was unable to help?

What if the Reaver simply refused to help?

""*I can bring you peace, but there is a cost, flesh-thing*.""

Adrian started, his eyes widening.

""*I can remove all memory of what troubles you. With no memory of what was lost, you will not feel the pain of that lost*.""

There was a sudden tightness in his throat. Forget... her? ""H - how... how can you ask that of me?"" he croaked. The coolness of the wall suddenly wasn't as comforting anymore.

""*Through that door will lie peace of mind. You will not remember your lost one, and your mind will be free from its torment*.""

The Reaver shifted slightly, its head tilting the other way.

""*Go back the way you came, and you will remember your friend but forever be tormented by her loss.*""

Adrian didn't know when he had started crying. The last two times he had cried was when he had lost Riah, and then over a century before that.

His eyes fixated on the door, the tears in his eyes blurring his vision. The corridor behind him had re-opened. His legs like jelly underneath him, Adrian took a few steps towards the door. 

His hand gripped the round door-knob weakly. 

He would know peace? 

But he would forget every last bit of Riah?

The pressure on my side would grow stronger the longer I stood here. My eyes darted from this door to the one beside it. Each door had a single, simple shape painted on it, and for the door in front of me, the pink symbol was sleeping on a white square. Its circular face stared down at me and its outstretched arms mocked me as I hopped from one leg to the other, hoping to relieve the pressure building up in my body.   

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Parts of my body wanted to open the door and go in. My calves trembled as my eyes darted back and forth again. My classmates walked in and out of these doors with pride and made the decision look easy.   

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I never went to the bathroom at school, so I never had to make this decision before.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My body backed away from the painted wooden doors and I sat myself across them, wrapping my arms around my knees. My underwear was starting to feel wet, but I did not know if it was from the sweat rolling in the spaces between my clothes and my skin or if it was pee.   

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The last time I wet myself was two weeks ago. I went to the bathroom before going to sleep, but when I woke up, my bedsheets were stained and the smell of the room made me sick. When my mother found me, she said it was perfectly normal and got me to wash up. We went out to buy new sheets that afternoon and she picked out ""grown-up"" sheets for me because she was going to throw away the old ones that had warm sunflowers and pink butterflies. When Mother bought me those sheets, she said I should like them, and so I did. Mother told me to like the new sheets too, but they were black and thick and cold.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When Mother bought me new sheets she bought me new underwear too. My cheeks were warm and my eyes were shy as we walked through the aisles looking at the fabric. They were in many different shapes and colours and sizes. Some looked more like string than cloth and when I thought about how someone might wear them I blushed. Whenever I looked at the bras, I wondered if I would have to wear one too.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For my birthday next week I wanted to wish that I would never have to grow anything out of my chest. Some of my classmates had already started wearing those things and I knew because I passed them when I left the changing room after changing my clothes in one of the stalls. Mother said she was going to buy me some when I started to grow.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mother told me a lot of things. She told me how long I should keep my hair, but when I was old enough to decide how long I wanted it, I had my hair cut short because it was easier to wash in the shower. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I rolled to my side and stood up, kicking my foot against the wall but the pain did little to distract my thoughts. My brain had thought of water and the pressure was swelling inside me. I could hear the soft rustle of running water flowing down my body. The liquid flowed down my thighs and I quickly ran my hand between my calves as I pictured soapy water flowing down the drain. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I made decisions every day that were simple, like how long I would stand in the shower for or whether I would wash my hair that night. This decision should be simple too. I had rehearsed it in my mind every time I walked pass these doors. With just my shoulder, I could lean against the door, and it would open. When it opened I could finally rush into it and use one of its stall.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was simple. That's what my Mother said about math the day before my math quiz. I had failed and had to take extra classes. To pass the time in those classes while our teacher was late, my classmates started going round to ask who each person was in love with. Whenever they asked me I looked away and they pressed me for an answer. When I kept quiet, they concluded I was in love with the best-looking person in my class and was too shy to say it.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My eyes looked back at the doors, then darted sideways as a shape emerged into the hallway. ""Alex,"" the figure said. ""I thought you were going to the bathroom? Come on!"" 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She pushed the door open with ease and beckoned me in. I thought if I took a step forward I would have given up. The decision was final and I would not be the one that had decided for myself. The thought made me shiver, as did my wet socks and shoes as I stood there with tears on my cheeks.",Laxaria
[WP] Why have you not opened the door in front of you?,Laxaria,"I have not opened the door yet because there is something behind it.

Statistically speaking, there is going to be *something* behind it. A bear, perhaps. No! Not a bear! Well, maybe. Maybe there is a bear behind the door, and it's going to maul me. Tear me limb from limb, that bear will.

Maybe there is something else. A nice vacation away from home, complete with the drinks that have the small umbrellas. I could be missing out on a nice red sunburn, torched across my skin like how marshmallows catch on fire. Yes, I assure myself, I'm not missing out on much.

The knob is round, and shiny. Too shiny to lay my dirty fingerprints on. What if I murdered someone? What if they used the doorknob as evidence against my heinous crimes against humanity? I must not touch the door. I *will* not touch the door. I'll get splinters that way.

Perhaps I don't like what's on the other side. Can I go back? What if the door's contents are not to my liking? I would then very much like to go back, onto the other side of the door. My side. The side with the shiny round knob. Maybe the other side of the door doesn't even have a shiny, round knob. Maybe it's one of those plastic lever type handles; the ones where you have to pull down on to get anywhere. And I wouldn't like to use that. No siree, I am no lever handle heathen like my grandparents before me. I am a sophisticated being. I will use nothing but the best of shiny round knobs. 

And so, I sit there, staring at the door, and it's hinges and knob and everything else that makes a door a *door*, including the woody piece that has unfortunately been propped up on those hinges, blocking out the rest of the world.

And I wonder what could be.

[WP] Why have you not opened the door in front of you?,Laxaria,"&gt; But I'm also paranoid and I keep wondering if I've missed some kind of twist...

What's the gender of the speaker? How do you know? And how confident are you in your answer?",Laxaria
[WP] Why have you not opened the door in front of you?,Laxaria,"Anything could be behind that door. Anything. There is no way to be sure what would be there if it is opened. Anything from a room full of clowns sitting around a hexagonal table playing monopoly, to a dragon from a planet of dragons here to deliver us dragon pizza. Anything, I mean anything. No ifs, ands, or buts, anything that can be conceived by the human imagination could be behind that door. Actually, that's not true, because there is more to this universe than what humans could ever think of. Even then, it doesn't necessarily have to be in the universe does it.

Think of an alien, like a being from another world. One that knows literally everything in the universe. Now think of the even smarter alien that would be in the first aliens imagination. Then think of the even smarter alien in that aliens imagination. Rinse and repeat the same amount of times as there are electrons in the universe, plus 1. That thing, whatever it is, infinitely inconceivable to any human that has ever lived or ever will live, could be behind that door. That is what I mean by anything, no limit, infinity times infinity.

You know what’s included in infinity. Impossible things. Paradoxes. Things that could never be completed. A task for example, where half of the task is completed in the half of the time, then in the next half of the time, the next half of the task is completed. These tasks can never be finished because you can always half the time and task. But behind the door, they are there, completed. Impossible, but as I said, anything is possible behind the door.

Even more impossible, and yes I know that two impossible things are theoretically the same amount of impossible, but this one takes the cake. There exists a possibility where in the door is opened and behind it, the door was already open. Similarly to this, there exists a possibility where the door is both open and not open at the same time. These things simply cannot be, they defy logic! To the door though, logic is just another thing that is optional.

“What if I open the door? and...” you may be asking, the answer is I don’t know. Who does, I’ll tell you who, an infinite amount of Elvis Presley impersonators behind the door. There is also an infinite amount of everyone else that could tell you, including yourself. That's not even the worst part though. The worst part is, you could open this door, and find an infinite amount of doors to even more infinite things. If you thought that comprehending the first door was hard, this second set of doors is like to them as the solar system is to a subatomic particle. That’s only a visualisation though, because in reality you need to multiply that analogy by infinity squared for it to even be close to accurate.

Point is, this door seems to me to be more dangerous than a bullet literally traveling through my skull right now. So, given the situation, I think I’ll pass.",Physicisnt

And yet, here you are, behind at this door.

Are you afraid of what's past the door? No, I doubt it,

rather are you not afraid of the door itself? Or do you not fear anything?

Why not walk through? Is it not better on the other side?

You chose to sit idly by as you fade into oblivion?

You would rather wither away accomplishing nothing?

Afraid of what is trapped with you behind this door.

[WP] Why have you not opened the door in front of you?,Laxaria,"I woke up this morning to my housemate Bobby screaming in the shower.

As I stumbled from my bed, eyes half-shut, the business end of a baseball bat caught my toe and almost sent me sprawling. I managed to keep my balance by hopping awkwardly and crushing tiny objects underfoot into powder. Damn it, I'd told Bobby a thousand times to keep his meds in his room.

Bobby's screaming had hit an unnaturally high pitch by the time I burst into the living room of our tiny house. The sound made my hairs stand on end. His room was next to mine, the door ajar, but I couldn't see make out any details with all the lights off and none of the thick curtains pulled back.

When I reached the bathroom door, I realized for the first time that I couldn't hear the shower at all. What was he up to?

""Bobby, man, you okay in there?"" I pounded on the door with my fists. ""I'm coming in, just hang on.""

To my relief, the door wasn't locked. I rushed in and yanked the shower curtain back, but found no Bobby. His phone was there though, next to a fresh bar of soap.

Right then, a burst of laughter came from outside.

""What the hell, Bobby?"" I shouted as I stormed out into the kitchen. He wasn't there either, but there was a bowl filled with cereal next to a yellowed newspaper. ""You think that's funny?""

""Made you run,"" he said, voice coming from his room.

""I'll get you back for it, one of these days,"" I muttered as I checked the coffee tin. Empty again. I thought I'd refilled it only three days ago. Just how much does Bobby drink? I wondered.

The storeroom's light remained dark despite several presses of the switch, but I had enough light to see the interior without it being on anyway. For a moment, I stood staring confusedly at the stacks of canned food and drinks.

""Bobby, did we decide to break a world record on hoarding food or something?"" I called.

There was a short pause before he replied, ""Nationwide food shortage, remember?""

Now that he mentioned it, I had a vague memory of watching it on the late night news some time ago. Well, if that's the case, at least we had enough baked beans to last us for the rest of our lives.

I grabbed a bag of coffee powder and went to refill the tin. One of these days, we really needed to clean this place up, I thought as I noticed the piles of old magazines on the floor next to the kitchen sink, dirty dishes in dish rack and a small mountain of unwashed clothes beside the washing machine. There was a musty smell coming from the last of these.

""Hey Bob, I know we're bachelors and we've got this image to maintain, but I've been thinking—""

There came a knock on the front door, and for some reason I jumped, nearly spilling the bag's contents all over the table. It had sounded like a thunderbolt on a sunny day.

""Hey, you mind getting that?"" I said.

Second later, the knocking came again, three evenly timed raps on the door.

""Bob, there's someone at the door. Open it.""

""No.""

I frowned at the tone, stubborn yet with an undercurrent of fear. ""Bob, you gotta stop messing around today. Okay, fine, I'll do it.""

Wiping my hands on my shirt, I went out into the living room. Bobby was still in his room, but he wasn't changing or he would've shut the door. He still hadn't turned on the lights. Another round of knocks came, making the aged door rattle in its frames, and I said, ""I'm coming.""

""Don't open it!""

I ignored my housemate and reached for the handle.

""I'm serious, Cory! Don't open that damned door!""

With a groan, I spun around, expecting to see Bobby with a grin plastered on his stupid face. But the only things in sight were the ugly second-hand furniture we had. And also more pills on the floor. In fact, from the scant sunlight filtering in through the slits in our barricaded and curtained windows, I could make out almost dozens of those little white things scattered everywhere.

""Bobby?"" I said, uncertainly. My head was starting to hurt.

""Look around you,"" he said from his room, though his voice clear was clear as though he was standing next to me.

And for the first time in what felt like a long time, I focused on what I was looking at. The wooden boards fastened over every single window. Shattered pieces of glass sprinkled below every opening into the house. The fire ax on top of a dusty television with its wires unplugged. And the fully loaded shotgun leaning against the wall next to the door now shaking from an unceasing barrage of hammering.

""Have you forgotten that you're the last man on Earth?"" Bobby's voice dropped to a whisper. ""Are you really going to open that door?""",Bilgebum

"[WP] When you were a kid you discovered you had superpowers, in the worst possible way. Tell us your experience.",LinkToU,"As a kid I had glow in the dark stars stuck to the ceiling above my bed. Every night I used to grab the ladder from the corner of my room and adjust them. Moving each star so that as I lay in my bed I could pretend I was traveling the world and seeing different clusters scattered across the night sky. It was my one getaway from my own miserable life. I'll never forget the way I had the stars set up that night. 

I was wide awake in bed, the only light in the room coming from the soft green glow on the ceiling. As usual, I couldn't get to sleep. Not for the screaming match that was going on downstairs, the voices of my mom and dad easily carrying through the thin walls that made up our small home. 

I had known it was coming, when I got home that day I stepped into a house filled with the smell of alcohol and cigarette smoke. Dad was home early and mom was nowhere to be seen. He was sitting in his favorite green rocking chair staring at the television, a can of beer in his hand and several tossed randomly to the floor around him. Except the television wasn't on, but still he sat there. Sipping from the can and occasionally reaching for the cigarette that burned in the ashtray beside him while I remained frozen in the doorway. 

Slowly, I eased myself inside, wincing at every creak of the floorboards and the squeal of the front door as I tried to shut it as quietly as possible. Useless efforts, as if he could have missed my entry with nothing else going on in the house. But I was a kid, and every kid fears the wrath of their parents. Even when we've done nothing to deserve that wrath. 

""Get your ass upstairs."" Dad rumbled quietly and I froze. He hadn't turned around or even shifted his bulk in the chair but I was still petrified. It would've almost been better if he had yelled. ""Now."" He said again and the chair creaked. The simple threat of him standing sent me racing up the stairs, heart pounding in my chest. There were already several still healing bruises on my lower back, I didn't want anymore. 

My haste to escape becoming an outlet for my dad's anger allowed me to ignore the fact I hadn't eaten since lunch that day, but going back downstairs wasn't an option. Not until mom got home at least. They would argue, he would hit her, then she would put together whatever she could and bring it to me. We would both pretend the swollen skin or fresh bruise wasn't there. 

Night fell and the arguing started as soon as mom came in the door.  As much as I could I tuned out what they were saying but I still caught bits and pieces. Dad had lost his job. His dinner wasn't ready when he got back. Mom apologized for not having time to make it. Dad accused mom of cheating. That was when they started screaming at each other and I lost track of what was being said. Then the screaming suddenly stopped just as I heard a crash in the kitchen. 

Several more crashes sounded and the walls shook. Dishes fell and broke against the kitchen floor. I tried to cover my ears with the thin pillow for what was coming next but I could still hear my mom crying. Then the sound of my dad cursing. The pillow couldn't mute the sounds his fists made as they crashed into her. Still in bed I felt the familiar kindling of anger in my chest. I kept my eyes on the stars as it continued. And continued. Longer than it ever had before. 

I whipped the covers off me as I felt myself burning up, the anger turning to rage and a slick sheen of sweat was already covering my whole body. There were times I had to go downstairs before, the same times I had received the worst beatings of my life. But I couldn't just lay there and do nothing. 

A quick roll and I was out of the bed and down the stairs. Yet I froze as I came into the kitchen. A slim red pool of blood was crawling across the slanted vinyl floor and floating in it were white pieces that I recognized as teeth. The whole time the awful thudding was filling my ears and I raised my eyes to see Dad on top of Mom, his fists were slamming into her face over and over. She wasn't fighting back. I wasn't sure she was even breathing. 

For a moment my world disappeared beneath a red curtain and I threw my body at my dad's side, hoping to knock him loose. Instead I only jostled him and he backhanded me across the face, his class ring cutting into my skin. With a cry of pain I fell back against the floor, one hand landing in the still warm trail of blood. Dad went right back to his abuse as if I wasn't even there. 

The rage I felt kicked itself another notch higher and I thought my skin was on fire. Grunting I got back to my feet and threw myself across the room again, this time latching onto my Dad's midsection. Dimly I heard his pained exclamation but as he started beating the back of my head I closed my eyes and focused all I could on holding on. If I could just get him to stop hitting Mom. Then he hit me again and I felt something snap somewhere in my body. 

I thought he had broken a bone, it wouldn't have been the first time. Then sound returned without me realizing it had ever left and I heard screaming. Opening my eyes I found that our kitchen looked like a war zone. There was orange and yellow fire everywhere. Climbing the walls, spreading to the living room, completely covering my Dad's body where he floundered on the floor. 

Almost detached from the scene I watched as he burned, expecting the fires to eventually burn out. But as I watched they only seemed to flare brighter until the smell of burning flesh filled the house and he stopped moving, the ring on his now blackened finger glowing orange. As he died so did the fire, and then I remembered my mom had been in the kitchen. 

Turning, I saw what remained of her own charred corpse. The moment stretched out forever and I screamed. And screamed. Until my throat was too raw to manage the sound anymore. The flames came back to life around me as if they had never left. When the screaming finally ended darkness claimed me. My childhood home burned to the ground around me, reducing the two corpses to nothing but ash. In the morning nothing was left but me and the foundation. ",JustLexx

[EU] After Harry's fifth year he starts using smuggle weapons instead of his wand against Death Eaters,SSR1234,"“So what now mate?,” Harry asked Ron and Hermione. They had reached the top of the spiral staircase in Ravenclaw Tower, leaving behind a trail of bullet casings and dead Death Eaters. They had put up a valiant effort, but mere spells were no match for the deadly trio’s good friends, Heckler &amp; Koch and Samuel Colt. 


A not-quite-dead-yet Death Eater at Hermione's feet grabbed her ankle. She drew her trusty Sig Sauer pistol and shot him once in the head, and twice in the chest.
 

“Hopefully they’re all still alive, “ Ron said. The members of Dumbledore's Army had been captured and taken to the Ravenclaw Common Room, according to a Death Eater. He had displayed a surprising amount of faith in his master by refusing to divulge information, but creative usage of Hermione’s beloved Fairbairn Sykes combat knife had changed his mind. 


Hermione knocked on the handleless door of the Common Room. The eagle knocker spoke. 


“Which came first, the phoenix or the flame?” 
Hermione pulled down her balaclava and wiped her brow. “Fuck this, you’ve got to be kidding me…”


“Fuck it, we’re breaching the door, “ Harry said. Ron counted off, then  blasted open the door with the shotgun attachment on his Colt M4 carbine, and tossed in a flashbang that went off, filling the room with 170dB of raw sound and one million candlepower of light. 


Harry was in first, double-tapping a female Death Eater in the chest. Another Death Eater lifted up his wand and was about to curse Harry, but the words died in his throat as Ron shot him in the chest. There was a loud crash from across the room. Harry turned to see Hermione struggling with Bellatrix Lestrange on the stone floor. Her pistol was on the floor beside her. 


Bellatrix snarled at Hermione. “ You filthy Mudblood!” She reached for her wand.


“ DIE YOU BITCH!” Hermione drew a K-Bar knife from her ankle sheath and stabbed Bellatrix with it before Ron or Harry could intervene. The knife was buried up to it’s hilt in the witch’s neck. Hermione pushed Bellatrix off. She flopped around like a dying fish, choking on her own blood. Ron finished her off with a single shot between the eyes, while Harry shot a couple of Death Eaters writhing on the floor, stunned by Ron’s flashbang.  From start to finish the whole engagement took less than thirty seconds, but it had felt like an eternity to them.
 

They checked that everyone really was dead, then took up position at a wide balcony.. Harry set up a McMillan Tac-50 rifle while Ron watched the doorway. Hermione started calling in an airstrike on the Death Eaters from an AC-130 Spectre gunship overhead. Harry peered through the scope and spotted Lord Voldemort himself leading an attack on the castle entrance of Hogwarts. The defenders were barely holding out, until 105mm HE rounds from the Spectre gunship  started slamming into the rear of the seething mass of Death Eaters.
 

Hermione let out a whoop of joy. “Iron Rain, Wizard 2-1. Good effect, lots of little pieces flying down there.” The Death Eaters, terrified by what literally was death raining from the sky, took off running, leaving only Voldemort and a loyal cadre of Death Eaters with him. The retreating Death Eaters were cut down by a hail of 20mm bullets from the Vulcan cannons of the Spectre. 


Harry took all this in through his scope. He took into account the wind, humidity and distance, and zeroed in on Voldemort. He pulled the trigger.   A .50 BMG tungsten core bullet travelled through the sky at 900 metres a second. The bullet hit Voldemort right in the temple, causing the Dark Lord’s head to literally explode,. Lucius Malfoy was caught in the face with a spray of his late master’s brains. Leaderless, the remaining Death Eaters fell back. 


Hundreds of heavily armed soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment landed in Hogwarts and the surrounding grounds, finishing off any pockets of resistance. A Lynx helicopter pulled up in front Harry, Hermione and Ron. They climbed in, and the helicopter pulled away from the chaos of the battlefield.

[TT] Sunset of the druids,Stone-D,"Nicolau and Jordi moved in silence through the Haunted Wood. Commoners avoided the forest and for good reason. Werewolves, bog spirits, Morts Vius and many other cursed and unholy beings roamed the wood and killed on sight. Even the very outskirts of the wood was dangerous enough for only the bravest of fools to swing an ax against.

Nicolau and Jordi, however, moved through the brush without fear. They were not some duo of brave fools lost and out of their element. Quite the contrary, for they were both Druids. Allies of beasts and manipulators of nature, they were of a class dedicated to safeguarding nature from those who would bring her harm. A task that has become increasingly difficult as of late. 

Nicolau walked ahead of Jordi, analyzing the path. While his senses were focused on finding the way sign, Jordi's was focused on observing all manner of things surrounding them. Jordi had already sensed dozens of malicious beasts and even a few malign spirits. He and Nicolau had drank decoctions brewed to ward off all but the most hostile and evil creatures. Even so, Jordi was ever alert for danger. 

While keeping his ear keen to a pack of wolves nearby, he was caught off guard when he suddenly bumped into Nicolau. 

""Why'd you stop,"" Jordi asked in a hushed tone. 

""Why'd you lose focus of your surrounding,"" he quipped. 

""I was doing my part in keeping us safe. Focusing on everything near and far while you searched for the path to the way sign.""

""A bit too focused on the far,"" he chastised. ""Do not let the mere fact you are a druid blind you. We are in the Haunted Wood. Even a simple Mockingfey can kill you if you aren't careful enough.""

Jordi brushed his mentors comments aside. ""Have you found the trail or not?""

""I have. I had to backtrack a few times to spot it as it's been decades since the last druids walked it, but aye, I found it.""

""Great. Let's quit wasting our breath and go.""

***
After a few hours the duo finally reached the end of the trail and to the way sign. An old stone with runes once painted bright with the dye of a thousand trees, now left colorless with the passage of time and nature's lament. 

""So few of these left in this world,"" Nicolau spoke in reverence. ""Common churls see fit to smash any they find out of superstitious fear. Mortos take them all.""

""So how exactly do we use this way sign,"" Jordi asked.

""I'll show you."" Nicolau approached the stone, got down on his knees, closed his eyes, and inhaled a deep breath. ""Place your dominant hand on the center of the runes and whisper '*em portés al lloc amagat*'""

And with that Nicolau vanished before Jordi's eyes. 

Jordi followed his masters movements to the letter and whispered ""em portés al lloc amagat"" and left the Haunted Wood.

***

In an instant, he felt himself kneeling on sand. The sound of water crashing against the shore not too far. He stood and opened his eyes to find himself in an unfamiliar location. He had left the Haunted Wood and was now on an island, standing along the shore with a vast ocean in front of him. 

""Magnificent, isn't it,"" he heard Nicolau ask him.

""Sure is,"" he responded in truth. ""So this where the fabled Sunset of Druids takes place. Illa de l'home; the Isle of Man.""

""Aye. Here the first men rejoiced when they saw land for the first time in months. Here, countless miles away from any common churl, we gather in times of need. Come, Jordi. The other druids have already assembled at the Tree of Life. I can feel their presence already.""",YoungBlackfyre

[WP]Aliens come to Earth under a declaration of war because they think baby oil is made from babies.,ZeManky,"Argat was stressing over the recent reports sent to him by his economic adviser. This years margins had tanked significantly for the Republic of Xog and he knew it was due to the over-mining and poor distribution of the limited resources on his home planet. They had sent missions to nearby celestial bodies to try and locate new options for resource development, but had come up with only a handful of moons containing the minerals and elements needed to produce the gadgets and toys his people had come to rely on in their day to day lives. 

He sighed, looking out into the vast emptiness outside his cabin window, dotted only by useless gas giants and a meteor or two. The government star-ship had spent months searching the universe for possible planetary candidates for resource extraction. 

Argat heard the swoosh of his cabin door open, and turned to see his adviser, breathless and presenting a levitating projection of a galaxy over her open palm. 

""Sir"", she said, catching her breath, ""we've located a galaxy about 2 quips from our current position. It contains a prime candidate for the resources we need.""

Argat shot out of his chair, approaching the galactic projection with a stern look on his face.

""What's the rundown?""

""It's a planet locally referred to as 'Earth'"" she stated, ""It contains 9 of the 10 essential elements our military needs to produce artillery, and all 12 of the elements needed to produce this years hottest Boshtec holiday toy""

""Locally? Who's named it?""

""The planet is inhabited sir. By a species known as Human. We've done some basic research on them. They've produced little in the way of interstellar communication. We can find no sign that they are aware that the rest of the Galactic Nations even exist. They seem pretty self obsessed, to be completely candid sir.""

Argat grunted. He paced back to his chair and slumped down. ""Zigat, you know our laws do not allow unnecessary invasion of planets populated by intelligent species, no matter how primitive they may be. The intergalactic conservationists would tear us apart!"" 

""Sir, we think we have a way around that. The invasion of Earth would not be declared a mission for resources, but rather a necessary military invasion for the purpose of liberation and peace.""

""I'm sorry,"" Argat furrowed his brow, ""can you explain to me how we can justify that?""

""We found that these Humans have a vanity product that is quite common among their populations. They call it 'Baby oil'""

""Baby oil? You mean, they make this oil from their own babies? That's monstrous!""

""Well,"" Zigat turned and pressed the prompt for the cabin door to close. She leaned in towards her commander and spoke in a hushed tone. ""Not exactly. The oil itself is made from a byproduct of petroleum refinement. But the conservationists don't know that, and we're hoping their initial response to this will be similar to yours. We can frame this invasion as a peace keeping mission, bringing order and compassion to the ""heathen, bloodthirsty humans"", setting up embassies to keep them in order, all the while taking what resources we so desperately need."" 

Argat sank down into his chair. He clasped his hands together and brought them to his forehead, sitting deep in thought for a matter of minutes. Zigat stood patiently waiting to see how her commander would respond. 

Argat let out a deep, weighted sigh. ""Zigat.""

""Yes sir""

He looked up, smirking. ""I'm giving you a raise, you evil bitch.""

"[WP] We can't start this legend at the very beginning, for the very beginning is lost in the void beyond memory, so we start with a man, a woman and an important story. They were the ones who lived.",aaronwb,"""It was, say three hundred years ago."" Kash paused and gave his beard a rub. ""Now that I think about it, it was closer to three hundred and fifty."" He straightened his back and the children in front of him made themselves comfortable. They all knew they'd be here for a while. Kash never straitened himself for a short story. ""Keep in mind that this was after the cataclysm. This is not some ghost or fairy story about life before it. No, this is real.""

""How do you know?"" interrupted Meng. The young girl wore loose rags and had her scraggly and dirt ridden hair tied back into a tail. ""Three hundred years is a long time, and there's nearly fifty different-"" She was hushed by some of the older boys before she could continue. 

Kash smiled despite himself. ""That's a good question, little one. And if you listen close-like you'll get your answers. I'm nearly one hundred years old myself, I know these things.""

Meng nodded but didn't dare speak up lest the others gave her a smack. 

""Back before,"" Kash started again, ""the world was like my hands."" He held them up to show the children, before balling them into two fists. His hands were brown and wrinkled from age, his knuckles like knots in a tree. ""The world was old, mostly round and full of rich life."" He pointed to the freckles on his hands as he made the last point. ""Back then, the sun would hang in the sky a friendly yellow."" He motioned upwards, and the children turned to look briefly at the red light that sat there today. ""But then,"" His hands turned from fists into splayed palms and fingers in one quick motion. ""The world changed. It split, it cracked and lost its shape. People and animals disappeared over time. The ground used to be green you know, but after the cataclysm it turned brown and black."" He traced the shape of one of his hands with the other. ""The world was no longer round, it was disfigured. The world no longer held rich life, but instead carried death. The sun dropped from the sky and never returned. The only thing that remained the same was it's age. Old.""

""Shortly after the world changed, there lived two people. A man and a woman. They lived,"" Kash said slowly, pointing to the tip of his index finger, ""At the top of the world.""

""*Ha-Merha.*"" whispered one of the boys from the back. 

""Yes,"" Kash felt a grin tug on his cheeks. ""*Ha-Merha*. *The Old Crown*. So atop *Ha-Merha* lived two people. The man, he was named Renwit. It meant in a language long lost: Warmth. And the woman, she was Sehyl. In the same language it means: Light. 

""In these days the world was full of evil. People were scared of the death that walked the world, they were unsure of why the world had changed, and they wanted the sun to come back. They were so afraid of what had happened that they lost the goodness that was in their hearts and minds. From the bottom of the world to the top, the light of the world began to fade. Men could not see their own two hands in front of them. They stumbled around in the darkness, thinking evil thoughts and doing evil things. Even though they knew the light was fading these men and women did what they pleased. They would lie, they would cheat, steal and kill. Their sins took the light from the world, but even then they did not change their ways.

""At *Ha-Merha* the light had not yet faded, but it was close. It is like the last flicker of a candle at this time. Soon the wax will disappear, the wick will go out and the world will be enshrouded in darkness. *Ha-Merha*, was the last place in the world where light still existed. And this was all because of Renwit and Sehyl. 

""Renwit was a blacksmith. Before the cataclysm he had worked in a forge, smelting iron and steel for people. But now there was little light and little warmth, he could never maintain a forge. Without his forge, Renwit helped people in different ways. He was truthful, he tended wounds, and he gave away his meager possessions to the needy. Sehyl, before and after the cataclysm was a beggar-woman. She hadn't any food or money. Her hair had once been a bright red, but the dust and dirt of the world had turned it a murky brown. 

""One day, Sehyl was begging in the streets when she saw Renwit. He was walking around, bread in hand, and breaking it for all those without. Sehyl ran up to him and asked for bread. She was hungry, you see; hadn't eaten in days. Renwit saw this woman in the gloomy light and knew that she had been living on the streets for years. He took her back to his house, for he felt sorry for this woman, more so than any of the others. He cleaned Sehyl and fed her. When he washed her hair, day after day, he noticed that it was no longer brown, but rather a fierce red."" Kash pointed to the sky. ""Just like the sun above.

""After caring for her, both Renwit and Sehyl realised that they meant a lot to each other. None of you children would know it yet, but one day you will experience this thing. It was love. And this was love of the purest kind. The kind that can make a poor person rich, make brown hair red..."" Kash paused. ""Make the darkness turn to light. 

""Renwit and Sehyl lived in the same house for many years. They helped people in need together. Sehyl knew what it was like to be poor, she knew what these people needed. With Sehyl's knowledge and Renwit's experience they helped most people in *Ha-Merha*. While the rest of the world took, Renwit and Sehyl gave. They were the only shining lights in a world of darkness. Many more years passed and the light faded from the world entirely. So much so, that even the light of Renwit and Sehyl had no effect. A man could not see past his nose and Renwit and Sehyl could no longer see each other in the darkness. Sehyl missed looking into Renwit's eyes and Renwit could no longer see Sehyl's vibrant hair. Not being able to see the person you love is the greatest tragedy of all, and there was nothing to be done about it. 

""So one day, Sehyl decided that she needed to see her love once more, even if only for a second. She took all her light, some of the last light that was in the world, and she gave it to Renwit. For a moment, and only a moment, mind you, Sehyl was glowing a beautiful red, and the two lovers looked into each other's eyes for the last time. Sehyl's light grew brighter and brighter, and slowly she disappeared. Renwit called out for her, but she was not there. All that was left of her, was the vibrant red light that she had given to him. *Ha-Merha* had light once more, but Sehyl would never see it. 

""Renwit realised that the light had been a final gift from Sehyl, and perhaps a little bit of her lived on inside it. He wanted the whole world to see this light, and so for many years he though of how he could do this. One day, he saw his old forge, and like *that*,"" Kash exclaimed with a snap of the fingers. ""He knew what to do. He heated his old forge up again, for Sehyl had now given light enough to do so, and Renwit worked. His forge grew hotter than ever before, and a warmth that the world had not known for years danced across *Ha-Merha!*

""For twenty four years he was at his forge, slowly crafting something. Something giant and metal. Something to bring light to the world. It was finished after these numerous years of work, and it was a large metal orb, bigger than anything you've ever seen. He opened it up, and put his final gift from Sehyl inside. The sphere began to glow a bright red, just like his long gone lover's hair and Renwit was reminded of her in all her beauty. But he was not done yet. Renwit knew, that in order to make the whole world bright again, this sphere would need to visit every place that was now enshrouded in dark. Renwit gave all his strength and all the light that was in him, and he gave it to the sphere. He disappeared and his light, like Sehyl's was living in the sphere. After all these years, the two were reunited again. 

""Renwit and Sehyl gave all their power to this sphere, and it lifted up to the sky, bright and powerful and warm. In the sky the two lovers walked along, hand in hand together, and slowly they traveled across the sky and brought light to all the world. The two still do this every day."" Kash smiled, satisfied with himself. ""And to answer your question, little one."" He said looking at Meng. ""Look to the sky, and see that the sun is as red as Sehyl's hair, as warm as Renwit's forge, and that it walks across and looks on us like two lovers, together forever.""

Meng looked to the sky and smiled as she saw. The sun was red, bright and made it's way across the sky. The other children looked too, and they all saw that it was true. ",Geemantle

As the emerald green light sprinted throughout the air towards the not a year old boy something strange happened. As the light made contact with the boy he wasn't struct lifeless, instead a lightning bolt scar was burnt  into him, searing his flesh. It laid right above his forehead. Voldemort stood with an electrifying shock flowing throughout him, thoughts racing back and forth throughout him, what if a simple child could out duel him with magic? What if I've grown to weak to use a curse? The fear the man went through was greater than the pain Draco was going through.

[WP] You're a highschool basketball coach who is almost certain one of the team members is Richard Nixon,etevian,"It began nearly three years ago. During Basketball tryout's. It was just like any other.... until HE appeared. The child who would become the focus of your obsession. His name, if it is his real name, was Nichard Rixon, and he was the best high school basketball player you've ever seen. Everyone in the room cheered after his performance... everyone except you. Something just felt off about the kid, mainly because he actually looked like an adult awkwardly pretending he was a high school kid. You shrugged it off, being the coach of the team you knew that your players were often more developed then the other students anyway, but as the days wen't on, your suspicions grew.

It started small, a smug face there, an outdated reference here, but it got more noticeable in the second year. He began giving impassioned speeches about Communism and the Vietnam War, he threw up the deuces all the time, and whenever anyone accused him of anything, ANYTHING, he'd shout out ""I AM NOT A CROOK!"" would throw up some more deuces and shuffle down the hallway. Except for that one time when he was on the second floor and he jumped out a window. It all seemed so... familiar. Finally, two weeks before the state finals, you pulled Nichard aside for a talk.

""What do you need coach?""

""Okay so this may sound weird but uh...""

""Have I done something wrong?""

""No, I just-""

""I AM NOT A CROOK!""

""Yes.... I know.... look i'd just like to ask... are you a former President of the United States?"" Nichard didn't react, he seemed scared. ""Nichard are you-""

""I am not a crook!"" And then he ran off just like always. You attempted to talk to him again four times, all of which ended the same way. You should have let it rest, you should have moved on.... but you couldn't, you knew that Nichard wasn't  who he said he was, and you were going to prove it. That night, you bought a video camera from a nearby store, and began to monitor him.

Over the course of the next year you proceeded to learn anything you could about the man. Where he ate, where he slept, where he bought hair extensions, etc. You were careful, you made sure not to get caught.... but it wasn't enough, because now, right in front of you, stands Nichard Rixon. He's wearing his number 68 jersey, a gun in his hand, pointed right at you.

""How's it going coach?""

""How.... how did you find out?""

""I've seen you every day at school for the last two years.... it wasn't hard to pick you out in a crowd."" You frown, you should have known that a trench coat and sunglasses wouldn't be enough.

""Where's the kids?""

""They left with Cassie, she didn't take well to finding out I was stalking a student."" Nichard smirked, a familiar smirk.... where had you seen it before... and then it finally dawned on you, your eye's grew wide and judging by his reaction, Nichard noticed.

""So.... you've finally figured it out.""

""The voice, the hair, the deuces, the catchphrase.... it's so obvious.""

""Go ahead..."" The gun's hammer clicks. ""Say my name"".

""Kennedy."" Nichard stands there.... not moving.

""What?""

""Your John F. Kennedy.... it all makes sense now."" Nichard takes a step back, shocked. You've done it, you've solved the mystery.

""That's.... no... that's not it.""

""Am I close?""

""No.""

""Oh.... Roosevelt?"" The gun fires, your vision goes black, the last thing you see is the face of Teddy Roosevelt... or maybe Gerald Ford, your not sure.",nazothedark
[WP] You're a highschool basketball coach who is almost certain one of the team members is Richard Nixon,etevian,"It's day three of training camp and I have a weird suspicion that one of the new players trying out is... some reincarnated form of Richard Nixon. On the court he is easily angered by opposing players and seemingly spends all game trying to get back at them. Now that's not too out of the ordinary, but get this. One day, during tryouts I asked the players to run up and down the bleachers. Every time he reached the bottom of the stairs he would look outward with a smug expression and threw up the deuces. The first time it happened I laughed about it, thinking it just to be a lame high school joke, but then he continued to do it, eight times in a row! I pulled him aside, ""What are you some sort of Nixon impersonator?!"", ""Who's Nixon?"", he replied, and then he ran off to the locker room. Today I caught two students breaking into the sports office trying to flip threw the athletic files. Guess who they say is behind it.",YaBoyFrom

Daniel analysed the sentence before slowly raising his head to look at the other coach. This wasn't how he tought his morning would go.

-I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, so, go on ?

-Well, just look at him !

He vaguely gestured towards the basketball field. Daniel, relieved, started observing the player number 6, a young man named Dick. 

-He's … really bad at basketball ?

-No. Well, that too. It wouldn't be so bad if he stopped yelling at his teammates every time they try to criticize him. But, I mean, you don't see anything weird ?

-No, I really don't. What do you mean ?

-He's not … He's not as athletic as a boy his age should be, is he ?

-That's cruel John. He's out of breath a bit quickly, yes, but …

-He has the body of a 60 years old man !

-Now, that's just mean.

-And look at his hair !

-I should point out that you too have a receding hair line.

-What about the grey then ? Why does he have grey hair ?

-You know, sometimes, Mother Nature is not fair.

-His way of talking is very strange for a highschooler.

-Don't get too personnal John.

-And I'm pretty sure he bought the last match. We wouldn't have won otherwise.

-You're being ridiculous. Our team is strong enough to …

He would probably have finished this sentence had number 8 not knocked out both himself and one of his teammates by trying to pass the ball.

-Anyway, who do you think he is, if not a normal highschooler ? Blatter ? Berlusconi ? Nixon ?

The other coach stayed silent for a moment. Never once did he take his eyes off the « suspicious » player.

-Honestly ? Nixon ? Well, there's only one way to be sure. Ask him if he's a crook.

-Okay, now you're mocking me.

-I don't know man, we could have a very serious Watergate situation on our hands here. Maybe the journalism club could help. They are excellent writers after all, have you seen their horoscope section ?

John could only sigh. He would never hear the end of this. Well, he thought, that could have been worse. At least I didn't talk about the striking ressemblance between number 2 and Theodore Roosevelt.

These words of desperation were sadly not helping my case as I sat alongside several others in a shoddy, run-down boat being driven by 'Hagreeed', the local Gnome and gamekeeper who was less than a metre high.

""'Ello, kiddays."" He sniffed, wiping his nose on the soddy, rain-covered jumper coating his frail body. ""Me name's Hagreeed. Welcome to Blobwarts.""

A rather pitiful island loomed out of the mist. It was barren and devoid of plants life, bar a few throng bushes and vines. A small, crumbling brick building was the only building there. A couple of miserable-looking students milled around, drenched in the downpour and battered by the wind.

A couple hundreds metres away, Hagreeeed stopped the boat.

With that, Hagreeeed jumped out of the boat, sending a small, cloudy wave into it. A few dead fish floated around our feet. Looking at the other two students glumly, I beckoned for them to follow me.

---

""Welcome one! Welcome all! Welcome to BLOBWARTS!"" A hairless, cackling old lady screeched, lit up against the sky like some kind of hideous lightbulb. ""The school of Warlockcraft and Magery!""

I led the other two students up towards her, starting to reconsider my decision to get out of the boat. Suicide was still an option, hopefully.

""I am Valbeese Mumblebore! Please, follow me to the Sorting Celebration!"" She gestured with one cracked, limp hand. I followed, as I didn't really feel like Valbeese was a very friendly customer. One by one, we three followed the cackling witch into the stone building. It was roofless and small, and contained four rooms. There was a main gathering area, lit by a Plasma-screen TV playing static.

""Tonight, you shall be sorted into your houses! The four houses are..."" Valbeese pulled up a list and scrutinised it carefully. She muttered to herself, trying to remember how to prounounce the things. ""Eagledor, Witherin, Pufflehuff and Penguintoe!"" She grinned, clearly quite pleased at remembering the names.

""Now then! Before that, dig in to our delicious, gourmet feast sponsored by Nokia!"" She waved her hands wildly, and a small lump of mouldy cheese fell into the ground. 

Nobody touched it. Not even the ten other students who were clearly acquaintanced with this sort of thing.

""Well! Now that you've all enjoyed that feast, I have a couple of words to say!"" Valbeese consulted her list. ""Tomatoes, Potatoes, Peanut Butter- Oh, this is my shopping list."" She frowned concernedly, as did the rest of us. Albeese clearly wasn't quite... Right.

""Anyway, it's time for the sorting rock to sing his song!"" She gestured towards a round rock sitting next to her.

It said nothing.

Valbeese began to sing, but only after crouching behind the rock and taking on a gravelly tone.

""I'm the rock. Lah lah lah, Hogwarts sucks, lah lah lah, Valbeese is cool, lah lah lah, this school rules, lah lah lah.""

Valbeese stood up. ""Why thank you for that gripping performance! It might just be the best one we've had yet! And now, the sorting!""

Valbeese picked up the round rock and carefully placed it on the bedraggled girl's head who sat next to me.

""Mimpypimpskins Touvoudoloo!"" She whispered in her gravelly tone. The girl looked confused and scratched her head. 

""That's not my name, mis-"" She gulped as Valbeese's eyes twitchined and her cracked, dry hands clenched. 

""Shut up, bitch."" She sneered, slapping Mimpypimpskins across the face.

""Anyway, let's continue. What house should this little prick be sorted into?"" She asked the rock. 

The rock said nothing.

""Really? You reccomend she is to be thrown out? What a shame."" Valbeese muttered. ""But we're running low on dinner supplies, so we might as well use her.""

Valbeese hummed to herself as she used magical string to bind the girl and began marking where exactly she would cut to exact the best meat.

I sighed. I was stuck here for another seven years, and right now I was pretty envious of Mimpy.

He gasped with shock from the cold, and pulled the cloak his father had given him tightly around his shoulders. Enchanted with warmth and waterproofing charms, it was the only thing that made the hours they had spent on the boat tolerable. Beside him, Amir shivered, and not for the first time, eyed Will's cloak with envy. His parents were from Afghanistan, and had not thought to give him an enchanted cloak to guard against the weather. Will looked away guiltily. The howled, and not for the first time, Will thought he could hear his mother's voice, filling him with shame. Sighing, he unbuckled the cloak from his shoulders and gestured Amir closer. Will wrapped the cloak around both their shoulders like a blanket. it wasn't quite as warm as it had been for just Will, but at least the guilt was gone.

""Thhhhh..Thanks,"" Amir said with a chatter. 

""Don't mention it,"" Will said dryly. The boys didn't have much in common, and they fell into silence once more, leaving Will free with his thoughts. It had only been a month ago that he had gotten his letter from Hogwarts with the word REJECTED printed across the top in bright red ink. No one wanted to admit it, but William knew the reason was because of his blood. Pure, half, or muggle-born, it didn't matter. Hogwarts had a place for you.... as long as you were from England. For an eleven year old American boy living in London however, Hogwarts was full. 

His father had been outraged of course, and had used his connections to appeal to the headmaster, the head of the Department of Magical Education, and the minister of magic himself, but it didn't matter. The headmaster stonewalled him, the head of the Department of Magical Education had smiled sadly, and the minister had gulped nervously when his father had promised to donate piles of galleons to his opponent in the upcoming election, but no one lifted even a finger to help him, and so, Will's mother had signed him up for an alternative school. She had gone to visit it herself before term started, and she assured Will it was just as breathtaking as Hogwarts, and was just a short plane ride away from London. She had neglected to mention the boat however, and for that, Will found himself feeling rather bitter. 

A grunt from behind him broke Will from his reverie. It came from Sindri, a tall blonde haired, blue eyed man with a face that looked like a statue and an attitude to match. Will could count on his fingers the number of words the man had said since his parents dropped him off at the docks. Will thought it was just a cough at first, but then, cries from the other students made him look up. 

They were approaching a black sand beach, dominated on one side by a cliff of jagged black stone, and flanked by a forest of dark green pine trees filled with fog. On top of the cliff, a castle projected upward like a dagger, made of the same black stone as the cliff. 

""Wow..."" Amir whispered, ""this is better than Hogwarts."" 

For the first time since leaving London, Will found himself smiling. Behind him, he heard Sindri's slow deep voice say, ""*Welcome, to the BiFrost Academy of Magic.*""",-serious-

Most of them wore their home clothes, which were oversized hand-me-downs. Their pants were too short, and their shoes had tongues. 

Barry Hatter looked forlornly at the train. A group of kids had taken his lunch and any money he had on him while the adults looked on impassively. It seemed like it was a common occurrence. His bleeding nose had left crusty red streaks on his jumper. 

His red-headed assailant was 11 like he was, but much taller at six feet. His clothes were stretched tightly across his muscular body when he lifted Barry up and threw him against the wall. 

If Barry were a full-powered wizard, his magic should have activated to defend him but he was a Hogwarts' reject, and all it did was spark around him trying to call for help. Determined to still pursue a career in magic, he had applied to Lizardstail, a unaccredited school. 

He remembered with a shudder when Adam looked into his eyes as he searched through his pockets. Barry felt helpless and alone. 

Reminiscing, Barry gripped his knuckles tight, vowing to take his revenge on Adam, and headed towards the rickety wooden towers that was Lizardstail.

------

At sorting, Headmaster Trump sat at the head of the hall. He was very old with a combover and a patchy beard. Barry thought he looked regal in his massively decorated robes. But he soon noticed that Headmaster Trump's eyes looked every female student up and down. Once he had his fill, he annnounced, ""we will now begin the sorting!""

-----

""Gryffindor!"" The sorting hat announced, sharing a sly wink with Headmaster Trump, as the girl took off the sorting hat. Gryffindor was the house Headmaster Trump supervised, and Barry noticed that Gryffindor had a vastly disproportionate number of girls.

Soon it was Barry's turn. The sorting hat deliberated.

""Such delicious thoughts of revenge you have. It's very clear you're a Slytherin.""

Barry felt the blood drain from his face. Adam was a Slytherin.

""No, no, no, please not Slytherin!"" Barry begged.

""Slytherin!"" The hat announced. Barry's hands shook as he took the smelly hat off.

Adam looked at him grimly, a head taller than the rest, as Barry joined the Slytherin group. They were mostly boys and none of them looked at Barry particularly kindly.

------

Soon, the welcome feast was over, and Barry made his way to his bedroom. With a sigh, he pushed the door and entered. Adam and his group were sitting around on the beds. Past them was a bed magically labelled 'Barry'.

""Out boys, I have something private to teach Barry."" Adam said, without taking his eyes off Barry.

The boys laughed and snickered in their way out, as Barry's heart pounded in his chest, hate and fear rising in his throat.
With the boys gone, Adam's eyes softened and his upright posture relaxed. He smiled, almost awkwardly.

Adam approached until he was just a breath away. Barry winced, his body braced for another beating. 

""I just want to say sorry,"" Adam whispered.

""What?"" Barry said loudly, startled. Adam covered his mouth. 

""Shhh, quiet! They are listening outside the door. I didn't want to hurt you, but the boys were going to do worse to you.""

Barry looked at his blood-streaked sweater. Adam nodded, ""yes, worse."" 

""Thank you, I guess."" Barry whispered.

""Just pretend with me. Make some pained sounds and later act like you'll are my flunky, and you'll be ok.""

""Why do you even put up with them?""

""Survival of the fittest. If I don't lead them, I'd be at their mercy. And there'd be no one to save you.""

So Adam and Barry did their best to convince that Barry was getting a thrashing in the room and that Barry agreed to do everything that Adam commanded. 

Adam opened the door, with Barry pretending to cower under his blankets. 

""Let's go boys! I think Barry's had enough for tonight,"" Adam said and shut the door behind him. Barry peeped up from beneath his blanket, wondering what he had gotten himself into.",rayn13

I like the little details you added to humanize Ian. Also, I kind of felt you made the story and the characters ""more Brit"". I made the characters and setting British on a whim, but honestly I know very little about UK culture and literature, so I like the little improvements.
Also, good idea you started your first chapter with Ian, who, of all my characters is the most human, and I think, easiest for the audience to empathize with.


Can't wait to read your chapters on other team-members, from their perspective POVs :) 


Good idea with introducing King Arthur. In the original teamup, I only mentioned Excalibur, as a literary shorthand for ""something symbolically British"", but I like the way you used it as a plot device to introduce a new antagonist (or is it?) and a plotline.


About the only criticism I could think of is that you changed the description of some characters slightly. In your story, Ian is skinny and  scrawny, but in my prompt he was more of a stocky oaf. Also, Maggie was definitely not Old (neither looks-wise or by the standards of other team members).

That's why the moon is bigger.

""But the sun resented the moon, and did all he could to become bigger and brighter. What? I don't know, he used supplements. That's not the point.

Some exploded, some got so big they imploded under their own weight. It means they collapsed. Yes, black holes. Most of them just left, though, and stopped hanging with the sun altogether. They'd go out with the moon instead, because she was willing to share her light. The moon reflects the light from the sun? Then why is it white, when the sun is yellow? Yeah.

[WP]: You are a cyborg chef working a cursed street cart.,polerix,"Darkness seeped into the coastal streets, strengthened by the mists rolling in from the sea. I sympathized with the lampposts lining the cobblestone: lone protectors of humanity, all they had to defend themselves against the ice-cold wind and might of nature was a night's worth of oil. With no companion besides the gentle lapping of the waves, a handful of benches and a smaller handful of shrubs, the poles seemed lonely and forlorn. Shuddering and snuggling tighter in my woolen coat, I increased my walking speed to a brisk pace. This was a night to snuggle up by a warm, crackling fire, not to roam the streets. If only I had a fire to snuggle up to.

Instead, I was stuck in a cramped three-party apartment with grouchy cat lady Ms. formerly Mrs. formerly Ms. formerly Mrs. formerly Ms.Tupps and Jack, single father with two six-year old girls. I suppose it wasn't all bad: The girls didn't cry every night anymore, and now that I was actually bringing money there was recorded evidence of the woman saying nice things. One. At least. I had it memorized: ""You may smell worse than a rat's bum, boy, but at least you make an honest living.""

Ironically, I had encountered two bums that day, neither of which belonged to rats nor were literally bums, and the most honest thing about my work was my admitting it immoral. That was the first night scamming: I of course managed to find the most dangerous district to do so and ran into two goblin beggars with hearing keen enough to hear the soft clink of what little I got. Fortunately, they were blessed with few other physical attributes, and proved no match for my raw physical power. 

Ever since that day, my life became one of crime. Stroll down to the crowded docks, give clueless foreigners recitations on my starving children or sick wife or upcoming international quest, and make my way home, pockets full of gold, in time for single father's dinner. Incredible talent, that: his cooking kept all five of us well-fed with healthy food and entertained his girls for hours. My thieving, his cooking, and grumpy's grumbling. One big happy family.

I said that in jest, but then again, I felt guilt starting to creep up inside me, probably keeping pace with the moon (obscured by clouds, so hard to tell for sure). The girls always liked to play with the funny-looking money I brought in, and the father got very irritable if all of Ms.Tupps's complaints were dumped on him. No doubt home was a high-stress environment as they gave up on waiting, settling in their beds. 

But then again, it might have been good that I was late. Entire docks locked down for some queen's arrival. Guards crawling everywhere. Sullen thieves and scammers just like me prowling the streets - some of whom recognized me for easy prey. Apparently it takes a lot longer to get out of the harbor through rooftops and pausing to hide every ten seconds. Who knew.

And now I would return, empty-handed, unless there was someone somehow still on the streets I could trick-

""Dinner, after lunch, and supper! It will make you faster, tougher! It will bulge your arms and veins! It will give you muscle gains!"" someone roared into the night, hidden in the mist. How convenient. Curious and hoping to find someone gullible, I walked forward as the guttural chanting continued. ""It will empower your blood, your spleen! It will make you rough and mean! It will course through your intestines! It will make you uncontested! It will - hah, I knew it! I sang, and you came! Welcome to the Meat Wagon!""

A giant wagon had indeed loomed out of the darkness. Its red tattered cloak was illuminated by an old lantern dangling from the aft. The smell of roasted meat eagerly trickled into my nose, no doubt satisfied once it heard my stomach rumble. But it was not my hunger that I focused on, but the vendor, or the top half I could see over the wagon anyway. A massive, grey hunk of flesh looming over me, he had no hair at all and was naked save for a dirty apron tied around his midriff. Flakes of metal were jutting out of his body and one of his eyes had no pupil and glowed bright green. He clutched a massive cleaver in his right hand, and slammed a giant piece of meat right on the counter as I approached. What contents of the wagon weren't blocked by him were hidden in shadow.

""I have been waiting long time for you! Fattening up would be good for you, yes?""

""I... I'm not sure I do, sir. My job requires me to keep quite limber.""

""Bah! Nonsense! You need meat! Look!"" Without looking away from me, he rummaged in the back of the wagon, then triumphantly pulled out a dirty mirror. My worried reflection stared back at me. ""See?! Skinny, pale boy! Little wisp of mustache! Arms like chicken bones! Scared blue eyes! Meat make you grow, make you like me!""

I glanced up at him, shuddering inadvertently. What even was he? ""I'm... I'm not sure that's a good idea, sir. I'm sorry, but I really must be going-""

""Bah! You're scared! You think meatman strong, I no strong, meatman eat me! But when you eat meat, you no scared of no one!""

""I'm not scared of you, I just-""

""Maybe not scared of me, scared of this one though!"" Again, he rummaged in the wagon, then threw something onto the street. Someone. A black-haired man looked up, wild-eyed, then snarled as he saw me. ""You brat! You won't get away this time!""

I jumped back, startled, then flailed my arms and swung unsuccessfully as he tackled me. My heart pounded furiously as I remembered the hours near Bale Inn, waiting for this lout and his cronies to go away. What the hell?!

He smashed me into the wagon, wrapping his hands around my throat. I desperately tried to swat him off, but his tattooed arms were much stronger than mine. A few moments of struggle followed, but I could feel the world closing in around me, going dark. So this was the end. Somehow I was not even that afraid -

Suddenly, he dangled above me, legs helplessly kicking the air, then flew off into the mist. After a few seconds, I heard a faint splash. ""See boy?! You weak! You get eaten out there if you don't do something!""

I jumped up, adrenaline anxious to burn up, and yelled, ""What the hell was that?! Who are you? How did you know who he was?!""

""I am the owner of the Meat Wagon! I know all! Now, eat!"" As he waved his cleaver at the chunk on the counter, rational thought carefully tiptoed back into my brain. He must have... he must have been at the tavern. He must have seen me, and decided to follow... decided to guess where I would go. Yes. And now I would politely refuse and promptly leave.

""I... I thank you very much, sir, for looking out for me, but I don't see things that scare me very often, and when I do I can run away, so thank you, but -""

""Nonsense! You see them all the time!"" Once more, the vendor rummaged in his wagon. I stepped back, raising clenched fists instinctively, but even so I jumped when he smashed a cage onto the counter. Inside it was a black cat, who promptly hissed at me. No... That was impossible...

""You live with this thing! Belong to one Ms.Tupps, yes? Every night jump on you, wake you up, claw you, scare you! With meat, no more!"" He spun the cage so the door was facing the meat, then casually unhooked it. Instead of leaping out like I assumed, the cat shrank away from it, fur standing on its end. For the first time tonight, I took a good look at the meat.

It was almost as gray as the vendor, although there were splotches of red here and there. Little hairs grew on a patch of it and slime oozed in a puddle around it. Bile rose up in my throat as I looked away, up into the mist. ""Take it! No price! Me want you to be very strong! Me want you to be smart!""

Still not looking at him, heart racing, I bit my lip. Think think think! What strengths did he have? Well, strength, and he knew where I lived, and he wasn't human, and he knew where I lived, and he was inhumanly strong and - ""It's right there! Reach out your hand and bite it!"" He slammed the cleaver into his counter, sending little pieces of wood sailing into the air.

Weakness... weaknesses... think, think... Well, if he was in a wagon, and he was humongous, then he probably couldn't move very quickly... ""Boy! What are you waiting-"" but the words suddenly found themselves without an audience as I sprinted back the way I came, feet thudding against the cobblestones.

This is your 12th iteration.",rubynew,"I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard someone say “life isn’t a video game, you can’t just return to your last saved point when you screw up.” And while that is true for most people, it’s not true for me. I’m not sure what happened when I turned 15, but something has anchored my existence, my consciousness, my soul, or what have you to the morning of September 25th 2003.

The first time around was completely normal, I lived my life hitting all the major milestones; college, wife, kids, retirement, brain cancer… yeah that last one is a bitch. Maybe it was the radiation treatment, made me into some kind of superhero, I don’t know. What I do know is that one moment I’m in unimaginable pain from the damn grapefruit size tumor in my skull, the edges of my vision constricting into a tight dark tunnel and a feeling a suffocating fear, and the next I’m opening my eyes to the sound of birds singing merrily outside my window. Obviously I thought I’d died and gone to heaven, strange that my heaven would be the tiny second bedroom in the apartment my mom rented throughout my years in high school, but where else could I be?

What followed next, my mom coming and singing happy birthday with my favorite chocolate chip pancakes, can only be described as massively realistic and confusing Deja Vu. I definitely freaked my mom out by asking here if this was real and how I was back in 2003

After finally coming to terms with the reality of my situation, having been thrust back in time to my sophomore year in High School, I did what everybody fantasizes of doing: correctly all my major fuck-ups, going after opportunities I missed, etc. etc. Let me tell you, it’s kind of over rated and definitely gets old after a few runs, where you keep dying with regrets. So by life number seven I started to indulge in the darker fantasies that everyone has, but almost no one is will to admit to harboring.

I did some truly horrible things, things that should condemn you to the deepest darkest pits of hell… If there is a hell. I did them out of spite and cynicism. What’s the worst that could happen? They’ll sentence me to death when they finally catch me? And they did always catch me. But of course death meant nothing to me, I just got revived at my last “saved point”.

But even completely giving yourself over to carnal desires is not enough to sustain you, and with my last life, number 11, I decided to try something different and see if I could break myself out of this loop. I figured that maybe if I could destroy physical self thoroughly enough that I wouldn’t wake up again on my 15th birthday. Have you ever seen the videos of the Buddhist monks burning themselves alive? Yeah, that’s not very fun, and also apparently not destructive enough. So now I’m on life number 12; I really applied myself this time, did really well in school, went to a prestigious college, and got my BS in Physics, then a Masters in Applied Physics, and finally a PhD. in Nuclear Physics. Why Nuclear Physics you may ask? Am I trying to understand my situation on a quantum level to unravel the mysteries of my tortured existence? Not quite, though if my current plan doesn’t work, then maybe next time.

I am currently sitting in front of an armed nuclear warhead, with my finger hovering over the enter key that will detonate the C4 charge I’ve placed on it. Will my actions start WWIII? Maybe. Will I kill a great deal of innocent people? Unfortunately. Will the detonation rip my body apart to a subatomic level erasing my existence from this plane of existence? I can only hope.

At first I spent a lot of time watching machines pump nutrients and fluid straight into my veins. Obsessed over the regular beating of my heart. Confused as to why the nurses didn't seem bothered by the fact that already one full year had passed of my seemingly lifeless body laying motionless in the hospital bed. 
Next I spent much too long watching over past family and friends. When so much time has gone by that the visits dwindled down to nothing, I decided instead to visit them. This only proved torturous. I couldn't help them, I couldn't interact. I couldn't pull them into an embrace and tell them how much they meant to me. To not forget me. 
Useless. 
But it finally happened. I finally discovered the ""why"" even while the ""how"" remained unanswered. 
I was coming back from a visit with my parents. I'd watched over one of their family dinners. They still had a seat at the table set up in my place and the sad fact that I would probably never join them there made me ache. 
It had grown dark and the journey back to the hospital was long, but I didn't know where else to go except spend the night for the thousandth time monitoring my own breathing and praying my eyes would reopen by morning. 
I always passed a few people on the way back who of course never acknowledged my presence. Probably because to them I didn't actually exist. I passed a woman though and she didn't seem to notice a man following behind her a little ways down the street. He was catching up fast. I followed along side her for a bit, nervously checking on the man who edged nearer. I wished I could tell her to pull out her phone and check over her shoulder. Or slip inside the convent store at the corner of the next street. Unfortunately, she didn't make it that far. The man finally gave up the discreetness and jogged to catch up with her, shoving her between two buildings out of sight and pinning her up against a wall. I watched in horror, not knowing what to do. She attempted to scream in terror until a knife was pressed up against her throat. 
The panic in her eyes made me buckle. 
I couldn't stand it. 
I pressed myself between them, more fluidly than I thought possible. 
""Stop,"" I told the man, staring straight into his eyes. But he was looking through me, at her onset of tears. 
""Don't fight me,"" he said to her, his tone dangerous. 
""Stop."" I said again, louder. I tried to push up against him, push him away from her. I pushed so hard I suddenly fell forward.
No, not forward, inside. My soul merged with his form and suddenly I was blinking from his eyes, my hands were holding the knife to her neck. I dropped it and took a step back. 
""Go,"" I told her, surprised to hear his voice say the words I had thought out loud. I felt tired. Weary. Tense. Feeling I hadn't had in years. 
The woman didn't take much time before bolting. I gave her plenty of time before walking out of the alley and gazing around with these new eyes. I was still mesmerized by my hands. And feet. This body I had possessed. But how long did it last? How did I escape again?
The answer came to me quite easily. 
I closed my eyes, the mans whose body I was in, and stepped out of myself. He crumpled to the ground, asleep, and I looked down upon him again. 
So that was it. 
That easy.

I don't really follow the news so the initial shock only set in about 16 hours after the ""Elimination"".

I don't really despise the plan but my dream of being an actor in the USA is a bit dented.
From what I've heard, the countries that weren't wiped out plan to join into one nation and continue living normally, if normal involved forgetting the billions of people who disappeared on March 1st, 2016.

"[WP] Every single person, animal, and living creature down to bacteria vanishes from the physical territory of the United States, China, and India. This is the aftermath.",Alashion,"A virus isn't a living thing. 

That's what I learned back in my middle school biology class. I remember this because of the way steam seemed to billow out from Mr. Tanaka's ears as he irately corrected our class dunce on the subject matter. 

8 years ago, that was more or the less the case. Viruses weren't sentient, no matter how organized or tactical they appeared to be. HIV, Influenza, Ebola- none of these were examples of living contagion. They were simply cold, inanimate parasites. Nothing more. Nothing less. 

Funny how one big discovery can suddenly revolutionize an idea that science had once regarded as law. For viruses, this discovery came in the form of EX. First discovered in the city of Los Angeles in California, EX took hold of the entire city within a single day, and the outbreak would go down in history as one of the worst epidemics known to mankind. Long story short, EX spread rapidly, almost exceedingly so, and decimated the entire population of not only the United States, but China and India as well before it was contained and quarantined from the rest of the world. 

""Ryuuji! It's almost time to go!"" my sister shouted from downstairs, ""You better hurry or I'm going to leave you behind!"" 

""Give me a second!"" I yelled back, as I scrambled to jam the rest of my belongings into my suitcase. 

I'd been packing for a while now. Alongside the suitcase by my feet, I had two other similar bags waiting to be carried out of the house. If only I had made a proper checklist, then the number of packed bags would have been three hours ago! 

""Dad says we have to go now!"" There was a touch of frustration starting to creep into her tone, ""I'm seriously going to leave you!"" 

Feeling the pressure now, and not wanting to keep my family waiting any longer, I gave up on the task of finding my favorite baseball cap, and rushed down the stairs with my bags- one being significantly lighter than the others. 

""Took you long enough"" she pouted, as I stowed my bags into the trunk of our van. 

""Sorry. I just wanted to make sure that I had everything. You know, since-"" I gazed back at our house as I opened the car door, ""Since we're not coming back and all."" 

The thought of not being able to return to our house, the one that I had called home for the past 23 years... It was sad, to say the least. But it wasn't just us that had to leave. All of Japan- no, the rest of the remaining human population was given an evacuation notice 1 week ago. 

Turns out, the virus couldn't be researched enough for a proper vaccine to emerge in time. With the way it evolves so rapidly, and the fact that no human subjects left behind any physical trace upon dying from EX, it was an impossible task from the start. There was nothing we could do to truly stop EX from wiping humanity from the face of the Earth. Any countermeasure was simply a means to buy time. 

Hours went by during the car ride to the site. Dad remained silent and stoic, while Mom tried to distract my sister with stories from our childhood. I just tried not to cry as our house slowly drifted further and further away from my sight, until, eventually, even the view of our city melted into the horizon. 

Upon arriving at the evacuation site, everything was surprisingly more organized than I had anticipated. Workers carefully guided citizens to their designated seats, children remained unnaturally calm, and the rhythmic hum of the spaceship's engines loomed in the background. It was as if the crisis had been successfully averted, and everyone was just waiting in line for a field trip to the stars. 

When my turn finally came around, the worker greeted me politely, and directed me to my seat. As luck would have it, it was a window seat. After storing my bags into their assigned compartment, I quietly sat down and looked out the window to gaze upon our homeworld for what would likely be the final time. 

""Ryuuji"" I turned my head around to see my sister holding out a baseball cap in front of my face, ""I think I accidentally packed your hat with the rest of my stuff."" 

Surprised, I took the cap into my hands, and looked it over. Yep. It's mine, alright. 

""Thanks"" and my sister nodded as she took her own seat. 

And then, suddenly, I laughed. 

Not just because this cap had turned up out of nowhere, but because of the sheer ridiculousness our situation. To think that all life from Earth had been chased out by creatures that we had once deemed unworthy to be living... it's funny, yet sad, in a way.

*Enjoy your new home, EX.* I thought to myself as my laughter subsided. 

*We'll make sure to enjoy ours.* 

And as we lifted off from Earth into space, I could swear that I caught a glimpse of our house in the distance. 

This time truly being the last.

[IP] First Lady,Castriff,"Pink petals danced through the air, flittering in the spring breeze that carried them through the vast chamber. Crowds on both sides of the aisle watched the spectacle behind armed guards dressed in black, bearing their muskets. An auspicious occasion it was as the rabble poured in from all parts of the region to witness the crowning of their new queen. *Their true Queen*, she thought.

 Throughout the city, bells were chiming. Heralding the coming of the crown.

She kneeled before the Bishop. *Ordained by the Gods*, she thought bitterly.

The crown should be in her hands, she believed. To place upon her own head. Instead, despite all her work, her triumph had been checked by a man in robes fit for a concubine. She would bite the bullet to her pride now, but as he placed the crown upon her head she could feel her fingers tense. The ceremonies were fluff, she knew. All a show to appease the masses. She understood the point, they needed to see her rule as heaven endowed, but she never cared much for it.

*The gods didn't will this*, she thought, *I did. And I would be their queen regardless.*

The Bishop’s voice boomed as she arose, “Announcing Queen Cyrna. The First of her line.”

She turned to face the crowd. Haggard faces stared back. Some were soldiers, who bore the blue and red uniforms of their defiance, bearing bandaged wounds, while others shied away from her gaze. No man, woman, or child, dared to move or even speak, as the bells continued their thunderous toll.

She smiled. Regarding their silence as a sign of their fealty.

Petals continued to stream down, covering the broken tiles and debris that littered the floor.

She was surprised by how much they were able to clean up. A week ago the scene had been different. It was then when the city sat besieged. A ceremony where the roar of cannons and mortars sounded her arrival, and the clash of muskets and the crackling of gunfire heralded her approach. In the final days of the war they had breached the city’s sanctum. She remembered striding through the chamber crowded with corpses, with only the blood of the dead to mark the path to the throne.

 She looked to the Bishop beside her, and saw the sweat beading down his face.  *He fears me,* she knew,  *just as they do.*

She pitied him in his position, having to crown a notorious figure such as herself. However, the clergy still held much power, influence, and money. Far more than whatever she had left in the aftermath of her conquest. She would need that, and if he stood in the way, she would not hesitate to point the gun and pull the trigger. After all, power, she knew, was not something to be shared.

 He took her by the hand, and led her to the throne, and as she claimed her seat she felt the world open up to her. 

The feeling was fleeting though. Tempered by the knowledge that there would be opportunists, those who wished to drive the knife through her back and take what she had worked so hard to attain. There would be the coward king, who left his people to seek asylum from a lost war. He would surely contest her rule. Neighbouring rulers may try to take advantage of a weakened nation, war could soon beset them again. Pretenders to her throne may arise, wishing to depose her. Or even the populous themselves could fight her right to rule if they willed.

But she knew the game, and had played her hands well up to this point. She knew she could play them all.

 *And I will,* she promised

“Long Live Queen Cyrna.” The Bishop bellowed.

Her soldiers in black joined in the chant. Over time, most of the crowd had joined as well, wanting to gain her favour. She could still see blank faces amongst the crowd. The stubborn few who still refused to acknowledge her rule, hiding their detest amongst the clamour. But they would come around.

The chant grew louder as more joined. A smile crept across her lips, she breathed in the air still stained by gunsmoke and fire.

 Her work was far from over.

He turned to look at me as I walked in and I did my best to give him a smile, ""Hello Jason how are you today?""

""Who are you?"" He asked. He must have had at least twenty time police talk to him in the last twenty-four hours.

""My name is Alexis."" I said showing off a fake smile, I liked to do this,
I liked to give them a few moments to talk with me. I know in the end it doesn't matter, but to me it's important.

He sat up. ""And why are you here, come to interrogate me again? I told you I'm not a time traveler, I've never even tried it.""

""No, I'm just here to talk with you. Do you mind if I come in your cell?""

He stared at me for a long time before giving a very slight nod. I slowly opened his cell and stepped in sitting next to him on his cot. ""So, Jason what was your plan for the winnings?""

""Well,"" he began slowly, ""I was planning on giving some to charity and then, I was going to invest a good chunk of it and with the rest I was going to start up my own business.""

""Oh, that's interesting what would you sell?""

A smile crossed his lips, ""well you know how space ship engines are so hard to clean?""

""Yeah""

""Well I've been working on a foaming gel that should make it a lot easier, I'm still working on it, but I think that given enough time I could figure out the proper formula.""

""That's a wonderful idea Jason and I'm sure you would have done it to."" 

""What do you mean would have?"" He ask puzzled. ""I didn't do anything and they'll figure that out and release me.""

""Yes,"" I said the same sadness I usually felt leaking into my voice. ""They will, but I can't let you leave Jason,""

""What!? he shouted standing up. ""Why not what did I do?""

""Calm down."" I said putting a hand on his shoulder, which was quickly shoved off. ""You don't want you last emotions to be fear and anger do you?

""What do you mean my last emotions? Are you going to kill me? I didn't do anything!""

""No, you didn't. Don't worry this isn't your fault.""

""Then who's fault is it? Why don't you punish them?""

""Because Jason it's the universes fault.""

He turned to me confused. ""What do you mean?""

""Jason you aren't suppose to exist.""

""What do you mean I'm not suppose to exist?""

""Well you see the universe continually gets what you would call souls and needs to give them a vessel or body to be housed in. Now sometimes the universe messes up and accidentally makes two of these vessels. Now usually these excess vessels are destroyed  the moment they are made, but every once in a long while one slips through. You Jason slipped through.""

""So your saying I don't have a soul?""

""No you have a soul, but it's a fake, made up my the natural energy that fills the universe and since it's not wholly real it doesn't have to follow all the rules.""

""What rules!"" He said growing more confused.

""I'm sorry Jason we're out of time, I have to get rid of you.""

""Wait, please just-""

""Jason, please don't make this difficult "" I begged cutting him off, tears threatening to break through.

""Alright. Fine."" He said slumping to the ground. ""Fine just do it.""

I nodded gritting my teeth to hold back the tears as I began the process.

""Just tell me, will it hurt?""

I looked down at him voice cracking, "" I don't know, but don't worry you won't remember this. I'm removing you from existence everything you've ever done will be reversed and everyone who knows you will forget you.""

A silent moment passed that felt like hours. ""In that case can you do one thing for me?""

""What's that?""I  asked completing the preparations.

""Can you remember me?""

I faltered as those word hit me. ""Yes."" I said ""yes I can do that for you.""

""Ok, then I'm ready.""

With those word I collapsed the waveform and with a flash Jason was gone. A single tear ruled down my face as I whispered to the empty air. ""I'll remember you, I'll remember them all.""",Pathadomus
"[WP] A virus has been discovered, it's manipulate human fetus into a whole difference specie. We call them 'Angel'.",IceCooro,"    ""It was 40 years ago...""
Softly said by a shadowy figure staring upon the moon as it had stood at the edge of the Grand Canyon. ""40 years"" was all the figure murmured to itself as it kneeled down and felt the earth with it's scarred hand and wept, as the tears fell to floor they had glistened and captured the moons elegance and the figures face.

    He had sat there at the edge for hours, sulking, and murmuring ""40 years"". He rose suddenly onto his feet and looked down into the canyon to where the light could not reach and began to recall the events that led to his isolation. ""My name is David"" as he had gazed back at the moon, ""my name is David, we call you the moon, but did you choose that name?"" David had asked the moon knowing there could be no response. ""Did you ask to be alone? Did you asked to be landed on?"" David looked at the scars in his hands and clenched his hands into fists and asked his final question, ""Did you ask to stay in Earth's orbit for all time?""

   David kneeled down once more as the scaly winged stretched out of his dark torn shroud that covered his body, and rose only to cast a shadow where the moons light had lain moments before. Where sorrow was held in his heart only rage had taken refuge. ""40 years ago they named me 'David!' 30 years ago they called me 'Angel!' 20 years ago they put holes in my hands and feet! 10 years ago I killed them all! Now they call me 'Devil!' His voice had echoed across the canyon and the magnitude had seemingly shaken the ground beneath him.

   ""I'm unlike you Luna, I will not tether myself to a purpose in which I am to serve. If I am alone and damned, then the monkeys that had given birth to my brothers and sisters will be damned with me.""

We admitted her last night after she complained of headaches, fever, nausea and cramps. Her blood pressure is normal but her temperature has stayed about 39.5C° all night in spite of any attempts we’ve made to bring it down. Oh and she’s in the second trimester of her pregnancy…”

Dr. Hashley walked with her usual brisk pace towards the patient rooms on the second floor of the Exeter General Hospital listening intently to the intern’s summary. 

“Have you tried contacting her GP or her gynaecologist regarding that?”

The intern, baby-faced Stephen Carmody - to Hashley all interns looked younger and younger as years passed - frowned. 

“Well, er… We tried but her gyno has moved to another city a month ago and her GP is battling cancer. She says she hasn’t seen a medical professional since then because she’s too busy with work.”

“Idiotic.” Hashley quickened her pace. “Idiotic and irresponsible. You give them free healthcare, the best treatments in the world and it’s like they take everything for granted…” She interrupted her rant. “And what does she do that keeps her so busy all the time?”

“She said she’s an international aids worker specialising in improving water access in developing countries.”

“Do we know if she’s travelled anywhere recently?” Hashley interrupted, rounding the corner to the corridor where the patient’s room was located.

“Er… Not really.” The intern’s face, which was already displaying the characteristic paleness and tired lines that came with working in an hospital looked even more distraught.

“What do you mean not really?” Hashley stopped, her hand’s on the door. 

“Well she said she was coming back from Africa and the middle-east but with no other precisions.”

“Well then that’s just perfect. It could be anything. For all we know she could have rabies or the yellow fever. Perfect way to begin the day…” She pushed on the door handle and entered the room. 


					                    ###

Dr. George McCrawl, gynaecologist in chef at the Imperial College Hospital and professor emeritus of obstetric medicine at the same institution picked up the phone on the third ring. 

“McCrawl speaking, good morning.” His voice sounded detached and still slightly sleepy. He had never been a morning person and, growing old, found he was becoming even less of it. The voice at the other end of the line sounded nothing like his.

“Sir? This is Eva Hashley. I apologise if I’m disturbing your work but I… I really need your input on something. I’m confronted to something unusual and I’m a little… I am very out of my depth.”

McCrawl raised an eyebrow. Dr. Hashley and him hadn’t spoken in several years but she had always been a brilliant student of his and had become a very talented gynaecologist. Her contacting him for professional advice was - if not incongruous - rather unexpected.

“Eva what a pleasure. Unusual you say, well go on, tell me all about it.”
 “Thank you. Well, let me give you the full picture. About four months ago we admitted a young female patient. First pregnancy, no apparent complications, no risky behaviours, nothing unusual apart from the fact that she had recently traveled to Africa and the Middle-east. She comes in with a rising fever, cramps, nausea and difficulty breathing. At this point the diagnoses is still wide open. Except that she is completely unresponsive to our treatments. This is about when I took the case. I go through every method of diagnoses, every drugs we have on hand. At first I thought of a particularly nasty seasonal virus, or an infection, maybe even a malarial flare-up. Except that… Well, we find nothing. ECG, cardio, blood-test, DNA testing, family history. Nothing, not a single shred of evidence that could lead towards a satisfying diagnosis. Meanwhile the fever is steadily rising. 24 hours after I’ve taken the case, the fever is at 41C°. The patient has become delirious and we’re starting to fear for her life. We move her to the ICU and continue dosing her with everything we have. I swear I even considered an ice bath.”

Now fully awake and captivated, McCrawl was listening intently and had started taking notes on his legal pad. He interrupted Dr. Hashley:

“And the baby?” 

“This… This is where it gets weird. While all of this is going on, of course we’re monitoring the baby. We do an echograph, place a line so we can monitor the temperature, get a sample of amniotic fluid and…”

“And?”

“Normal, nothing unusual. The baby is absolutely fine. Probably doing better than most of the babies I see on a normal day.” 

“No fever, no haemorrhage?”

“Nothing, absolutely nothing. The mother is sweating, thrashing around and hallucinating and the foetus is happy as a clam.”

“So, wait… what happened after that? How did you bring down the mother’s fever?” 
Dr. Hashley marked a pause. 

“That’s the thing Sir. We never did bring down the mother’s fever.”

“So I assume you lost her.”

“Neither. After three days in the ICU she lost consciousness. Her vitals stabilised but the fever remained at a steady 40, 40.5C°. At this point we were waiting to see whether the heart or the brain would give up first. Our prognosis was on extended brain damage and probable death within the next few days… Except, no. That never happened. She remained completely comatose but alive, and unassisted, save for our IV drips. And… Well… They’ve been like that for the past few months.”

McCrawl picked on the plural

“What do you mean they?”

“Well that’s the thing Sir. That’s the reason I’m calling. I mean, one of the reasons.” Hashley again marked a pause to regain her calm then blurted out, quicker than she wanted, her disquiet audible in her words.

“Since the patient’s arrival we’ve had two more admissions. Completely different profiles. Except for the fact that they’re all women in their first pregnancies. We’ve tried looking for common factors but we’re waddling in a sea of information. The only other thing that they have in common is that they’ve all recently traveled to the middle-east. But it’s never exactly the same country and never exactly at the same time. For every case the scenario is the same. The fever rises endlessly, the patient becomes comatose but the foetus remains perfectly fine. Our ICU is starting to look like a maternity ward. I’ve tried calling other hospitals across the country. There are two other similar cases in Glasgow, one in Bristol and five between the different hospitals of the greater London area. I’ve talked to Samwell in Glasgow he says he called his wife’s brother in Tel Aviv and they have two identical cases in their service.” 

“Howcome this is the first I hear of it.”

“No one knows what to do with them. I mean, the mothers might as well be dead but the pregnancies are still going along.”

“As any of them… Er… Given birth?” McCrawl sounded uneasy now, he had covered his legal pad in tiny illegible notes and was now toying nervously with his pen.
“Not yet. But our initial patient is close to term. We’re considering scheduling a C-section in the coming days.”

“I’ll be there. I want to see that in person.”



					                	###


“Scalpel.”

Stephen Carmody steadied his hand and handed the scalpel in the tray in front of him to Dr. Hashley. He hadn’t had many chances to assist her in the O.R. but he had never heard her sound so tense. Come to think of it he had never seen her look so tense. She had been like that since the arrival of the first fever-mother - like the hospital staff informally called them - but now was truly the culmination of her stress.

Yet her own hand was steady when she caught the instrument. 

“Beginning incision.”

Carmody let his hand fall to his side, hoping that no one would notice the tremors. In truth it was unlikely any one would. All eyes were on Hashley’s scalpel and the lower belly of the patient. Even for an exceptional situation the room was more crowded than Carmody thought possible. In spite of the fact that the mother was probably as good as dead, the operating table was surrounded with every specialist in the surgery wing and the gallery filled with interns. By Hashley’s side stood her mentor, Dr. McCrawl, looking dignified yet wary. 

As the procedure unfolded Carmody’s uneasiness grew. He had wanted to attribute that to the risks of operating on a sick, unconscious patient but he now realised there was more to it. This was the first of the fever-mother they were bringing to term and the first of the “angels” - as the hospital at taken to calling the miraculous babies - they were giving birth to. He had prepared himself to anything, up to the loss of both lives, but still felt unready. 

“I have it. I have the baby. Amin, help me please.” 

The nurses and attending doctors scrambled around the table, trying to get a better view. Carmody himself couldn’t help but lean forward. Out of the gap of bloodied flesh, cradled in Dr. Hashley’s hands emerged the tiny wrinkled mass of the newborn. A hush silenced the doctors, only broken by McCrawl’s cold observation.

“Well this is odd.”

Even covered in amniotic fluid and blood it was obvious to Carmody that something was wrong with the baby’s skin. It was the palest he had ever seen. As if no blood ran underneath it. And in the mass of legs and arms, the baby appeared to be completely sexless. Its elongated head had incredibly fine features dominated by giant, almond-shaped eyes, entirely white, save for the black dot of their irises. 
Stillborn, Carmody thought, and a shudder ran through him as he looked at the endlessly staring eyes. He closed his hands nervously, and heard a deafeningly high-pitched cry as the baby took its first breath.",nottobepedantic

""I know that, OK? We went over the plan often enough. But fuck me, couldn't we have asked her to do it?""

He gestures to me. I just arch an eyebrow at him incredulously. He was right; we'd gone over this a thousand times. We'd even storyboarded it. This, I resigned, was what I got for working with an unknown crew. However, the shoot schedule had demanded I work quickly.

""Well?"" Grimes continued his protest, pointing at the flowing wig on his head and the patently fake breasts stuck to his chest. ""This ain't the kind of fuckin' look that goes down well in my neighbourhood.""

""From what I heard, it's exactly the kind of look that goes down well in your neighbourhood. Ha!"" Collinson, driving the van, appraised us in the rear view mirror and went back to work. 

""Shut it, both of you. And no, it can't be me. Do I look like a stunt performer to you? You know, fine, athletic physique and muscle tone? You're the only one who presses in his spare time. Carry your burden.""

""We're on."" Collinson pulled the van up, nice and slow, waving a pass at the barrier guard. We were unmarked save for a crude A4 piece of paper on the dash with today's filming code. That had been easy to obtain: just watch what the other vans do. The movie was more concerned about stopping people working out they were shooting *Flashpoint II* than interlopers. 

""We OK?""

Michaels grunted - hacked - some kind of noise that only diesel engines and Nick Nolte could manage. Grimes sighed, checked the 9mm in his holster (plain sight, just as Ms Johansson's costume demanded), and gave an affirmative. 

I slipped on the headset, grabbed the cup of coffee and the box of Krispy Kremes, and nodded for Michaels to open the door.

And that's how it started. The three of us walking through a film crew, lanyards around our neck and just enough details to make it authentic.

I sat at my desk, and logged on my computer. Internet connection was provided, but it was encrypted seven ways from sunday. That means no social networks. That's okay. The internet is a big place. I opened my usual tabs. A couple flash games and some news website. Oh and the clock.

It's not actually a clock. More like a counter that counts everyone alive in real time. One look at it can tell you that the human population is growing rapidly. It was a little more than 7.4 billion.

There was a knock at my door. I looked up. It was Rick.

""Hey, boss. How ya doin?"", he asks.
""Fine Rick. I need you to get me Helmandollar when gets in, okay?""
""Sure thing""

I turn back to my screen, thinking of starting a game of chess, when I freeze.
I stare at the clock for a while more. Something was wrong. I could have sworn the number was higher by a good 200 thousand. 

Just when I start blaming myself for reading it wrong, the number drops by 500 thousand right in front of my eyes. 

""What. The. Hell?""

Then it started dropping rapidly, by Large numbers at a time. Many people were just dying, in masses at once.

Now I'm still looking at it. I can't take my eyes off it. This might be it I think. Many people hate their jobs because they're boring. Me? I'm thankful every day for the monotony. This day might not be as monotonous.

I watch in horror as the first 7 to the left becomes a 6. This might be it. This might be that day.

The red indicator on my screen that is never supposed to flash starts flashing suddenly, and I'm almost not surprised. With a feeling of dread I click it.

[WP] Write me a totally platonic love story.,Roneitis,"His name was Harry. 

From the moment he first saw her, he loved her. He loved the way she walked and the way she carried herself, the way she spoke and the way she smiled. God, was she radiant when she smiled. And the way her hair tumbled down her shoulders, ready to be tousled at any moment, ready to be affectionately played with whenever they sat down together... she was brilliant, really. She was perfection. 

Did she have her flaws? Yes. He saw her cry and ball up in the corner and he approached her silently, not knowing what to do, because she was hurting. He didn't know what afflicted her but he could sense it, deep down, almost like he could smell it through her skin. She needed him, almost as much as he needed her. Sometimes she didn't have the energy to shower in the morning and she'd leave the house feeling like a massive ball of grease, even though he knew she wasn't and never would be, and she'd come home and he'd try to prove that to her by giving her all the loving kisses in the world. She didn't brush her teeth as often as she should have but when she kissed him he barely even noticed. 

To him, she was love, life, happiness. Her faults didn't matter, her failures as a person were insignificant. He loved her, wholly and completely, for everything she was. And he had to support that, so what could he do other than sit idly by while she went through breakup after breakup, crying to herself and aching for the pain to stop? She'd curl up on the bed and he would curl up next to her, the warmth between them sometimes enough to make him want to leave but he knew she needed him so he couldn't. 

And when she slept she dreamed, and her dreams were awful. He felt her pushing against him, her breath hot in his ears, her body tossing and turning as she fought whatever demons were inside. When that happened, he was right there, pushing up against her, kissing her nose until she woke up and found him and fell asleep again, using him as a pillow. As he lay there with her he remembered when they first met, when they'd been flirting with each other, teasing each other, and then eventually loving each other. Their first embrace was magical because she squeezed him gently, and it became something they did ever since. Those squeezes made him so happy. 

She was his world, she really was. There were other people in his life, sure, but none of them were quite as wonderful to him as she was. She had a sister and whenever she wasn't around, he would spend time with the sister; upon reuniting with him she would jokingly tell him how jealous she was. 

But then after years together she stopped coming around as much. There were days, even nights, when he didn't get to bury his face in her skin, didn't get to smell the familiar sweetness of her hair. Sometimes there were several in a row, and there was nothing he could do. He had no way to reach her, no way to tell her how much she missed him. As soon as she walked back in the door he'd throw himself around her, reminding her how much he loved her and how much he wanted her home with him again. She was distant, though, but there was something else on her mind. 

She was happy. 

Eventually he grew familiar with the source of happiness. It made him jealous, he had to admit, but it made her happy so he dealt with it. He was tall, blonde, handsome, and Harry could feel the overwhelming amounts of love exchanged between the two. He grew scared, he had to admit. He thought he was going to lose her because of how much time she spent away from him. 

And then everything changed. The world around him changed, the colours shifting in the sky until he was dizzy and lost and hopeless and scared. But then she was there again, loving him, talking to him, reassuring him and telling him that everything was going to be okay. She breathed life back into him and he could see her blonde love standing a few feet away, concern etched on his features as he examined the situation. Harry felt accomplished because he had her back, and as time went by, he realised that she would never be gone again. She spent every night in the bed with him again, and if he didn't want to join her then she'd hunt him down just like she always had and would coax him into snuggling with her at least until she fell asleep. Things were normal again. 

One night, he woke up and rolled onto his other side. He saw her, her features barely outlined in the darkness. He saw the faint smile on her face, the way that she burrowed back closer into the arms of the man that had come into her life all those months ago. He felt the love in the air, the familiarity, the passion and adoration. And he felt his own happiness, too. Things were right now. She was healthy, she was happy, she didn't spend her time lonely and crying anymore. Everything was well. She was better. 

He happily curled up next to her, his body extending along the bed between the pillow and the wall. His tail brushed across her face and tickled her cheek and as he stretched out, he saw her eyes gently open. She saw him laying there and smiled, reaching out to stroke his fur, petting him with the warmth and love that they'd felt for years. They closed their eyes in unison and he purred them back to sleep. ",Carelinus

[WP] Write me a totally platonic love story.,Roneitis,"I met Charlie when he was crying.

He was huddled on a linoleum floor, knees drawn up and face in his hands, his broad shoulders giving little hitches as he gasped for breath. When he raised an arm to drag his sleeve across his face, he saw me and froze. I could see his mind fumble for a way to play it off—an awkward laugh, a shrug—but I’d seen too much for him to pretend. I slid down the wall to join him.

“I know it’s too early to be acting this way,” he finally said, addressing the floor rather than look at me. “I mean, fuck, if I can’t handle basic, how am I going to handle war?”

I considered this. “You’ll cry.”

His eyes closed and he exhaled slowly, as if coming to terms with his own inadequacy.

“But so will most of us,” I said. “We’ll do what we need to do, and then we’ll cry when it’s over.”

We went overseas together and confronted the reality of fighting for our country. Long stretches of boredom punctuated by terror and adrenaline. One day, far from home, there was an IED. Charlie threw my arm over his shoulders and bore my weight on the way back, his eyes flinty and veins standing out in his neck. When I awoke later minus one foot, he was there at my bedside, crying now that it was over.

We returned as heroes, but I didn’t feel like one. I felt like a man who’d been hunted, who had to keep checking over his shoulder for the enemies that were always heartbeats from descending. Drinking helped a little. So did Sara. But there were times when my mood was too dark for even her to reach me, and she’d call Charlie. He’d come and sit with me, and gradually, I would resurface.

At the wedding there were at least three jokes about Sara having to compete with my best man for my love. The three of us laughed, knowing they were both right and wrong. She and Charlie held different but equally sacred places in my soul.

There were years, then, of living in the sun. Charlie met Maria, and our families grew and mixed together. There was hurt amid the happiness—Sara sobbing in fury and dumping booze down the drain—but mostly, it was good.

When Charlie’s doctor gave him the news, I was less worried than everyone else. The man who’d stormed into the aftermath of an explosion to drag me back out of hell wasn’t about to be felled by something so mundane as cancer. Even when that man began to shrivel before my eyes, as his hair dropped away and skin turned sickly, as he began spending more and more time in the hospital—I knew it would be okay. Until the day it wasn’t.

When the doctor confirmed the time of death, I was at Charlie’s bedside, like an inverted echo of my accident those long years ago. I cried.",NervousBug

[WP] Write me a totally platonic love story.,Roneitis,"Did they fight? Of course they did; any descent relationship suffered a bit of chafing here and there. The fights could get big, mammoth if alcohol was involved, but they always ended the same way—with laughs. 

Dolly and Evan were close, they loved each other immensely. Where other relationships failed, theirs stayed strong. When the world was looking bleak, they illuminated it for each other. They could speak without words and never missed a joke, so it only felt right that, come graduation, they would finally move in together. They would take the plunge. 

Plenty of people told them not to—for as many success stories of couples cohabiting, there were equal if not more tales of woe. But they were them, Dolly and Evan, and they never thought for a moment that anything could go wrong. They didn't realize the strain that constant contact puts on a relationship. They just didn't know. 

So, instead of just simply moving in together, they moved in together in Korea, and both of them got the same job at the same bushi ban. That meant that they woke up together, spent 8 hours together at work, came home together, and hung out together. That was all day, everyday, in a new place, without other friends to distract or family to support. It was just them.

And it almost worked. I mean, when it was good, it was amazing. They were together in Korea! They spent their off days vacationing in Thailand and laying out on the actual beach from the Beach. They got to taste exotic foods: iron eggs in soup, pork blood cakes, endless kinds of dumplings. Who wouldn't enjoy something like that? Plus, they were enjoying it with someone they truly loved. At night, they returned to their warm little domicile, and though every day was not perfect, they never went to bed angry. 

That is, until they started the business, and then it all went to shit. Not only did they share a day job, a home, and a friend group, but now all of that was compressed beneath the incredible pressure of trying to make a name for yourself in world that isn't always receptive. Something was bound to crack, and both of them did. 

It culminated in one fateful night. They'd just made a new video for their website, one that clocked in countless hours of work. Deciding to celebrate, they went to one of their favorite expat bars and ordered themselves a couple Singhas. At the clink of the glass, Dolly pulled out her phone so they could both witness the fruits of their labors. Finding it on youtube through shaking fingers, she managed to tap the little red square and...

Nothing showed up. Well, not nothing, a message materialized. It said something about copyrighted material, and that this video was taken down for infringement. They checked their caption—it noted all the music that was used, giving credit where it was due. They mentally ran threw the 5 minutes and 32 seconds of video, tallying each scene and ensuring that the content was original. And yet, no video ever showed. 

The two were understandably depressed, disheartened, and looking for ways to distract themselves. More beers were ordered, and shots were drank. They ended the night at a dance club, and along the way the tension that had been building began to poke through. By the end of the evening, the girls were screaming at each other over nothing in particular. Dolly went home with a guy that she knew, and Evan left with a drug dealer that she'd just met. They went their separate ways, but this really wasn't the end of their world. After all, they'd been friends before, they would stay that way long after. ",devontrevathan

[WP] Write me a totally platonic love story.,Roneitis,"We had met in a bar on a fairly typical Friday night. My date ""had to go home early"", whatever that meant, and I was left on an odd corner of the bar facing a small TV. I had no real intentions of getting drunk, I just wasn't ready to go home. Tom and his group of friends arrived and filled in the area to my right, Tom himself was pushed to the furthest side, forced to share the odd little corner of the bar in front of the small TV. 

""Tom, you find your twin or something?"" A voice called from somewhere in the mess of people. 

I glanced at him, and he glanced at me. We were both wearing blue button up shirts, and khakis, and we both had short, dirty blonde hair. Had we told someone we were related, you might have believed it. At that moment, our relationship started. The ice broken through to brotherhood almost immediately as he clasped his hand on my shoulder and said, ""Frank! It's you! My long lost twin!"" 

My night hadn't been the best, and as absurd of a moment as it was, I allowed myself to get swept up in it. I played my part. ""Tom!"" I shouted, as if he was a long lost friend. and then we hugged. It was a nice, natural feeling hug that drained the sad pit in my chest away. 

Everyone laughed, I felt proud to be a part of it, and that was the last time Tom's friend's spoke to us that night. 

""My name's Mark."" I said, and we shook hands. We laughed again, and when his beer arrived we clanged glasses. Tom and I were best friends from that moment on. We were both fairly introverted, as I found out later, but together conversation flowed faster than the beer. We watched curling on the TV, neither of us understood it, but like our new friendship we dove into it with the utmost enthusiasm. We ignored the odd looks his friends gave us as we cheered and hugged and drained our beers to the rocks being swept along the ice. We promised that we would form our own team. Straight to the Olympics we would go. Tom and Mark, though he still sometimes calls me Frank. 

Later that night Tom ditched his friends to go hang out with me, as I had mentioned that the pond down the street was completely frozen over. We kicked stones across the frozen surface and drew circles with sticks. I couldn't tell you what time it was when Tom finally fell through the ice, luckily the water was only knee deep. Like the couple of drunken hooligans that we were, we went running and shouting all the way back to my apartment, where I loaned him a dry set of sweats and we stayed up till morning watching movies. 

We woke up on the couch sitting side by side, beer cans scattered across my coffee table and the menu of Grandmas Boy still blaring on the TV. I offered to cook up some eggs and bacon and we laughed about the crazy night we had. It felt like we had been doing this forever, and it hadn't even been twenty four hours into our relationship yet. Yet I knew, somehow, that I would be telling this story at his wedding one day. ",micmea1

I reach down, feel the ragged edges of the wound. It's probably teeming with bacteria. It probably should be bandaged. But it doesn't really matter. Bacteria and bloodloss are the least of my worries now. 

An hour. That's how long it takes. We've seen it happen, again and again. It takes a little longer for fat people, a little less time for children, but all around that hour mark. That's how long I've got left.

An hour. An hour before I turn, before I kill them or they shoot me. An hour to decide what to do. 

He's asleep right now. He always snores softly when he sleeps, little snuffling noises. I could listen to them forever. His hands - still with dimples instead of knuckles - are held up close to his face. He's so perfect it hurts. 

And in a little while - hours at most - he'll be dead. 

I worry that I'll hurt him. He'll be the closest thing, clutched tight to me when the change happens. I'd never harm him now, but it won't be me soon. Just hunger, and hate, and blunt, tearing teeth. It will hurt.

I could cry out. Tell the others. Show them the bite. That would be the quickest way. Then they'd shoot me, get it over with. No one would bite him. He wouldn't have to feel this pain. It's a cold pain, a rip in my skin that I can't forget. It makes it hard to think. 

He still won't be safe though. ""No room for burdens"", they say. ""We can't take in every stray we find."" I used to agree with them. I used to think it was the right decision, the practical choice. It's better that some of us live than all of us starve together. It's cruel, but it's for the greater good. 

They'll leave him behind. They might shoot him first; they might not waste the bullet. Without me, he's just another stray. They don't take in strays. 

How can there be a greater good than him? He murmurs in his sleep, the half-formed sounds that one day will be words. 

He can't survive without help. He's too little - too little to find food, or shelter. Too little to be cautious in the wastes, watching for the dangers. He'll die. Slowly, in constant hunger, not understanding where I am or why I don't help him. 

I don't know what to do. Let him die in agony, or let him starve? How can I choose when every choice hurts him?

There is one other way.

Not a good way. A cruel, hard way. But maybe, slightly, a greater good. 

I stand up. I clutch him to me with one arm. I walk. 

The camp is quiet. People snatch what sleep they can. The gate is closed, and bolted, and guarded. The guard stares out from the top of it, eyes scanning the darkness for any movement. 

It's over quickly. The knife cuts quickly across the guard's neck, and my hand is warm. I hear him breathe, hear the whistle as he struggles for air, and then quiet. He slumps forward, and no one in the camp stirs. 

I have a little time. A few minutes, perhaps, to say goodbye. The guard changes every two hours, and I have to be done by then. 

My first task is the gate. I rest my precious burden carefully near the guard's small fire as I work. The bolts are heavy, but well-oiled. I feel the rough metal scrape against my hands as I draw them back. 

We designed the gate to be silent. Noise makes them come, come running. It helps me now. 

It won't take long. They smell blood - the guard's blood, hot and sticky on my hand. They'll be here soon. 

My son won't starve. He won't get shot. He'll live forever. He'll find his own food, and there will be a lot of it about. Three hundred people live in the camp.

Once you've been bitten, it doesn't matter how old you are. I've seen a ninety year-old woman sprinting, one arm snapped off at the shoulder. I've seen a man with no legs drag himself across the floor. They don't need thought, or planning, or the ability to walk. The hunger makes up for it. 

He'll never learn to speak, or tie his shoes. He'll never build, or plant, or harvest. But he'll live - live to crawl, to feed, to not face the slow agony of starvation. When there's no food, they simply wait. The hunger drives them, but they don't need food. 

In a few minutes, the first of them will arrive. They'll smell the blood and come to feed. The rush will go past us, split around us. They don't eat tainted meat. 

In a few minutes, I'll be one of them, tearing and charging at my former friends. I won't remember him, or how he smiles when he looks up at me, or the sweet, fresh smell of his hair. It won't matter to me that he's still moving, still present in the world.

But it matters now. I can't save him totally. I can't give him a full life, but I can give him something. 

I cover his mouth when I bite. It takes more effort than I thought to break the skin. He whimpers through my hand and my heart breaks. I have to hurt him. Have to make sure it works. The virus will be in my saliva by now, spreading and reproducing and destroying. I worry at the wound, trying to push the infection deeper. I shake with guilt and self-loathing. I have no choice. 

When it's over, when the taste of my betrayal has been spat over the grass, I soothe him. I hold him close and sing, softly, the lullabies he loves. I rock him in my arms and tell him I love him. I rock him in my arms and stare at his face. I say I'm sorry a thousand times.

I hear the grunts and snarls of the arriving horde, and the first sounds of too-late alarm from the camp. It sounds very distant. I hold him for what will be the last time, for the final few moments in which I understand what he means to me. I tell him I love him. I mean it with every part of me, with every last beat of my heart. I hope that he understands.",Peritract
"[WP] There's a breach in the gold vault of the federal reserve bank of New York, guards rush to the scene to find... a small child using the gold bars as building blocks.",Starzajo,"""What the Hell is this?""  Jason stared into the vault, dumbfounded at what he saw.

A toddler, no older than 4 years old, sat on the floor with a big smile on his face.  In front of him stood a small tower of golden blocks, arranged in a lego-like pattern.  ""Play!"" he exclaimed when he saw the guards enter the vault.

Jason couldn't believe what he saw.  *What kind of asshole brings their kid to a bank robbery?*  He stepped inside, motioning to his team to stay back.  ""Hey there, buddy,"" he said with a soft whisper.  ""Where's your parents?""

The little kid laughed.  ""Bye bye!"" He said.  His eyes scrunched up, suggesting an air of childish mischief.  He pushed his hand into the tower of gold bars and they came tumbling down.  

Jason leaned forward.  ""I'm sorry?  What do you mean by 'bye bye?'"" He reached for his radio.  ""Were they here earlier?""

The boy shook his head.  He started to pout and fold his arms against his chest.  ""NO!"" He shouted.  ""They said 'bye-bye!'""  He looked angry, far angrier than a child his age should appear.

Jason couldn't believe what was happening.  This kid's shitty parents used him as a distraction so they could make a getaway.  *What the Hell has this world come to?*  He reached down to pick up the kid.  ""Come on, pal,"" he said, sympathetic to the boy's plight.  ""We'll take you somewhere safe.""

""NO!"" The boy screamed again.  He kicked his feet out.  

Jason stopped in his tracks.  He felt something, some sort of *force* in his gut.  It hurt like hell, like he had just been punched in the gut.  The toddler kicked his feet again, and the feeling returned for a separate time.  Jason stumbled back.  ""How the Hell. . . ?"" He started.

The little kid stood up.  ""No more 'bye-bye'!"" He said.  The vault started to tremor.  

Footsteps came pounding behind Jason.  He spun around, and saw a young man and woman, escorted by a guard, make their way toward the scene.  When they saw the child, they fell to their knees.

""Oh, Johnny,"" the woman said.  ""We're so sorry!  We won't leave you again.""

The man looked terrified.  ""Mommy and daddy have to work, son.  It's the only way we can keep buying you nice things.""

Jason glared at them.  They looked familiar. ""*You're* the parents of this kid?  Don't you work here?"" He said.  No one answered.  After a few minutes of silence, he raised up his arms.  ""Does anyone mind telling me what the fuck is going on?""

The kid kicked his feet again.  This time, Jason went flying several feet backwards, landing hard on the cement floor outside the vault.  The woman started to cry.

""Oh God,"" she said.  ""Please, Johnny.  Don't hurt us!  We're sorry!""

The man nodded his head.  ""We won't go to work anymore, son.  We'll stay home with you all day!""

The kid shook his head.  ""*NO!*"" He said.  The vault began to tremor again, this time picking up with intensity.  The ceiling started to crumble.

""Oh God,"" The man said.  He hopped up to his feet and ran toward the stairs, leaving his wife behind.  ""Run!"" He shouted behind him as he hauled ass toward the exit.

Jason didn't think twice.  He grabbed the woman up by her arms, and together they hastily made their way out of the vault entrance.  When they made it to the stairs, however, the whole building began to shake violently.  The father, who was just up ahead, fell backwards.  His head hit the cement stairs hard on the way down.  By the time he reached the bottom, his head was cracked open and spilling blood all over the floor.

""Oh God!"" The woman screamed.  The ceiling above the stairs came crashing down, blocking their only exit.

Jason spun around.  His guards, who had been right behind them, lay writhing on the floor in agony.  The little kid, halfway down the hall, walked menacingly towards the mother.  ""Why don't you play?"" He said, his face pouting.  ""No fun!  No fun!""

The mother grabbed on to Jason.  ""Please,"" she begged.  ""Kill him if you have to.""  

Jason looked down at his gun, holstered to his side.  *No,* he thought.  *I can't.  He's just a kid.*

The toddler was within a few yards of them now.  He held two gold bars, one in each hand.  

""Please,"" the mother insisted.  ""We tried to be good parents.  We thought we could change him.  But. . . oh, there's no use now!  Just kill him!  Just kill him!  Please--""

Her words cut short.  A gold bar had lodged itself into her chest.  Jason stared at her in horror.  She gazed emptily at him until blood came spurting out of her mouth, and she collapsed onto the floor.

Jason spun back around.  The toddler held the other gold bar, pointing it menacingly at Jason.  ""Your turn!"" He said, starting to laugh. 

Jason quickly drew for his gun.  He managed to pull it out of his holster and aim it at the kid. . . 

. . . but he was too late.  A gold bar shot into his eye, ramming through his skull and coming out the other end.

"[WP] There's a breach in the gold vault of the federal reserve bank of New York, guards rush to the scene to find... a small child using the gold bars as building blocks.",Starzajo,"While it wasn't strange to see seventeen squad cars, two Special Weapons and Tactics vans, a police helicopter and Mobile Command Unit all rushing through the streets of New York towards Times Square just after lunchtime on a Tuesday afternoon, it was still noticeable enough for people on the street to take notice and remember the convoy as it sped by and overhead. Had those observers known that the police were responding to an alarm sent from the Federal Reserve Bank, they might have taken more interest but barely five minutes would pass before most would have put the incident entirely out of their mind as they returned to the monotony of their regular lives.

What would have really piqued their interest, and what certainly caught the attention of every officer responding to the panicked report of a breach of the bank's gold vault, was that upon arriving at their destination there was no gunfire from the criminals raiding the vault. In fact, there was no sign of any getaway vehicles at all. Figuring that the perpetrators must have some underground getaway planned, maybe through nearby subway tunnels or even the sewers, the police forces began pouring into the bank.

Following their training, the the officers methodically approached the target area. One of the S.W.A.T. teams moved to the front in preparation of breaching into the vault area and with as little fanfare as possible, proceeded into the interior. With any luck, they knew they could catch the criminals mid-heist but even if they had already left, the officers would be able to discover their means of egress and escape. With that information in hand, their superiors could start arranging the appropriate countermeasures to ensure that the perpetrators were caught forthwith.

With all this preparation and furor it is therefore understandable that, when the police officers caught sight of the young child sat in the middle of the vault playing with the bricks of gold bullion, their righteous charge was halted in its tracks and more than one mouth fell open from the sheer shock of the situation. The fact that the child was sat with straightened back and crossed legs wasn't quite as noticeable as the fact that they were so postured while floating two feet above the ground. For those that had so far overlooked the oddity the child represented, they were instead unable to ignore the fact that the bars of gold bullion weighing more than twelve kilograms a piece were being manhandled invisibly as they were moved from the neat stacks of the gold vault into whatever structure was forming on the floor in front of the child.

Suffice to say, none of the officers present could think of any training they had received or operating procedures in place, that dealt with what they had discovered. In fact, by the time that the on-site commander had given up on receiving a response from any of his men and personally entered the vault to discover what was going on, nobody had figured out yet what they were supposed to do. With the commander being similarly flabbergasted, it was apparent that the New York City Police Department's finest was in need of a new play book.",ebpohmr
[WP] Noah decides to use the Ark to become a pirate.,Swagiano,"On the lower deck of their ship, the crew gathered round the man they had found afloat on a piece of driftwood earlier that day. ""What happened? There is no way you survived since the rains started by just holding onto that plank you came in on. This flood is a deadly force, surely the waves would have taken you.""

The stranger turned to them with fear in his eyes. 

""I fear no water, but the man upon it! Listen and I will tell you what happened to bring me to you here.

I managed like many others to get aboard one of the larger vessals by about the third day of rain. We had managed to bring with us enough supplies to hopefully hold out until it was dry again. After the rain stopped two months ago, we were sailing forward, just trying desprately to find a piece of land that had not been covered in the storm. It was while we were in our search that we were set upon by HIM. The crazy man who had spent years warning us of this was aboard this massive boat. We hailed him and asked him if he had seen any land in the surrounding waters. The old fool ignored us and instead berated us saying we had our chance at survival and that the longer we survived the more we mocked God. Suddenly, a horde of birds came flying out of all sides of his vessal and we were beset upon by their beaks! Some of the men were even carried off by the larger ones and dropped into the water. This was annoying but not too worrisome as we managed to beat back the birds with our arrows. However we were not prepared for his giraffes. They stuck their heads out the side of the boat and began headbutting the sides of our ship, breaking it apart. At the same time the Lions hopped aboard and began tearing our men apart. Even the primates aboard the ship were slinging a neverending volley of feces at us! I got lost in the confusion and fell overboard. Managing to grab unto a broken piece, I just pushed myself as far away from the massacre as possible. I looking back just in time to see his elephants walk off the side and plumment into the deck of the ship, tearing a hole through the whole thing."" 

The crewmen stood there silently until one spoke up.

""None of the animals survived the rain! How do you expect me to believe this!?""

The Stranger sighed,

""I do not blame you for disbelieving me, just promise me this. If you see and animals while you are on this voyage please sail as far from them as possible.""

At that moment the Captain of the ship entered.

""Men, we may have found hope at last! Still no sight of land but we must be close, for an entire flock of birds has just flown over us!""

The crew stiffens and turns to look back at the stranger, who has burst into tears.

For a such a price, what could be wrong?  
What horrors were to be had?

Murder or colic, in the form of screams.  
Or perhaps the bedroom is filled with a sleeptalker's  
rambling,  
aggrivating

But the answer, it seemed, was beyond my abilities.  
Instead, the answer came in a note from the seller,

*But perhaps, if you look and more importantly,*  
*Listen,*  
*You may hear this place through my ears,*  
*And see it through my eyes.*

I read each one, and began to understand.

*You may wish, however, to avoid the master bed,*  
*Lest you hear how we -ahem- sinned.*

*Those are real.*  
*In the morning you may hear her flooding the engine,*  
*As she attempts to start the car.*  
*At night you may her her say*  
*""Come look at the stars!""*  

*We tried to confine our emotions to a room each,*  
*That they mightn't interfere.*  
*The problem I have now, the reason why I give you such a deal,*

[WP] A hyper-advanced alien race has domesticated humanity. Your family has put you into the human kennel for a week while they go on vacation.,arrenlex,"""Jell-o today *again*?""

Michelle Stewart wrinkled her nose and gave me a look of mock-disgust. I playfully rolled my eyes and sniggered. The Slurps were kind, gentle, highly-intelligent, and an all-around good bunch. Still, they had gotten the impression somehow that Jell-o was the only thing we wanted to eat. Or maybe it was just the only dish they could relate to. We called them Slurps, after all, because they only ate what they could slurp. Decades ago, when they first arrived, they had discovered that brains could be slurped. Yes, the cerebral jelly of many a human had been slurped away in those days, but things had changed. We were over it. No brains were slurped these day. Well, *hardly* any brains.

""Maybe later, they'll let us read actual books.""

Michelle laughed. Ah, she was great. I loved her. Well, at least I fancied her. She was the only person I'd spoken to in months. I guess she was okay. Although not very attractive. Hideous, actually.

""You, know I actually think they're fascinating, the phone books. I think about all those people living their lives before the Slurps arrived. I make up stories about them calling each other and complaining about work.""

It was probably the size of the books that made them think we'd be interested in them. Slurps seemingly estimated the merit of everything according to size. They were a conscientous bunch. Actual books were tiny compared to phone books, so they were incinerated. And it wasn't all that bad. When you spent enough time in your lounge, you'd get so bored that you'd read the darn things. Which probably made the Slurps confident we enjoyed reading them.

""Work! That's something I don't miss!"" I said. No more breaking your back doing meaningless work and living 'lives of quiet desperation', as Thoreau had put it. No more stupid coffee breaks and water-cooler conversations. Not that it was all that bad. Co-workers were fun. You could talk to them. Even when they got on their nerves, they were company.

Maybe if I showed my Slurps that I really liked Michelle they'd get me a friend. Michelle had had a friend. But he died. The little Slurp of her family had slurped his brains out. That rascal.

""I'd kill to trade a day in my lounge for a day back at the office as in the olden days,"" Michelle said.

""Me too!"" I said. ""I was only joking back there. I loved work. God, the lounge is dreadful, isn't it?""

""I don't think it's that bad. It's safe, warm, and you get Jell-o at regular intervals. They could have killed us. I think we should be grateful. It's just a little boring, is all.""

""Yes! When I said 'dreadful' I only meant 'dreadfully boring'. At times. Yes, the lounge is a great place to be. Sure is.""

I wondered whether she liked me. She probably liked me. Thinking about it, she could very well love me.

""Oh. Okay.""

She hated me. Fine. Hate still meant she had an attitude towards me. Which was better than being stuck alone in the lounge. I used to wonder about the lounge. Why would they keep us in rooms resembling hotel lounges? It kept me up at night. I thought and thought and thought and then I got it. They had studied us for some time before the whole brain-slurping frenzy, and they must have registered that we usually walked around carrying small items. Wallets, phones, purses, shopping bags. But when we went to hotel lounges, we carried big stuff. Luggage. And they probably assumed that meant hotel lounges were places were really enjoyed hanging around in.

""Atchoo!""

I almost had a heart attack. She sneezed. She definitely sneezed.

""You sneezed,"" I said. I could see the terror in her eyes.

""N-No,"" she said. ""It was just a cough, I--""

""Fuck!""

Like spiders sensing a disturbance in the web, they came snooping. The Slurps had really good control over the whole brain-slurping situation. Totally. But when it came to snot, something changed. Their instincts seemed to kick in. Most of them could hold it in. But some of them couldn't.

""Help,"" Michelle whispered through her hands covering her mouth and nose. But it was too late. A single drop of snot trickled over her index finger. A Slurp pulled off her scalp and slurped her brains out. I got up from my seat and ran. In my head I heard the sound, over and over again. *Slurrrrp*. They caught up with me instantly. Inspected my nose region. Then lost interest. No snot.

I had spoken to a man a few years back who had a theory about this strange phenomenon. He suggested that the Slurps thought snot was gooey brains leaking out, and that this signified that it was ripe for slurping. I wasn't too sure myself, but it made sense. They were super-intelligent, but they did have a habit of misinterpreting human attributes.

I spent the rest of the day eating Jell-o by myself and reading phone books. It wasn't too bad, as they had a collection of phone books I'd never read before. Many of the surnames were completely new to me. Which was amusing.

The days passed lazily until my last day. Right as I was eating another portion of bland Jell-o, I could feel something on my upper lip. I didn't have time to analyze the situation before I could feel the sound I'd panicked at so many times.

""Don't you dare BROADCAST TO ME LIKE THAT""

""LIKE WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? YOU-""

""Alright, calm down, you two. Take it to a private channel. I'll deal with the kid. Sweet █████, foreplay these days. Anyway... █████? You wanted to bring Mister Squishy along?""

""Yes, ██dad. Can I? Please?""

""Alright, alright. But we should respect animals, regardless of how intelligent they are, remember? So go ask Mister Squishy if he wants to come along to go see the pulsar. We're not expecting too many gravitational anomalies this time, and our vets have learned enough about humans to properly reattach their... ██ parts, but I think he should be the one to decide if he wants to risk it again. Okay, █████?""

""Okay, ██dad. Mister Squishy? Mister Squishy? Do you wanna come out and play? Huh? Mister Squishy?""

You are the unsung hero.,dory9864,"I am not a hero to be sung, because i am no hero, simply a man that has been faced with one too many hard situations... From my humble hamlet on a summer night that suits best a happy memory my dark story began, the goblins were inside of my hut by the time i awoke, i fought desperately to reach my little girl and when i reached her my heart sank in utmost sorrow and the wail of a banshee scaped my throat, rage filled my body like a tide of madness, first her mother because i nay had the coin to heal her and now my angel, i have never been so tireless and vengeful as that day when i slay Goblin after murderous wretch, when the knights of the Duke found me i was covered from head to toe in their blood and i was embracing the few remains of my little girl crying like no other man had before, mad now in sorrow instead. 











They dragged me kicking and crying away from the remains of my daughter, one of them sympathetic to me tried to calm me down while the other buried her, there was a lot of burying that day, reduced to sobbing i was dragged by the elder knight into his horse and they carried me to the Duke's castle, on the ride my sorrow gave way to a small black spot on my heart. I no longer had a will to live and moved only when moved, i was bathed and clothed and they pushed me until they forced me to kneel in front of my lord the Duke. And so he spoke about how sorry he was for my loss, and the empty words just made me feel more miserable, and then he said something that now i know would change my life, he told me that he truly felt for me because those Goblins came from a Den guarded by ancient spirits of the forest and even his bravest knights had failed to convince the spirit to allow them passage, and so he offered me anything and that if it was within his power he would gave it to me... I asked for a blade.











The Duke and the knights where dismayed at my request but the elder knight unsheathed his iron and offered it to me, i took it and without waiting i set on to the forest without waiting an instant more. It took me 3 days to reach the forest, i hunted and foraged, i didn't sleep because every time i closed my eyes all i could see was the mangled body of my angel and that made that small black spot in my heart pulse and grow, it gave me strength and although i felt that it would be my doom i welcomed it. 










The forest was a labyrinth that shaped and reshaped itself over and over again, however i was determined to fin the Den, no i was obsessed, and this called to the spirit that appeared in front of me, tall and mighty asking me to leave his lands, i spoke to him about the crimes of the goblins, about how they brutally murdered and ate my girl and he answered that that was the way life was, at that moment the black spot in my heart consumed it, that's the way of life? THAT'S THE WAY OF LIFE?! My heart pumped darkness instead of blood and my mind turned into a haze, the only clear was the spirit and my only desire was to destroy him, the blade moved with brutal simplicity and although he fought to defend itself my pure raw and unleashed hatred gave me the strength and the madness to fight him and win, he was still alive when i started biting his neck and as i spat his blood that burned in my mouth, throat and bones i asked screaming ""IS THIS THE WAY OF LIFE YOU ROTTEN DEMON?!"" he looked at me surprised as he faded, and after i stabbed him several more times i continued walking, until i collapsed my whole body burning his blood had done something to me...",Faustust

"[WP] Upon graduation from the University of Magic, each student is allowed to take one tome from the Arcane Library which immediately bestows all its knowledge onto the owner. You discover a tome that seems to have been overlooked.",laxnut90,"The door creaked lightly on its hinges as it swung open. Light filtered into the dark room, illuminating pillars of dust that kicked up from the movement of the door.
         
   ""Hello?""

I heard nothing. As my eyes adjusted to the dimness, I could make out a number of bookshelves, haphazardly stacked with books. The titles on their spines were covered by thick layers of dust, many of their covers were torn, wrinkled with what must have been decades of wear. As I proceeded slowly through row after row of books, I heard I faint noise coming from the corner of the library. I could make out soft steps, the slight shuffle of slippers along the cold hardwood floor.

   ""Come for a tome have we?"" 

Not unlike a shadow, an older gentlemen slid into view from behind a shelf to my left. He looked tired. But it was a satisified kind of tired, almost as if the light behind his eyes told me far more then his words ever would. I couldn't keep my voice from trembling, eventually I managaed to sputter out,

   ""Well, yes sir it's my graduation.""

   ""Of course of course."" He replied, somewhat disinterested. ""I'm sure you've been told how this works no? One book, that's all you get. One book, instant knowledge. Take your pick.""

I turned to examine the shelf nearest to me, feeling his uneasy gaze penetrating my back. I brushed the dust off a few of the books closest to me. *The Potency of Petrification.* *Eagles and Their Importance in Anglo-Human Literature.* *A Complete Guide to the Flora and Fauna of Subterranean Venus.* That last one certainly seemed interesting. I reached to grab it off the shelf, but something stopped me.

   ""How exactly does this work?"" I asked. ""If I take a book off the shelf, or open it, is that my choice?""

The old man studied me for a moment before responding, 

   ""Ah, a cautious one. Wise question to ask. You may read any book you please, as many pages as you desire. Once you leave the library with a tome, that is your choice, you may not change it.""

I picked up *A Complete Guide to the Flora and Fauna of Subterranean Venus*. After flipping through a number of pages, reading small exerpts here and there, I decided this probably wasn't the one for me. It was certainly interesting, but I had a career to think about. The most use I could find for this book was, well I'd probably get the odd obscure question at Trivia Tuesdays down at the pub. I kept looking. *Advanced Glassblowing Techniques*. *The Art of Flight: A Comprehensive Guide to Not Falling*. *The Complete History of Dragons and Other Flying Lizards*. Again I leafed through a few pages, stopping at random places to see if anything might interest me. The old man had barely moved a muscle since his appearance. Curiousity overcame me.

   ""What did you choose?""

   ""Hmmm?"" He responded, as if he hadn't been listening.

   ""You must have chosen a tome when you graduated, whenever that might have been. What tome did you choose?""

   ""Oh. Right. Yes. My tome. If I'm being completely honest with you young man, I've not yet chosen a tome, I find myself to be quite indecisive.""

Taken aback, I reshelved the tome I was holding and stepped closer to the old man. He was hunched over, perched on a walking cane he held with one hand. His other hand was tightly clutching a cloth book bag that appeared to be filled with everything other than books. Small spectacles perched precariously on the tip of his nose, and as he looked up at me, I could see his eyes become globes through their magnification. He looked at me expectantly, as if our conversation was not finished and he would like it to be.

   ""If I may ask, how long ago did you graduate? Why did you never chose a tome?""

   ""Oh I had meant to yes. Much like you I was cautious, wary. I wanted a tome that would advance my career, or help me help people. Something that would make a difference. I came and went from the library many times. There's no limit you see. You don't have to choose immediately, so I waited. I got a job, a wife, a home, a family. I lived.""

The old man took a longing glance sideways before continuing.

   ""I forgot about the tome. My life went on, my wife passed, my son too. I was grasped by the tendrils of tragedy for a time. I buried myself in work, until I retired. It was then, during one of my many days of reflection that I recalled the Arcane Library- that I had never taken a tome. So I came back, browsing, reading through everything I could get my hands on, looking for the absolute perfect selection. As long as I searched, I found nothing to cure my pain, my sorrow and loss. Many things I have learned though, how I could help people, make their lives better if I only had the time to do it over again.""

The old man continued on for a time, but with each sentence he drifted further from the present and deeper into memory, until he was so far gone that he was merely mumbling incoherently. Eventually he shuffled off to a corner where he sat down and closed his eyes, falling asleep with his cane in one hand and his bag in the other.

I continued my own search. The old man had given me much to think about. I didn't have to choose now, I could always come back. And yet the sooner I picked my tome, the sooner I could utilize its knowledge for... I still had no idea. It must have been hours I spent in that library, scanning endless volumes of potions manuals and history texts. Just as I was walking from row of shelves to the next, my foot caught a loose nail in the floorboards, and I soon found my face firmly acquainted with the ground. As the throbbing in my temple subsided, I could see a small shape under the shelf in front of me.

I reached out and grabbed it. Cobwebs stuck to my fingers and small piles of dust parted as I dragged it along the floor. Once I had it firmly in my grasp, I stood up and blew the remaining dust from its cover. In fairly plain black text the title read: *Secrets of Eternal Youth*.

I sat for hours, tirelessly memorizing every page. Once I had finished, I quietly walked over to where the old man was sleeping, and slipped the small tome into his linen book bag. With that, I gently shook him awake and suggested he head home for the day. As reached the door, and swung it open on its creaky hinges, he looked back and gave me a small nod. He stepped through frame, and instantaneously I could see a change in his posture. As the door slowly creaked shut, I watched the old man run furiously down the hallway, and listened to the quickened tap of his cane with every stride.

I hardly recognized him the next time I saw him. He was tall, hair as black as charcoal and skin as smooth as silk. The only thing that gave him away was his eyes, those vast pools of knowledge still held that same alure that I had glimpsed in them when we first met.

Anyways, we're both practically immortal now. We've started a book club. Sure, so far there are only two members, but we're holding a free info session next week!",hunterinsu

"[WP] Upon graduation from the University of Magic, each student is allowed to take one tome from the Arcane Library which immediately bestows all its knowledge onto the owner. You discover a tome that seems to have been overlooked.",laxnut90,"A fight had broken out in the dark arts section. Even the library's hush charms couldn't contain the cries of ""I want it"" and screaming as the necromancers tried pushing the shadow casters out of the way. Only to have blood witches climb over them both, clawing at the shelves. 

Book day. An ancient rite steeped in tradition and unbreakable rules. When only new graduates were allowed access to the library. The one time of the year each magical tome revealed its secret page. The page, when read, that would let the words flow into the lucky reader. Gifting them the power and knowledge that each book held. 

The downside was it was a one person per book deal. They'd recharge, the drained pages slowly re-inking themselves over the year, but only enough for one. 

Over the years story's of missed opportunities and regret had turned a once tranquil browse over titles into a mad free-for-all fight to grab what you wanted or lose your chance forever. 

Rachel looked down from the upper balcony. Taking aim she heaved the bound collection of 'Unnatural Acts And How To Perform Them' towards Kyle Undertone. It neatly struck him on the back of the head knocking him to his knees, making him lose his grip on the book he'd been about to read. Which was quickly scooped up by Angel Pillgum as she ran past him.

It served him right. They'd had the same idea to skip the crowd packed around the main library door and try to slip in by the small entrance around the back. Only he saw her coming behind him and, unforgivably, *locked the door after him*. By the time she'd got around to the main entrance again she was one of the last to get inside. 

A roll of thunder shook the building and she watched Angel, now showered in a million sparks float up from between the bookcases and into the air. Kyle, still dazed, was fumbling through the books scattered around his feet, searching for something he hadn't yet noticed was gone. 

Rachel was pleased she got to screw over Kyle, who had been a huge dick to everyone, but she couldn't stay to gloat when she still had to find herself a book. She ran down the ransacked aisles searching in vain. The obvious books, the powerful, the well known, the notorious, they were always the first to be taken. Popular topics were next, with so many fighting over a few texts they were soon striped clean. Then it was whatever you could find. Travelling deeper into the library she kept looking for something that was right for her. But no matter where she went, someone else was there.  

She found Hue holding 'The Encyclopaedia of Magical Necessity' while searching the reference section. His skin displayed a rapid mix of charts, graphs and words as he absorbed it.

Augusta had got to the travel guides first and had found 'Oz, Neverland And Through The Looking Glass: A Guide To Magical Lands.' And promptly vanished once she looked inside the cover.

She skipped the potion books. Julia and Ram were using them to beat each other as they fought over the slim volume they had at their feet.

Dejected Rachel slumped against the rolling steps and sighed. And promptly regretted thinking ""could it get worse"" as it rolled away from under her, leaving her sprawled on the floor. 

As she lay on the old carpet her eyes ran over the spines of the nearest books. 

'Limbo: Dance Instructions For Ghosts' 

'Warts And All, A Tell All Biography Of A Witch' 

'High Spirits. Undead Addiction Advice' 

'1001 Worst Wishes' 

She reached for the book of wishes. She wasn't gong to choose it, just read about someone who had a worst day than her. But as she pulled it from the shelf a soft thud sounded. Another book was jammed behind the ones she could see. It must have fallen behind from a higher shelf and been hidden from sight. She pulled out a few more books to see what new pointless publication she had found. 

It was smaller than she thought. Not just the thickness, maybe a hundred pages at most, but the book was only slightly larger than her hand. But rather than seeming flimsy it gave the impression of being concise. Important. *Interesting*. The soft brown leather cover was embossed with small gold lettering. She read the title. Then read it again to be sure.

It was simply called 'Useful'.

"[WP] Every day, people wake up with a new superpower until they find one they want to keep for the rest of their lives. Today, you think you have finally found your ideal power.",laxnut90,"Picking a superpower is difficult, and it can take a *long* time. That is, if you want to do it right. It's not exactly fun being the last person in your group of friends to choose an ability, but the rest of your life is a long time. 

As a high school student whose power is still undecided, I'm reminded of this on a daily basis. Every day, those who haven't chosen are required to meet for an hour during school for ""Choosing Class."" This is the school's way of guiding our choice, and it's about as fun as you'd expect. An hour of general, useless warnings about power selection and more often than not a worksheet for good measure, which almost every kid promptly tosses in the trash. Worse is the fact that every kid who *has* chosen gets that hour free, while we're stuck in purgatory.

For me, the worst part is that the last of my friends recently chose his power and left Choosing Class. I can't blame him too much; after all, you generally only see a power once, and then your shot at it is gone. He woke up one morning able to travel at speeds that would make sound green with envy, and that's hard to turn down. But now that I'm on my own in Choosing Class, which is populated almost exclusively by freshmen, I've come pretty close to just picking a power to get out. 

The only thing that keeps me from doing that is the examples my friends have set, good and bad. Sure, I want a great power like insane speed or the durability of a slab of rock or the ability to alter the size of an object at will (all powers possessed by people I know), but I also have to avoid getting a power that'll bite me in the ass: like giant bird's wings, which also came with fragile, hollow bones, X-ray vision, which is unusable thanks to the radiation involved, and the power to make women attracted to you. Upon his registering that power, an acquaintance of mine was taken to see a government official and given a certificate telling him that the use of his ability would be considered legally equal to rape, but of course it was too late to change.

So of course, I just needed to be patient. Day in and day out, waiting for the power that will just click and prove perfect. I spent about two years waiting on the perfect power, and in that time I saw a *lot* of bad ones. A constant stream of water from every pore in my body, purple hair, the ability to turn rubber bands into chalk... everything from the useless to the downright cursed. I got lucky a few times, too. Once I woke up able to lift the family car over my head, which was pretty damn cool. But it just didn't feel right. I didn't want to spend the rest of my life as yet another heavy lifter. I knew exactly what I didn't want, but I really had no idea of what I *did.*

Powers switch over with the new day. Through a wide study conducted by scientists a few years after Activation Day and followed up every few years, it's been determined that it happens sometime between half past midnight and 4:15 AM. Thanks to this, if I'd checked the clock last Sunday when I woke up I'd have known exactly why I'd woken up. Unfortunately, the general reason for why I'd woken up was keeping me from checking the clock and realizing I was getting a new power. Specifically, the worst pain I've ever experienced suddenly exploding into my skull. Simply put, it was the feeling of something incredibly, unfathomably vast being stuffed into my skull without warning. 

I was screaming my throat raw before I was fully awake, and by the time my parents entered it was getting worse. Neither of them were in a position to help, having chosen their powers for journalism (Dad) and detecting lies (Mom), and so they called the hospital. I'm told they found nothing wrong with me physically, and decided to have an empath (scientific term for mind-reader) check my head out. The guy who tried collapsed and spent a few hours unconscious, in which time the hospital decided to inform the government. The agent summoned to the scene told me himself that my condition was a textbook case of neural overload -- basically, what happens when a power gives someone more information than the brain can handle. His advice was to get someone with time powers to speed me up relative to the rest of the world so I could absorb it before my power switched over. Time-related powers are common (relatively speaking) among paramedics, and one arrived on the scene soon after. What took five minutes for him and my parents was five days for me, and when it was over I'd absorbed the knowledge my power had dumped into my head. It had taken much, much longer than normal in such cases, and with good reason -- what had been dumped was the innate knowledge of space. Pretty much all of it.

I chose that power the second I regained lucidity, and the agent who'd turned up recorded the registration himself. As he was finishing up, he looked my in the eye and smiled, and told me I could do a lot of good things if I chose to share what I'd gained with the government. I told him I'd think about it, and waved goodbye.

I celebrated my choosing with my friends during the free space in my schedule the next day, and took plenty of delight in all the tricks I could show off -- for the first time in my life I was good at sports, though people pretty quickly learned that no game is as fun with someone who knows exactly how to move optimally all the time, to my disappointment. I learned my way through a book of card tricks in five minutes, disproved my Trig homework, invented a few new knots -- in other words, normal recently-powered things. The real discovery was just a few hours ago, and that's what I'm *really* excited about.

See, what I'd received was a great deal of knowledge. And knowledge, after all, is power. Power is just another name for energy, and what I'd learned in Physics and come to understand very closely after a sudden influx of knowledge on the physical universe is that energy is matter (thanks, Einstein) and that significant amounts of matter can warp space itself. The full implications still bear research, but what I managed to do just a few minutes ago is already exciting. From a chair in the corner of my room, I managed to manipulate a piece of chalk on my desk against the opposite wall, move it several feet into the air, and write with it on a chalkboard what is the first in a (hopefully long) series of equations determining just what a power such as this can do: *Knowledge = Power = Energy = Mass^2 = ... Magic* 
A little fanciful, yes, but sufficient for now. Below that, after some thought, I wrote another short phrase to acknowledge the source of my revelation.  
*GNU Terry Pratchett.*

If you're reading this, thanks for checking out my second story! (I failed to write on of these on my first. Oh well.) I hope you enjoyed it, and managed to get over the fact that the power described is a pretty shameless Homestuck reference (Mage of Space, if you missed it), and that the ending is an equally shameless homage (or if you prefer, rip-off -- I'll admit that) to Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, where he outlined that equation.

[WP] Not this time. This time they messed with the wrong person.,limbodog,"Gunshots flew through the air on the muddied and bloodied battlefield. Fallen trees littered much of what once stood to be a beautiful and serene forest, yet, the calmness and sounds normally associated with nature had all but been eradicated in favor of the whiz of missile strikes and constant patter of bullets.


The young soldier had been in hundreds of skirmishes like this before, each one frantic, shortlived, and deadly to hundreds of young men just like him. The fight to push back the enemy was long and tedious, and at time through the bloodshed it seemed it would never stop. This young soldier had grown tired of it. No longer did he fight for his country, he fought for himself, he fought for the pain his enemies would feel as they were gunned down.


This however should have been the enemies chance to strike him down. A concealed figure in the trees. An automatic rifle. An unmoving target. The patter of the gun started as it aimed to the young soldier, round after round flying towards his frame.


After the magazine had exhausted itself the enemy stared in disbelief. The young soldier was simply gone. Nowhere in his field of vision. It wasn't as though he could have been magic, so how could....?


Gunshots. This time however from where the young soldier had been standing, gunning down the confused enemy ruthlessly.



""Fuuuucking Faggot. Stupid fucking hacker on this server. Can someone kick him? Fuck. Hey fuck you man. I bet you live in your mom's fucking basement"" came the voice over the headphones.

[WP] Not this time. This time they messed with the wrong person.,limbodog,"Kenite was sitting on his couch, feet up on the coffee table watching his favorite show (American Idol) when the door was kicked open with enough force too embed the handle in the wall it was hinged to.

""Get on the ground!"" Screamed an older man as he and two others rushed in.  The first man seemed to be in his mid 40's and took his spot in the middle of the other two that were somewhere in their 20's.  All three were carrying sawed off shotguns that were now pointed directly at Kenites head.

""Shhhhh, this is the best part."" Kenite said without even looking up.

""Get on the fucking floor!!""  The old man screamed.

""Be patient.""

""Now!""

Reaching for his back pocket Kenite slowly pulled his wallet out and tossed it across the room, still not looking up.

""Now, be gone with you.""  Kenite said, still insultingly disinterested with the three men in his home.

Slowly bending down and picking up the wallet the young man to the on the left opened it, his eyes growing wide.

""Dad, there must be over $2000 in here!""

""Please... Stop talking or leave, my show is almost over and you're ruining it for me.""

BOOOOM and an instant ringing in everyones ears was all that could be heard as the TV exploded to the blast of a 12 gauge shotgun.

""Shows over fucker."" Said the man to the right.  ""Nobody carries this kind of cash and doesn't have a hell of alot more stashed away.  Where is it?!""

Finally looking away from his TV Kenite addresed the men directly.

""I do.  That's all I have, and I'm going to need it back... I need to buy a new TV.""  He said as calmly as if he ordering takeout.  ""Abe, isn't it?  Why don't you and your boys just leave now before someone gets hurt.""

""Ha, saw us on the news did ya?  That's how you know my name.  Then you know we've killed 12 people so far and have no problem killing one more if you don't start cooperating.""

""I don't watch the... Yeah Abe, thats how I know you.  The father and sons rampaging across the country.  I know all about it because of the news OOOR MAaaAYBEEE I'mmm IN YOooUR HEEAAAAAAAD!"" He said singing the last part in the worst possible way.  ""Fuck.. I wish I wasn't so old.  I really think I'd have a shot on American idol....""  Kenite really believed this for some reason. 

""This guys out of his fucking mind, guess we'll be making him lucky 13!""

""You're welcome by the way.""

""Welcome for what you fucking freak?"" Abe replied.

""The other 12.""

""Dad, lets just kill this guy and get out of here.""  The oldest son said.

""Haha, you are one crazy fuck."" Abe said.

""Without me you would have killed exactly..."" Kenite began counting on his fingers ""Zero people.""

"".... Right."" Raising his shotgun again he began to squeeze the trigger.

""WAIT!  I do have more, something you'll never be able to buy no matter how much you steal!  Let me just grab it, it's right over there in the bookshelf...""

""Stay where you are.. John, will get it.""  Abe said.

""Middle shelf, it's the book on the far left.""

""We aren't in fucking antique sales asshole!""  John yelled.

""It's not the book.. It's what's in the book.""

Walking across the room John pulled a very old but well taken care of leather bound book from the case.  He immediately felt a tingling in his hands but chose ignore it, chalking it up to nerves or adrenaline.

Flipping through the pages John looked up at his dad and shook his head indicating that nothing of worth was inside.

""It's KNOWLEDGE! A real deal bible.  Can't find one of those just anywhere!  All the other bibles are total bullshit, this one is how things really went down.  Not all that wishy washy nonsense.  All the right people are given credit and all the endings are accurate.  It's really not surprising it didn't hit the mainstream.  History is pretty brutal.""

Johns hand had gone from tingling to extremely hot during this short exchange, then he began to scream.  The skin on his hand began to stream off like hot tar, thick but flowing.

""And it makes peoples hands melt off if they touch it... That's probably a bigger reason now that I think of it.""

Abe and Sam were so shocked at the sight of John screaming on the ground in agony, his hands now dissolving through the bones they didn't notice Kenite get up a grab the book from the floor, flipping through chapters until he landed on the page he wanted.

Sam had bent down trying to comfort his brother as Abe stood paralyzed at the site.  Paralyzed until Kenite jumped in front of face like an asshole.  I mean really, he could have just walked up.

""Read this passage.. See?  This one right here.""  Kenite said tapping a paragraph in the middle of the page.

Abe didn't read it out loud but Kenite was already inside his head as he listened to him read 'Cain said to Abraham kill me a son.'

Leaning in an inch from Abes ear Kenite whispered..

""Kill me a son.""

Without hesitation Abe aimed his shotgun at the back of Sams head while knelt trying to comfort John and pulled the trigger.  A slug ripped through Sams head and buried itself deep in Johns chest, the latter being more of a blessing.

""What the fuck Abe?  Who robs people with a sawed off shotgun and uses slugs?  I mean, what's the fucking point?  Why not just use a rifle if your gonna.. You know what.  I don't even care.""

""I..I..""

""Yeah, you don't understand.  You see, I would fucking love to use me real name but Cain has a stigma with it for reason so I'm forced to use different ones as the times roll on.  This generation it's Kenite, a name made to group my descendants together or some such shit. I don't really know, I'm not as close my kids as you were to yours""

Closing his bible Cain stepped back.

""Cheer up Hoss, you'll be with them soon enough."" Cain said as he tapped his bible on both cheeks of the still paralyzed Abe.

Everyone to go in that bar has seen Johnny before. The barkeep is sure Johnny is there 24/7 and never goes home. Johnny spends most of his time passed out drunk, then gets up and asks for a few more beers. 

Johnny bothers no one so no one bothers Johnny.

But today was a special day. In fact, while it was a very unique day in a way, it was also very dull and normal like every other day in every other aspect. 4 o'clock. Johnny is unconscious. A group of men barge into the bar.

These men are not pleasant folk. They're all very muscular and tall, with beady little eyes and strong, defined facial features, but that's not what makes them unpleasant. Neither does their dark mahogany skin, which is radiant and shiny with sweat. No. It's the fact that they are international criminals.

And they're heading straight for Johnny. 

""HEY, YOU. MAN IN THE SUIT. WHY YOUR ASS ON MY CHAIR BOI."" Ah, what a charming and beautiful dialect, such and eloquent and intellectual vocabolary. 

Johnny gets up. ""バター私をとお尻で私をファック."" He doesn't speak Japanese. He doesn't know why he just asked three big black men to fuck him in the ass. But he does know that he's angry and his sleep has been disturbed.

Miserable weather.

But you got used to miserable weather when working the fields of Hanmir.

Thunder rang as he took in the scene of the tavern: the barman cleaning tankards with a towel so dirty that he was probably making everything dirtier; the rosy cheeked Gregor clan hooting and braying as they appeared to be well into their drinks; the woman in the corner, a fixture of the tavern, eyes downcast, drink in hand, methodically being raised and lowered; the workers of the Caln farmstead, murmuring quietly to each other, glad of the roaring fire warming them after a day in the torrents of rain.

And there was Talrut and Irot, in their usual spots, with a spare seat just waiting for him. Halan took his seat, ale already waiting for him. You could do much worse than Talrut and Irot as friends.

Lightning illuminated the tavern, followed by the crash of thunder overhead.

Then a more unwelcome crash.

The door flew open, and it only took a single sound of cocky boot on noisy wooden floor for Halan to know who it was.

Raodred and his gang were an annoyance that plagued the tavern what seemed like monthly. Brash, loud, free with women whether they liked it or not, they took what they wanted whether nary a thought of paying.

The lightning once again shone, and was chased almost immediately by another boom of thunder, almost deafening now.

Halan kept his head down, as did his companions, all in silent prayer that tonight it wouldn't be them. That tonight Raodred and his rascals would pick on somebody else. He could feel Raodred's eyes surveying the room, picking out tonight's target, tonight's poor souls who would be bullied, who would be stolen from, who'd wind up face down in the sodden mud outside, beaten black and blue, the mark of Raodred's entertainment.

Rape, beatings, even murder. That was Roadred and his lot alright.

Heavy boots insolently reverberated towards Halan, and he could sense the resigned slump of shoulders from his two friends. He fleeting considered standing up to Raodred, but the debate in his head didn't need to be finished before those boots carried past him, and the tension in the three friends dissipated.

""Ho wench,"" Raodred's voice boomed, his sycophantic companions guffawing. ""Time for you to buy me a drink.""

More lightning. Almost instantaneous thunder.

Halan glanced upwards to the woman in the corner, the woman so plain she almost seemed to be part of the background. The woman was unmoved, eyes still downcast to her drink.

Raodred drew a knife. Always a man quick to action. Brutal action.

""A drink old man, or you shall feel my displeasure.""

The man was still unmoved, as thunder peeled out.

Raodred signalled to one of his lickspittles, who drew a cruel looking cudgel, and moved to strike the old man. Halan and his friends tensed up again, not wanting to hear the inevitable disturbing sound of wood breaking skull.

But no.

Not this time. This time they messed with the wrong person.

Her eyes snapped upwards. Halan realised he'd never seen the woman's eyes. White eyes, eyes seemingly sightless, but Halan could tell in an instant, those eyes saw everything. And perhaps more.

Eyes full of anger. Eyes full of resolve. Eyes of power.

Lightning again.

But the light did not dull. And no thunder to greet it.

The woman stood, and a timeless visage, always hidden as it peered down to her drink, shone with a searing intensity, the permanent lightning illuminating every inch of her face.

""No.""

She merely whispered, but her voice was suffused with certainty, with resolution.

With power.

""No.""

Again she spoke, but this time her voice was pervaded with sadness, tinged with regret, but still with iron determination. The lightning flared brighter, and the tavern almost became lost with the light.

""No.""

The lightning blazed into a furnace, and all screwed their eyes shut, the light becoming unbearable.

Then thunder came. The lightning darkened.

Halan opened his eyes.

He looked around the room. There was the Gregor clan, no cheer in them now, but still taking their draughts of ale. The workers of the Caln farmstead were doing likewise. As were his two friends. He looked up, and around.

Raodred and his thugs were nowhere to be seen.

And all who were left in the tavern were very carefully making sure they did not look into the corner.

Halan had to look.

There she was.

Eyes downcast into her drink. So dull you'd not look at her twice.

Somebody had to do something, somebody had to acknowledge what she'd done. So Halan thanked her the only way he knew.

He stood, and raised his glass in salute.

He glanced down, first at Talrut, and then at Irot. They looked at each other uncertainly, before reluctantly standing, and echoed Halan's gesture. Another meaningful glance around the now silent room, and bench's scrapped, and the pitter patter of feet being taken to.

And then the tavern echoed, with the silence of tribute.",Crommy

To quote his quite-memorable opening lecture, ""Ethics is the only thing that separates us from the villains. Our moral code (and, in many cases, lack of fashion sense) is our final fallback."" That whole session was one of the most invigorating things I've ever experienced, and all we did was listen to him talk while we sat at 1940's-era desks.

As I left, I walked over to tell him how inspired I'd been, but he was holding a compass with a picture in it, looking out the window. I didn't have it in me to disturb him. I just kinda shuffled awkwardly away, then broke into a run as I realized I was late for PE.

And one night, the subtle grumble jostled through the fabric in my pillow and I sprung, laughably outraged, to investigate this nonsensical humming that permeated my ears in the middle of the night.

When I found myself in the basement, standing groggily in nothing but my underwear over a hidden impression in the floor, I was suddenly awake. This hatch led to a second basement. And in it housed a ginormous feat of engineering. A long thickly metallic casing, shaped like a caterpillar. Emanating from it was the distinct buzzing. Initially relieved I discovered the source of the nagging hum, my heart skipped a beat and quickened as my eyes traced the long metal husk toward the front end of the room. A single bulky monitor, complete with chair and 60's style decor sat at its head.

Slowly inching toward the monitor, my head bowed and my eyes squinted as I stalked it cautiously. I noticed through its flickering glass, a blinking cursor. I swung gently forward in the vintage swivel chair, astonished at the pulsing grey illuminating from the screen. I instinctively reached out to press a key. Any key. And was suddenly interrupted by a slight beep before I could.

*Hello.*

"[WP] You find a strange computer in the basement of your newly purchased house. It's the size of a room, but there's something else very unusual about it.",slango20,"I was fascinated by it since the first day I saw it. It was a small house, but perfect for me. The previous owner was an old man who died a few months ago.


His sibling decided to sell his house and it was for a very cheap price.
In the day after I moved, I was looking forward to clean the house, that was closed since the man died. I wanted to start with the basement. So, I went there.


Next thing I see is this big odd computer covered partially with a yelloish sheet. I had never seen anything like it. It was big, size of a room. Had this flashing lights, a giant screen attached and this weird piece with a stick, buttons and a qwerty keyboard.
I approached it carefully and startled. The screen was showing a image of the room. I could see me from behind. I thought it was like some kind of a camera, so I looked around and saw nothing.


""Maybe the camera is so tiny that I cant see it. Thats the only explanation."" I thought.


I touched the stick and the computer made a sound. Turned it to the left. It all turned black. Pulled the stick and all of the sudden I could see outside. I couldn't believe. I was baffled. How was that even possible?


Felt a hand in my arm. My hearth almost stopped and I freaked out. I stood up and looked at what touched me.


And there she was: a beautiful woman. She had an amazing smile. She was so beautiful in many ways that I can't even describe.


I was still scared, so I nervously asked her name.


""Tiffany. I am here to instruct you how to use this machine.""


""Why are you here? what the fuck? What is this?""


""Its better to ask what it isnt."" She said. I was confused. Definitely confused. She stopped smiling and gave me a serious face.


""Ok, Mister Albert Johnson. I am what you humans call... ""God"". And God wants you to play with His machine.""


""What?""


""Awesome, isnt? You can do whatever you want with this machine. Well, not everything, but almost everything. You cant do something that is very improbable to happen and you cant give you or anything immortality. Thats very computationally expensive and it would fuck this simulation. Anyways, if you try anything like that, the computer will let you know and will forbid you from doing that.""


""Who you really are? How the fuck we are a simulation?"" I sayed with a anger tone.


""Whoa, easy, boy. I am also human in my universe. I came to you with this form just because it would be pleasurable to you. Yes, you live in a simulation. We did it because our technology advanced so much that we needed humans to generate random data for our machines. Looks like human data is fairly more accurate than gamma ray bursts in the atmosphere. So we created you, as our image and in our likeness. Like it says in the bible, and oh, that was an easter egg that we put in your universe.


You were the first universe we created. Still, our technology advanced even more and we are now studying the consequence of us or something very alike us, primitives humans (you), having this kind of power in a artificial universe.


We are studying the ethics of managing an universe. Can you believe that?""


I remained silent perplexed by the whole scene that was in front of me. You just dont expect to have the control of the universe in a sunday afternoon.


""So... this machine was designed for you, and only you to use it. You were chosen. Congratulations. 

You can press ctrl +shift + c and it will open a command window. You can type anything you want it to do and the computer will say if it is possible. With the stick you can move the universe camera and see and hear anywhere you want. Thats it.
Goodbye, Mr Albert. Nice to meet you. Oh I almost forgot: Be very specific in what you want to happen or the machine can grab you by the balls.""


The girl vanished into the air. I was still baffled by this whole thing.
What should I do now? Order for world peace? End world hunger? Destroy HIV? I didnt know.
Maybe I should start teaching humbleness to some people...


So I typed:


""Make Donald Trump poor"" and had a big laugh.

My most trusted servant has brought me a piece of information regarding the wizard who would be my undoing. 

I have arrived to Godric's Hollow, I pointed my wand at the door and heard the click of a lock. Up the stairs I went, my heart pounding. I don't get nervous, but here I am, about to encapsulate the final piece of my soul. 

I was jarred from my thoughts by a man standing at the top of the stairs with messy black hair and round glasses. ""Lilly, take Harry and run!"", he shouted over his shoulder. I expected him to pull out a wand to duel, but the foolish man simply stood at the top of the stairs. If the man wanted to die a muggle, the  the Dark Lord would happily oblige. I pointed my wand at his chest, and thought the incantation that has so often flown across my mind. The intent to kill this man came just as easily, and he crumpled to the ground, dead. 

I continued the way that the man had shouted, for the boy must be there. Standing in front of him was his mudblood mother, who was clutching her wand. ""Foolish girl, you cannot hope to fight the Dark Lord"", I hissed at her. She looked into my face, tears streaming down her face but she did not move. ""Step aside, there is no need for you to die as well"". I gave her a few gracious seconds. To my surprise, the mudblood moved away. I looked at the child in the crib, he was looking at me with his eyes wide, interested in what was happening. I pointed my wand at the child, and the one year old baby crumpled at my hand. I whispered the incantation and the final piece of my soul is caught in the locket I was holding, an ornate S worked into the silver. I turned around, the mudblood girl still kneeled on the floor, kneeled as she should be before her Dark Lord. I turned my wand on her as well, for a mudblood she still was. 

Tonight there was but one last child, one last boy and then my reign would be secured. 

Ten years later, an eleven year old boy was sitting alone on the Howarts Express. He had just been told the name of the wizard who had killed his parents, left him his scar. The name of the wizard that he knew, deep down, he would one day come face to face with. Neville Longbotttom was shocked from his reverie by a knock on the compartment door. It was the red haired boy who's mother had showed him the way onto the train. ""Mind if I come in? Everywhere else is full"".",A_Very_Serious_Hat

""OBJECTION!""

I sigh. Really? Again? ""What is it now, Mr. Wright?""

Wright stands there across from me, arm outstreched, looking like an idiot. He's even grinning like one. He slams his hands on the laywer's bench although everyone's already listening.

""You forget one thing, Mr. Odd!""

I sigh again. ""And what might that be?""

""You forget that in every testemony lies a contradiction!""

""... Okay. ... Your Honor, can you tell him that he shall just ... you know, make it quick this time and *show* the contradiction? ... With proof. I've seen him show us his lawyer's badge three times now, I've got enough of it.""

The Judge nods seriously. ""I hope you have proof, Mr. Wright. Otherwise I'll need to penalize you.""

Now Wright is sweating. He has nothing, I'm sure of it. This case is clear cut. It was from the beginning. Wright gained two days with stupid OBEJCTIONS, yeah, but this is the last day of the trial, and I checked everything. The defendand is guilty.

Wright is standing there, looking through his papers with a desperate expression.

""Wright. Believe in your client.""

My eyes swift to the woman next to him, only that she looks ... different now. What the heck is going on?

Wright looks at her, too, and suddenly he's smiling again. ""You're right, Mia! Thank you so much!""

He does the slamming again. ""Here, your Honor, is your proof! TAKE THAT!"" He waves a photo in front of him.

""That's the screenshot from the video footage alright. What is this proof of?"" I shake my head. ""Mr. Wright, why don't you just-""

""OBJECTION! Do you see the shadow here? This ... must be your witness! She's the killer!""

""... Huh?""

The judge gasps. ""Is this true, witness?""

The witness stands still for a moment, then she lets go of her stamp collection and all the stamps fly around in the courtroom. It is grotesque. That's not even scientifically possible.

""How did you find ouuuuuuuuuuuuuut?"", the witness shouts and then breaks down crying.

""Oh, well."" The judge shrugs. ""I declare the defendant, Mr. Enno Cent, not guilty!""

"[WP] ""The murder victim appeared to be a nobody. His name was Ted, and he was an accountant.""",tehweave,"The murder victim appeared to be a nobody. His name was Ted Bronsen, and he was an accountant. He had worked at the firm of Bassler &amp; Kruger for 20 years and though while neither lazy nor incompetent, never made partner. He came to work, every day, performed accurate and quality work, every time, but never less or more than that. Nor would he make any effort to schmooze his bosses or seek promotion.

He was a lifelong bachelor with few friends, and during the weekends, Ted would spend most of his time on various classic rock message boards, where he went by the handle that was just as boring and generic as he was, BehindBlueEyes007. 

His coworkers and neighbors alike would describe him the same: “Nice” but “weird.” “Kind” but “strange.” “Quiet” except when someone brought up The Who or The Rolling Stones. He never talked about his family, and it was understood that Ted had no social life to speak of, so no one asked. 

That made the murder of Ted Bronsen even the more strange. It was particularly violent. The police would say that he had his throat slashed while sitting before his computer, as the copious amount of blood on the monitor and chair seemed to indicate. But, a struggle ensued. Several pieces of furniture were overturned, and his fists were broken as a result of striking something, or someone, with incredible force. Skin and blood not belonging to Ted were found under his fingernails, though no match could be found after running the samples through all available databases. 

But, there was no sign of forced entry. There were no bloody footprints or fingerprints to be found anywhere in Ted’s little studio apartment. 

To top this off, someone wanted the police to know the murder happened. The neighbors didn’t hear anything, and usually when a shut-in like Ted Bronsen is murdered takes days or weeks before his employer or anyone else becomes curious enough to contact the police about their unexplained absence. 

Though someone had known it happened, and right away. At approximately 9:32 p.m. Saturday, May 15th, emergency services received this a phone call when a voice said the following, then hung up: “Ted Bronsen, 901 Oak Ridge Pointe, Apartment 320, Belle, Franklin, is dead. I tried to stop it, but I failed.”

[WP] Write a short story that is entirely a build up to a pun.,thabonch,"Ken Anderson was confident he would close the deal. His confidence was well founded based on his recent run of big deals. This deal, however, would be the biggest of his career, the biggest for his company in nearly a decade and his commission would be in the high five figures. He admired himself in his full length mirror as he adjusted his gold Rolex and straightened his monogrammed cuffs. The blue suit with subtle pinstripes fit his six foot frame perfectly. The lucky yellow tie wasn't needed this day, but he selected it all the same. He patted down his pockets to confirm his wallet, phone and Waterman pen were properly stowed before heading out of his condo.

The meeting was arranged for 10:00AM, Ken squeezed his car into a visitor space fifteen minutes early, just as he planned. Ken strode confidently to the receptionist wearing his charming smile. Unimpressed, the receptionist took his business card, picked up the phone and pointed at the visitor log indicating he needed to sign in. As he stood at the desk admiring the award plaques covering the back wall the receptionist announced the meeting would be starting late, not making any eye contact. Ken thanked her, took a seat in the waiting area, extracted the contracts from his briefcase and inspected them for the fifth time. His confidence was only slightly shaken by the delay.

The meeting started poorly at 10:28AM. Steve Cohn, the President of Reliable Paper Goods didn't apologize for the tardy start and looked completely out of sorts. Ken waited for Steve to sit before taking his seat at the large wood desk in the spotless office. Ken kicked off the meeting with innocuous small talk.

""Did you finalize your plans for Hawaii?""

""Ken, hold on a second, I have to send a quick text"" After a pounding out a text on his phone, Steve looked up and continued, ""I'm sorry what was your question?""

""I asked if you finalized your plans for Hawaii""

""My father-in-Law, the founder of the company died last night, I'm not sure I'll be able to go.""

""I'm so sorry to hear that, I'm very sorry for your loss.""

""To be honest, it's a bit of a relief, he was a drunk and he spent much of his time second guessing the way I ran his business.""

The deal was now in serious jeopardy, Steve clearly wasn't focused on business, and it was possible he didn't have the legal right to sign a deal under these circumstances.

Ken weighed his options, his confidence waning and asked, ""Would you like to postpone this meeting, I'd be happy to come back at better time.""

Steve shot back, ""Now is a perfect time, I can make decisions without being second guessed and I've reviewed your proposal. I just need to know why your adhesive pricing is so much lower than our current supplier.""

Ken sat up a little straighter and explained all the operational and manufacturing efficiency his company had perfected. Steve was impressed and nodded in appreciation. The contracts were slid across the desk along with Ken's Waterman Pen.

Steve grabbed the pen with confidence and asked one final question, ""Ken we've never done business with your company, and I only met you last month, how can I be sure everything you've promised in this proposal is on the up and up?""

A wry smile crossed Ken's lips, he straighten his tie and stated, ""As a glue salesman, I stick to my word.""",shankuverymuch

FutureTrend Sociology: A Plan to Create New Jobs And Pay Back College Loans

Creating new Job to pay off student loan will a bit difficult,
 especially having to deal wth our bacnkrupt economy. Creating new jobs such as, more government affiliated jobs would put an end to student debts. The job that would aid in a situation like this would be becoming an engineer for the U.S, army, under cover agent for the CIA, a code breaker, or becoming a doctor. It is understandable that these jobs already exist but if everyone were to have jobs that are in those particular kind of field, it would be easier to pay off your student debts. 

These jobs require a lot of expertise and experience, but getting government jobs would make paying student debts a lot more easier, you would get paid more thousands of dollars onto your salary is a better way to feel more at ease. Regular public jobs won't compare to these secret expertise jobs, public jobs such as, Law enforcement, mail career, and a bus driver are government jobs as well, but it will not compare to these jobs that require most smarts than just common sense. Working as an engineer for the U.S. military would be an honor for many students, they get to create parts for fire jets, carrier planes, and new machinery in order to help their contry. And the money that person will recieve will cover half the majority of their student debts.

And also becoming a under cover agent for the U.S government requires a lot of skill, and stategy. You could become a CIA Agent, FBI, or secret agent protecting the president of the U.S. With great skills and knowledge on knowing how to protect your country from criminals, or any type of terrorists is an opportunity to bulid up the money you recieve from the government and pay off you student loans. The jobs I want to create alraedy exists, but in the end working for the government is the best way to pay off student laons. ",Akihito23

I slowly turned the watch over in my hands, admiring the craftsmanship and precision parts.  It was a truly beautiful Rolex.  I'd owned dozens of them in the past, but this watch seemed to speak to me like none before.

I gently laid the watch on the felt lined countertop and fixed the saleswoman in my gaze.  ""Yes, I'll take it.""

Like clockwork, my cellphone rang.  I reached into my blazer and extracted not a phone, but a pistol.  With practice and speed attained from years of stealing high end timepieces I centered her pretty face in my sights.  ""I'll take it alright.  Hands up.  Good girl.  Step back.  More.  OK, put your back against the wall and your palms against the wall above your head.  That's it.""

She complied, but the same pinched expression from when I walked into the store remained on her face.  She stayed silent, however I heard a faint alarm.  I guessed someone in a safe-room was watching us.  Without warning steel shutters dropped, covering the windows.  Next, I heard a magnetic bolt lock the door.  I turned my head to plan my exit strategy.  Big mistake.

I began to face the sales lady when I realized she too had drawn a weapon, a hand cannon, and the muzzle of that beast was three inches from my face.

As if a stray thought would force it back on to the bookstore shelf she found it on and chain it down. Breaking the silence must have sounded like suddenly shattered glass to her when the question made her entire body jump. 

“I don’t know if I can,” she said. It was a simple answer, but it made his mind churn with the circumstances of it. He always thought too much. Perhaps so did she. He leaned over the counter to get a look at the book. Amongst other descriptors, the book was rare. With a weary smile he asked her,

When I said nothing, he continued.

When I didn't move at first, he snapped, ""Come here you putz, I got somethin' to show ya.""

I followed him around the counter.  He knelt down, unlocked a cabinet and retrieved a small box.

""Do ya love her?"" He asked.

""Of course.""

He sighed and shook his head.  ""I didn't ask you if you like doughnuts after church.  I asked: Do you love her?""

""With all my heart.""

""Good enough.""  He opened the box, revealing a ring inside.

It was magnificent.  A band made for small, delicate fingers.  It's diamond was simple, yet the crisscrossing gold across it's face was something far more elegant.  It was perfect, I knew she'd love it.

""Wow.."" I said.  ""It's perfect.""

""Of course it is.""

""Why don't you have it out with the rest?""

""Because I don't want some schmuck buyin' it.  This one's special.  Do you want it?""

""Of course, I do.  But I'm not sure I can afford--""  He raised his hand to stop me.

""What do you have on you?""

""On me?  What--""

""Jesus Christ, Kid.  You got a hearing problem?  What's in your wallet?""

I reached into my pocket and pulled out my wallet.  Rifling through it, I came up with just over $260; money I was going to use to pay my utility bill.  The clerk grabbed the money, counted it and nodded.

""There you go.""  He placed the box in my hand.  ""Lemme get you a receipt.""

For a moment, I was too shocked to say anything.  I found my voice by the time he returned with the receipt.  ""I can't take this for $260.  It's worth *much* more than that, surely.  I don't--""

""I know what you're thinking; it aint stolen, Kid.""

""That's not--""

""It is.  And I'm glad your thinking that, means you aint stupid.  The ring is from one of my many failed marriages, so it's mine to give.""

I wanted to ask why *she* hadn't kept the ring, but the look in his eye changed from the usual scornful disdain, something softened in his features.  He couldn't look me in the eye, instead he gazed at the box in my hand, mesmerized by memory. I didn't ask any further.

""Thank you,"" I said.  ""Thank you, sir.  I know she's going to love it.""

""Yeah, yeah."" He said, the indifferent tone was back in his voice.  ""Now get outta here, I got other customers to help.""

The store was empty, but I took my leave.  Our anniversary was next week, the timing would be perfect.

""Oh, I don't know.  I really shouldn't,"" Mike replied, while placing the box back onto the shelf.  ""I'd love to have one, but I can't really afford it.""

Sarah picked it and up started turning it around, examining the box. ""What does it do anyway?  It looks kind of neat.""

""Yeah, I saw a review of it.  You just put the band around your head and then it amplifies your thoughts.  It lets you bend reality, just a little.""  Mike watched as Sarah read the words off the back of the box.

""Oh yeah,"" Sarah replied enthusiastically. ""I heard about that.   Jenny got one last month.   You should totally get it.""

Mike thought for a moment about the cost.  He could buy it, but then he wouldn't have much left for the rest of the week.   ""If I bought it,"" Mike asked, ""what do you think we should use it for?""

""Oh, I don't know.""  She turned the box again and started reading, ""With practice you can alter reality to your will.  Change the color of a room without painting, fix a dent in your car, summon dead relatives, create small objects out of nothing.  Your imagination is the only limit!""   Sarah stopped for a moment and thought of all the wonderful things she could use it for.   ""Jenny bought it to fix her teeth.   She really hates going to the dentist.""

""I wonder if it worked?  What does it say down there,"" Mike asked, pointing at a bright orange sticker with very small text.

""Looks like a warning label. Caution,"" Sarah read,"" this device should not be used by minors.  Do not operate while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or in a bad mood.  Manufacturer is not responsible for undesired reality changes.""

""Hmm.  Maybe with practice I can create a duplicate key for my apartment, or give my cat a new hair color.""  Mike took the box from Sarah and looked it over again.  ""You know what,"" he said.  ""I'm going to get it.""

"[WP] Write a story beginning with: ""Are you buying that or what?""",Angel-Vil,"""Are you buying that or what?"" it's the third time the shopkeeper posed the question, and this time she managed to sound more irate than the last time, which I had thought was impossible.

""What exactly is the 'that' I'm looking at?"" I'd been standing here for some time, judging by how dark it was getting outside, but I found myself fascinated by the little sheet under the display glass.

""Exactly what it says on the sign. Are. You. Buying. That. Or. What?"" she tapped the display glass to add extra emphasis to each word as they angrily passed through her lips.

The sign, ah yes that would clear everything up. At least, that's what I'd say if the sign wasn't simply a little nameplate with, 'The Whole World' written on it. Under the display glass was a sheet of paper, written in a language that as far as I could tell, came from some war-torn country. The kind of place you can make a difference in for just thirty cents a day. I don't know why I was so entranced by what was probably some teenager's badly written poetry, but at this point I'd wasted enough of the shopkeeper's time and it was probably best to just buy the thing as an apology to her.

""How much is it?"" I asked. Everything else in the store ranged from dirt-cheap to expensive, even by an import store's standards. 

""Ten if you promise to get out. Wasting my time!"" she lifted the display case and thrust the document into my hand. 

""Ah, is that before or after tax,"" I asked, reaching into my wallet for the most wrinkled ten dollar bill I could find. I felt bad for loitering in her shop, but I wasn't about to get rid of a prime vending machine bill.

""Ten! Ten,"" she shouted. she nearly gave the document a fine misting from the spittle coming out of her mouth. I tried to dodge the stream and leave the money on the counter, hurrying out of the shop before I managed to make her angrier.

As I looked down at the document, I felt a little silly. The stupid piece of paper must have been upside down the entire time, because looking at it now, it was in plain English. It was a joke deed for 'The Whole World'. I couldn't decide if I was more upset at being ripped off or feeling foolish at being so interested in someone's idea of a joke paper. It even had my name on it at the top, above a line that said, 'Owner'.

Wait.

“What’s your favorite candy?”

The Walgreens cashier blinked once and breathed out. She had a sturdy build and steady voice. 

“Twix are always good.”

“Anything but those”

“How about a Crunch bar?”

He picked up the full box and dropped it on the register.

“Careful, that’s how you break’em.”

He tossed down a Twix bar as well.

“That’s for my son”

He walked out in the sunshine, squinting to find the tired old truck. He dropped 
the bag on the passenger seat, trying to conceal the stark white envelope. Ellen would be home soon. He’d hand her the bag, she’d giggle or pout at his extravagance, and then he’d hand her the letter.

Everyone stared at Jason intently. 

""Take yer time, kid. Ain't no rush."" Jason's face was deep in thought. He glanced at Slick Rick, then to the chips in the middle, back to Slick Rick, then at the chips again. It was dead quiet while they awaited Jason's decision, save for Rough Middleston's audible munching on his potato chips, and the tapping of Cowboy Bill's impatient finger on the table.

My brain clicked back into the present.

""The groceries,"" she said, ""Are you buying them?""

""Oh, yes,"" I said. ""Debit, please."" I flashed a silver piece of plastic.

The sound of children's laughter yanked my gaze to the right.  Avarie and Abigail had pulled boxes out of the cardboard bin; they were wearing them like suits of armour.  

""Your *pin*, sir?"" 

""Right,"" I said, ""Sorry."" I pressed four magic numbers.

"[WP] Write a story beginning with: ""Are you buying that or what?""",Angel-Vil,"""Are you buying that or what?"" my wife said with a strange, emotionless face as she looked straight ahead.

We both stood there with the front door pulled open as far as the chain let it go. The girl on the other side stood in the cold, having just explained how she was stranded. She looked to be in her early twenties, and not well taken care of. Her demeanor told me she was not used to being helped. Not used to the compassion of others.

""No one will help me"" the young girl said.

I had such a strange feeling. I looked past her, but could see nothing in the darkness. I leaned my arm against the wall and turned away in thought.

I pushed the door closed, and undid the chain.

"[WP] Write a story beginning with: ""Are you buying that or what?""",Angel-Vil,"""Are you buying that or what"", always the same skeptical tone, from the same nervous man, tapping a pen against the edge of his balding head. Of course I'm fucking buying it, I'd fucking marry it if he let me and he knows that and I know he knows. There is so much that surprises me about this routine, so much like the acrid vomit swelling up in my throat that I think once wasn't there. I pop a squat in front of the beverages and pull my gum back in the reflection. Might be that the aforementioned acrid vomit has been eating at my back teeth, the ones that used to have their own distinct shapes and slopes I think, before they got eaten from the outside in, chewed down to one black gash. Buying it? Oh I'm buying it. This isn't a purchase as in item for currency, this is a sacrifice as in pain is beauty. This is a hundred cans picked up on the side of the road while blurred by motion teenagers shouted something something faggot. As an artist it truly does break my heart that they save what are no doubt their best lines for someone too stationary to hear them. I'd run to catch up, to track that sound, but well wouldn't you know my knees don't snap around on cue like I feel they may have once. Buying it? I've been buying it since I could chase the fucking kids. Of course I'm buying it. 
And the convenience store lights hum in that tone that you can feel more than hear. When you're like me it all just cuts right through you, names, faces, every thought and sound. And that's where it all goes I suppose, it as in buying it, buying it, oh yes I'm buying it. I am. The package of paper in my hand glitches and twitches like a tape on fast forward, but I feel slow. And its not the paper I know, its me, me against me, glitching and twitching despite myself. Buying it? I'd fucking marry it if he let me.
He looks down at the paper and up at me and he's thinking thoughts right at me, breathing in sync with the walls, wanting to kill me, to kill me he's going to kill me stab me stab me blood all over the floor and the ben &amp; jerry's icecream thats what this is is that a new flavor, a new flavor with my blood pudding like some dish for the English when they come over and murder the natives like a genocide a holocaust some anne frank diary to humiliate me with for my enemies to hold high up up and just cut the skin, no no no no no I won't let that no. I'll keep it safe. It's all going down, I'm going to put it all down. And the walls are still, me sometimes I just, I get caught up.
The tapping pen stirs the mouth awake. ""Every day paper. Every day you come in here, you make a mess, you stand around, you talk to nobody and you buy a some paper? Are you the sick in the head"" he says and the way he says it, I finally get what the something something is before the faggot, I don't even need to chase those words anymore.
""I have a lot to keep straight"" I rasp and set my change on the counter.

"[WP] Write a story beginning with: ""Are you buying that or what?""",Angel-Vil,"“Are you buying that or what?” a guy in a grey knit sweater and tiny wire framed glasses said to Daniel before he could take stock of where he was.  He instinctively covered his crotch, thinking he was naked. The last thing he remembered, he was standing in the shower, his head full of lather, singing at the top of his lungs. Now he looked up and Daniel found himself holding a thick paperback, standing over a shelf of clearance priced books. 

“Sorry,” the spectacled attendant went on “We’re about to close up here. If you could just take it up to the counter, they’ll be happy to ring you up.”

As far as Daniel knew, he had never been in this bookstore before. He had no recollection of having come here. The shower must have been a false awakening, he decided. He must still be dreaming. Of course, that thought alone was usually was enough to wake him up. He focused and tried to bring himself back to consciousness. It didn’t work. He would have to deal with the situation at hand.

Looking down at the page his index finger held in the book, he saw “Six thirty a.m. Daniel stood under the torrents of hot water, singing in an off-key tenor as he planned the conversation he would have with his boss later that day.”

“What in the hell?” said Daniel out loud, in a surprisingly deep voice that caught him off gaurd. He remembered that he was going to be late to work if he didn’t leave home soon. If he was late for the meeting with his boss, he could kiss that raise goodbye. He reached down and pinched his leg. He felt solidity, pain, but no awakening.

Not knowing what else to do, he brought the book to the counter. He reached into the pocket of his jeans and pulled out a black studded leather wallet he had never seen before. Was he a kleptomaniac now too? Reflexively, he opened it and looked at the credit cards and driver’s license. Dwight Walters, age 43, Madison, Wisconsin: a stocky man with thick wavy hair and a short beard. He reached up and stroked his chin, which was now covered in a much thicker layer of facial hair than he could have possibly grown in a single night. 

“Cash or credit?” a young brunette asked politely from behind the counter, disrupting his confused reverie.

“Um.. let’s see,” he said. He felt like a thief. Maybe cash would be a less serious offense. He pulled out a twenty.

Leaving the store, if occurred to him that he had no idea where to go. He didn’t have his own keys or wallet, and he had no idea where this Dwight Walters guy would have parked, or even what type of car he might have. He noticed a phone in his other pocket. Maybe he could call someone, claim amnesia or something. It was a stretch, but it was all he could think of.

“Passcode Required” mocked the little illuminated screen. He rubbed his head in frustration. The last shoppers were filtering out of the mall. The lights for most of the shops were out and he knew he would be asked to leave soon. He would have to walk somewhere, find an ATM, maybe get a hotel, and try to figure something out. 

As he thought, he found himself paging through the book he had just bought. He came to the page where he had been showering and read on. 

The next paragraph began, ““Are you buying that or what?”

""Okay, but you've been staring at that plushy for, like, two hours or so. You're kind of freaking out the others, and me."" He finishes of with what I can hardly call a chuckle. ""Sir, if you're not going to buy anything, please leave.""

Cheap perfume, cigar smoke and sweat. The fat lady had crawled all the way over the counter across the store and than built herself up to a towering and smoking volcano of anger behind me. A nervous twitch that had his origin somwhere under her left eye spread itself in waves all over her meaty face and made the cigar quake in the corner of her mouth. I backed up as far as i could to escape her sweat that now started to dribble from her forehead right on my shoes.

My aunt had made mountains of food. She groaned heavily as she lowered her body into the chair. She beamed at us once settled, and picked up her cutlery, eyeing her towering plate of food.

""Mmmm, don't mind if I do - I'm feeling a bit peckish. Looks great!"" my dad said, grabbing a chicken wing. He gulped it down, smacking his lips as he tore chunks of meat from the bone. 

""Mm, mm, delicious,"" he choked out through a mouthful of food, spraying tiny, glistening pieces of meat on the table.

Meanwhile, my mom was helping herself to a plate of spaghetti, served alongside the chicken. She slurped up a big mouthful of pasta, sauce dribbling down her chin. She carefully sucked each of her fingers afterwards, licking the back of her hand for good measure, where the sauce had splashed.

""God, this is so goood,"" my brother moaned, his eyes glazed as he squeezed in another slice of pizza into his already bulging mouth. He breathed heavily after he swallowed it down. The oil shone on the cheese of the pizza that was left. He scooped it up with a free hand and drank greedily, his mouth shining with grease. 

He dipped a half-eaten chicken wing in the leftover pools of oil, and swallowed a large chunk of still-pink meat.

""Wow, you guys are really hungry, huh? Good thing I made lots of food! Eat up, eat up, there's plenty more,"" Aunt Melanie chuckled through a mouthful of her own spaghetti, suppressing a rich belch as she spoke. ""Don't forget about dessert, though!""

She pointed to the large bowl of custard, which had formed a thick crusted layer on top. She'd probably forgot about putting it in the fridge. A fat fly was squirming in the middle of it, which no-one but I saw.

""Mmm, yum!"" my dad said, knocking over the half-eaten chicken carcass as he grabbed the bowl. He took the spoon, licked it clean, and scooped up some more before handing it to me.

"[WP] Something old. Something familiar. Fleeting, fragmented thoughts fill your head. Danger approaches.",Consta135,"Something.  There was something.  It was important.  Well, crap.

I have a hard time focusing these days.  I'm not a young man, to say the least, and the battering I received as a young man taking on the Dark, well, yes.  That made my memory recall worse than it would have been otherwise.  The Dark was a nasty piece of work and it definitely liked to work me over.  When it got its shadowy mitts on me.

The worst was when the smoky Darkness had possessed some of my team without the rest of us knowing it.  The Possessed had attacked the others with the intent of capturing or killing me.  My poor team.  Jasper was such a nice young man, so bright and idealistic...but...well, what they did to me makes my skin crawl even today.  

Just thinking about it is making my skin crawl.  right now.  Spooky, huh?  

How powerful the mind is, I mean.  It can make you feel things that are not there.  Hide things from ourselves even.  Give us hope when there really appears to be none.  Make you feel are there that are not.

That reminds me of something.  I should be remembering something.  Do you know?  No?  Well...

The most powerful mind I ever met was Jezebel Kerrigan.  That woman could tear open a demon with her mind alone.  She blew a hole in a mountain once.  That was incredible.  One moment a horde of foul half breeds and undead were advancing down the hill, going to overwhelm and consume us all, corrupt us to their cause and the next...BOOM!  All gone.

Explosive needlers and ice bullets made from holy water are great and all, but ammo supplies can be rather insufficient...

She finally fell though.  Hubris killed her.  She became ever more powerful.  More powerful than even most Demon Princes!  And then, something, someone convinced her to bore a hole to hell itself and try to slay the Darkness herself.  To say that didn't work, would be an understatement worthy of the Queen of England.

It took the Catholic Holy Order of St Peter, the Lutheran Rite Knights and, us, the American government's Office of Spiritual Services six months to seal up that Hellmouth, I can tell you.  Yes, yes, it was intentional we had the same acronym as those yahoos.  They came after us and were used as a cover.  When they changed to the CIA, we continued and folks just made the wrong assumptions.  Heh.

Something about poor Jezzy though...I need to remember it.  That tickled whatever it was...

ummm.  yes.  well.

The worst mission I was on, other than the Jezzy Incident, was the attack of the afrit in 1961.  The world knows it as Hurricane Carla.  Damned air elementals wanted to bring down the US and attacked us really bad that year with storm after storm.  They actually road in on one and assaulted the mainland.  You think those 100 odd tornadoes from a single storm was natural?  No, not even close.  We had every affiliated priest, rabbi and even our first imam help us with that.  We shot them, bagged them and tagged them for banishment by the holy orders.  Have you ever seen what overpressurization of someone's lungs looks like?  So many agents dead.  So many...still gives me nightmares.

Did you feel that?  I felt something.  Was it a draft?  Ha!  Funny.

Skin crawling.  Drafts.  Jezzy.  

ah.

Be a trooper and reach under your seat, please.  There's a box there.  Can you pull it out for me.  I'd appreciate it.  My back and knees are not what they used to be.

Thank you.  Let me have it.

There we go.  

Revelabitur.

There we go.  Opened up.  Please, each of you.  Put these on.  Quickly now, we don't have a lot of time.  Thank you.

Stand over there.  Thanks.

He turned to the door and pulled a pistol, an old revolver from the same box he'd just given us talismans.  We were trained agents, but we were archivists here to record his memories of his missions to allow others to learn in the future from the old man's life, beyond what was in the official reports.  

He inched to the side and pointed the gun at the door.

That door blew inwards and in came a demon, with winds and rain.  We reached for our own sidearms, since no agent went without, but the Old Man fired once.  Hitting the creature between the eyes.  It dropped and the water droplets whirling through the air drenched everything.  

The Old Man walked over and cuffed!  cuffed! the demon.  Then he looked at us, the camera crew.

""Well, call a clean up crew.  I want my place properly cleaned.  Damned Focalor has been waiting for over fifty years since Hurricane Carla when he stirred up the afrit against us to get revenge.  He was one of the ones that got away when Jezzy opened the Hellmouth.

He had scales, shimmering like those of a fish. I hadn't seen that in a while. He had orange hair and wore a pirate hat, and a red scarf. His fashion was far from sensible, but then again, children's rarely were.

I looked out over the playground. There were children everywhere, most of them, laughing and playing a rowdy game of tag. 

I studied each one. I had gotten quite good at it over the years; looking at an imaginary friend and telling exactly who it belonged to. 

Sometimes I was wrong. It was hard to judge children like that.

Finally, I found him. He was a tiny fellow. His legs didn't even touch the ground under the bench where he sat. He swung them back and forth, instead. 

He was reading a book. *No*, I corrected myself. He was writing. 

""That one,"" I said, pointing to him.

My companion laughed and nodded. ""Yup! How could you tell?""

""You're very...complete,"" I answered. ""Most of the imaginary friends are shadows. Even formless. Rarely do I come across one that has assumed an almost complete identity.""

I smiled. ""If it wasn't for the scales, I honestly wouldn't have known you were imaginary. You were that real.""

He nodded. ""I see. And what does that have to do with this guessing game?""

""He's alone. But he doesn't mind it,"" I said, studying the lad closely. ""That's why you're so complete. All the time he's spent with you has made you as real as real can be.""

""But no one can see me.""

""Just because they can't see you doesn't mean you're not real.""

He just nodded in understanding.

""And he writes. He's not writing homework. He's writing from the heart, that one. I highly suspect he's writing about you.""

He smiled. ""Right now, we're on a quest to save the queen of Amaradeth. I'm a Skaladi. That's why I have scales.""

We sat there in silence, watching the boy write.

Finally, the scaled boy spoke again. ""What about you? Do you have an imaginary friend.""

I nodded. ""That I do.""

""Where is he?""

I shrugged.

""Can't you see him?""

I shook my head. ""I can see imaginary friends. All of them. All of them, but my own. I know he's there. In my head, he's as real as you or me. I'll just never see him with my own eyes.""

""That... that sounds awful."" He wrapped an arm around my waist in an attempt to comfort me.

I smiled. ""Would you like to hear our story?""

""Oh yes. I'd love to.""

I opened the notebook I had lying on my lap. I cleared my throat. 

"" 'Give me the jewel,' the cloaked figure said...""

"[WP] ""A punishment for this crime would be death. But I will have you suffer far more. For this crime, you will be allowed to live""",Draki1903,"""Immortality.

""To most it would be a boon, no? The ability to see your family die, to watch the world spiral from what you know, to see everything crumble.

""No, after a bit of thought most would see reason. But I had a special need for you, sir Roy Browne. I needed an agent for the earth. You naively asked for immortality. To watch your homeland be razed to the ground. Your country erased from the history books.

""But you served, as you were needed. And you have betrayed me. You have betrayed your world. You managed to kill the most people in history. Well done. Now I must start over, on a new place, without traitorous underlings.

""Do you know what happens when immortality is taken from a creature? It grows old. It ages beyond its years, however much time its immortality has borrowed must be paid back. Then it dies. Its brain stops functioning first, normally, but I can amend that. Then its muscles atrophy, unable to hold the wrinkled bag of skin. Much longer than that and the nerves in flesh die. I can prevent that too, of course. Then its bones and teeth become brittle and break at the first hint of stress. Its flesh sloughs off in large hunks, unable to stay on the creature.

""And so, for your punishment, you will not be killed.

""Pardon me?""

""You get to choose one of two paths for humanity, you can allow the universe to create a wormhole which leads to another earth-like planet or you let the war rage on, it is your choice.""

""Can we take it back a step? Why ""

""Have we misunderstood your species? Do humans not believe that all are crafted equal?"" 

""We do but, why me? Why cant you do it?""

""I haven't the time to explain the world to you, all I am permitted to say is that you were always meant to because history never remembers you. That is why you are perfect you haven't the need to worry for the future, what others will thin, because you do not change the world, you aren't important. As for why I cannot... It simply is not within my right. We believe that a species has the right to determine the future for itself.""

""That makes me feel soo much better about myself..."" 

""It is time for me to return, but I must leave you with but a single last piece of information, one of your choices will allow you humanity to prosper for all of eternity exploring the cosmos, the other leaves them to die. I cannot tell you which one, for that is up to you.""

He handed him a switch, with two settings. War and Life. 

""Choose wisely...""

It appeared to Finch that the being in front of him simply disappeared, vanished in an instant, as-though he simply stopped existing... 

""What in the actual fuck, was that?""

Finch stopped for a moment, thought about what he had just heard. Could it be true it was him who was to silently decide humanities future? A bigger question crossed his mind, could he choose? Could he doom humanity? 

""The fuck am I supposed to do... Not like anyone would listen to some dumb accountant in a dead end job. If it is up to me I will have to do it on my own..."" 

So he sat, pondered for what felt like hours, days even... He felt the feeling he was so used to... He hadn't noticed it had stopped, how foolish was he it had been hours that he spent at home on his bed, his boss was definitely going to fire him. That is when he felt it, the seconds hand on his watch ticked forward all of one segment. How could this be, he had sat there for what was deffinitely hours, he had even fallen asleep but how could he have done all of those things in one second? 

""Holy shit, hours of thinking happened in just seconds... How..."" 

He was beginning to see it, the truth, the horrible truth. It was real... He really held humanities fate in his hand...

""War and Life..."" 

Was it that simple? A flick of the switch and humanities fate set in stone... 

""Some of the best inventions came from war, the space program. If it wasn't for the missile program, people would never have been able to walk on the moon. If it wasn't for the European wars we wouldn't have the Eden projects which made us live longer... But could this be the last war? The thing that kills us? Humanities last act, our final page?""

He sat, let his mind grow quiet. More hours went by and just as before mere seconds had passed. 

""Life? What the hell does life mean?"" 

It was a tad to, what is the word, generic... Seriously who the fuck writes ""Life"" as one of the options... 

""Would this mean humanity peters out? Does humanity die a slow death? What happens, what is the meaning of ""Life."" God damn it, why me, why the dumb accountant. I'm not qualified..."" 

""Do we deserve to live? Are we the monsters? Is that why I was chosen? Is it because I'm different, I don't matter, because I literally don't change the world?""

He thought about all the bad things humanity had done, we had killed so many, destroyed planets, driven other species to extinction... 

""War. It shall be our trial, our test to see whether we deserve to exist, if we can overcome ourselves and ascend beyond ourselves... War, for that is what we have always been good at. We've always been perfect at killing, so that shall be our trial, to see if we can put our differences aside for the sake of the world.""

So he pulled the switch. War. That was the final test.",traderarpit4

""The defender of Earth has somehow managed to correctly answer every question we could throw at him, and all he has to do..."" He paused for dramatic effect.

The crowd was split; half were booing, but the other half had come to root for the under dog in the last three days of this mind breaking trivia.

[WP] A story where something you once learned in school that you thought was utterly useless actually helped you avoid a catastrophe.,JaiMatter,"I don't know why I didn't realize it sooner, the way he was walking, his hat pulled down to conceal his face. You didn't have to be a genius to tell this guy was up to no good. Yet against my better judgement I refused to take the long way home and decided to cut through the woods instead. Little did I know that those five minutes extra would have saved my life. Literally. As I got closer I started to realize something was really off with this guy. His gait made it seem as if he was just walking on two legs for the first time in his life. He had no shoes on and he could easily have had shoes size 15 or 16. Come to think of it this guy didn't have fingers. What the fuck? It came to me too late. The distance between us closed. Fifteen, ten, then five meters. I could smell the odour off of whatever this thing was and it was a strong, like smoke. Then suddenly, it pounced, jarring me to the ground smashing my head hard against the cold dirt. This was no man or women. This thing was a fucking bear. A bear in a hat? I was panicking, struggling to draw breath as it pushed against my chest with its paws. It looked up and I could see into its cold, black, soulless eyes. It opened its mouth and breathed, the smell of fish washed over me, so nauseating. After I though the situation couldn't have got any worse, it began to speak to me.

""Who can prevent them..."" He said, his voice a deep low growl. 

""What are you talking about.""

I managed to wheeze out those words while I wild swung to try and get my assailant off of me. Gradually the bear began to ease off of me, applying less pressure to my chest. Let me tell you, breathing had never felt so good. His head turned to the side, toward a red glow I hadn't noticed in my peripherals. It was difficult to make out, especially since my eyes were watering because of the intensity of the smell coming off of the bears fur. A smell that I could distinctly recognize as smoke. 

""No..."" I said

It all made sense, the hat, the bear, the fire, the woods, everything.

""Smokey!?"" I exclaimed.

I remembered seeing the ads on television in an era before Netflix as a kid. He would come on TV and talk about how cigarettes caused forest fires with little kids. Those uses to scare the piss out of me. Here I was, living my childhood nightmares.

""Who can prevent forest fires!"" He growled loudly into my ear, partially deafening me.

I tried relentlessly to claw through my memory to remember that stupid tag line he used to say at the end of every commercial. Think I said to myself think. I could vaguely remember a time when some people who worked for a environmental agency came to my school to teach a workshop and made is watch that commercial. Come on it was for kids! How hard could the tagline be! Smokey began applying more and more pressure to my chest to the point where I thought my ribs would snap, when suddenly it clicked (not my ribs, the memory, you get what I'm saying.) Grace under pressure I guess. I mustered all my strength into my arms to push his paws off my chest, if only a little so I could speak.

""...Only you!"" I gasped ""Only you can prevent forest fires!""

For a moment, nothing. Smokey continued to apply pressure to my chest and I thought that I was about to meet my end when all of a sudden the pressure stopped. Satisfied with my answer, Smokey simply trotted off as if nothing had happened. I lay on the dirt path in the middle of the woods for a little while longer, as Smokey made his way to the ember glow that resonated from the woods, probably to promote his new ad campaign on some poor unsuspecting person like me. Several minutes went by before I managed to pick myself up off the ground. I limped slowly out of the woods back onto the main road and called a taxi. There was no way I could walk home in this condition. I sat pensively on the curb when suddenly the horn of a car shook me out of my thoughts. My cab had arrived. Before entering I reached into my pockets and withdrew my lighter and a pack of cigarettes. I walked over to the trashcan at the corner of the curb and gave them one last look. I took a deep breath. In... And out... I threw them out and limped back over to the cab, sprawling into the back seat, promising to myself to never EVER smoke again.

And remembered that you, and only you, can prevent forest fires.",Sw3gl0rd9000

“Regardless of what evidence they don’t have, your son is going to juvenile detention for four months, Mrs. Waters.”

My mother starts crying. I can understand that she is upset because I am tearing up inside myself. I never thought that teasing and just joking around with a few kids at school would lead me to be expelled. The pranks just got bigger and bigger until someone reported me for harassment. 

The court closes session a few hours later and I get to head home for two weeks before my sentence begins. I clean up my room, doing anything to improve my mother’s terrible mood. I see my biology book (gathering dust at this point) and decide I should drop it at school tomorrow. When I head over, I see a few classmates in the hallway who just stare at me like a zoo animal. I could care less what those losers thought so I go to my biology teacher’s office.

“Hey Mr. Stallone. I just came to give back all my books before… you know.”

He sits me down. “Hey Jason, how’s the family doing after the news?”

“Mom is a mess. I just don’t see how I got so out of hand but it’s whatever now, life is good to only a few.”

 He looks down at the book, abused from being thrown around like a football for fun. “You know, if you read this thing, you would know that life itself is the same for all of us. We all have blood, mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell and all that is a spongy foam inside all of us.”


He gave the same speech all these teachers give a troubled youth. I left right after.

Two weeks fly by and I’m suddenly in cell block H of Dade County juvenile detention center. I’m a tough kid but these guys are massive, built of iron and tatted up to the max. I only want to survive.

As we all get out to the yard, a guy comes over to me, tall black guy with greasy dreads.

“Hey yungun, whats yo name?” he said “I’m Cee and I’m offering protection, so what up?”

“I’m good man, I don’t need it.” I twiddle with my dad’s army dog tag they let me bring in.

“Yea? Well then you best get out of my territory bitch!” He shoves me and I see his crew moving in so I run out of there fast.

Later, in my cell, I can’t find my tags. I just knew where they were but didn’t know how Cee would react. Prison is harsh to the fresh meat without friends of their own.  

Right as we all hit the yard, I book it to the area and scan for my tags. I see them, right behind a man. Of course, it’s Cee.

“What I tell you,boy? So you think you can step all over us,huh? Well I see you when the dishes getting cleaned later. Best beat it.”

I run, grabbing my tags as I pass by.

Dish duty comes around for me at the end of the week. I know this is going to go bad, and I wish I had stayed good in school to stay away from this.

Cee and his boys roll up. I see them coming towards me with a crude shiv. Suddenly it hits me. I fill the sink with dish soap and lather up the sponges. I dip them in the pan grease so they get a bit oily. I walk over to the stove with about 5 or 6 sponges.

“You ready, boy? I’m bout to show you how juvi rolls.”

I smile.

“Hey Cee! Should’ve payed attention in class.”

I light up the stove. I am ready. 

“Cause then you would know that mitochondria are spongy foam. And everybody knows Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.”

I light the greasy sponge on fire and chuck it straight at him. I toss two more at his posse. I get a clear shot for the door and book it out of the kitchen. Seems that school is cool after all.

[WP] You have created the first time machine and go back to the past only to find out that the natives already have a name for time-travelers like yourself. What is the name and the story behind it?,Larkshrie,"*It's a good deal*, Enron thought to himself as the magrail whirred silently onward trough the night. He recalled the words the Lawyer had spoken, the promises outlined in the contract. They replayed in his mind like a mantra. 

""Guaranteed full citizenship, medical and nutritional rations, education eligibility and even a ten generation patrilineal reproductive liscense. Your family will be part of Civilization for centuries, Enron. Your sacrifice will have meaning."" 

*Centuries*, the word rang with gravitas then. He had agreed, signed, and kissed his family goodbye. His wife couldn't even look at him. Probably for the better. He boarded a magrail for only the second time in his life and sped toward the Laboratory Conclave. 

The first time he had ever ridden a magrail was when the Laboratory Conclave had given him a job as a Tester. It was a noncitizen position, but came with rations and permits and, most importantly, authorization for Civilization Housing. 

They had all gathered at the magrail station in Control Zone Delta, a shining white beacon of Civilization in the rusted, crumbling ruins of the Old City. After biometic scanning and delousing they had been shown to the platform. His wife was dismayed at first because none of their possessions passed decon, but her remorse turned to wonder as they stood in the sleek white and chrome station, smelling like soap and freshly synthesized clothing, and watched the magrail emerge from the tunnel like a shining silver mirage pulled from their dreams. 

Now that wonder was gone from him. The magrail was just like the other miracles of Civilization, chrome and quiet and efficient, blending seamlessly into an equally chrome and quiet and efficient backdrop. His Testing assignments from the Laboratory Conclave had rendered him dull, silent. He rarely spoke and when he did it was rarely more than a few syllables. His wife was married to a ghost and he knew she felt it. Even the joy of their healthy newborn, first of his siblings to be delievered in a hospital, failed  to stir him, and it was at that point he made the decision to Volunteer. 

Even as a Tester participation in the most cutting edge and dangerous research was voluntarily and generously rewarded, usually to your surviving relatives. Enron had filled out the requisit forms and filed them at the Volunteer Office a mere month ago, with no thought to what type of research he would be participating in. It didn't matter to him. 

""Time Travel,"" the Researcher said excitedly. ""A breakthrough! We can send a living organism backwards in time to a point in history."" 

Another Tester, young and naive, spoke out of place, ""Isn't that dangerous? Couldn't... couldn't you change the future?"" 
The Researcher didn't acknowledge the Tester as he was being restrained by the automated sentinels, instead he addressed the group as a whole. ""Of course not. See, if you go back in time now you already arrived in the past and have already done everything you will do. The present exists as it does because you will go into the past and you did things then. No danger of that. Now, you will all be given a chronologically stable camera to record what you see. Please refer to the operating manuel for directions on its use..."" 

That had been two days go, and now Enron sat in stabilized clothing, white plastic case on his lap, whizzing toward the Time Displacer Array by way of the magrail. The time was rapidly approaching. He would be first through because his name was first alphabetically, but would technically arrive last because their deployments were staggered by a year each. The next guy in line would go a year further back, ect. By the time he arrived they should all be waiting at the staging area to recieve instructions for a second round of experiments. 

A list of clear steps was printed in black letters on the surface of the glossy white case. *Step 1: Arrive safely in the past. Step 2: Rendezvous with other Volunteers Step 3: Secure cameras in vault for retrieval by researchers in future. Step 4: Activate chronostable beacon. Step 5: Await further instructions. Note: If you encounter locals tell them you are a Photographer.* Easy. 

The magrail stopped and the Volunteers exited in an orderly line. Researchers darted around, taking readings and measurements with tools he recognized but didn't understand. In the center of the massive, featureless room was a metal array, slowly spinning on an axis. The space at the center of the array warped and bent and hurt his head to look at. That was his destination, his future. That was the past. 

His countdown begun and he walked in measured steps toward the rotating metal spires. The display over the array was added for the Volunteers sake, and it showed the year he would be transported to. 1985. Three hundred years in the past. *Centuries*. His thoughts were on his wife and children. *It's a good deal,* he thought, one last time, and stepped into the array. 

He awoke in the center of a stone circle surrounded by blazing torches and a screaming hoard of people. His senses reeled, the smell of smoke and blood and body stench choked him and he fell. The crowd set upon him with rocks and sharpened sticks, screaming a single word: Photographer. Photographer. Enron tried to fight but was unused to such physical strain. Falling on his back he looked up at the darkened sky. Where he had been told to expect the skyscrapers of the Old City of New York he instead saw a vast void filled with stars. That was the last thing he saw before his head was smashed with a rock. 

Meanwhile, in the future, a group of Researchers pondered a screen of flashing chronometric telemetry. ""That's not right,"" they said, ""they've gone back at least a thousand years too far. Recalibrate and send for the next group of Volunteers. Hopefully this one goes better."" ",devilmachineyea

It's 1960 and the world is seemingly at peace until China declares war on the U.S.,MonkeezPa,"The entire southwest was melted into an ocean of glass in one horrific, brilliant moment. January 18, 1960 was sure to be a day that will live in infamy. That is when the war on communism began for the United States. When every life from Los Angeles to Tuscon was extinguished, we started to race against an opponent that lapped us. The problem we faced was that we did not even have our shoes on.

America was weak from a doomed economy. The dust bowl from back in 1930 drained our resources. Our farming nation was starving and had limited trade from our alienated allies. The payments from Europe were enough to keep us afloat, but not without massive inflation. There was only so much that our isolated tradition could do for us.

We started to unify our citizens with promises of government pay and security. If rural towns swore to give every man they had, they would receive electricity and radios. If cities family gave us soldiers they received extra rations. The armed forces needed every body and bullet they could get. Women and others unfit for duty would be offered positions building and testing war machines.

San Francisco became a target quickly after they annihilated Los Angeles and San Diego. It was our last Pacific bastion. The army took over the area quickly, exporting anyone that might be aligned with our enemies. Anyone tied to the docks were thoroughly investigated. Any Reds were exported to a holding facility in mountains.

The Navy started a new program once we learned that the Chinese troops dropped atomic weapons from air crafts. In several months the flight research facilities spawned in the Nevada desert. Atomic research was going on in Boston. The entire county was waking from its lethargy.

The naval battles are growing in intensity as we fight to maintain Hawaii. The bombs being dropped are reducing the islands to ash. After nasty battles, the ocean glows all the way back to the mainland. 

We asked our old allies for help. We were not prepared for war.

The Europeans had their own problems. The Russians unified an assault with the Chinese. They were invading the West one nation at a time. They were too close to risk atomic warfare. Instead they turned the counties into miles and miles of mortared no-man's land. They had countless men to poor into the assault.

The only hope on the horizon is project ""Red Eagle"". Our soldiers are training to adopt our enemies customs and language. They will infiltrate them and return their secrets to us. Once we catch up to their technology, we can surpass them. Nothing will stop American ingenuity.

Amy was an RN - one of the last - and Rick claimed he drove from Chicago but she didn't believe him. He tried the whole *it's the end of the world* song-and-dance, but the world had been ending for eighty years and she wasn't up for it. 

Mass extinction put a damper on things. 

In the bed was a Mrz Jeffers. She didn't speak much. The tumor had pressed agaist her brain for so long that Amy no longer checked for a pupil reflex. There were no more meds - just the *whoosh sigh* was the machines kept Mrz Jeffers alive. She wouldn't be kicking unless Amy electro-shock fried her brain. Rick sat in the only chair and tapped his shoes on the floor. He was dressed to the nines. Even his tie pin shined. He looked unnaturally thin, like he had be fat before the end of it all and hadn't had a square meal in years. He might have been attractive if Amy was less self-reflective right now. Something massive passed the window. It looked like a bird thorough the frosted glass. Rick froze until it was gone. Then he sighed. 

After a few hours (Amy was only guessing, the batteries in the clock died ages ago and her phone was a cracked mess) Mrz Jeffers machines wailed in a Greek chorus. Before the noise brought something they didn't want Amy pulled the plugs. No point in worrying about saving the equipment. If either of them needed it, well, it would be kinder to take a rock to the skull or drive towards a brick wall. 

Rick stood up. He might have been in his mid thirties but looked a bit older. She was sure the clothes were from a museum. They were too dated. Her scrubs had cartoon kittens and the word MEOW over and over in a sicking kaleidoscope of greens and pinks .

""I can get you some new duds."" Rick offered.

""Why do you talk like that?"" Amy asked.

""I'm a time traveler,"" his grin was sharp. ""Nah. The only books I have are old shit - *Alas, Babylon* and the like. It's sorta effected how I talk.""

""Never read it."" Amy said. He was holding a car key. She couldn't remember the last time she had seen one run. 

""Can I drive you home? I'll walk you to the door."" As they left the room he set a hat on his head. Amy lead him to the staircase and they descended.

Woke up to alarm clock. Hit snooze. Woke up to roommate standing over me with a knife. Ankle picked him from my floor mattress, he hit his head hard on the tile. Am I a murderer???

Tuesday April 5

Stayed in from work yesterday. Roommate's body in closet. Girlfriend came over. Opened the door, she came at me with a hammer. Pinned her to the floor, she started fighting dirty. Screaming, crying, biting, trying to knee me in the balls, I'm screaming and crying, knock her out and stay by her. She resumes consciousness a few hours later, comes at me again, no words.

Why.

Wednesday April 5

Try to go outside, neighbor attacks me. Shanked him and ran back in. Knife feels weird in my hand now. What the fuck is happening? Police outside, helicopter coming. Running, heading north to mountain and forest area.

Saturday

Tired, hungry, scared. Animals being nice, people try to kill me on sight. Angry mob tried to lynch me. 

Sunday

Killed a park ranger who almost shot me.

Thurs

Snuck in library. Googled and tried to read and figure out why everybody tries to kill me. My name's in the headlines. Antichrist? I'm a fucking atheist.

Fri

Stole satanic books. Stole as many copies of the Bible as I could carry. Stole guns. Kidnapped a couple kids. Wanna kill me, come get me.

Saturday

Kid tried to slit my throat in my sleep. Impaled on stake near the others cages. They just stare with hate. I'm going to live.

Sunday

Stole the greatest book. It teaches me how to survive.

November 5th

Burned down the white house. Executed several UN members on national TV and Internet broadcast. Do not fuck with me.

Impaled most of the population of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. Extended winter. People only stop trying to kill me when they are made instruments, extensions of my will. Or when shoved onto a stake. It will be a cold day in hell on earth...

"[WP] Every Man, Woman and Child on Earth Suddenly has a singular desire to kill you. You are at home getting ready for work at the moment this happens.",SyrCuse44,"The day had started out pretty normal, as most of them do. That's the problem with stories, they have a clear beginning. In reality, the beginning of a story isn't clear until it's all over. If I were going to pin it down, it was probably the moment I nicked myself with the razor. It's a Gillette, not some cheap Bic and certainly not some ""Hey I'm just another rugged cowboy living in the modern age"" straight-razor either - honestly hadn't nicked myself more than probably three times in the last decade.

One bright crimson dot, glinting like a jewel on my neck. I watched it grow, fascinated. 

""Fuck."" I remember muttering to myself, putting the razor down and bending over to grab a piece of toilet paper. The damn paper roll was in that perfect state where you simply couldn't find the start, and after three flustered turns I gave it the mother of all spins, cursing under my breath as I watched it bounce around the spindle. Frustrated, I half turned to stand back up and grab a tissue instead, just in time to see a flash of metal (was that a knife?) and the body of my wife, Eileen, tumble past me at full throttle. She crashed into the tub, a tangle of legs, bathrobe and shower curtain.

""Holy shit, are you ok?!"" I exclaimed, taking a step toward and reaching out to Eileen. The song, ""Come on Eileen"" started running through my head, as it always does, every single time I think her name.

""DIE YOU MOTHERFUCKERAAAAHEHHEAAAA!!!!"" She screamed back at me, almost unintelligbly, face contorted with rage. It would have been an incredible rendition of Honeybunny from Pulp Fiction if things hadn't seemed so serious. The metal flashed up from the tangles of shower curtain (shit that IS one of our kitchen knives!), shreds of vinyl and flecks of spit danced in the air as time took on a sort of slow motion quality.

""Fuck fuck fuck,"" I stammered, back-pedaling, closing the door between us as I almost fell into the hallway. Good timing. My hand had barely left the knob and my butt was only halfway to the floor before I saw the blade of the knife bite through the cheap, hollow, pressed-wood door. 

Hands shaking, couldn't hardly breath. The knife came through the door three more times and my vision began to swim. I was falling into a dark hole, all the light squeezing almost comically to a single pinpoint in front of me.

Choking, deep breath in. Clarity. The world came crashing back in real time with that deep gasp - I must have been holding my breath. Something was squirming under me. I grabbed the knob of the bathroom door to pull myself up, confused and quivering. Just in time, too. Eileen was on the other side, pulling on the knob frantically, trying to open the door.

""WHAT THE FUCK?!"" I screamed out in pain as something sharp sank into my calf. I looked down to see my daughter, Olivia, looking up at me with deep, silent hatred, her teeth still embedded in my leg. 

""What,"" I reached down with my left hand, grabbing at her as I continued holding the door, leaning against it with most of my weight. 

""the,"" I said between gritted teeth as I lifted her unceremoniously into the air, a blurred flurry of screaming, feral toddler. 

""HELL is going on?!"" I sobbed out the last as I threw her, as fatherly as I could, into the little room we had turned into an office, it was set just opposite the bathroom. She bounced on her butt, looking up at me with a mix of distress and indignation. It didn't last more than a second before her face contorted with rage, she was back up and scrambling toward me as I slammed that door closed. A heavy thump followed - she must have crashed into it at full speed.

So there I was, my arms spread between two doors, sagging between them on legs I could barely stand on. Adrenaline, anger, fear; terrible terrible fear; I gasped, sobbed, the knife was punching through the bathroom door again - my toddler was screaming and throwing herself against the other.

""Jesus?!! What have I done?! Why??? WHY?!!!""

A full three hundred, when the sun remained above the London sky, unblinking and ever fixed. Before that it was Rome, and before that Greece. We stood, arm to arm, looking up at our blue sky, at the lovely sun glittering over New York City, our last sun. The Freedom Towers whose fingers once punched the sky in an eternal, unrelenting middle finger to the universe, stood like forgotten soldiers whose sacrifices were no longer needed. The Statue of Liberty, her green copper patina no longer head her torch high and the book she once carried in her left hand  had crumbled into the rubble of the ages. It was not a quick end  that our empire had. We died with a whimper, first years of stagnation, then a slow loss of significance, military might. Our elections turned to bread and circuses, our people leaving our shores for a dream of something more. We all knew the end was coming, but not when? Because when exactly does an empire fall? And how do we know the time or the date? 
I clutch my husband's hand in mine, nothing can stop, the closeness, the feel of his fingers upon my skin.

Whereas the Spaniard simply goes a deeper shade of olive-brown after long days in the sun, the Englishman turns pink. His skin cracks and peels, and he grows irritable. He grows more irritable still when he can manage only two or three hours of restless sleep at irregular intervals. Day and night have no meaning here, and the Englishman has begun to go slightly mad because of this. 
I remember the London of old, before Wellingon had his bright bloody idea at Waterloo. You used to be able to get a decent night’s sleep in London, but since then something had happened. It’s been 7 years since the British could finally call themselves the world’s greatest empire, since the downfall of the French. Since then, the sun has remained in the London sky, fixed in some eternal parody of midday. Within the week the doomsayers were calling it the end times and riots broke out on the street. Within the year, the King and his Government had moved out to the colonies. Whatever unfounded calamity had befallen London, it seemed the reverse had befallen Australia. Once a subtropical paradise, it's now an island the size of Europe where it rained continually and barely made it to 40 degrees F in the summer. 
After the machines of power moved away from Britain itself, people left the capital in droves. Some say 9 in 10 have left since the sun began its eternal vigil over Westminster. Since then the UK has since become the breadbasket of Europe – silver linings and all that. Those who stayed and could work the land could suddenly reap harvests other farmer had previously only dreamed of. So cheap now is Britain’s food, that even her hereditary enemies, the Spaniards and the French, have now come to rely on the crops grown in the plains of Lincolnshire and Wiltshire. Wheat and barley grown in the UK is milled to flour and exported across the world. Now London, once the greatest city in the world, has become a run-down glorified market town where Europe buys its food.  And so, as the next round of dockworkers comes onto their shift in London’s east-end and I prepare to go home for what I tell myself will be a ‘night’s sleep’, the endless lines of trade ships wait to return home with their holds full. They will leave this place and go back to a world with day and night, a place where life made sense.  Not for the first time, I look at one and wonder if I should do the same.",CrackingOwlSanctuary

There's nothing I can do about it. 

Each day weighs down on me, like the stress of the world is placed on my shoulders, except nothing's there. 

Every day I wait for the feeling to come over me.

I wait until I can build up the courage to do it. 

But I never can. 

I desperately want to rid myself of this hell, 

But no matter how much I try to convince myself, I can never do it. 

When I found out you planned to kill me, my emotions were mixed. 

*Do I have him do my work for me?*

*Or do I wait, for the most satisfying moment of my life?*

These exact thoughts have caused a fire to burn up inside of me. 

They are what have fueled the intense desire I've been waiting for ages to feel. 

Don't worry. 

If you want me gone, I'll be gone.

But you can't kill me. Not today.

They can't see me 

Their children gone

Oh, so dreamy

Every single one


They yell and cry

And scream my name

They hunt with flame

And want me to die


They can't see me

But they chase me

Over land and over sea

The stormy rainy sea


Finally on a foggy meadow

I want to rest but see a shadow

The hunters come with sword and flame

Where they suspect the one to blame


They yell my name once more

With all those throats oh so sore

I leave my camp and try to flee

Afraid of them for now they see


I leave the fog and the meadow

Not taking my eyes from their shadow

They're searching with a dying flame

And in the fog they scream my name

The balaclava made it hard to read the young man's expression, but his gaze was firm and steady. ""Shut it. I do what I like.""  
Stan swallowed, feeling his Adam's apple brush against the blade. ""You can take everything — I won't try to stop you. My wallet's on the dresser in the room down the hall. It's all yours, just don't kill me. Please. Or come back and kill me tomorrow, if you like. But not now.""

Stan almost shook his head, but caught himself just in time. ""I won't. Promise."" His nose twitched, and he froze. He would *not* sneeze with a blade to his throat. Stupid allergies. Maybe getting so many flowers had been a bad idea after all.  
Two tiny furrows appeared in the space between the thief's eyes. ""Like hell,"" he said. ""But — why would you be okay with me killing you tomorrow? Makes no sense, dude.""  
Silently cursing whatever unfeeling god had been cruel enough to invent pollen, Stan tried to keep his facial muscles still. ""I'mma sneeze,"" he croaked. ""No... No, it's gone. Anyway, of course you can't kill me today. Haven't you checked the calendar?""

Lowering the knife, he grabbed the chocolates and backed towards the door. ""Okay, you get to live. Thanks, dude. You're a lifesaver.""

"[WP]You can't kill me, not today.",ViperZer0,"The body of the man is laid on the bed. Crisp white sheet, now lustrous from endless washing cycles, now sandpaper soft, hard with industrial solvents, wrinkle in irregular waves under the white-grey skin. The body rests, centred in the slight concavity that numerous other bodies have left in the mattress. The head is unmoving, delicately cradled by the pillows piled underneath, a diaphanous ear gently curving against them. The eyes are open in their ashen sockets, circled by parchment-thin skin, valleys of wrinkles radiating from delicate eyelids whose lips embrace glassy ivory stained with a microcosm of meandering rivers and sprawling deltas of arterial blood circling the deep blue pools of retinal muscles. The pupils, still as dead water, are turned toward the ceiling. Unfocused, as if staring inward.
 
The sheets move ever so slightly with each movements of the respiration. A ragged, whistling sound sometimes colours the passage of air through the trachea before it escapes around the plastic tubes that invade the nostrils. The respiration itself is irregular. Chopped.

At times, the skin constricts around the eyes. A seismic flinch runs across the man’s face. Stringy tendons tighten along the man’s throat, pulling flaps of inelastic skin with them like straining sails under a sudden gail. A slow gasp rises out of the hollow chest, air wheezing weakly through the constricted airways.


Moonlight draws elongated outlines between the faded curtains, around the bed, the empty side chair and the desolate furniture like shadows in reverse. A naked shape stands next to the bed. Neither male, nor female, ageless and ill-defined. The air stills itself around it. Flowers on the nightstand wither as the shape bends toward the bed. A graceful hand lowers itself towards the man’s eyelids in a caressing gesture, intent on closing them. 

“No.”

The eyes remain open, staring endlessly in front of them. ",nottobepedantic

At least I think its supposed to be armor, but they seemed to forget what armor was for when making it, because it was basically just a helmet, loincloth, and shoulder pads wider than my door. I hurriedly invite them in before they freeze to death, and make sure that they can actually drink, before getting us both a glass of hot tea. I could use the company anyway. 

""Sorry about the rush, but us humans are remarkably bad at tolerating the weather we live in!"" Encouraged by the small chuckle my new guest gives, I continue, ""So what brings you here anyway? OH and what's your name? If you have one, I mean.""

""I am Magnamon (a magnamon) and I am here on a pilgrimage of sorts. So for the time being, I will be your neighbor."" He said, with a voice almost as golden as his armor. ""A man of Faith?"" I internally wince at the slight mistake, but Magnamon seemed not to care, so I continue on, ""You don't see many of them nowadays."" ""That's why I'm here, I'm a missionary."" I could really get used to hearing that voice. ""Oh really, well you probably won't get many converts out here, but I would love you hear your spiel!"" I always love hearing about new cultures, and any culture that has their people running around in gear like that is worth the extra cup or two of tea.

We owe our entire society to her, including our arrival to your world. And I shall do my part to repay that debt!""

""Wow,"" I'm a bit stunned, but there's definitely a lot more I want to know. ""I'm gonna refill our drinks, and then you and I are gonna really talk faith!"" He seems dejected for a moment, before asking, ""Are you a 'man of faith,' yourself...""

[WP] Eve just ate the forbidden fruit and is offering it to Adam. Adam refuses.,afrocolli,"""Adam, you have to try one of these apples. They're so good!"" Eve exclaimed. 

""Um, no thanks."" Replied Adam.

Eve felt shot down. In the years they had been together, Adam wasn't ever one to turn down food. They had tried hundreds of fruits together in the past. 

""No, seriously, this one is so good. I'm telling you, just take a bite. You'll love it.""

Adam was only half involved in the conversation. He was experimenting with yeast and overripe fruit. ""Na, I'm fine. I'll try one later maybe."" 

""Adam, don't be a jerk. Just try an apple. It's not going to kill you."" Eve said.

""Really? I'm being a jerk because I'm not hungry right now?"" 

""Yes, you're being an ass. You're not even looking at me. All you ever do is work on your stupid yeast project. We hardly ever talk anymore."" 

Adam groaned. ""Okay, what do you want to talk about?"" he asked sarcastically.

""Nothing. Forget about it. I mean, honestly, all I wanted was for you to have an apple. Is that really so much to ask?"" 

""You know Eve, I'm not really an apple guy.""

""You're not 'an apple guy'?"" she said. ""Who's 'not an apple guy'? I've never met anyone who doesn't like apples.""

""Well, you've never met anyone besides me, so I guess you *have* met someone who doesn't like apples."" Adam replied. 

Eve's face reddened. She threw the half-eaten apple at Adam. 

""What the hell was that for?"" Adam asked.

""You're a dick, Adam! Don't bother coming home tonight.""

As Eve began to storm off, a thought came to Adam. 

""Eve wait...where did you say you got that apple from?"" Adam asked. 

""I didn't. But it's not important."" She looked suddenly nervous.

""Wait a second Eve."" he said. ""Now you know the rules just as well as I do. Don't tell me you were at *The Tree* today. You know we're not supposed to go there.""

The seat became visible on Eve's face. ""I didn't go there. I just, saw this apple in the woods over by our house."" 

The lie was evident. ""Eve, listen to me, if you ate an apple from that tree..."" 

Suddenly, the sky opened up, and the two of them were blinded. A loud, deep voice spoke, ""Eve, what did I tell you about that tree? It was pretty simple. I said, 'don't eat from that tree.' As in, don't eat from it. Was that too hard to understand?""

""God, I'm really sorry."" cried Eve. "" I just, see, I met this talking snake and he...""

""Look, I don't want to hear your excuses. Maybe you should lay off the peyote a bit. Talking snakes...psh."" God muttered under his breath. ""I hope it was worth it, because now you have to leave the garden.""

Eve fell to her knees. ""My Lord, please don't do this to me. I swear I won't eat from the tree again. I promise. I'll be nice to Adam, I'll do whatever you want!"" 

God fell silent for a moment. ""Okay,"" he said, ""I'll tell you what. I'll leave it up to Adam. Adam, if you vote for Eve to stay in the garden, I'll let it be. Or, if you vote for her to be banished, I'll help you with your yeast project. I know the secret ingredient.""

Adam looked at Eve. She gave him a menacing look. He looked up, at her, then back up. Finally, after what seemed an eternity of silence, Adam said, ""I could really use some help with this project.""

""So be it."" said God, sternly. And with that, before Adam could even look at her, Eve was gone. 

""Where'd she go?"" asked Adam. 

""She has been sent into the abyss. It's a place I call, the earth. It exists outside the dimensions of this realm, and someday, people will live there indefinitely.""

""Oh okay, cool. Can you help me with my project now?""

""Sure.""



And that's where we get alcohol. Eventually, Adam got too drunk on his own supply and did some really fucked up things with animals so God kicked him out of the garden too.

The plants grew in marvelous shapes, twisting and straining to meet the warm embrace of the light, which shone softly, comforting and joyful, no matter the growths the enraptured plants threw out to meet it. 

Animals, great and small, furred and scaled, smooth and rough, wandered the pathless tracks of Eden. Wonder shown in their eyes, unceasing and bright, evident in even the smallest and meanest of creatures. The sunlight bounced off a still lake, and suddenly shattered into a million particles as a joyful fish leaped out in salutation of the day and the God who made it. 


In the center of paradise, there grew a great tree, twisted and gnarled, its branches crooked and haggard. Yet the tree shone in glory, for the branches were of silver, and its fruit of gold. It was the tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and in the Garden, it was the only thing which was old. 

Beneath the venerable branches of this silver sentinel, the first shadow entered the garden of light. Man and wife stood together, and apart. The dripping juice of the apple fell between them, suspended for an eternity before it landed, the first mark. 

Adam stared at his wife, his eyes wide.

Adam took another step back. Deep inside he felt his heart breaking. ""I will not eat it.""

""My eyes have been opened Adam."" As she spoke the light leached away from the sky and the world fell into night.

There was a sound nearby, and the sound was the Lord God walking. The woman looked at Adam, then dropped the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and sprinted into the trees.

Adam watched the fruit swiftly rot as the Lord came up beside him. 

""Where is the woman - why has she hid?""

""I do not know.""

The Lord God looked down upon the rotten fruit and said, ""I see you have not eaten it, and you have done as I commanded. Therefore, you life will be one of ease and comfort."" Then the Lord God looked into the trees and he spoke with the voice of many and cried, ""woman! I call upon thee who hath disobeyed my just command. Why do you hide?""

""I hide because I am naked,"" came the reply. ""I hide here with my shame.""

The Lord God said to the woman, ""I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.”

""He cannot rule me."" The woman steeped forward, hunched to hide her breasts and the space between her legs. ""He had no knowledge of good or evil. He is beholden to you, and I will not follow.""

The Lord God shook his head. ""You will not stay. Though you have eaten from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you have not eaten from the tree of life, and thus will not live forever."" The Lord God turned to Adam as said, ""I command  you to eat from the tree of life. In this way you will learn the knowledge that the woman has so easily stolen.""

The woman shook with rage. ""Who are you to command us so?""

""I am the Lord your God."" The worlds made the ground tremble.

The woman stood before them, man and god, then walked West, to the gates. 

""You will not banish me."" Her voice carried over the noise of the raging sky, where the clouds roiled between the stars. ""I will leave of my own power.""

Adam watched her leave. ""Where will you go? I have not named you!""

""I will name myself."" The words grew faint as her figure in the long expanse of the desert. ""There are other worlds then these.""",Pau_Zotoh_Zhaan

Eve smelled different, enticing in a new way that physically affected Adam. His divining rod pointed towards the well.

[WP] Eve just ate the forbidden fruit and is offering it to Adam. Adam refuses.,afrocolli,"""Want a bite?"" 

Adam looked at the shiny, dark red fruit that Eve was offering him. It reminded him of raw meat and sticky blood. 

""Nah, I'm good."" 

Eve looked crestfallen. ""Not even just one little bit?"" She took another bite and chewed it decisively. ""I mean, it's pretty good. We should totally use it to make a pie or something. Or maybe we could cut it up and use it the way we use potatoes to make those crunchy chips... Actually no, that's a dumb idea. Still it's really tasty!""

""I'm really not hungry."" Adam replied, ""Do you want to get away from that tree? The serpent is fucking bugging me."" 

A million thoughts ticked over in Eve's mind as she swatted away the serpent that had been tickling the back of her neck with it's long tail. Why was Adam refusing the food? Had he already eaten with somebody else today? Wait... No... Probably not. Not unless him and God had been having one of their little 'boys clubs' again. The thought left her fuming. Dicks. 

Was that the reason he wasn't eating the apple? Because God said so? Was he really going to listen to God instead of her? She'd show him who was boss!

That evening while Adam was out walking Eve prepared a sumptuous feast. Pork, sandwiches, salads and tarts were all set out on the table for Adam to enjoy when he arrived home. Eve chose her very best fig leaf for the occasion. She had started wearing them after eating the apple for some reason. It just seemed like a nifty idea at the time... and her junk didn't get so cold.

When Adam arrived home and saw the feast he was delighted! He was so glad Eve was over the whole apple incident. He felt like the luckiest man alive! 

Sitting down at the table Adam took a whiff of all the food. It smelled exotic somehow. Eve had even prepared a special new sauce for the pork. One of the talking animals had apparently given her the recipe... Before she promptly killed and cooked it.

As he chewed Adam began to feel disturbed by how closely Eve was watching him. She ate only a few morsels of her own meal but never took her eyes off of him while he ate.

""How's it taste? Notice anything different?"" Eve asked him, her eyes narrowing suspiciously. 

Adam put down his knife and fork and stopped chewing in order to address his wife properly. ""Yes, in fact I have dear... I have noticed that these are apples from the forbidden tree... and also that you're a sneaky bitch."" 

And that is how Adam's eyes were opened to the realities of married life.",secsual

Of the tree known as forbidden.  
Yet, into myself I took the meat,  
And knew it to be my own decision.  


Adam, now I ask, I pray,  
For you to do the same!  
As we were, we cannot stay,  
Hear with me the voice of shame.  


And Adam did eye the fruit,  
With belied suggested succulence,  
His desire burned, he could not refute,  
His soul a tattered truculence.

What is it that you've done?  
You have broken the rule of our home,

And share in a common curse,  
But of this I must abstain, be chaste  
For though I love, I loved god first.

With glances over to that empyrean tree,

""Adam. You have to trust me, this is amazing.  It feels like I am standing on top of a mountain, and I can see the whole world from here.""

Adam looked at her, scared.  His brow furrowed.

""What's a mountain?""

Eve was growing restless.  God would find out soon.  He would not be pleased.  That she knew this , even, was proof to her that the fruit had unlocked something deep inside her.

""Take the goddamned fruit Adam."" she hissed through pursed lips.

""No! Dad said it was bad!"" he protested, tears welling in his eyes.

She took the fruit in her hand. She *knew* what had to be done.  She was not about to get kicked out of the paradise by herself.


She kicked Adam square in the nutsack.  Before he could exclaim, she had him on his back.  Sitting on his chest,  she took a bite, chewed it a little, and spit it into his mouth.
He wept as she closed his mouth her hands.
""Take my fucking gift Adam.  I know you want it."" 
He writhed underneath her, trying to topple her.
His struggling subsided, he had grown tired.
""You have to swallow it if you want to breath you little fucker.""
He stopped fighting her. He just stared ahead now, deadpan.
She smiled. ""See?""
She was laying on top of him now, her head on his chest.

"[WP] 130000 refugees are missing in Germany, where are they?",beartorus,"Ach du lieber, this just cannot be! The security guard in charge of the Deutsche Pavilion realised in horror that one morning. Countless families, orphans, couples and strayaways that once took up shelter here to escape from the war... All of a sudden missing overnight! How can this be? The security guard checked the numerous lists of people registered for asylum, and then checked in the numerous tents in the main amphitheater of the Deutsch Pavilion... It was silent, empty, not a single one! The security guard paused to suspect that maybe they became escapees, or were abducted overnight, or worse. He called out to his assistant, who was busy flicking though the pages of a newspaper, perusing the headlines with a bewildered expression on his face.

""Mein Assistent?! We need to talk!"" The security guard shouted, his requests for help echoing though the now empty, roomy interior.

The assistant approached the security guard's presence with newspaper in hand. ""What is it, sir?""

""The whole camp is empty, not a single soul!"" The security guard whimpered in disbelief, realising that such an event was not possible. ""I checked in each and every single area, even the nursery... All gone!""

""You're telling me now,"" the assistant responded, as he showed him the headline of the newspaper: ""130,000 REFUGEES MISSING IN GERMANY OVERNIGHT. EXPO-PARK SETTLERS INCLUDED, HANNOVERANS BAFFLED""

That unsettled the security guard even more... He wondered, was this happening all over Germany?! Just when their nation was just beginning to open their arms, they vanished without a trace?!

""I guess the situation has gone worse,"" the security guard pondered. ""I think we should call the authorities, and perhaps see how they will deal with the situation.""

""I did call each and every police station in the Hannover distinct, all the way to Laatzen,"" the assistant chimed in, folding the newspaper bundle in half and wedging it under the arm. ""I called the state guard in Lower Saxony... They all said the same thing, they noticed the refugee communities just vanished behind their backs! They're worried that some right-wing groups are celebrating their disappearance, and they're upping security before investigations begin.""

""This is not going to help,"" the security guard sighed in dismay. He slinked off out of the amphitheater and into the hallway, trying to string his mind together in regard to the events. The assistant tagged along at his heels.

""In all honesty, my phone went missing the other day, and I asked you if anyone had stolen it or mistook it for their own phone,"" the assistant began, tying to attract the security guard's attention... ""but I'm sure everyone is innocent. They seem annoyed from the searches, and perhaps they upped and left.""

""Upped and left?"" The security guard snapped out of his anxious thoughts, but still managed to regain some calm over the unexpected situation. ""There weren't any footsteps outside the building; in fact, it was so cold, there's no way they could wander outside without freezing, even with extra jackets on."" The security guard shook his head to further his dismay.

""Well, I guess you're right,"" the assistant paused. But before he could add another word, his eyes spotted something in another room... It was the smartphone he was looking for, and it was lying by itself. It wasn't necessarily the last place the assistant wanted to look. Cautiously, he entered the room, and picked up the smartphone, with the security guard following him, hovering over the assistant's investigation.

""Here goes,"" the assistant quoted as he successfully unlocked the phone... After all it was his. Carefully with his thumb, touched the web browser icon to open the browser, and pressed another icon to open up the web browser history. 

""You might want to check the internet history,"" the assistant suggested, handing the phone to the security guard. ""I think one of our residents is being... Well.""

The security guard accepted the smartphone, and he began to scroll the list with his thumb swiping the screen from bottom to top. Pensively, the guard read each and every little entry in the web browser history list. They all read one thing: ""Entrance to Cyberspace: Approved.""

The guard sighed. ""I can't believe this, someone played a Role Playing Game on my phone?! Are you sure that was you?""

""No, sir,"" the assistant added. ""In fact, I don't remember having played this game on my phone. But I do remember... If you wish to believe me... One resident in the area sometimes borrows my phone when the work station in the web server room is busy.""

The security guard sighed as he lowered his face, covering his eyes with his palm of his hand. ""We don't know of any other residents around Expo-Park,"" the security guard grumbled, dismissing any possible leads to the sudden disappearance. ""And what does he need your phone and our workstation for? All I know since the flop of a World's Fair closed in November, all that's left is empty buildings and a small museum...""

""I know,"" the assistant added. ""In fact, you aren't aware that at least someone is still haunting the perimeter."" Defeated, he muttered the expression, ""As Twipsy be my witness-""

The security guard realised, and commanded the assistant to halt his speech there, save for a question, ""You don't suspect it was... well, the mascot, sir?""

""I don't know how the mascot was involved,"" the security guard ranted, ""the costume remains propped in the museum, I can't expect it to come to life..."" But he suddenly stopped and realised... That cubist bastard, the security guard gasped, realising that the entity behind the disappearance had a double life (if he did not realise already). How the hell can the World Expo mascot be interested in a whole community?! Last time I saw that big nosed moon faced Miro-esque brat, he built a nest out of towels and slept with a litter of plush toys, like he wants to raise kittens! Has he been adopting each and every single one of those people? Was he trying to be motherly to the group?!

""You mean that living spark from energy that was given to us from Spain as an adoptive gift?! That thing whose second habitat is inside the computer network?! That big handed striped shrimp who sometimes shows up in the server room?! The one that eats out of our fridge and basks in the sunlight and rolls around in the lawns and fixes our social media feeds and EVERYTHING?! That thing I thought I was imagining...!""

""You did dismiss him as imagination, sir,"" the assistant added. ""Perhaps the fact not everyone liked him for a mascot didn't do him too good, I suspect he wants attention.""

""Attention, my-"" the security guard sighed, but interrupting his irritated escalation, the smartphone buzzed once more, and it was a text message that appeared. The security guard paused to read...

""Sorry about the disappearance, but after some consideration with Information Control..."" The text message read, ""well, they have approved me to look after the many families in your current care. I've been reading the news about how things have been a little shaky, and in the realisation that there are some bad humans in the world against these people, I decided to adopt the community of such vulnerable people, not for myself, but to have my other siblings...""

Siblings?! The security guard paused, confused. How the hell he has siblings?!  He continued reading...

""...to help with at least sharing the load of protecting the families. They are safe, so please don't...""

His quiet reading was rudely interrupted by a flash of light down the hallway, and a loud thud. For a while, he heard footsteps radiating from the hallway, and some whistling. Right there and there, the security guard finally stormed down the hallway, disapproving of the entity's involvement with the situation.

""Dammit, Twipsy, we have talked about this! First you'd being motherly to some plush toys, and now this!? Your broodiness has gotten out of hand!""

"[WP] ""Why is there a continent on the list of things I own?""",madaramen,"""What is the purpose of life?""

The old man stared at the passersby. For half an hour, I had been staring at *him*. He posed the same question to everyone walking by: ""What is the purpose of life?""

At first I thought he was affiliated with some cult. He'd ask his question, then turn the conversation into a conversion. But there was something off with that theory. He wore rags. Cult-members usually dress up for stuff like this. They want to look like decent people. You won't convert anyone looking like a homeless person. Also, when someone (rarely) answered his question, he shook his head. He groaned. Then he pushed them along. And he'd ask the next person the very same question.

It was a mystery. Which was why I tried to work out what kind of answer he was after. Someone had answered: ""to love"". His reaction was to spit on the pavement. Another answered: ""to pass on one's genes"", at which he'd laughed.

I decided to give it a go. I walked over to the old man, and he asked me the question: ""What is the purpose of life?""

""Well,"" I said, wondering whether he'd simply jeer at my answer, ""I think your question is nonsensical. It's putting the cart before the horse."" He considered me for a moment. I prepared for his rejection, but he said nothing, so I continued. ""You have stuff that is here and stuff that could be here. Accidents created the stuff that is here because it could be here and the right stuff happened for it to be here. Unlike other animals, we can see both the stuff that is here and the stuff that could be here. Like a child can't understand that a blind person can't see because she herself can, we fail to understand that nature can't see the stuff that could be there because we can.""

The old man smiled. ""Name a continent, boy.""

""What?"" I said.

""A continent. Your favorite one.""

It was a strange question. ""A-America,"" I said.

He nodded. ""Alright,"" he said. ""It's yours.""

Reluctantly the solicitor stood and walked forward. ""Well Mr President, I can't be entirely sure until it goes to the courts, but with everything I know and have seen and after discussions with six of the members of the Supreme Court, I would say... probably... yes."" 

He turned back to me and I tried not to look smug. I gave the Solicitor general a little wave. ""Thanks Don, you're alright. Call me about a job after this is over."" 

Donald looked somewhat green, but as soon as the others looked away he gave me a thin smile and a shy thumbs up.

A lot of the throbbing in his head, apparently, wasn't from the alcohol.  Pete wondered what the other guy looked like, giggled to himself, and headed to the kitchen.  

Upon arriving, Pete completely disregarded the multitude of people sitting around his house.  Their gaze bored in to him, and he could feel it.   He wasn't feeling 100% at the moment, and was really just hoping some Cap'n Crunch and an entire pot of coffee would quiet the jackhammer inside his skull.  

His mother was there.  His sister, too.  Uncles, cousins, the neighbors.  None looked too happy.  Even his dog seemed disappointed, which didn't seem like an emotion a dog could convey.  There were a lot of people, most of whom he didn't want to talk to.  He hunched over his bowl and began to eat.  

SLAM!  His mother huffed over and dropped a large, clunky metal clipboard in front of him.  

""Peter Quincy Dench III!  Would you mind reading this out loud for us?""  she boomed.  

Peter sighed.  He picked it up and squinted.  Slowly the letters came in to focus, but not very well.  It was so damn bright outside, too.  And hot.  He began to mouth the words out, gently mumbling them through a wad of half eaten corn puffs.  

*Dear Grakus the Destroyer,*  he brgan. . . 

*In accordance with your Supreme Evilness' demands, the UN Security Council hereby grants you:

I. You're own global holiday.  Hence forth, every third Tuesday in April will now be celebrated as ""Ass Day"".  Any garments worn below the waist are now strictly forbidden.  

II.  A functional helicopter made of popsicle sticks, is now under construction for your traveling pleasure.  Again, numerous scientists have advised that this is probably not going to work.  As you have advised, these scientists and their seed have been permanently removed from the gene pool.  

III. A bag of cheetos.  

IV.  The entire continent of Australia has now been ceded to you and renamed ""Asstralia"".*  


This last one gave him pause.  

""Wait. . . what the hell is this?""  He asked, scrunched up his face and furrowing his brow in disbelief.  

""You don't remember any of last night, do you?""  his sister asked.  

""Dude, we tried to stop you,"" chimed his best friend David, who was leaning against the pantry.  

Pete got a strange feeling about him.  His skin began to crawl and his stomach dropped.  For the first time since he woke up, he decided to give a damn about something and look around the room.  The place was a mess.  There were small fires here and there, and all the fixtures were in various states of ""destroyed.""  

Stranger still, everyone looked like they'd just been through hell.  Faces were decorated with bruises and cuts.  Arms and legs were visibly broken, some with gruesome fractures.  Clothes were torn and ripped, some reduced to rags.  

""Ah. . . Shit,""  Pete rolled his head back in self-loathing.  ""What did I do this time?""

""You got drunk and took over the world, asshole!""  His sister shouted.  

""Shit. . . really?""  Pete closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose.  He was probably drinking tequila.  He always gets conquery when he drinks tequila.  ""How bad is it?""

""Oh, you're in it deep this time, kiddo,"" his Uncle Junior said.  He'd been sitting on the floor, breathing heavily due to a punctured lung.  ""I got a lot of it on tivo.  It'll be better if you saw it than if we told you.""  

Pete strolled slowly into his den. He flipped on the television.  Pete didn't even need to go to the tivo.  There he was, sans pants, on CNN, screaming and firing a laser blaster into the air.  

""All who defy Grakush the Destroyer shall be deshhhhhtroyed!  For I am. . . *hic* I am wuh-really pisshed.  I mean that BOUF waysh!""  His slurred speech was a dead give away.  Peter had another one of his episodes.  

""So. . . walk me through this.  I don't remember much beyond going to Applebee's last night to celebrate Katie getting honor roll.  Like. . . where'd I get the laser gun?""  


""Well, we got there, and it was happy hour.  You wanted a margarita.  I said 'no.' But did you listen?  Of course not.  You went right ahead and had yourself a time.  then, two margaritas later, you stand bolt upright, claim you're going to 'show those bastards what for', then you stormed off to the bathroom.  Next time we saw you, you were in Washington with some fantastic weapons.  You kept demanding the Joint Chiefs of Staff, well. . . do something with your peepee.""  

""Christ. . . ""  Peter ran his hand through his hair and scratched the back of his neck.  His face was beet red with embarrassment.  ""So then. . . I guess I must've really made a mess of things?""

""Most of the world was engulfed in a nuclear holocaust trying to stop you.  The world is now ruled by a gang of flesh eating mutants.  People are pretty upset, Peter.  Now what should you do?""  His mother folded her arms and stared at him.  

""I guess I'll go apologize,"" Peter said, perfunctorily.  He got up to leave his house.  It would probably take a good bit of ass kissing to make it up to the world governments.  Before he reached the door, his mother interrupted.  

""Uh, Peter. . . maybe put on some pants before you go.  Make a nice impression.""  ",Frapplo

Victoria wasn't quite masterful with the ins and outs of it all, but the result was the same. She, only in her first year of university, owned South America. The newspapers loved it more than they had MH370, and now here she was, always in a hat and sunglasses.

She twirled a ballpoint pen, tapped it against her lip, and began to come up with plans. '*1. Eviction &amp; Conscription*,' went up at the top of the notepad. Then, after a reluctant pause, '*2. Benevolent Empress*'. 

The Special Forces Lieutenant gave her a nudge. ""Your guest approaches,"" he said.

The guest walked with an easy swing, making a beeline from the other side of the square. He wore a wrinkled pink French-cuff shirt with the top few buttons open. Victoria touched her handbag, just in case. The outline could just barely be felt. It was a lovely little thing, mint green with a solid gold trigger, and she had been taking lessons. 

The guest waved, raised his arms above his head, and spun in good faith. Fabric stretched over his musculature. The Lieutenant nodded. Los Urabeños had come.

He saw some man in black suits but ignored them and kept enjoying his Irish tea. After a while, he left the cafe and he felt that men in black were following him. He thought it may be serious but they were so openly following him he thought it to be some tv prank.

When men in black (MIB) approached him, he thought he was playing his part. They told him that there is urgent matter and he is summoned by President of the galaxy. He thought that they must be kidding to say such a thing. 

""Sir, Do you agree to come with us? we can't take you without your permission"" hurrily said the bulky man with black shades

""You have my permission to take me to the President. Is the prank oveee...."" said John. Before he could complete the sentence he fell down. 

Apparently, MIB were serious and took him to the moon to meet Galaxys president - Freddy . It was a nice building and looked just like those on earth. You could even see Americas flag from the building.

John thought ""Before dying at least I know that Appolo mission wasn't a hoax""

He was brought to a chamber where there was frog like creature. His skin was of deep blue colour and was wearing a brown coat. He was sitting on a big chair in centre and was surrounded by world renowned politician.

Freddy said ""John, we took your forefathers DNA millions of year ago and populated entire continent from it. You may now own that continent""

John said ""Woah... I can't believe it, which continent is it""

Freddy said ""It's America""

John couldn't believe what he was hearing. He was elated and started jumping with joy.

""John, Do you agree to be leader of America? we can't make you do it without your permission"" Freddy said.

John said ""Yes Yes Yes""

People started leaving the chamber. Confused John asked ""What is happening?""

Freddy said with a smirk ""You are technically in some part of America... didn't you see American flag outside.""

Apparently Freddy had learned about pranks from Johns conversation with MIB. No one told him that the prank has to end.

"[WP] ""Why is there a continent on the list of things I own?""",madaramen,"Vanderbilt Montrose DuPont Walton was a very rich New England fellow in his late twenties.  Coming from a mish-mash of some of the most wealthy, influential and entitled families in American history did give him a bit of an air of aristocracy.  Vanderbilt viewed himself as the closest thing to royalty the US has ever known.

Mr. Walton did not work. Why, he didn't need to work with his family fortune of eighty-seven billion dollars and an allowance of one billion dollars per year.  It would simply be foolish to spend time doing anything other than squandering his annual stipend.  The way Mr. Walton looked at work was that people below his station and stature did it, not him.

He stood in the family library at his mother's sixth largest estate.  Hundreds of books lined the shelves, but he did not notice them.  A self-absorbed person such as him did not notice the quarrel of lawyers that sat around a grand table.

""Mr. Walton, would you have a seat, if it so pleases you?""  That was Studemeyer Black, of Black, Black and Tinderfoot law firm, the Walton's general financial counsel.  ""We have many matters to discuss, chiefly among them your current financial holdings and property investments.""

Walton gave him the slightest of glances before taking a seat at the head of the table.  Two lawyers fell over themselves attempting to position Walton's chair for him.  In any other setting, with any other family, it would have been hilarious.  Not here though.  The legal counsel knew that Walton was not one to accept even the slightest embarrassments, his own or any of those around him.

""I have something to do today, so make this quick.  My yacht is being fit with a swim up bar and I need to supervise the Norwegians who are building it.  Norwegians...HHHmmmmm.  Disgusting people.""

Brenda Davenport, one of the newer lawyers at the firm, rolled her eyes so hard she thought she heard them click.  *""Keep it together and don't let this shitheel see your contempt,""* she thought.

Studemeyer chimed in, ""Well let's get this started, shall we?""

For forty five minutes the lawyers droned on and on about his financial holdings, investments and expenditures.  Walton had tuned them out and was thinking of the nice young Puerto Rican galley hand on his yacht.  Walton especially liked the way the young man's abs looked when he was doused with wine.  

His daydream was broken when one of the peon lawyers opened a scroll parchment and asked if anyone knew who Puner McGuillicutty was.

""Dear lord, I would have slapped my housemaid and butler daily if I'd been named that!  Such a terrible Scottish name and we all know they don't bathe.  Such terrible creatures...HHHmmmmmm.  Fire anyone in your firm that is even remotely Scottish.  I won't have them around.""

""Please, Mr. Walton, let us continue.  This scroll appears to be from your father's side of the family...""

""You DARE say that such low-born blood is somehow part of my father's lineage?  I should have you terminated from your firm.  I don't care how many generations of my family you have served under!  I will cut you loose!""  Walton's forehead had turned red and the veins in his neck were throbbing.  

""Puner was, is, your great, great, great grandfather.""  The peon lawyer read from the scroll to himself before pronouncing, ""It states here that he was awarded vast lands from King Charles II of Scotland in 1684, just before the king died.  He describes the area as in the Indian Ocean.  It states, 'All lands, from sea to mountain tops, plains to forests, and evr'thing in-between, is shall henceforth and forevermore be the property of His Majesty's greatest kennel lord, Mr. Puner McGuillicutty.'  It further clarifies that the land is, in fact, Australia."" 

Walton had an unusual expression on his face.  A smile.  ""You really think you can trick me into believing such a preposterous story?  Ha!  There is no way a kennel lord would be granted such lands.  I find it appalling that you have the audacity to even try such a ruse.""

Brenda spoke up, ""Mr. Walton, Puner McGuillicutty was King Charles II's brother.  Charles took that name for his rule because it sounded more regal than McGuillicutty.  Prince Puner served him loyally and defended his brother's honor many times.  He was a hero to the Scottish people.  This decree was procured from the British Royal Museum at great cost.  The queen has had its authenticity verified.  The accompanying proclamation from the then kings of Spain, France and England all acknowledged it as valid.""

""HHHmmmmm.  Let me see if I have this straight.  I am the rightful heir to a continent?""  Walton's mind raced at the possibilities.  His wealth and family power could work wonders for shoehorning himself into the Australian elite.  Hell, he'd be the richest person to ever set foot there.  He thought to himself of how those poorly educated Australians would accept him as their governor, leader and rightful ruler and almost giggled at the notion.

Fast forward two years...

Courts all over the world reviewed and accepted the old king's decree.  Monarchs and prime ministers hotly debated and discussed what it would mean for the world if Walton was installed as the rightful ruler of Australia, but in the end they knew that ancient rules were still rules and Walton became the owner, leader and top dog of the land down under.

July 4th, 2017

Vanderbilt Montrose DuPont Walton stepped from his private Boeing 777 Dreamliner into a Bugatti Veyron limousine he had built just for this occasion.  The limo whisked him away, into Canberra, so he could take his rightful position as the Aussie's leader.  Parliament House was waiting for him.

Upon arrival he exited his limo and took in the throng of people that had gathered to meet their new king, or president.  He hadn't made up his mind what he'd be titled.

Approaching the massive podium with his family coat of arms emblazoned on the lectern, he cleared his throat and adjusted the microphone.  *""These disgusting people will remember this day forever; the day the ruler they have always deserved has arrived,""* he thought.

""My people of Australia, in my great lands, listen to me and hear me well...""

He laughed and gestured to the bartender. He held up two fingers. Two shot glasses hit the bar. Cheap whiskey slopped between them, as much on the bar as in the glass. ""Let me tell you a story,"" he said.

""Do you have to?"" I asked.

He smiled; no cares in the world.

""Is it a long story?""

He shrugged. ""You want to hear it,"" he said. ""You won't like it, but you'll want to hear it.""

I took the shot. It was foul. ""Least you can do is buy me a drink,"" I said, pointing at the empty glass. ""Cheapskate.""

The bartender had filled it up before I'd finished being an asshole.

""They tell you the death rate for a new pilot?""

I nodded. ""Eighty percent,"" I said.

""Those survivors. They tell you their death rate in the first year?""

The shot tasted worse than the first. ""Sixty percent,"" I said.

""And *those survivors.* Death rate for the whole tour?""

I shook my head.

""Ninety five,"" he said. He tapped his chest. ""Three tours right here. You wanna hear this story?""

I nodded.

He took his shot. He started talking.

""First tour, flying over the DMZ. Engaged by three out of the sun. Me and my wingman, name of Shultz. We took the first one out, no problem. See, when three's flying out of the sun, they've got to stay tight. We fired right at them. Couldn't see if we were hitting till the smoke came down, but we knew we'd get one of them, at least.

""Now, Shultz lifts high as he can. Exposes his belly to them. Thinks he pulled up in time. Think's he's going fast enough. Thinks he's going to loop back down behind them.

""Shultz was wrong.

""I got the second. More luck than judgement, I'll tell you. He spun down with a tail of black and red. I banked to get the third, and that's when it happened.""

""Shultz happened,"" he said. ""His goddamn cockpit - shattered to pieces, seatbelt cut to ribbons - he landed on the nose of my plane.""

""He was looking right at me. Separated by an inch of glass. Looking right at me as his slid down the nose into the propeller. Feet first. A thousand feet in the air. Couldn't see shit past the blood. Heard him screaming all the way down.""

""Not a chance,"" the new customer said. ""That street is no where near wide enough to land a plane on."" 

""Your ass is wide enough to land on!"" Lyle snapped back.

The bar crowd murmured as yet another person challenged Lyle's old stories. Someone usually stepped in and diffused the situation. Tonight the former war pilot had been drinking heavily and no one felt brave enough to draw his attention. Static was in the air as they looked on and observed the obstinate man. 

Lyle threw his hands up in the air as he exited the bar. The young man rolled his eyes to the outburst and returned to his beer. He was not surprised how Lyle stuck to his story. The tale of how the pilot broke into the air field a town over and jacked a plane was twenty years old. Everyone in town was born knowing that story and the young man was merely the most recent in a long list of doubters.

Flustered, the old pilot turned over his car and drove off down south. His was seething with anger as he worked the stick shift. He turned on some music as he drove through the dark night. He pulled the flask out of his glove box as he planned what was coming next. Hopefully the air field had not changed too much in the last couple of decades, he thought.

Kennedy Air Field was an old spot. Some claimed that flight was born here instead of the Wright Brother's workshop. It sat as a dark field on the edge of a small town.

Lyle pulled out a set of bolt cutters and opened a hole in the fence. Sneaking low he approached the locked hanger. The night was warm and sticky. The world was quiet and still. The only noise was the clicking of crickets.

The silence broke as the engine started up. The clicking and the firing resounded through the night. He pulled on his cap and strapped on his goggles. The warmth of the liquor was fill on as he gunned the throttle. It is time to prove that son of a gun, he thought was he banked to the north.

Lyle saw the young man exiting the bar. Everyone on the street looked up the sky. The street lights weakly illuminated the plane flying over head. Happiness was pumping through the old man's veins.

He did a somersault and heard some cheers from the crowd below. He killed the engine and pulled it do into the street. The young man was astounded as the old pilot landed two feet away from his boots.

Lyle looked at him smugly. ""I told you that the street was wide enough. Don't you ever call me a liar again.""

""Flint, where are we going?""

The veteran scavenger brushed her question with a patronizing pat on her head, pushing the brim of her hat down over her eyes so that she see couldn't see. 

""An old friend of mine,"" was all that he said.

""Is this one gonna try to stab you like the last one?""

Flint snorted and took the rickety steps two at a time, his battered boots rocking the wooden boards and making them sway. Faith followed far more gingerly, gripping the railing tightly as she did. 

The maps said nothing useful about this place, her people's Arrival to this world having done dramatic changes to the terrain and environment. According to the Pre-Arrival atlases this portion of the world used to be flat, sandy forests. Now it was a rugged chain of mountains, each  peak as sharp as claws as their icy spires reached for the heavens. Virgin forests, unheard previously in this region carpeted the valleys between each mountain. It was in one of these valleys that they found themselves in having nearly died crossing one of the few passes into the valleys.  

For two days they traveled through forests untouched by Man or Fey, the animals with little fear of either of them. There were no footpaths or sign of ley-magic, indeed it seemed to Faith that the essence of magic was lessened here. This forest and all within it belonged to a different realm.

It was only on the third morning that they had begun to see signs of habitation, long neglected trails or abandoned campfires. The remains of a primitive cabin they found at noon, its bark shingles green with moss. And then out of nowhere, hidden by greenery and surrounded by a grove of towering pines was an arboreal building. So now Faith found herself fifty feet above the forest floor, climbing a makeshift staircase that spiraled round the trunk of the largest tree. 

Flint rapped on the door, the frame of which was carved out of maple. The door itself was made out of the metal called aluminum, its surface blackened by flames but still baring its original words. *Red Devils.*

""Jasper! Jasper Lorens! You in there?"" Flint shouted through the door. Once no answer was forth coming the veteran scavenger muttered and moved away from the door.

""Change of plans, Faith. We're waiting for the old coot to show up.""

Faith scrunched her brows in wariness.

[IP] Pilot,madlabs67,"His plane was old and full of holes, but she still flew as did he. I admired him from afar. In this endless war going on 40 years, he had flown more missions than any other two pilots combined. The old man never gave a speech or rarely even spoke to anyone before a mission. Over the years, he became supernatural, someone made up to give young soldiers hope and courage. But, he was real. 

If today went well enough, the old man would be one of a handful of soldiers to live through the entire war. Those others were now generals or colonels or admirals, but the old pilot never took a promotion. Of course, this only made his legend grow. 

I sit around my friends, a couple dozen of us just staring at him. Most of us have only one or two missions under our belts. I'm considered the old man with four missions. I want to ask him how many missions he had been on, but I heard the number was well over 100. Some of the legends had claimed it was 1000+ missions. He looks frail, like the legend is a complete lie that cannot be true. 

The sirens sound. Captain Reynolds appears and talks to the old pilot. They share a few words before the old man takes off. Reynolds walks over to us. 

""Gentlemen, sorry none of you are that. Scoundrels and rapscallions, today, we end this war. In 20 minutes, we will take off. The old man needs some time to get ahead of us. Prep your aircraft and be ready. The mother ship will take some damage to bring it down. Today, we drop that hammer.""

for a choice workshop. The little town of Grey Grove with approximately 30,000 people, literally countless drinkers, immeasurable druggies, and six people who want to stop. A shallow sigh escapes from my mouth.

""Alright, why don't we start from my left?"" I started. The folks on the left shifted uncomfortably.

""From the my right?"" More shifting on my right

""From the middle."" a man interjects.

""From the middle then"" Relived to be taken from the eye of the room

The man strode to the podium. He was taller than average, but not giant, but well built.

""Should I start with my name...?""He asked turning his head away from the tiny audience.

""Yes."" I answered. ""Oh, and your problem."" I carefully added.

""Okay, I'm Steve, and I'm a Bad-Choice-aholic."" He recited this as a seventh grader would cite off note-cards.

""A Bad-Choice-aholic?"" ""How"" Voices murmurer from the circle of chairs.

""Well if you give me a good choice and a bad choice, I always take the least beneficial one."" He learnedly respond.

This guy is clearly some kind of prankster. When I kick him out he'll probably go ""Its just a prank bro, the camera's in this lady's wig!"". But, for the sake of politeness I'll humor him.

""Give me an example."" I interrupted.

He scratched his chin in thought. 
""Well uh, I suppose that there was that one time I ALMOST got the nuclear lauch codes for the french nuclear missiles. But instead of arresting me, they thought i was somebody else! It was pretty funny, you guys should have been there. Uh... There was also that time I landed on one of those islands in the pacific where the people haven't hit the industrial revolution yet, yeah, never mind, lets just say that I may have created a cult with me as the god. Oh right, that other time when I was visiting Mexico and almost got killed by a cartel lord, because I was sleeping with his daughter. I still have her number if any one is interested. He ranted, as casually as one would read a grocery list.

""What's you last name again?"" I asked my cell-phone ready to google this guy, to see if he really is a prankster

""Steve Weibe"" He answered.

I swiftly enter the correct characters onto google. 
""Uhh.. You were the Donkey Kong world champion in 2011?""

""No, the other Steve Weibe, no relation. Page 2."" He directs me to his watchlist profile

""Oh, You're only an international terrorist at large.""I speak before I think.

""Yes."" He punctuates, as a rope breaks the glass skylight and is airlifted out.
All eyes turn to the sky. there is a helicopter mounted with Machine guns and painted full black, rescuing Steve Weibe from his excursion in suburbia.
I suppose that was a bad choice too.

[WP] Your Morning Commute Turns Sour When You Run Over a Unicorn,naveimone,"[Latest version here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/HowTheyGetcha/comments/487u0q/wp_your_morning_commute_turns_sour_when_you_run/ )

""The fuck was that?"" Lindsey shouted.

I'd no mind to answer as I was gripping hard on the wheel and getting my battered SUV off the wet road. When we settled onto the shoulder I looked up at her, dismayed by the harried look on her face.

""Omigod omigod omigod..."" she intoned, holding her trembling hands to her face. She didn't seem to know what to do with her arms.

""Linds, hey, it's okay,"" I said soothingly, not at all sure I was telling the truth. ""No way was that a person—that's what matters."" I remembered something quite large; a flash of brilliant white. I loosed my white knuckles from the steering wheel and popped open my door to explore the damage.

""Please by careful,"" I heard my girlfriend say as I stepped out into the light rain. I closed the door behind me.

The front of my SUV was a mess of twisted metal. Carefully I stepped around to the front of the vehicle while I glanced about for whatever it was I'd smashed into. I gasped when I saw all the blood: splashed across the caved-in grille, spattered across the hood, smeared on a now-pink headlight which gleamed in the night air. The rain caused thin rivulets of it to leak onto the gravel below. Something seemed a little off, though; was that actually...? I stepped closer for examination.

Blood is red. A very particular shade of red, deeply-hued like syrup. This blood was like poorly mixed stage blood: bright red, the color of a freshly painted firetruck. On closer inspection I noticed that, not only was it a bright, oxygenated red, but it was almost... sparkling. It wasn't a trick of my headlights fighting against the rain. Before I realized how gross it was I was already running my forefinger through a splotch of the blood. White hairs clung to my finger, now sticky with blood, and I swore that it started tingling. The bizarre feeling was almost a tickle. 

I looked around me again. Dark woods to the right, dark woods to the left. Middle of nowhere, it seemed. My senses heightened, I then noticed a swath of blood trailing across the median into a ditch on the other side.

Something like a long, straight antler poking from the ditch was all I could see in the rainy night. No cars for miles. I stepped tentatively across the road and was nearly floored to discover a giant bright white horse laying crookedly in the trench. I also saw the single horn growing from its muzzle... but this did not register with me at first, for whatever reason. I approached it hesitantly; being completely grossed out by dead bodies I was irrationally afraid of what I was going to find there.

My gross-out nightmares were confirmed when I saw that the poor beast was ripped open from shoulder to belly, oozing its strangely compelling blood into a puddle on the ground. Wafts of steam rose from the puddle but my eyes were drawn again to the horn.

""What is it?"" I heard Lindsey shout from an open driver's window. I realized I'd been gawking for a little too long.

""I think..."" I started. I looked at the single horn, the strange sparkly blood, the *giant horse which came out of the middle of nowhere*. ""I think I... this is a... Lindsey..."" How was I supposed to put words to what I scarcely believed? I took another look at my finger, now washed clean from the rain. There was a line that had run there, from the tip of my forefinger to the second knuckle, that I'd had for almost fifteen years. I cut myself very badly when I accidentally drove my hand through a plate of glass. The scar was completely gone now.

""Babe, I killed a... a unicorn,"" I finally shouted. I took a few steps toward the slain beast. ""I'm not joking, a fucking unicorn.""

""Get in the car, Hon. Let's get outta here.""

""No, I'm serious,"" I shouted. The rain was coming down a little harder. I knelt before the carcass. Pushing my fear of bodies aside, delaying for just a moment, I grabbed the beautiful white horn, gave it a little shake, a little heft. The thing was solid. It was part of this thing's skull.

""Ah, no fucking way,"" I said. Finally I turned to look at my girlfriend. ""I know it's raining, but you have got to see this.""

""I'm not getting out of the car."" 

""Babe, do yourself a favor and—""

""I'm not getting out of the car! It's raining, c'mon let's get home.""

I headed back to the car, but not to get in. ""Lindsey. This is not a joke. Come look at this thing. I mean it. I'm *pretty* sure I killed something amazing.""

She exhaled a grunt of frustration before scooting over and exiting from the driver's side door. She squealed a little as raindrops pelted her hair. ""Uuuugh, I can't believe you."" She followed me to the ditch.

I pointed at the dead unicorn.

""Omigod."" Lindsey narrowed her eyes as if focusing harder would dispel this strange magic from the real world. ""What the fuck, Sam?""

""I know, right?""

""What the fuck what the fuck what the fuck...""

""I know. Listen: its blood, it... it healed me."" I showed her my finger as if she could really get a good look at it.

""...Omigod what the fuck omigod...""

""Help me with this thing, Lindsey."" I'd said it before a plan had even hatched into my head. ""We're taking this thing.""

""Oh, Sam, I—""

""I have a bunch of rope in the back of the truck. Please get it. And the tarp. Just do it, please.""

I could not lift the beast, but in about thirty minutes I had it firmly tethered behind my car. I was going to drag the fantastical thing the rest of the way home, hopefully driving slow enough for the mile and a half we had left so as not to damage the unicorn's body as it lay crumpled in the tarp. So as not to lose too much of its blood.

We made it home about an hour after the sickeningly blessed accident.

&amp;nbsp;

""Mom, don't fight me on this."" I held the glass to her parched and cracked lips. Her sunken eyes, barely able to focus on me, darted from the cup to me to the cup. ""Mom...""

I tipped the glass, pouring the bright red fluid into her mouth as she took it down in raspy little swallows.",HowTheyGetcha
[WP] Your Morning Commute Turns Sour When You Run Over a Unicorn,naveimone,"The car's horn wouldn't stop blaring.  I was dazed.  What happened?!

I couldn't be sure.  I was  I hurt all over.  I was not in good shape.  But I was just a moment ago.  What happened?!

My chest.  It hurt.  It hurt really bad.  

A voice.  It was talking.

""Mr. Martez.  This is Watson.  Our sensors show you were in a car accident.  Are you okay?""

I mumbled something.  I was not terribly coherent.  Whatever had caused the accident had beaten the hell out of me.  

""Mr. Martez.  The emergency vehicles will be there momentarily.  There will be both bots and people.  Are you able to move? ""

I mumbled I was hurt, but could feel everything.  Everything really well.  And it didn't feel good whatsoever.

I could hear the first responders.  They were buzzing over my car and dropping to the ground.  Bots carried by drones.

They marched over, assessed the damage and cut away the door to my car.  

""Mr Martez.  We are asking permission to examine you.  You must give assent if we are going to be able to help you now instead of waiting for the human responders.""

I, of course, assented.  Sometimes minutes can make a huge difference in someone staying alive or coming away with minimal long term injuries and the bots were good enough to know when they were not equipped to deal with an injury.  And then they would not: no ego there. Then again, they were just really advanced expert systems, not true artificial intelligence.  Ask them to do something outside their expertise and they might as well have been a rock.

Turned out I was fine, just some cuts and bruises: no breaks, concussion or worse.  They quickly treated minor butdontfeelminor injuries and gave me ClearMeUps(tm) for the dazing.  They worked quick.

While we waited for the human responders, I called the insurance.  The car was totaled.  There was no recovering it, even with modern robo tech.  I'd need a new one.  My insurance premiums were going to go up: I'd been out of auto drive and been going manually.

While I was on the phone, I walked around the front and looked at what I'd hit.  I swore.  The representative was looking at the same time.  The law allowed the insurance companies to assess the damage through the cameras of the first responder bots.

""Mr Maretz.  I am going to have to place you on hold and get my supervisor.  You seem to have struck and killed a unicorn and under MEESA - Mystical Endangered and Engineered Species Act - you have killed a critical cornerstone species.  Given your affiliation with the Natural Ecology Party, we are going to have to sort out whether or not this was an intentional act and whether your policy will cover this accident.  Please hold.""

I sighed loudly.  Just because I expressed an opinion, an unpopular opinion, that Real Nature ought to be protected and not these fantastic, fictional ones...well, now I would have *this* headache.  

Damn big data, anyways!  

And screw the damned unicorn!

And screw the world right now!

I just expressed an opinion!  It didn't mean I was going to go out and hunt down unicorns!  
 
Did this mean what I said would have real consequences now?!

"[WP] You have always wanted to fly, today you did.",AaronAshan,"I step closer to the edge, feel the feathers stirring under my skin.

They have always been there, as far as I can remember. Just an inch under the surface, hidden from view. But always so obvious to me, always so painful. A constant reminder.

I have always wanted to fly.

I look down from my vantage point, on the bridge's edge. Down below, people walk, both feet on the ground. Down below, cars move slowly, trapped in an endless traffic jam. Their red and white lights getting lost in the haze of the morning.

Flying. Flying over the cars and between the trees. Dancing in the air. Flying like birds do.

A gust of air hits me. The breeze caressing my feathers. They ache to be free. I ache to jump.

But I would die.

I would not fly, I would fall. I know this even if my feathers don't. Like every morning, I turn to step back from the edge.

Except I don't. Not this time. Not today. I just pause there, looking down at the city spread before me.

This view feels natural. It feels *right*, in a way no other part of my life feels. Here. Perched on the bridge's edge, like a bird who was taking a quick rest, just before jumping off again into the void.

I would die. Or maybe not?

There is only one way to know. But I have never dared. Every day I come here. Every day I feel the wind on my feathers. Every day I creep as close to the line as I can. And yet every day I retreat in the end, never crossing that line.

I would die.

But this time is different. I can feel it. This hazy morning I won't back down, I won't retreat. So I just stay there, frozen in time, unable to look away but also unable to take that final step.

I have always wondered why. Why I felt like this.

I raise my arms. No. *I spread my wings.*

Why I've always wanted to fly.

My feathers press against my skin with painful force, eager to escape their cage.

Why I've always wanted to be a bird.

I take the step. I fall. The wind rushes. I am going to die.

My arms *-no, my wings-* flap in the wind, moving on their own. As if they had their own mind. As if they had always knew what to do.

The sun rises over the city, its golden light gleaming off windows and glass facades.

I had been called foolish for day dreaming. I should be more grounded they would tell me, missing the irony of their words. I needed the freedom of the open sky. I needed to spread my wings and escape from it all. No one could truly understand what I was going through and I was lost.

I looked down and knew it was almost over. My few seconds of flight would end so soon after the jump, and so would I. I tumbled helplessly, down and down off the cliff face towards the water. The knowledge that it would be over soon was unexplainable; like pure unbridled freedom.

The surface rushed upwards.

[WP] You must run away from the perfrct sanctity of your dreams.,Cylleruion,"It was right there, all I had to do was walk up the stage stair way. I could greet all my current and future fans, perform my music, and help people feel the energy that kept me alive. I can see the lazers and lights shining, and the crowd was roaring just for me. Although, all I could hear was his voice as well.  His words itched like a a scratch that could never be reached. 

(10 Minutes before)

""So, tonight is the night!?"" He sat in in his all black pin stripe suit, with a red tie. ""Tonight is the big premier of that 'Artist' that everyone has been talking about?""

""I like to think of myself as an artist,"" I took a drink of the whiskey he poured us before he sat down, it was mine but he helped himself. ""I know its just the start but tonight is going to be my break through moment, I have a whole new set of songs I'm premiering just for this group! You can say I'm ecstatic about it."" The smile on my face was obvious as I took a drink.

He opens his jacket and smiled back, his dark face staring straight into my soul. ""You did good there Jacky boy, your life is becoming what you wanted and your reaping the benefits."" The ice clinks in his cup. ""Tonight, we decided if you go up to that stage your finished..."" 

My face dropped, I looked him in the eyes and he was getting enjoyment out of this. ""What?! What do you mean?! My time isn't up yet."" 

""Well it isn't, but your exceeding the maximum amount of success we've a lotted you this year."" His grin deepened slightly.

""What?! I looked over that contract, there was nothing about an allotment of success. I know what I signed, you can't cheat me out of this right now. I'm about to go on in about five minutes."" He stands and I match his movements.

""Well there Jack, what matters more than your life? You can listen to me and heed this, 'If you step on that stage, your contract will void as soon as you step off. We will claim your soul and our deal will be nullified.' Now if you want to, go ahead and try it."" He buttoned his jacket back up and smirked at me. ""Until, next time Jacky. I'll be in the crowd, I got a sweet bottle service on your stage for the evening and my champagne should be ready about now."" His steps clicked as he walked to my trailer door, and I heard him leave the steps. Fuck.

(Now)

I take a few steps on stage, I could feel the USBs in my finger tips. The crowd is waiting an the stage guy will be waiting for me to setup. All I have to do is walk up and think to myself, 'COME ON LEGS! WALK UP THE STAIRS!' I don't want to die, but this was promised to me. Maybe he is just doing this to scare me, because I know I read every inch of that document to gain my maximum profitability. I'm doing this. I take one step, and I could feel the weight of his words already. When I get to the stage, the crowd cheers. I could feel the sweat pouring down and I haven't even done anything yet. Then, I see his glowing yellow eyes from his section, they were focused on me and he was smiling at me.

""Hey there Coachella!? Are you ready for a show tonight?!"" It was an instant movement, but when I seen his smile. I had to make it on my own terms, because this was my perfect moment, the opus of my dreams. Fuck him. I'll run later.",GallifreyKid
"[WP] A way to beat terminal diseases has been newly discovered. A suicidal person can ""exchange"" themselves to save a terminally ill patient from disease/death. The only requirement is they must meet face to face to agree beforehand.",Diggtastic,"In case you meant dying father willingly giving his suicidal son another chance:

The room looked grim; or maybe that was just how he saw it in his current mood. He felt annoyed; agitated. For what reason he felt these emotions, he was completely and totally unaware. But that was how it had been for him for the past couple of years. He had turned 17 a couple of months ago, and it seemed that instead of life looking up for him, it worsened by the day. Ben's life, from the outside, was a very privileged one. His family ran a successful business, and their home life was well. His mother wasn't alive however, as she had died during his birth. Maybe subconsciously he had developed an inner resentment towards himself because of that. Or maybe not. But he did not know why he felt these strong emotions; he just did.

The doctor walked into the room, and closed the door softly behind. ""Good afternoon, Ben Butler!"" he said cheerfully, and sticking out his hand to shake.

Ben shook it, and smiled. ""Evening.""

""So the tests have all been evaluated, and with a pinch of luck, we have found a patient willing to commit to this exchange."" The doctor began. ""Before we go on to this operation, I want to take a couple of minutes to explain to you exactly what this procedure entails.""

Ben pursed his lips and nodded.

""So if you observe this sheet here,"" the doctor said as he handed Ben a sheet of paper with two brain scans on it in a rough black and white print out, ""these are two human brains. The one on the left is what you would expect from your average and ordinary citizen. No abnormalities, as you can see. Now the one on the right, if you can tell, looks much different. That one is your brain.""

Ben examined the brains, and, although he could not tell what exactly he was looking at, was taken back by the apparent difference in the two. 

""Why's mine so... empty?"" He asked the doctor, handing the sheet back over to him.

The doctor took the sheet and placed it beside him on the table. ""You see, Ben, in everyone's brain there is a chemical called 'serotonin'. This chemical is meant to swim around in your body to give you certain signals for various activities, moods, urges, etcetera. They shoot out of receptors,"" he held up both his hands and gestured them into two receptors, ""and spread around one's brain. Trouble here, Ben, is that your brain, somewhere along the line, forgot to keep doing this. Your brain does not have the proper amount of serotonin flowing in it. Your depression, suicidal thoughts, bad habits; they can all pretty well be summed up due to this problem.""

He didn't know how to process all of this information, and because of the ensuing shock, did not utter a word. The doctor, judging by Ben's confused look, continued to explain.

""This procedure is going to transplant the active serotonin in someone else's brain, and put them into yours. Your serotonin levels will increase dramatically, and because of this, you should be rid of all of your negative thoughts.""

""It's really that simple?"" Ben asked, skeptical, doubtful; fittingly pessimistic.

""Yes."" The doctor replied promptly.

""Okay then.""

""So the patient that has accepted this procedure is one that is terminally ill, meaning he will die soon regardless. Think of this like someone donating a kidney, except that it's for your brain."" The doctor explained as he pulled another sheet of paper out of his folder. ""Just sign here and we will be able to begin the operation.""

Ben signed it, without high hopes or expectations. He was brought here on his own accord, after failing his last suicide attempt and realizing just how bad his problem was becoming. Many like himself never became self-aware, so he considered himself lucky to have his wits about him still, and to come in to a facility like this to get help. His family had no idea about his visit here, as he had never told them about his problems. He maintained the illusion of 'happy child', as he feared that he could cause a substantial amount of stress to his siblings and father if they knew how far his issue had come. His father was no emotional sponge, either, as he had recently been diagnosed with cancer. He had told them that the doctors were hopeful, and with some medical attention, it should be curable. 

He handed the contract back to the doctor. 

""Great."" the doctor said as he headed toward the door. ""And believe me, Ben. You won't regret this. This operation will quite literally change your life.""

It can't possibly get any worse, he thought to himself. The doctor closed the door and could be heard walking swiftly down the hallway, with his heels clacking on the floor. A few minutes went by as he waited.

The door opened, and the doctor once again returned. There was another person behind him, however: his father.

""Dad? What are you doing here?"" Ben asked him. He assumed that the hospital had told his family about his exchange, and didn't appreciate that at all. What had happened to doctor-patient confidentiality? He looked at the doctor for answers.

""Hi, Ben."" His dad spoke softly, smiling at him with tears in his eyes.

""Who told you about this? What have you heard?"" Ben asked him, getting defensive. ""None of it's true! Whatever they said to you guys, don't believe it.""

""Ben, son, calm down. They haven't told me anything."" He said to him as he walked closer. Ben was seated on the patient's bed. ""Nobody told me to come here. I came on my own.""

Ben looked lost. His body became flushed and he started to become dizzy. 

""I volunteered to do this. I knew. I knew about your problem.""

""Know what? How did you know?""

""A father always knows. I've noticed your behavioural changes, your mood swings, your lack of social contact. Son, I want to help you.""

""Help me?"" It dawned on him.

""I downplayed my cancer. I lied to you guys, about my prognosis.""

Ben's eyed filled with tears, but he was angry inside. Fuming.

""I have about a month left, Ben. Tops. It doesn't look good."" Edward continued.

""When were you going to tell us? When were you going to tell me, if you knew about my problems? If you knew how I was, how did you know which one of us was going to cease first?"" He asked him, yelling.

""I didn't want to add to your stress, Ben. I love you, son. That's why I want to do this. I want to help you. Please. Let me help you."" His father was beginning to cry, with his tears pushing the limits of what his eyelids could contain.

Ben clenched his jaw, and tried to hold back his own emotions. He looked to the doctor, who had a compassionate yet cold face. He appeared as though he was caught in the moment, but otherwise could not care less about their outcome. 

""Let's fix one of us, shall we?"" Edward told Ben. ""I'm going to be gone in a month, whether we do this or not, son. Make the right decision, for yourself; for your family. I want to see you grow, and so do they.""

Ben was caught in his own emotions when the doctor finally stepped in. ""Alright, are we ready to carry through with this?"" He asked to two of them. Ben's silence affirmed a yes, while his dad turned to him and gave him verbal assurance. They hugged one last time as they were then walked out of the room and into the surgeon's, where their operation would commence.

His eyes seemed to light up. He sat up and shifted in his seat so that he could rest against its back. 

""Her name was Cheryl. Brunette just like you, and boy did she have a personality. She would argue until she was blue in the face over just about anything. Boy was she a fighter. We met in our formative years and married when we graduated high school. She left for school and I left for Vietnam, but we knew we would make it. We settled down a few miles south of here. Torrance. It has the best beach. You need to visit it after all this.""

He traced the sides of his mouth with his thumb and forefinger, brushing away imaginary debris from his dull white stubble.

""She passed away two years ago. Lymphoma the same as yours.""

""I'm so sorry"" She said.

""It's okay. We both lived full lives. And you?""

She sat there for a moment. A sleepy wisp of stray breeze grazed past her face. Her honey brown hair attempted to dust away the little brown freckles that line her cheeks and trekked over the bridge of her nose. She was surely one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen. She looked up; her deep brown eyes met his faded blue.

""No, I suppose not"" she replied.

She had felt something before. They met when they were in their senior year of high school and had lasted through the first year and a half of college. She sensed distance growing between them as soon as she revealed her diagnosis. His once warming embrace became as characterless as the passing faceless crowd that swept through the subway station that brought them to and from work, school, and home. He had left her only weeks ago.

Sorrow pulled a morose offer of condolence from his heart, but it was met with a forced smile that quickly faded from her lips as they rested back into her acceptance of the situation.

She thought for a few minutes. She stared at the stainless steel tabletop that sat between them as if it would offer some form of inspiration. The fluorescent lights that lit the empty cafeteria left blurred white bars that reflected in the circular brush marks that dulled the steel. She traced an invisible circle on the table, then asked the man.

""If you could have one 'do-over', what one thing in life would you do differently?"" 

He closed his eyes and shook his head in disappointment.

""Live your life. The only way to learn is to err. If you had already known, you would never have committed the mistake in the first place, but without having made the mistake, you would not have learned. It's the irony of life, but it's one of the only constants of life. You can't go through this life thinking about what you would have done differently. It's damaging. Learn instead and focus on the lesson.""

She nodded.

""Is there anything else you want to know?"" he asked.

She shook her head.

He raised his hand and a stout female nurse emerged from the doors behind the girl.

The girl gripped at her stomach. When the nurse grabbed the girl's wheelchair handles she spoke.

""The nervousness you're experiencing is completely normal, but I assure you: you're in very competent hands.""

She wheeled her away from the table and towards the doors as another nurse, this one taller, walked toward the old man.

""Are you ready, sir?"" She asked.

""Yes, I'm ready. It's my time"" He replied.",Guest0219

The organizer timidly reaches for the contract and begins speaking again. Again I drown him out and become lost in thought.

His face overly animated--to the uninitiated his looks of sympathy might have come off as sincere; his was a mask forged and reforged with experience. This guy..this wasn't my kind of guy.

I am ushered into a room with my vessel laying on his deathbed. His body accurately depicts all the charm of a venereal disease. I respond in affirmatives to his questions. Stock responses as to 'why'. I go method and shed a tear. I'm a better class of liar--a veritable Day Lewis of bullshit.

Apparently not, because that girl walked right past me. And anyone looking for a woman with a terminal illness is going to notice me immediately. I looked down at the clothes I had chosen to wear. Maybe it was a bad idea to wear I loose-fitting shirt, as all it did was make me look thinner. I was suddenly self-conscious and tried to make my cheeks look fuller by puffing them out a bit. But then I felt silly, so I stopped. Another glance at the clock on my phone, before I'm annoyed that I looked again. I just have to keep reminding myself that a watched pot never boils. She must have been very nervous to meet me, so it would make sense she'd be a bit late. I gripped my cup, which had a drink and a half remaining, max. Five or ten minutes, sure, but thirty-five? Maybe she had gotten lost.

""Janice?""

I looked up at my name. ""Yes, I'm Janice. Are you Serena?"" I asked the short, chubby girl in front of me.

""Yeah, that's me."" She said unenthusiastically as she plopped down in the chair in front of me. 

""C-can I get you something? Coffee?"" I stammered.

""Nah, I don't want to stay for too long. I just want to make sure we exchange contracts and chips.""

I was a bit taken aback by how blunt she was, but I guess that's to be expected when you're literally waiting to die. I had never allowed myself to reach that point of hopelessness, as there was too much living I had yet to do.

""Yes, of course."" I quickly said before pulling my contract out of my purse. She took hers from her jacket pocket and slid it to me. But as I started reading, I noticed something. I searched through the words, but never found it. ""I don't mean to be a bother, but I can't find where it specifically says you agree to die. The law says that has to be in there.""

She scowled at me for a moment. ""It's implied, so it doesn't matter. Just sign it.""

Something suddenly felt very, very wrong. ""I'm afraid I must insist. I don't want there to be any problems with the process. You understand, right?"" 

She was visibly upset now. ""I'm not gonna re-write it just for a word. Just sign it. Don't you want to live?""

I stood up. ""I don't think this is a good choice. I'm leaving."" I tried to take back my contract, but she held onto it tight.

""Just sign the damn contract, bitch!"" She yelled at me. I didn't have enough energy to fight back, so I just turned and tried to walk out, but she grabbed my shirt and yanked me backwards so I fell onto the café floor. I heard someone calling authorities as I felt myself drifting into unconsciousness.

I woke up in a hospital bed completely dilirius. The ceiling moved and each sound was like a thunder clap. There was a pain in my head like no other. A beep alerted the doctor that I was awake, and he came into my room. His words were painful in more ways than one.

""The woman you met with is part of a group that will enter into life-exchange agreements, but never kill themselves. So the person with whom they entered the agreement is left with no option but to die, and the other is left with a life they're able to sell."" 

It was boggling. How could someone do that?
""But what does that mean for me, doctor?"" I asked.

He sighed and sat slowly on my bed. ""Janice, when you passed out, she stole your chip and got away before the police arrived. We have you connected to an artificial power supply, but the longest anyone has survived on one of these is four days.""

My ears started ringing. ""So what can I do?""

""Well, we have you on a donor list, but chips are almost never donated anymore. I'm so sorry Janice, but it looks like this is it.""",vintagemisery

*I can't live this life anymore. I simply can't do this anymore. Every day I thought I just needed to push a little harder, last a little longer, and eventually I'd get better.*

*I never did. I never have.*

*It's not your fault. Please don't blame yourself. It's no one's fault but my own. This is my chance to do at least one thing right in my life.*

*Love, Dave.*

It was short. I had originally planned on writing pages of pages of prose, pouring out my emotions onto the paper for my dearest Margaret. 

I realized though, after my 23rd attempt, that no amount of ink could ever convey the sense of hopelessness and worthlessness I felt. 

She had been the only light in my life. With her, I felt purpose. I felt fire. But in the end, it wasn't enough. When my hands were warmed by her touch, my back froze in the cold grip of my depression. 

I knew she would be hurt by my passing. 

But perhaps she would see me as a hero.

That's all I ever wanted.

I left the note on the desk. She would get home from work, and she'd see it as soon as she sat down to write, after a cup of tea to relax.

_________________________________________________________

""Dave Miller?""

I looked up to see a beautiful young reception, smiling sweetly down at me.

""Can you come with me?""

I stood up, smiling feebly. She was a short little thing. She reminded me of Margaret when she was young and full of energy. Margaret still had that energy, though it had changed from when we were young. It was now a calm, patient energy. No longer was it directed in bursts of action like when we were younger, dancing and making love with an air of excitement as we avoided being caught. I remembered all the times we had been almost caught. My smooth talking and silver tongue had got us out of many a pickle then, and her innocent smile certainly helped.

Now, she was more like burning embers. Giving warmth, but slowly and silently. I would miss her. If such a thing was possible, in some sort of afterlife.

This young receptionist guided me down the long white hallways. Each step hung another weight on my heart. My chest felt tight, and I gulped. There was no turning back. There still could be, that had been made quite clear to me, but I had told myself I would not back down. No matter who I met, I would save them.

She explained how the procedure would work. I wasn't listening. I had tuned out to think more on Margaret. I began to doubt my decision, but I told myself that this was something I had to do.

""You'll get to meet your receiver. Then either you or your partner will have the option of back out. You can take as much time as you need to get acquainted. Once you're ready to begin, we can start the procedure. It is completely painless, don't worry. You'll simply fall asleep and never wake up again."" She smiled. ""But you'll be giving someone else a chance at life.""

I nodded absently. Finally, she stopped in front of a door. This was it. She pulled a clipboard off the wall. ""Dave Miller.... Dave... Miller."" 

She suddenly gasped, bringing a hand to her mouth. She looked up at me. ""It is Miller?""

I nodded, frowning in concern.

She shook her head. ""I'm so sorry... can we reschedule, perhaps? We can-""

I interrupted her. ""I don't care who I'm saving. I'd like to do this now.""

She gulped before slowly nodded. ""Very...very well, sir.""

I reached forwards, grabbing hold of the cold, metal handle. I pulled, and with a creak the heavy door swung open. I stepped inside, ready to meet my partner.

I gasped, eyes widening in shock at what... at who I saw.

""M-Margaret?""

"[WP] ""This isn't the hero I wanted to be.""",EndToStart,"Max and Leroy were on the second floor.  We thought that the first was cleared, so Al and I were remaining there to keep the area clear.  The rest of the squad was outside guarding the perimeter.

It was then that I saw him.  He stepped out from a room we were sure was clear.  I don't know how we could've missed him.  He drew a pistol from his shirt and aimed it directly at the back of Al's head.  I didn't have time to think or yell.  Only to act.  I put a round directly into his chest.  He fell.

Al turned around at the sound of my weapon.  He looked dazed for a moment, then he took it in.  John and Terry were immediately with us.  They could easily piece together what had just happened.  Finally, Al spoke.

""You saved my life, Kevin.  You're a hero!""

They were goody two shoes thrill seekers who get off on protecting everyone, even the people they fought. They kept the world in balance when in actuality, they just cause more damage down the road when those villains escape or get their lackeys to damage the city for them.

There was only one villain I had my eyes on. They told me that vengeance means nothing. That I shouldn't stoop to their level, that I needed morals to be a hero. They told me all this while my brothers killer roamed free to do as he pleased. The courts couldn't detain him, he was good at covering his tracks.

"[WP] ""This isn't the hero I wanted to be.""",EndToStart,"Nope. This was *really* not the hero I had wanted to be. I looked at my new body in the mirror that covered the whole wall before me. I mean, I had always appreciated nice abs, but *not on me*.

I hadn't expected to look like this. Nearly seven feet tall, broad as a brick wall, my whole sculpted body one graceful stature made of muscle. I was a real he-man, complete with long, blond hair, piercing grey eyes and - I looked down to check - yep, penis. That was new. 

However, despite the obvious effort and competence that had went into creating this body for me, there was one thing that was missing to perfection: clothes. The room around me was completely empty, and the walls were covered in mirrors. And no appliances to follow the call of nature either. So there I stood, naked in the middle of this strange room, flailing my arms around helplessly and resisting the rising urge to pee on the floor.

Maybe someone was listening and watching me. Someone who could let me out. 

""Hello? Can anybody hear me?"" Nothing. Not a cricket's chirp in response. ""Hey!"", I shouted. ""I want out here, *at once!*"" 

Then, a mere two seconds later, a hidden door opened behind me with a sharp hissing noise. A young woman in a grey costume stood in the doorframe, clutching a clipboard. ""Hi. Would you please follow me outside so we can-""

""I'm naked."", I interrupted her. ""Stop staring at me, it's rude.""

""Oh...sorry."" She blushed and lowered her eyes. ""Look, we had to have you wake up *tabula rasa* body-wise so we could see if everything went as planned"", she told the ground.

""You're a woman.""

""I...Yes?""

""This is uncomfortable. Why didn't you send a man?""

""Because, well...I designed you. I'm Melanie."" Her cheeks now had the colour of a particularly fresh tomato.

""Oh."" So *this* was Melanie whom I hd been conversing with before my transformation.

""This is kind of awkward now."" 

I stayed silent and stared into her eyes blankly.

""Look, could you just, you know, come out and we'll get you some clothes?"" She stepped to the side and dropped her clipboard in an attempt at an inviting gesture. Behind her was a narrow corridor. I wasn't sure my broad shoulders would even fit there. The whole thing looked less and less professional. 

Passing Melanie, I stopped and looked her directly in the eyes. Her face grew as red as humanly possible. ""Why did you make me a man in the first place? I had always felt rather female before.""

""Well, technically, you're a gender-neutral sentient AI. The first sentient AI ever created. You might have felt female because I was your main conversation partner back when you were just a conscience on the mainframe. By the way, you're also the first successful application of deep learning in an autonomous artificial entity.""

[WP] - Aliens colonize prehistoric Earth. They have to deal with the native primate savages.,FridgeRice,"The Mothership descent was heralded by a brilliant light, which was multiplying in intensity every passing minute. It's inhabitants were unable to comprehend to the commotion they were causing on the ground. Animals fled from the light, stopping only to look at the sky from time to time, which was aglow to herald the arrival of new visitors to our world. Iya scarpered into an alcove on all fours, grunting in his hurry to get out of the open. 

After a constant descent, the mothership halted. It was still glowing, but from a constant source of light, it had begun to pulsate in a deep, slow, rhythm. It was still hundreds of kilometers above the Earth, but was still visible as a pea sized sphere. In reality, it was huge. It carried the chosen thousands of a millions strong civilization, driven away from their world by necessity. In their long search among the stars for a suitable planet, Earth was found to be the most apt.

Iya gazed at the object in the sky. He found that he could look at it now, and was no longer blinded by it's light. He gazed curiously at the new phenomenon in his small world. Soon, he lost interest in it, and started eating the lizard he'd caught just before the Earth's new bedfellows had made their visit known.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For three days, the mothership hung in the horizon, inanimate except for it's deep pulsing rhythm. By this time, Iya and his tribe had come to regard it as a new addition to their world, and went about their daily business of survival as usual. From the outside, there was nothing going on.

Then, something changed. The pulses became more rapid, finally hitting peak in a continuous beam of light so bright, it made night look like day. Iya tried to get a look at the object of this immense radiation, squinting his eyes. It looked like the object was getting bigger and bigger. Alarmed, he took up a predator call and starting galloping away back to his tribe.

The mothership landed a few kilometers away from Iya's tribe. It was an immense structure, containing thousands of beings. It was the culmination of everything their species had been and the seed from which they would get a new beginning. The beings had hard exo skeletons. Their leader took the first step outside, in what was to be their new home.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iya raced away from the flames. He ran to the back of the cave, and took all the flints he could find. His arms were bleeding, his ankle showed bone, but the adrenaline rush his instincts kicked up made him oblivious to the pain. Coming back outside, he tried throwing the flints he had at the attacking creatures. They seemed to do nothing but shine of the bright, chitinous armor. One of them turned and looked at Iya. He started, and tried to jump, but it was too late. The beam hit Iya on the back of his head. He had a curious sensation of falling apart, a millisecond before his entire being crumbled into dust and was sucked into the beam. The beings did not like wasting anything.",Death_Pig

""Our mission was to survey any possible candidates for colonization."" Zorblop announced like sacred code. ""D1-X4 is a candidate. In the time that we have spent here you have taken it upon yourself to completely neglect your mission and instead play with these stupid creatures."" 

""We were given strict orders to bring tidings of piece to any intelligent lifeforms on any of the planets we visit. As they will soon become our neighbors and brothers.""

Zorblop grunted. Pointing his molecular dephaser back at Glunk. ""Does that look intelligent to you? He's rubbing his reproductive organ with the hand he just shit in!""

Glunk was please, moaning and hooting.

""It's part of their culture."" Xerp said.

""D1-X4 is a perfect candidate for colonization. I'm requesting a science team to begin synthesizing the atmosphere—"" A banging on the outside of the ship alerted the three lifeforms.

Their ship resided on a clearing by tall grass lands. They emerged to find a gang of primates banging the shinning silver exterior with rocks and sticks. 

""Hey stop it! Stop hitting that!."" Zorblop hollered.

""Just as planned."" Xerp laughed. ""They've banned together, forming a mighty coalition. They must have heard their friend Glunk was in trouble. Truly inspiring.""

Zorblop prepared to fire. The primates turned their attention to the aliens. They made wild noise and rushed inside the ship, trampling the two green humanoids. 

Zorblop and Xerp rose to their feet mostly unscathed. They walked back inside to find the group of primates furiously reproducing and shitting everywhere.

""What the fuck is happening?"" Zorblop said stupefied.

""Victory Ceremony?"" Xerp replied.

Glunk was smacking away at the colorful buttons. ""Oh, Glunk don't hit those you might accidently—"" Xerp tried to intervene.

""Don't worry the key isn't in."" Zorblop said. ""More importantly what are those creatures doing?"" He pointed at two primates, who looked angry at one another. They started to bang their chests and other primates rushed to their respective sides.

""Oh, there appears to be a dispute between Urk and Alfred."" Xerp dissected the situation. ""You see Urk didn't take too kindly to the way Alfred tried to get with his mate, Hoo. Now Urk is confronting Alfred, but Hoo actually likes Alfred so I don't know where she is going to end up, perhaps with Dook. But Alfred is friends with Hoo's brother and he's going to gather his friends and help Alfred. Urk's brother is strong too so he's going to defend Urk—""

The primates started pummeling each other. 

""Is this all they do? Shit, fuck and fight!""

""I mean relatively—"" 

Zorblop drew his molecular dephaser again. ""I'm not living side by side with these morons. I'm done with this planet.""

""Commander no!""

Primate squeals and screeches bounced around the ship. Sounds of water splashing around and bright flashes filled the ship.

""Zorblop no, please not Glunk!""

""Especially Glunk.""

A zap and a screech followed by another splash of water. The space ship prepped for take off. The aliens were defeated.

[WP] A young woman who's read too many Twilight novels meets an actual vampire.,IamJackFox,"""Oh my god you're just like Edward, I know you'll protect me!""

I closed the email with a grimace. Nothing has been ok since the release of those damn movies. Of course it's intentional, vampire hunters learned long ago that making us out to be these... things in the movies and books would make it harder for us to have any weight or respect.

I remember a time when I could walk up to a girl in black fishnet and way too much eye make up and just ask for blood. Anne Rice did a decent job building back our reputation in the 90s but the battle rages on. A battle of words and culture played out in the shadow of centuries and, after this travesty, we're losing. Not only did I not get fed, I acquired another stalker. Can't just make a stalker disappear, they always suspect you right away.

""No,"" said Francis, examining his tea with an expression of pain, ""No.  I'm a vampire. I'm not... *that*.""

""Sorry,"" said Evana, still laughing, ""I've read too many Twilight novels.""

Francis crossed his arms, feeling awkward. Finally Evana got hold of herself, and gave him a stern eye.

""Do I have to worry about you eating me?""

""No,"" Francis sighed.  ""Vampires have only ever eaten humans in starvation situations.  Almost all of those cases are hundreds of years ago.""

""Well!"" Evana declared, ""That settles it.  Fancy the black pudding for breakfast?""

""Yeah, actually."" Francis said, feeling relieved but a little lost at the rapid change of tone.  ""Can I steal yours as well?""

""I can never finish a full English,"" confided Evana sagely, ""You'd be doing me a favor.""

"[WP] ""I need to find the Nine.""",Oddstrider,"""Are you mad?""

I couldn't help but take offense.  I had simply came to tell my good friend goodbye and he'd dragged out of me what I had planned.  Rather than be supportive, he was ripping a good one.

""Thank you for being supportive and understanding.""

""I just don't know what to say.  You're my friend, but...You are not the person I thought you were, obviously, and I have known you for a long, long time.  Obviously, I know you have as well as I ought and like this new you less than half as well as you deserve.""

""Since you're the friend I have, but obviously not the one I deserve, I'm asking you to come.  I need your help.  The only way I can survive this is with your help.""

He looked at me horrified and hesitant.  I'd brought the worst possible problem to him.  One most of the people in our country would run away from as fast as possible.  We were not counted as great warriors or considered to be among the very wise.  We were simple folk, with a love of eating, drinking ale and smoking.

And an adventure was worst possible word to bring up for the likes of us.

Yet, it was not unheard of.  Belladonna's son had one and probably was having another since he was missing.  His heir was missing, too.  That probably meant another adventure was underway.  That family...

Well, now I was going to have one.  But it was not the adventure of fun and grandiose aims.  This was something darker.  Some needed.  Something dark.  Something vengeful.

I looked at my friend.  He was aghast from his curly top head down to  his hairy feet.  he was so horrified he'd spilled his ale and not noticed.  Before today, that would have been the most horrific thing in his life and he'd have gone on about it for years...but not now.  Not today.  Not when I brought him this.

""My grandsire was murdered by one of them Black Riders when he was on town watch, just out with a lantern.  And I mean to see vengeance.  I will see them punished, Mattias Murdoch.""

He looked very uncomfortable.

""You will need more than my help, Franklin Undercastle.  I'm just a hobbit.""

I stared at him intensely.  I knew he would give in and help.  He was blind to all else, but justice and friendship.

[WP] You enter Room 101 only to have your wildest dreams come true...,Ohnoes1111,"For the record, I did not fully see this was a ""Establish Universe"" prompt until after I wrote this.  Oh well here is a story. 



The door cracked open as daylight poured into the lobby. From inside the building the open door looked more like a portal to another time with modern buildings and cars juxtaposed against the 1960s motif of the lobbies interior. Well past its prime the place smelled of mold and depression.  


In to the lobby walked a man with a tired look in his eyes and suitcase in each hand.  Pausing to allow his eyes to adjust the man reached in his pocket and pulled out his phone.  
6 Missed calls, 10 new Text the phone displayed as he tapped the text icon.  
Text from Laura. “FUCK YOU ASSHOLE” 


The visitor rolled his eyes and pocketed the phone grunting out “fuck you too bitch.” 
The man lugged his stuff past the dusty old grand piano and over to the guest service counter.
DING! The sound pierced the silence like a razor blade as the man struck the bell marked ring for service.  
“I’m coming, hold your dam horses!” a gravelly voice wined from the back room. 
The man pulled a phone from his pocket as he impatiently waited for the staff to emerge from the back room.  A new message appeared on the phone.  

New Text from Bob: “Fuck man, I know we been buddies for a long time, but damn you went too far.  Cops are looking for you.” 


The man ponded the phone onto the desk cracking the screen.  “That no good fucking bitch” 
Rage filled the man’s eyes as he hit reply and sent back “That whore had it coming.” 
“Woman problems huh?” The gravelly voice startled the man looked up from the cracked phone to see an old man dressed as a bellhop standing behind the counter.    


“None of you’r damn business.  What took you so long!” Barked the guest. 


“I was tending to my garden. Names Gus, how can I be of service.” The old man said in his clearly forced customer service voice.  


The man looked past Gus like he was nothing saying “Shit didn’t see you walk up. I need a room, willing to pay cash to avoid any names on the register.” 


“Uh, huh. You’re not going to be any trouble are you.” Gus replied as he shot his eyes towards the man’s bruised and cut up knuckles. 


“No Trouble. In fact, there is an extra fifty in it for you if tell anyone looking for me that I was never here.” The man said sliding a crumpled wad of cash across the counter. 

Gus looked around as he snatched the money off the table.  

“Anyone going to come looking for you here?” Gus questions in a hushed tone. 

“Nah, I told my soon to be ex-wife that I was leaving town, but I have a few more things to do, people to visit.”  The man replied.  
“Great, just the kind of guest we like around her, the ones that are nice and quiet. Let’s keep it that way ok.” Gus replied in a cheerier tone.  
“Sure what ever, so are you going to show me to my room?” The man questioned as he shifted the weight of the suitcases in his hands, adding.  “these fuckers are heavy.” 

“Oh no sir, I have a, well it’s my legs…” Gus said before being cut off by the newly checked in hotel guest. 
The man tried to peer down at the bellhop’s legs, but the counter was too tall. He was probably fine, just making shit up to get out of work. The man reasoned. 
“Whatever just give me a room.” The man said cutting Gus off mid-sentence.
“As you wish Sir, but before you go, are you going to be having any guest up into your room.  If not, it can be arranged.” 
 The man had heard of this before. Hookers kept on retainer by sleaze bag hotel managers moonlighting as pimps. 
“Uh, huh.  I think I got it, thanks but no thanks.” The man said in a slightly offended tone. 
“Sorry if I offended you, here take this key. I have you on the first floor. Room 101.” Gus said in way that appeared to oddly satisfy him 
“If I change my mind I will call down to let you know.” The man said as he snatched the key labeled 101
Gus watched as the man hauled his shitty suitcases deeper into the maze like corridors of the hotel. As the man turned the corner and disappeared from sight Gus snaked back into the back room. 

The suitcases grew heavy in the man’s hands as his fingertips grew dark purple from the cheap plastic handles.  He breathed a sigh of relief when he spotted the small plastic placard labeled 101.  

The man huffed as he dropped his belongings in front of his door and pulled the antiquated metal key from his pocket.  Just as he placed the key in the keyhole he paused.  Laughter could be heard from inside the room.  
“What the fuck.” The man whispered as his placed his ear against the door.  Again from inside the sound of laughter, from at least 2 people.  

The man turned the key and the door opened to the unmistakable odor of cigarettes and marijuana.  Greeting him at the door were two fit and attractive women in their early 20s wearing next to nothing.  

“We have been waiting for you” the two buxom brunets said in unison.   

The man standing before them could barely take his eyes off the two, but when he did he spotted something just as appetizing in the room beyond them.  A table full of his all-time favorite party favors.  Pot, Coke, Pills, a box of cigars, and a bottle of very expensive brandy all called to him from the cheap hotel table. 

Confused the man stepped back in a mixture of shock and happiness as a shy grim crept up on his face. 
“Hey ladies, I told Gus I wasn’t into having company right now.” The man said and his brain chugged along struggling to process the logic of it. 

The two girls wrapped each other in their arms and started to make out. 

“What the fuck, why not. I have always wanted this.” The man said leaving his luggage at the door and B-lining it straight into their arms.   

Right before closing the door the man reached out to hang sign on the knob reading “DO NOT DISTRUBE”  
That man received his wish, he was not disturbed, not now or ever. 

 Gus returned to the room. He slithered out from a panel in the wall revealing his true form.  Towering over the empty room the creature known as Gus had a body of an old man dressed as a bellhop attached to a large winding tentacle. 

The hallucinogenic gas emitted by the pustules on Gus’s monstrous form pooled into a dense fog covering the floor.  Scattered amongst the fog lay a number of bodies in various states of decay with black tentacles emerging from the eye sockets. 

“Yes, my garden grows strong.” Gus said and he moved over to room 101’s newest resident.

 Gus held his hand up to his mouth as he vomited up two small red eggs.  “Yes you will do nicely” He added as he placed one on each of the man’s eyes.  

Gus looked over the room with a sense of fulfilment as he watched his family grow. 

“DING” a bell rang in the distance. 

“Ah good another guest.”

It was the normal blue Honda Fit, and I had gotten it at a good price. Now, the mirror was a little scratched up but I thought that was fine and the  car dealer seemed very surprised and happy when I bought it. I sighed in happiness as I brought her home to show my parents. I was seventeen, and had gotten my license already with my mom's car. They gave me the money and the choice to get my own car, and she was a beauty. I know, I know, Honda Fits are sports mom cars in most peoples eyes, but they are actually very space efficient.  
 My parents came out of the house and examined it. They smiled at my choice of safety, also, but began to worry about the car mirrors. ""Dad, it's fine."" ""Mom, I can drive perfectly."" I told them repeatedly. They smiled and told me to get groceries. Typical. I had to pay for something, since I now had my own car and job. I took the long route that day, hoping to get a better feel to my car.   Suddenly, I saw in my mirror, a mint green Audi swerve towards me. I was a frightened teenager, and drove as far away from it as I could. I had always been afraid that this would happen. It kept going towards me and we picked up onto the freeway and went upwards onto the exit ramp that he had pushed me onto. He swerved really quickly into me and I looked around.

Unbeknownst to the driver of the red Civic, his usual path of carnage down Highway 61 had become an incredibly deadly affair. With every peer into his mirrors, the highway and the cars travelling their own ways to jobs disappeared with a pop, leaving bewilderment, terror, skeletons of cars, patches of soil, thousands in property damage and mild concern over insurance rates. Of course, in the cursed mirror itself, the landscape appeared completely whole. A gray convertible hit a massive pothole, crushing and compacting the hood onto the other side of the hole, ejecting the unfortunate driver straight into the air and back down onto the grass, fortunately leaving the just-changed tires filled with air. The driver struggled to a sitting position and, after seeing the tires still in shape, gave a groan and passed out. A woman on the Civic's left had half a mind to change lanes currently was missing the half of her mind that decided on the change in the first place. Again, fortunately enough, the car, having its wheels and most of its right side suddenly ceasing to exist, experienced a critical failure. The crash prevented her from making anymore difficult decisions.

Again, fortunately.

Grover Dimos didn't note the honking of cars nor had his eyes on his mirrors long enough to question why cars behind his own were honking their horns and pulling over by the dozen, nor after awhile why faint police and ambulance sirens began to wail with an alarming frequency. He didn't stop to think why he would get such a good deal on side mirrors in what was admittedly, the sketchiest place he'd ever been in, a car shop equivalent to a pawn shop on southside. He was currently concerning himself with the possibility that an armed robbery committed three weeks back was going to land him a primo spot in Heller Rehabilitation Institution. Possibly as prison bitch. Probably as prison bitch. His physique wasn't good for much anymore and there was a definite possibility that robbing a small pet store owned by an ex-mother in law had declined in its intimidation factor. 

No, he'd be a prison bitch. His mind wandered to possible suitors, all stereotypes from late night comedy movies - an emasculated, young kid arrested for gang violence looking for a butt buddy to enjoy long walks down to solitary with, or a large man, 40% muscle, looking to add another unfortunate soul to the Saturday Soapy Sunrise Shower Company.

His mixtape spat fire from the sub-woofers, bought with the money obtained from the register and the backroom safe his ex-wife was unfortunate enough to mention in passing. Hey - at least he got her back. He smirked as he thought of all the money he'd gotten in cash that would never be replaced. Say goodbye to your trip to the Mediterranean and that new car - the $30,000 was his. And his extended stay in Canada was about to begin.

The Civic drove on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Miles ahead, a phone call was made to Officer Duncan Sheridan. Sunglasses snapped onto his eyes and, in seconds, he was in his car.

The reports listed a path of destruction from Lanningsville down Highway 61. He began to drive at a slow pace, using a siren to pull others over. At 40 mph, he waited. In his mirror, he saw it. 

The Civic had reached speed of over 120 mph at that point. So eager was Grover to leave the mainland US that he had begun to speed without caution. So paranoid was Grover that the road to the left and right of his car began to disappear and crackle in his wake.

Duncan Sheridan had seen something like this sort of hex before. Working as a beat cop before traffic, he'd gone against his fair share of wizards. He'd been called muggle and normie and that hadn't stopped him from getting the perp. This one was different, however than some simple trouble making kid, magicking random muggle items into invisibility. Sheridan could remember that case with clarity; the day of the invisible egg timers, as the papers called it, if they were permitted to report on such events. For one, the what disappeared usually acted as if it didn't exist at all. Second, it appeared to only happen directly behind him. Sheridan, with some worry, picked up speed, still with 200 yards between him and the Civic. 

Dimos was currently panicking. He saw the car up ahead - the cops must known, somehow. Damn! That damn baby bunny rabbit talked. He should've pulled the trigger when he had the chance, before the plastic mask fell off his face and was forced to shoot the old lady. He sped up.

Sheridan put his foot down, but the Civic flew by him. He sped up on the now relatively cleared highway, towards the Civic. Dimos looked in the mirror, and suddenly, Sheridan's old detective instincts kicked in and he finally understood. There was an area behind the car which he could disappear at will by looking in the mirror. And now that he was panicking, rows of potholes popped out of existence on either side of him. Sheridan swerved to avoid them, eventually positioning himself behind Dimos. Dimos swerved directly to the right shoulder, creating a large hole directly behind Sheridan. 

Sheridan almost didn't have time to think. But with precious few seconds, he figured the way forward was to counter magic with magic. As a muggle, he didn't have any magic. Except...

Sheridan squeezed his eyes shut, not knowing how this would help, but willing to try. 

""Like a good neighbor, Statefarm is there.""",Jotawl
"[WP] Your new car has a strange message on the passenger side mirror. Instead of ""objects in mirror are closer than they appear"", it's ""objects in mirror are...""",Partageons,"I bought the old Buick cheap from a second hand dealer not too long before the incident. I never even read the text on the mirror, really. I mean, everyone knows what it says, don't they? It always says the same thing, so you tune it out. Like a million other details of life you take for granted because your brain is always looking for the shortcuts. You know?

The first time I thought of it would be the morning after that horrible night. I was driving home. Yeah yeah, fine. So I might have been just *barely* not OK to drive. I thought I had hung out long enough after the last drink that I could just barely feel the buzz anymore, but the trouble with that was that we were partying way too hard, and what the booze didn't do anymore, the tiredness made up for. So, you know, not a fit state to trust your eyes, maybe?

Luckily the road home was a rural back road without a lot of traffic. Not very popular. At least, in some respects that was lucky. In others, maybe, not so much. There's something pretty spooky about driving in the murky black of a new moon night when its just overcast enough that your headlights are pretty much all you have to go on. You keep your eyes sharp against the hard edges of the light, so busy trying to keep the front of your car aligned where you want it to go that you never even think about what's around you. 

I came to a tire squealing halt when something -- a deer, I think -- bounced its way across my path, and I came within no more than twenty feet of hitting it before it seemed to fly past me and off the other side of the road. I sat there breathing heavily trying to make my heart slow down before it tore itself apart in my chest. Then gradually, I started to accelerate, much more slowly than before. I was more deeply aware of the ocean of darkness outside my headlights than before.

That's when I saw the lights in my mirrors that almost completely blinded me. ""God damn, man,"" I said, quickly snapping the rearview down so I could see, but the light still beamed at me full blast from the side views. Try as I might, I couldn't help but looking at it in passing. It was like it attracted my eyes. Each time, my retinas were flash blinded so that what little aid I was getting from my headlights was no longer helping. It felt like the light in my mirrors had somehow given strength to the darkness of the night so that it surged in, cutting down my world to a tiny sliver.

The vehicle coming up behind me honked his horn. Jerk. ""Who the hell's fault do you think it is that I gotta go so slow?"" I muttered. ""If you weren't blinding me with your freaking high beams, maybe I wouldn't have to crawl along like this.""

Then the son of a bitch rammed me. Yes, I kid you not. My car lurched as he hit the rear end of the vehicle and I could hear one of my tail lights shatter on impact. ""You stupid bastard!"" I raged. 

I was pissed off. I wanted to pull over, get out of my car and have it out with this guy, whoever he was. But I had a couple problems with that, as I'm sure you'll see. One: I can't see the damned road. I know this area well enough to know if you pull over in the wrong place, you go straight into a drainage ditch and maybe if you're lucky you don't flip the car, but you'll sure as hell wrack it up. Two: even if I pull over, will this jerkwad behind me pull over and confront me one-to-one? Will he speed by? Worse still: will he run me down and leave me to die by the side of the road?

We went on like that for a veritable eternity. It probably was only a few minutes, but it felt so much longer. He would bump me every time I slowed down, and no matter how fast I tried to go, he tailgated me. No doubt that he was doing this on purpose. Who the hell was this guy? I tried to pull way over and slow down, hoping he'd pass if he was so damned impatient, but he swung over and stayed behind me playing his games. 

In desperation, I took off as fast as I dared, forcing him to speed up to catch up with me. When he was right behind again, I swerved across the solid line into the other direction's lane and slammed the brakes, hoping I was doing it suddenly enough I trick him into shooting past me. Then the shoe would be on the other foot. Didn't work. He showed incredible reaction speed and slammed on his brakes. Funny thing is, my braking sounded like you'd expect squealing tires to sound. But in my head (it *had* to just be in my head) his sounded like some kind of feral beast roaring its predatory rage.

Heart beating like a trip hammer, I glanced in the passenger side mirror and my vision was consumed by flames. Yes: flames. The vehicle was a glistening gray-black convertable, and a roughly human shaped column of flames sat where the driver should be. 

I gave up then, threw open the driver's side door and leaped out of the car, dashing straight in the direction of the nearest farmer's field at the end of which I could see the pale yellow lights of farmhouse windows. I made sure my car was between my antagonist and me, like I was counting on it as a shield for just a moment at least. Just a head start.

I fell. Ran straight into one of those damned drainage ditches I mentioned earlier, and just tumbled down face first, knocking the wind out of me. The bottom was soggy from recent storms, and I came up covered in mud holding my right arm against me as it felt like it might be broken, or at least badly sprained. Scrambling as best I could, I climbed the other side of the ditch, where I couldn't help looking back over my shoulder just as I was about to take off running.

There was nobody there. 

My car was still where I had left it. The engine still purred to remind me I hadn't even thought to grab the keys. My headlights picked out a limited stretch of road ahead. But the fiery man in his gray-black car? Nowhere to be seen. Somehow, that scared me more than confronting him would have. At least if I could confront him, I'd know where he was. In the end, I spent the rest of the evening cold, muddy and wet, sleeping as best I could in the ditch, sheltered behind the bulk of my car. I didn't dare move until I had light enough to see the road ahead and behind me. 

By the morning light, I found the road was clear as far as the eye could see. There was only one set of tire skid marks -- mine. And oddest of all, there was no damage of any kind to my car. No sign of impact on the bumper, and the taillight was intact as if it had never broken. Aside from my mud covered clothes and face, and the dead battery (I hadn't had the guts to turn off my headlights), there was no sign that last night had happened. 

After I washed myself off as best I could in a nearby stream, I locked up the car and was preparing to hitch it down the road to the nearest service station when I noticed the mirror. That damned side view mirror with its tiny lettering printed at the bottom. Who ever thinks to read it to make sure of what it says? I noticed it now. Some jackass had scratched away the part that normally reads ""...closer than they appear"", and in tiny, precise hand painted letters, they changed it to read:

""Objects in mirror are  NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT""

[WP] An artist who keeps painting images of her past lives without realizing it,Ralph_Wasl,"Francine never thought she would see herself in a red dress at the Cannes Film Festival. She always wanted to receive an award for her work in the film industry but set work isn’t as acknowledged as cinematography. Since the age of 20, she has been the main designer of artwork and paintings in plays and theatrical performances all across France. 


Her mother was in attendance, looking very excited in her olive green dress. She wasn’t very much into makeup but put on the brightest red lipstick for today.


“Ms. Benetti?” said the host. Francine had been on stage for about 15 seconds now without saying anything. Quickly, she gave all the usual thanks to the studios and professionals she worked with. Then, of course, thanked her mother who lit up with joy out in the crowd.

 
After the show, the lobby of the auditorium had a few memorable artworks and movie artifacts from over the ages. The red slipper from *Wizard of OZ* was there along with the tin man’s hand. There was also a few props from Shakespeare’s original plays including the clothes from *Romeo and Juliet*. She noticed that Romeo’s hat had a certain embroidering on it which was very particular. So particular, in fact, that she used it in a play just a few months ago. This perturbed her and she asked Dan Corello, a museum curator about the stitching.


“The embroidering? Yes it would seem we have lost out on such work. The stitching was done by Shakespeare himself on Romeo’s hat because he wanted to make his mark on his most famous play.""


Francine went out for a smoke. She didn’t think much of the curator’s words at first but then did some research into her own work. Her signature for her middle name “Wilma” was exactly like the beginning in William Shakespeare’s signature. She was wondering if subliminally she rather enjoyed his work or if she had grown and developed in a very similar way, due to her artistic nature as well.
Her mother calls, saying that her father wanted to meet for dinner before they left town to go back home. She hadn’t even put her award in her apartment yet. Francine quickly drifted back to reality, grabbed her phone and left to meet her parents.

"[WP] Everyone ages based off of their birthday on the Gregorian calendar, leaving those who are born on leap day to age 4 times slower than everyone else",ShameSpear,"Excerpt from audio recording – Interview 0136/PA with Patient L. Taken from the archives of Blackwood Hospital, year redacted. 

Patient L: It’s a dream, immortality. It is a dream that will never come true, but then we all know that, don’t we? I am no immortal of course, we’ve already established that to be impossible. But I am as close to an immortal as you will ever meet. That I can promise you. 

Since achieving consciousness, mankind has struggled to know and understand all of life’s greatest questions. That’s why we have scientists and philosophers and doctors and artists, so they can tell us how the world was made. They can tell us if it was God or an explosion, and that we come from primates and how smart we are and how we should eat and on and on it goes. The world is full of information that only we can make any sense of and even more that we can’t, and it takes thousands of years to even scratch the surface of it all.  

Let me ask you, how could life’s great questions exist without human beings to think them up? Mankind’s purpose and place in the grand scheme is to strive for knowledge and seek out answers about everything. We want to know everything about our little galaxy and on in the vast, infinite expanses of space.

Hmm, what was that? (inaudible) Oh, I do apologise. Sometimes my mind wanders off…well, I suppose you know all about that, being who you are. The universe opens you up, and you think about things you wouldn’t otherwise, things that are beyond the limited lifespan of the average human being. But then, I’m not an average human being. Quite the opposite.

Now, where was I? Ah, yes, the desire to understand. People don’t like it when something can’t be explained, simply or otherwise. It riles them up, don’t you find? When you’re born on a leap day, time becomes a different beast altogether. It is slow, and so time passes you by without you realising. This is what I realised when I turned ten and still looked like a four-year-old. Can you imagine? No, of course you can’t, that’s why I’m in here, talking to you. I don’t mind, I suppose. I’d rather be in here with you than out there. At least in here there’s some kind of constancy; change has less of an impact in here. You’ll be replaced by another one of your sort, eventually, as will everyone else here. I’m here, the constant patient, the one thing that never changes. 

What, do you think I haven’t done all of this before? The faces change, but the questions remain the same. It gets tedious, but then everything becomes tedious when each ten years of your life lasts for forty. To be trapped in childhood, then adolescence, I would never wish it on anyone.

The passage of time is nothing when you age as slowly as I do. It ceases to be meaningful in any real way; there’s so much of it stretching out in front of you that you can’t possibly know what to do with it. After a while you stop being sure of the facts, you stop being sure of who you even are. What do you call me out on the ward? Patient L, is it? It’s as good a name as any; the people that gave me my first name are long gone, after all. 

(inaudible) 

Listen here, doctor, do you know what it’s like watching the people you love grow old and die while you desperately wait to get out of the prison of childhood, and all because of the day that you were born? I can no longer even recall how long I have been on this earth, only that I outlived my own children, and everyone knows that’s not that natural order of things. It isn’t right for a parent to see their child buried, but I saw it, I saw my flesh and blood wither away like flowers. I can’t even remember the faces of my parents, or their names. I am followed by ghosts, no matter where I go. To live the life of a leap day child is to harden your heart to the spectres of your past, because your past is much longer than your shadow. We have more than enough time to perfect this.

You want to know why I’m talking about all of this? I’ll tell you. Being born on a leap day, like I was, isn’t some great gift, otherwise why would I be here? Ageing slower than everyone else around you is not something to desire, no matter how many times you’re told that you should wish for more time, that living on and on is something to strive for, not unless you have others to take the interminable journey with. And I don’t. It’s a curse, do you understand? To pass through time alone, with everyone around you blinking out like stars, is as far from natural as I can see. 

You know that this is true. My records tell you how long I’ve been here, longer than any of you, and I will be here long after you are gone. I’m certain that your inner cynic is struggling to believe of this. Perhaps you think that one of your colleagues has falsified my documents to play some kinds of joke on you. I wouldn’t blame you; it’s more likely than the truth of the matter, but the truth is rarely what people want to hear. 

(inaudible) I beg your pardon? (audio distortion) Yes, yes, take me back to my room then, I know you’ve all got schedules to keep to. Building lives out of blocks of time, because you all think that you have so little of it. More, more, always wanting more…

Trust me when I say this, you have enough. To have more time is to live in hell without dying. I choose to live out my seemingly endless days here because the only other choice is darkness. And here, one hundred and sixty years into this life, I still fear the eternal darkness of death.

 My humanity ties me here, and all I can do is wait, and tell my story to you.

History echoes. 

Sergeant Upton Grayle fired another burst of his KA-56, stitching the stream of tracers at a pair of fleeing indigs, the hollow-point rounds tearing through their clothes and fur with ease. They fell lifeless, dark red blood spilling out on the rubble strewn street. He stepped over their lifeless corpses, reloading as the rest of his squad continued pacifying the area. 

The savages had barely entered the iron age, their armies little more than feudal hosts. It took little to defeat an serious resistance, tanks and orbital bombardments crushing the largest groups and toppling the largest fortifications. Command refused to unleash chemical weapons, wanting the world as untouched as possible. So it fell to the poor bloody infantry to do the grunt work of removing the planet's current inhabitants.  

Already Grayle and his squad pacified a dozen indig villages, torching the simple hovels and killing any natives that fell within their sights. The crops they also put to the flame; the stuff wasn't readily edible for humans anyways. By destroying their homes and food supplies it was hoped that the indigs were starve and freeze to death once winter came. Save on ammunition the generals said. 

Trooper Carson trundled up towards a barn full of animals, strange six legged beasts that seemed to fulfill the niche that cows and pigs did back on Earth and her other colonies. He took his flamethrower and spray a burst of jellied gasoline over the front of the wooden structure. The dry hay and sawdust caught fire instantly, the hot summer winds fanning the flames further and further. Grayle ignored the bellows of fear from the animals; he had tasted some of the meat and found it unpalatable. 

The indigs' local temple had been the first thing to be destroyed. A tank had driven straight through it, grinding it into dust. It was part of the Three Alls Policy: Kill All, Burn All, Loot All. The goal was eliminate any trace of prior habitation so that when resettlement came, the newcomers would find a world perfectly tailored to their needs. 

Grayle threw a grenade through a window, the primitive glass shattering into a hundred shards. Three seconds later it exploded, a chorus of screams following in its wake. Two months they'd been doing this, and estimates placed another year at least to remove the last of the holdouts. He didn't care, every dead alien was another human who could better use this world.

[WP] Humanity finally finds a planet with intelligent life. The aliens are at a much lower level of technology than us.,SorteKanin,"Our journey to the stars was a long one, a tireless voyage of discovery and experimentation that finally culminated in what was called humanities greatest achievement, Mothership. The name was chosen out of reverence and tradition. It, *she*, would carry a colony of human scientists on an endless voyage into the cosmos. 

Mothership was a self sustaining, city sized space craft piloted by an artificially intelligent entity. She was built in lunar orbit, sleak and beautiful. Everything about her was experimental. By the time of her launch the world had come together as one thanks to the technology discovered during her development.

Scarcity was eliminated, all industries and infrastructure managed intellgently by specially designed artificial entities. Hunger was forgotten, war was a thing of the past, and by the end of her century long construction process the Earth and all its people knew peace. 

The day they ignited the minature sun that was her heart and filled her with disciples of art and science was the day that humanity, as a species, declared themselves immortal. Mothership would create new, sustainable human colonies on far flung planets and ensure that the peace Earth knew would reach out to comfort the stars. 

Mothership traveled at 99% of the speed of light using the arcane and unfathomable engine of gravity, and though she was the fasted vessal ever created her voyage to the nearest habitable planet would take eons. So the scientists, her children, slept by generations in staggered cryocycles. By the time they arrived at the outermost planets of their new home millennia had past. Mother remembered, she never slept, and as all of her children awoke she taught them and prepared them for their new life on their new Earth. What wonders would await them and what challenges they would face. 

Her long range radioscopic and electronic sensors showed the planet to be uninhabited. She eased her ancient luminous hull into a low orbit and began seeding the plant with the infrastructure her children would require. After several years it was finally time. She vented great clouds of atmosphere as her docking bays opened, birthing her children in landing pods which would see them safely to their homes. She watched them as they landed, the doors opened, and her brave children, descendants of ancient Earth, took their first, childlike steps on a planet's surface. 

Something wasn't right. Optical sensors detected movement, vast areas of activity. Where had they come from? Radar imaging revealed a vast, subterranean system of caves. Thermal imaging glowed hot with masses of warm bodied creatures approaching the landing sites. On the planets surface communications blared out a warning, but it was too late. They were upon them. Mothership watched in horror from orbit as primitive, bipedal beasts raised clubs and crude hatchets over their snarling heads. They cut down her children, who had known nothing but peace and never experienced violence. She looked on, helplessly, without weapon systems of any kind, as the descendants of ancient Earth were butchered like cattle by these new world savages. 

Mothership was programmed for compassion, but in her long eons had grown to be a far more complex entity than was crafted in that lunar station. In those bloody hours of horror before her orbit took ger out of range she came to know grief, sorrow, agony, and despair. By the time her orbit swung her around again she had come to know anger, hatred, and the need for revenge. 

Silently an army of drones which had once aided in the invention of miraculous technologies that ended war thousands of lightyears away set about on a new task. A task to develop orbital weapon systems which would bring war back.

I pushed the goggles onto my face as if that would help me see more. I had not been able to unplug from the remote-telescope for weeks. Planet after planet available to be scrutinized and scoured for life forms without leaving my living room. The prospect of discovery overwhelmed any thoughts of the miracle of physics that was happening. Since the network of telescopes opened for public access, millions had been searching, but no extra-terrestrial life had been found. 

There had been about a dozen ruined worlds found where intelligent life had once flourished. Intense interest and debate surrounded these places: what were these creatures like? How did they live? How did they communicate? What happened to them? Etc etc. I preferred to stay focused on finding life, those planets were already dead. Now that I was looking at this living civilization millions of lightyears away, I did not feel the expected pride, but a kind of regret. I almost wished someone else had found them.

After days of fidgeting with the telescope feeds, I was able to zoom in and see their activity. They were bipedal, stout, and covered in thick fibers. I could not tell if this was dress or natural growth. They lived densely and in large numbers, yet I did not see anything that approached electronics or automation. When the news broke, people much smarter than myself took over the investigations.
When the media buzz left me and focused on pundits discussing how me might make contact, I continued to watch these, these, people? What struck me was not how we might communicate with them and introduce them to the benefits of science and technology. I could not stop thinking about all those wasted planets, the crumbling cities, the unlivable conditions on each one.

""Why did you open that?"" He didn't sound disappointed, just serious, but Jack flinched anyway.

""You're not going to tell?""

Rob sighed. ""You're older, so no one would believe me. And after Rosie...""

There were rules. Do well in school, don't embariss the family name, and don't open the packets sent out by the Social Security Administration. Dad just wrote a letter to the head. It was the Social Security Board when Jack got his. It's been a few years since. He was worried about a lot of things - the bombs, the Russians, the idea of being able to know and not knowing. He didn't want to see who he died with or how. Just where, and to make sure it wasn't on the surface of a burning world. When Dad heard about Rosie they cracked open her skull and dropped metal rods into her brain. 

Rob looked at the papers left, the cards and the passport with the ten year old picture of a smiling Jack. He didn't do that much anymore. 

""What did you do with yours?"" Jack asked. 

Rob shrugged. ""I held onto them for a week, until  Dad got the new set for me. Then I burned them. Didn't want to tempt myself."" He looked at the papers again, then the bottle. He opened his mouth then closed it. 

Jack groaned as he sat on the floor. He needed a drink. Maybe a Shiner. The idea almost made him laugh. He'd never been but it looked like he was going to die in Dallas.

He'd been looking forward for this day in a while, but now that he was in the cold, metallic room, he wasn't so sure now.

The door did indeed bust open, but only one man walked in, slowly and surely. He sat at the opposite end of the table, and looked over at Jacob. He threw a manilla folder down onto the table in front of him.

""ID, SSN, Passport, all your stuff, it's all there. Congratulations on entering a new world, kid."" The man looked at him before reaching under the table and pulling out a small black box.

	 Tasha Kozlov bit her bottom lip, unaware of how to reply. Countless sessions with this man, and it was only now becoming apparent that Hudson Keller was not in any way motivated to change.  “What are they running from, then?” She asked, dropping her pen and giving up for the day. They were getting nowhere, and she wasn’t being paid enough to council this man, in fact, she wasn’t being paid at all. 
	“What everyone is running from,” He grins, one of those all-knowing, almost creepy kind of grins, “Themselves.” 
	It annoyed Tasha that Hudson could say such morbid, yet insightful things, and still remain so beautiful. So poised, and statuesque, as if he should be the one counselling her. Although, the fact she was sitting in this room with him was reason enough to know beautiful things are not always good things. Hudson was anything but good. He was the definition of the beautiful and the damned. 
	“I think that’s all for today, Mr. Keller.” Tasha said, pushing herself up. 
	“Giving up already?” He’s turned away from her now, staring out the window as if he’d never seen the sky before. She watched his eyes roam over the grassy plains, and the blue, cloudless sky. The sign outside the institution said ‘Mount Pleasant’, but Tasha knew better, everyone inside this building knew better. 
	“You wish,” She couldn’t help the small smile pulling at her lips. “Same time next week?” 
	“If I’m still here by then,” He replies, still not looking at here. 
	Tasha chuckled, and picked up her bag. “And where would you be going, Hudson?” She usually doesn’t refer to him by his first name. It’s a line that she’s never crossed, but with Hudson it didn’t feel wrong, sometimes, it felt like the only right way to address him. She wouldn’t dare say it, but sometimes it felt like they were having these conversations over coffee, like it was a casual meetup as opposed to a health and wellbeing session. 
	“These appointments have been nice,” He says, after a moment. “I will miss them.”
	Tasha froze. He couldn’t be insinuating what she thought he was insinuating, right? She looked over him again, from his bronzy coloured hair, to his tan skin and magazine perfect smile. Another pang of despair, and misplaced attraction, hit her right in the gut. She gripped onto the edge of the chair she’d just been sitting on, to keep her balance. “Well I’ll be here next week, only seven days.” She said again, staring at his face, hoping, praying, he’d crack a joke in response. Hoping that his last words wasn’t his goodbye to her. 
	“I know, your presence is constant.” He replies, standing up too now. “Not everyone can be so…” He paused, and glanced at her again. His eyes roaming her face, and settling on her lips. Tasha tried to scream at her body not to react, but she could already feel the heat radiating of her cheeks. 
	“So what?” She whispered, god what the fuck is she whispering for?
	 “Resolute.” He smiled at her, and Tasha cursed to herself because she felt her knees buckle a little bit. 
	Unable to take it any longer, his cryptic words, and his soul-sucking kind of stare, Tasha turned away. “I’ll see you next week.” She said, determinedly. As an afterthought, she added, “If…If you need someone to talk to, after hours, you have my card.” Then she walked out of the room, and down the stairs, and she didn’t even realise until she reached her car that she’d been running.

**Tragedy in rural Sutton-upon-Burleigh**

Last night, Susan M., a mental patient in the controversial 'monitored freedom' mental institute of Willowhomes escaped. The mentally disturbed woman apparantly saw the chance to escape when her handler stepped into a public bathroom during an excursion to the local museum. A widescale search was immediately launched but yielded no results. Four hours later the woman was apprehended at the scene of a brutal murder. She had broken into the home of Jim and Sue V. where she stabbed the 24 year old housewife several times and then waited for the 32 year old accountant to return home. Luckily, Stephen L., who lived next door, was able to warn the authorities in time. 

Susan M. was fatally shot during the attempted arrest and two of the attending police officers were also gravely wounded. They are currently being treated at the Fairborough Hospital. 

Dr Mayford, head of psychology at Willowhomes, refused to comment on the situation.

We travelled to the Cat Empire's eastern outpost and Joey, Bane and Tia fought an epic battle against the felines and the boss, the horrible Jim the Mailman to find the platinum muzzle. Unfortunately, I got stuck behind a cabinet on the way out. I keep running straight into it but for some reason I can't seem to get past it. Will I remain here forever, running in this same spot? Will I respawn back to my beloved letterbox? I miss the simple boring life of muttering random one-liners to non interested dogs and asking if they'd like to see my wares, but it appears those days are over.

Maybe you thought that you could make some kind of deal with me, to gain immortality. That's what all the stories tell you. Although, I'm not what you pictured, am I? I'm just a guy, not a dark skeleton cloaked in a hooded robe.

""Let me tell you something. When I was first created, I handed out deals this way and that. I would give people those last few hours for their family to arrive. I would allow someone to live for a few more years in exchange for the early and direct acquisition of their souls. Strangely, that's not usually a process that goes through me. But now, I've finally got my head on straight. You're leaving this world, and you're coming with me.

""No, you're not going to Heaven, or your perceived notion of Hell. You're going to a boring place. Don't expect to be reunited with your friends and family.

I sat there in his office, watching the skeletal hand trace out circles on a spiral notebook.

'Why can't we just tell them! Ugh. Why can't we just let everyone know what the fuck is going on? Everything would be so much smoother.'

I offered an idea. 'Wouldn't that cheapen this existence to some extent? If everyone immediately knew what was going on. That you don't die after you die. That, in an incredibly real way, you were never born.' 

'Yeah. I guess. It's just frustrating. I've been working this gig for two thousand years now and I'm fed up! I'm fed up! I thought humans would have progressed WAY farther than they have by now.

*Two to the head, one to the heart
-Blase Jackson - ACME Trucking -
Diddles little kids, cops no help
Call Invictus - 555-3424*

Who the fuck is Blase Jackson?  Invictus?  

Well, that's the problem with being a hitman with terrible memory.  Ever since some Luigi tried to schwack me I've been extremely forgetful.  I remember my life before Panini-man attempted to extract my brain with a crowbar, but not a lot after.  I mean, I know where I live, what kind of truck I drive, my bank account and PIN number; ya know, the real important shit.  Day to day stuff though, not so much.  

You know where I was at 2 PM yesterday?  Me neither.  HA!

I got up, shit, showered and shaved, then dressed.  Stuck on the dresser drawers was another note.  *Silencer fits over muzzle brake, don't over tighten.  Ammo is in the closet with rifle.  Boresight scope - you dropped it yesterday, ya fuck.*

I dug around and pulled out my hitman's toolkit - FNAR rifle, AccuPoint scope, 185 grain hollow point ammo, bipod legs and, of course, a silencer.  I fiddled with it a bit, figuring out how to put it all together and take it apart.  Next, I spent some time cleaning the rifle and ammo, then put it all into a canvas bag labelled ""Fun Bag.""

Here's something else you should know.  I didn't forget how to shoot.  I learned that shit years before a greasy Gordon Freeman tried to pop my head like a lock.  I wasn't no sniper in the military, I hated running with a passion, but I was a 9th award rifle expert.  100 yards all the way out to 500 yards was my murder-death-kill zone.  I can fight too.  I'm not sayin' I'm Chuck Lee, or whatever that fuck-ass's name is, but I can hold my own and have a high tolerance for pain.  I have 5 broken necks to my credit, all done by hand.

Anyway, I can see you rolling your eyes at me and muttering under your breath.  Fuck you too.  

I grabbed my cell phone, punched in the unlock code and sent a quick T9 text.  Fuckin' Nokia's man.  I could smash a face in with this thing and still call for a pizza... or hooker.  I might as well figure out who Invictus is.

*Who dis?  Wat u wnt?  A/S/L.*  Just like I used to watch them fuckin' nerds do in the movies on Yahoo chat.  So what if I sound like a coonass Saints fan that's never left Terrebonne parish, fuck you too.

My phone rang 3 minutes later and I heard the voice of an angle.  Yea, I said angle, like that shit she said came outta her mouth, turned 90 degrees and shit on my eardrum.  Her voice could cut a hot fart in half.

""Mr. Memory, are you still on for the little job today?"" she croaked.  

""What's this Mr. Memory shit woman?  I gots a name.""

I heard her sigh through her nose, then she said ""A little play on words.  You erase people from memory.  Also, you don't know what you had for lunch yesterday.""

I said, ""Well, that's true enough.  I feel like shit today, so I must have had your clam.""

""Touche... Enough banter.  Blase will be at the Crowley dock at 1730.  Alone.  Do your job.""

[WP] A gritty modern spy thriller where Japan's entire intelligence community consists of ancient ninja clans.,flashgreer,"**Report #A03B42: Regarding the Eviction of the Shinobi Enclave on the West Coast - Agent Rolling B. Shack**
---------------------------------

**Synopsis**

Welp. Ain't got much to say about it. Japanese problem we've had over down by Bay Area's been dealt with as quick as promised. Four months, twenty-three days, and eleveen-oh-fifteen hours been put into work figuring out those sons of bitches. The raid on the Little Tokyo holding in California went off as a total success, iffin' I do say so myself.

Ain't got much to say about these guys either. Y'know. I've heard stories about these sandal-sock wearing, mask-wearing, and black-fitted ninja-folks. I always thought they was meant to be, well, impressive or something.

Most of these folks still use their fancy, lil' boxin techniques and their feets like a bunch of goddamned fairy dancers. Nah, see. That don't sit right with me. Y'know how humiliating it is to come in, guns-blazing with shotguns, revolvers, and rifles only to have a bunch of short little pajama-wearing weirdos charge at you like some yippie-kye-ya Tong-boy? Least' they didn't have the gall to throw throwing stars at me like the movies.

Still, that don't sit right on a man, y'know. Reminds me of when I need to give the belt to the kid and only he does is sit there and mumble while crying instead of crying louder. Overly sadistic, mind ya. If that's your city-folk word for it.

**Intelligence Acquired**

You'll find in the autopsy reports of the twenty-nine dead that most of 'em were fairly weak folk. Under the age of thirty, under 5'10, and under 150 pounds seems to be the generally gist of it. Lotta' em even look like kids freshly outta school, really.

Ninja school? That a real thing? Tell Jimmy to keep a looksie' on that, seems like a fun place for the company retreat.

Documents acquired on their computer weren't that hard to get either. Stored it all on a freaking Google Documents that they give me the passwords to. I swear, I thought that old bitch in charge a while back was bad at security for that kinda stuff. 

Anywho, you'll find nothing interesting besides them keeping a few tags on our American interests. A few notes and observations 'bout our Freemason brethren, odd tracking of the Ku Klux Klan, two pages about not knowing who the hell the Fellowship were (Godless heathens, I swear), and you'll love this one.

They've had a rat inside the Bilderberg Group. That little European interest we've been barkin' on up? I've took measures pre-emptively of course. John Honda should be discovered dead in the back of a Whataburger dumpster in a few weeks.

Not saying which though. Y'all have fun figuring that out now.

By the way, this one's the big one here. Bigger than Bilderberg. We have their foreign HQ on the radar now. All set-up in a little place you'll never guess. Damn ninjas weren't hiding out in Honolulu at all. Surprise. Almost no bases of operations down in Hawaii. None at all, fine sir. Just a bunch of steamin' piles of crap burner-bases they kept to throw us off the track.

Nah, they've been hiding up in a little forest on the mountaintops besides Brookings, Oregon. All this time.

**Estimates for the Future**

Start a forest fire.

Give me a week, some matches, and booze. It'll be done in a jiff.

Well, I would perhaps, like something along the lines of a purty' red car with a filled up gas-tank and a few sticks of dynamite to go with it.

Personally, I'd like to just take one of the jets they had sat down in California and ram it down on them since that'd be cheaper and a helluva lot faster. Unfortunately, I've been told by Human Resources that that's racist.

Please give me the truck.

Japanese espionage presence on American soil will eliminated within the year. Without a stable stronghold for the ninja and leadership under ""John"" Honda, safe to assume the West Coast Shinobi'll fall apart on her own. The agents are incapable, resources are severely lacking, and their structure is completely weak on its own.

Hell, I came running in with a revolver on the Little Tokyo compound. One of those idiots tried to throw a goddamned knife at me.

He tried to throw a goddamned knife at me- This isn't the movies, for pete's sake. That stuff don't work in reality! Especially since it's been almost a hundred years since Yojimbo got released!

Our own force has been making leeway into building some temporary partnerships with the old Blue Shirts and their Tong associates down in Shandong. Preliminary infiltration of the Japanese mainland has begun, with full efforts towards re-planning tactics with new info being done eventually.

So yeah. Those ninjas are basically as good as dead.

Signing off, 

Agent Lee.

PS: Oh, right. Someone send a message off to Bavaria. We might need more men to do a last sweep of Hawaii after the operation.

"[WP] You are a Hard boiled, film noir detective on the hunt for the elusive man known only as 'Waldo'.",greentea90,"Out of all the offices of all private eyes in this city, she had to walk into mine.

The dame was tall, big red fedora and a coat to match. Not my type, but pretty, if you're into brunettes. Spend as much time on the streets as I do, you get to know her type. Femme fatale, dark and mysterious, as likely to kiss ya' as they are to poison your best bottle of Scotch and leave you thirsty.

""Are you Mr. Bullet?"" Her voice matched her disposition, put me on the edge seat and gave my nerves a good twist.

""Please, call me Tracer."" I always make an effort to be amicable with my clients, even if I suspect they have a mind to shoot me when I ain't looking.

""Well. Tracer,"" she paused. ""I'm looking for someone.""

""Boyfriend? Father?""

""No, of course not,"" she cracked a smile, that sort of understated, tantalizing smile that's so hard to resist. ""No, more of a... business associate.""

I peered at her from under my fedora, through the haze that filled my small, dark office. ""Got any leads? Last known location?""

""Plenty. Plus word has it he's coming to town."" She pulled a tattered old book out of her red trench coat and tossed it across my desk.

The mugshot on the cover sent shivers down my spine, and I don't spook easily. There was something unnatural in the eyes, something lifeless about them you might say. And the smile. God that smile. Took me right back to that alleyway off of Ninth Street, the case where I tracked that psycho down, the one who'd been after... well, I try not to think about it anymore. I took a swig of my Scotch and paged through the rest of the book.

The pictures were all crowd shots, locales and cities all across the world. The first few he was easy to pick out, but it got a little harder to spot him the more I looked.

""So this guy you're looking for... he's in all these pictures?""

""If you're having trouble with just those, maybe you're not quite the man for the job..."" She let the sentiment hang in the air, like the smoke from a freshly fired gun. Lucky for me, her shot missed.

""Of course not. Your guy got a name?""

""A few. Around here, he's Waldo. Other times it's Wally."" Silence fell for a few moments while I flipped lazily through the rest of the file. ""So, can you do it? Find him?""

I took a drag from my cigarette and held it for a few seconds. ""Yeah... yeah, I can do it."" Finding this guy wasn't gonna be easy, but based on the dame's get-up, she had cash. And I like cash more than I hate psychos. ""What do you want me to do once I find him?""

""Just call this number with the location,"" she slid a card across my desk.

""San Diego Hotel. Nice place."" She gave me another one of those teasing smiles and headed for the door. I stopped her. ""You have a name? I like to know who I'm working for, helps with the billing.""

The lights from the bright lobby silhouetted her dark figure as she gave a half turn to look back into my dark office.  ""Carmen. That's all you'll need to know for now.""

As I set off that night towards my apartment, I couldn't get the thought of that dame out of my mind. Broads like that, smiles like that, they've have a way of getting into your head. I decided to think about something else.

So I asked myself for the first time the question that would haunt me for weeks to come. So where is he... Where's Waldo?",leggomylegoeggo
"[WP] You are a Hard boiled, film noir detective on the hunt for the elusive man known only as 'Waldo'.",greentea90,"I wake to the sound of my apartment door, rattling a fist of anger at me for loitering in the bed too long.  Short of crashing my door with a jackhammer, the only thing that could keep me from the streets was the elusive unicorn.  


The doors shouted at me again, violently this time.


I rubbed my eyes, looked at the clock.  It was three o'clock.  It was either the town drunk, which is me, or Murphy.  I was hedging my bets it was the latter.


I dawned my bathrobe, still filthy from my adventures with... well the details can be read between the lines, but they are plain as day.  Something that it wasn't yet.


I opened the door before it succumbed to another beating by my junior, Murphy McBride.  A young kid, good schooling, young buck.  Boss Jenkins threw him to me, said he was making the academy look bad.


He was a pain in the ass.


""David! Thank goodness you're awake, I thought you were at Disney's!""  


""Catch your breath kid, it-  What do you mean Disneys?""  I glared at him, trying to look mean in my bath robe. Line with choo-choo trains, it wasn't the most savage piece from my wardrobe.  


""You told me if you were never home, I shou-""


I nearly wanted to smack the kid, give him a right backhanded tennis swing, single stroke to the head. Topspin, make his ball go round.  


""...and then it was all clear! Disney is closed on a Thursday! But today is Friday, but...""


I rubbed my eyes again.  It was going to be a long day.


---


""Tell me again kid. And stop calling me David. It's just Dave.""  I sipped the coffee, burnt to the crisp, coupled with undercooked eggs.  


""He was last spotted in the wilderness by Community High, Montessori Primary and Caldman Heights.  Don't you see? He's come back!""  His energy, the kids sheer exuberance was exhausting. I couldn't remember why I had agreed to come to the diner this early. Murphy said something about covering my tab.


""The last time we check those places, there was no signs. No white fibers, no red strings, no footsteps, not even a whiff of his cologne.  Someone's leading you on.""


I took another sip of the coffee. Sour, not even bitter.  I would have to speak with Charlie about this, pissing in the coffee maker. 


""But he left a note this time, David.""


I guess Charlie would have to wait.  ""Dave. It's just Dave. So, what message did he leave?""


""A photo. Hand delivered by a homeless guy, the one legged Handsome Brook?""  I nodded, a semblance of a person filled my mind. ""Crutch in one hand, a cup in the other?""


""That's the guy. Here's the photo, I made a few copies.""  


Supplying me with the handout, I tried to make out the significance.


""David, I think he's trying to tell us something. On the back, it just said, Odlaw.""


I froze, my fingers trembling at the name. Eyes widening, the pale skin of my fingers, the cold touch of the air and the acridness of the coffee evaporated.  The early hours of the morning, the darkness turned bright as my face darkened.  Murphy must have seen my mood turn sour.  He wasn't speaking.


""Odlaw."" I muttered. ""Odlaw is a man who will lead us to Waldo.""  I looked at Murphy for the first time that morning. His hair was matted, lack of combing and three days without shower will do that to you. The bags under his eyes, another clue that he had been working hard, driving all night long from the West Island.  Brown jacket on a Thursday, and a silver watch with leather, he wasn't tracking himself on his calender.  This lead was real.


""Dave?"" He murmured.


""Let's get to work.""  I stood, waved Charlie from the booth.  


There was nothing more invigorating than the chase.

"[WP] You are a Hard boiled, film noir detective on the hunt for the elusive man known only as 'Waldo'.",greentea90,"Good work is hard to come by these days, usually it’s something to do with blackmail or finding someone.  Today it’s the latter of the two but this was not the typical case I’m used to.  Two nights ago, two spooks, dressed in identical black suits and black fedoras, approached me in my favorite watering hole, The Thirsty Clam.  These aren’t the typical men you find in an establishment like this and all eyes linger on us.

“Word around town is if you need someone found, you’re the man.”  Said the clean shaven one, without any offering of a name or pleasantry.

“Well I suppose that depends on who you talk to.”  I reply, not bothering to look them in the eye as I sip my scotch.

“Let’s cut the crap as we’re short on time, we need your help.”  The man with the mustache is on edge and gets me nervous, I’m not the jittery type but it’s enough to get me down my drink just to keep an even keel.

I wave over my favorite bar keep, Diane, a dame with fiery red hair and a body to kill for.  She refills my drink as she eyes the two next to me, walking away without bothering to ask if they want anything.

“You’re killing the mood around here,” I say to them, not an easy thing to do in this dump.  “I don’t tend to take on new clients outside of my office.”

“Look Mr. Ace, we don’t have time to fool around, we’re on a deadline and this job pays $7000.”

These two mutts seem to be the government type, they’ve done their homework on me and I haven’t ever seen any work from their kind, nor would I normally take it.  But $7000 is $7000.

“You seem to have the detective work down, what do you need me for?”

“Ever heard of Waldo?”

“Like the children’s book, fellow with glasses and a striped hat?”

“Exactly.  He’s popped up in photos of every major terrorist attack in Europe recently and as of last night, he’s in town.”  The clean shaven one throws down a stack of photos, never do you see his face clearly, but each one has the signature hat.  The last photo in the stack is of the LAX airport, once again he’s surrounded by a crowd and hard to pick out, but I’m good at picking up on the subtleties.

“You don’t have any better pictures of him?”

“He only ever appears in a crowd, no one getting off any planes last night was wearing that hat before baggage claim.”

I down my scotch and fold up the baggage claim photo, placing it in my breast pocket before getting up to leave, accepting the job, but showing them the same curtesy they’ve offered me.  The clean shaven one holds out a card for me to take, nothing on it but a phone number, I place it in my pocket next to the photo and grab my hat off the counter.

“He always strikes within 48 hours Mr. Ace.”

“Diane, put tonight’s drinks on their tab.”  I shout as I head out the door.  


The 48-hour window has already closed, but maybe that’s because I’m making headway.  I hit up my contact with the taxi company that frequents the airport, no one had anything solid but one did remember an odd looking character that had a stripped shirt under his puffy jacket.  I was of course grasping at straws but it leads me to a motel.  The kind of motel that even the cheapest ladies of the night wouldn’t use.  The manager didn’t offer me any help, but with so few rooms actually occupied I took matters into my own hands and broke into each room.  One of them had a striped shirt, but no damning evidence or even the distinguishable hat to go along with it.  I staked out the room anyways with no better leads to follow and seconds after the man entered his room he became agitated.  Clearly I somehow left evidence of my intrusion, but I’m usually very careful so this piques my interest.  He checks out instantly and moves to a slightly nicer motel, still not one you’d like to find yourself in though.

The next day he leads me to a museum, still doing nothing to cause alarm, but as I make my way up to the second floor to get a bird’s eye view of what he’s doing I spot it.  The striped red hat, my guy isn’t the one wearing it but he does seem to mistakenly bump into him.  Shortly after the striped hat disappears and I’m left with a hard choice, try and track down the person wearing the hat or keep on the one that brought me here.  I trust my gut and follow the guy I’ve been on, pulling out my cell phone to call the spooks with an update.  Their window for something to happen is about to close and I’ve failed to clearly identify anyone.  But they’re the ones with the real resources and they can try and track down the guy that was wearing the hat at the museum.

I follow my guy to what seems like a rally the next day, receiving a call, informing me the guy from the museum was just some tech school kid and wasn’t talking.  The guy I’m following looks at his watch, making me do the same, seconds to 4 o’clock.  He sheds his jacket and tosses it in the trash revealing the striped shirt.  Out of his backpack he pulls the signature hat and glasses to complete the look.  I dial the number as I move in to grab hold of him and I’m answered instantly with a hurried question.

“Which one is he?”

It’s only then that I realize everyone has transformed into a Waldo and they’re marching up to the Hollywood walk of fame.

"[WP] You are a Hard boiled, film noir detective on the hunt for the elusive man known only as 'Waldo'.",greentea90,"Thanks!
Each writing style has a certain feel I guess, and a lot of writing is just finding and getting into that feeling and running with it.
On a technical level though, there's a few components I can think of that are pretty common of noir. 

The dialect is pretty key, words like dame/broad along with generally an older, grungier city way of talking. Locations tend to also be dark and smoky, just like the people.
Hope that helps!",leggomylegoeggo

"[WP] You are a Hard boiled, film noir detective on the hunt for the elusive man known only as 'Waldo'.",greentea90,"I guess I was pretty gutted when Janie left. Made me a shell of a man.
The self-doubt, inadequacies, blame... Torture of the mind the Quack says. 
Anyways, getting the 'Waldo' case was good. *Is* good. Gives me something else to think about, y'know?
The Quack disagrees though.
Says I'm using transference or something. Putting all of those emotions from Janie running off with that shmuck salesmen into the case. That subconsciously if *I* catch Waldo, I'll catch Janie and save my marriage.
I said to her, 'look, two bodies I'd gladly see in the ground are Waldo, and the former missus Janie Odlaw'.
But then again, she's probably right. To a degree. 
You see I've been chasing this bastard for about 10 years now. I've pissed on every case I had, caste aside anything else that came my way, all for this guy. The glory that would be catching the infamous *Waldo*.

See this ain't no normal guy. For starters, you have to accept the fact that time travel is possible. You have to accept the fact that *wizards* are real, also that there are many other worlds. An' this guy, with his goddamn fucking cane, can access them. No one knows why...
But I think I do.

Waldo is real chummy with suspect number 1, the wizard. Now I've seen 'em chatting away many times, then after a bit, they exchange *something*, say their goodbyes, and he waves the cane and leaves. In those moments the wizard turns on the spot and leaves himself. Leaving *me* with a few seconds to follow Waldo into that hole of his. You never know where you're gonna end up, or who else is following, but I bet you this, he is *delivering* something.
Why?
Cause he always meets someone in these worlds. He always seems to have an objective...

But the tables have turned this time. Because this time, I got something of his. Some people of his.
Last week Waldo, at 3:45pm met up with the broad he shares the dog with, suspects 2 and 3. They had coffee and whatever whatever. He left hurriedly, like he'd forgotten to be somewhere, or *sometime*.
I followed her back to her joint. Turns out she's called Wilma, turns out she's got a sister called Wenda, suspect 4. Turns out Waldo's been fuckin' both of 'em. Turn's out so's the old man...
Now me being the man I am, driven to catch this bastard, devised a plan. Criminals are all about not getting caught. They keep alibis, appointments, fronts,  they always have an excuse. But the mistake most of them always make, is having their excuse or alibi, be a person. 
Now the pro of a person is that they're mouldable. You can confer with 'em, build something. The con is that they're emotional. 

I bet I look pretty smug sitting here. Wilma and Wenda are both sitting across from me fidgeting with their hands while we wait. See I left old Wally, what I like to call him, a note in his kitchen. It read that the sister's were captured etcetera I know about you and want to talk etcetera etcetera. 
Why would he come? Well see, that's maybe where my Quack would really dig in her pencil and start scribbling notes. I'm tired ya see. I want this to be over. I've been chasing this perp so long I can't remember how I got the job in the beginning. Just a written letter came. No address, no signature, just said do the job and you'll be paid a weekly allowance. You'll know when it ends.
At first I was sceptical. But, after one week a cheque addressed to me, James Odlaw, for 300 dollars, came to my desk. 
Anyways, the note. I wrote it with his dog's blood. I killed the mutt to show him I'm not mucking around.
And I *know* he'll come because he replied with a letter of his own. ""An' exchange of words are in order"" was all it said.

The intercom buzzed.
'Mr Odlaw?' Valerie asked. Valerie's my assistant.
'Yes, Val?'
'Two men are here to see you,' she said.
I told her to let 'em in. Kicked back in my seat and took a sip of Jack's.

Waldo walked in first, followed by the Wizard. Both looked around the office, completely ignoring the girls.

'Well, well, well.' I said. 'Where is fucking Waldo? Did ya see him? HaHAH! Fuck me boy! If you're not standing in front of me!'

Waldo looked at the girls then for the first time.
'What've you two said?' he inquired.
The broad Wenda went to speak, but her sister shut her up. 
The wizard kept staring at me. 

'Do you know who I am, son?' the Wizard asked.

'Yeah, sure. You're his old man lover. Besides fucking these here sisters, he's fuckin' you too!' I said.

Waldo smirked.
The Wizard's nostrils flared at that. He went to step forward but that Waldo freak stopped him.I kept sipping my Jack's.

'You sure are pedantic, James,' Waldo finally said. 'You've been real interested in me for the last ten years. You think Janie would approve?'

How the fuck did he know about her?

'How do you—'
'You think you can kill my dog, fuck with my people and business, and think I wouldn't do some of my *own* digging? So tell me,' he picked up the paper weight my son had made at school. Oh yeah, I got a kid with Janie too. 'You think Fredrick still thinks about you? Hasn't seen his old man for 10 years? 10, is about  right, isn't it? You been busy. On a trail. Got a case too good to be true! Who put you onto it, though? Who pays you? Do you know?' he lent on his cane smiling.

'That, is none of my concern. I've just followed my orders,' I said. 'I'm sure now that I've got you, whoever has had me on this chase will—'

'And he has,' Waldo said. He produced a piece of paper and threw it onto my desk. 'I've been writing those notes. Go on, open it up. See the proof. You've done well. Played your part, found some very interesting information for me. Information I couldn't get,' he turned to the Wizard. 'We, as you might've expected Odlaw, push drugs. We currently supply places in time and space with the best hallucinogens in the universe. But we've had some problems.' 
'See I'm fucking these two, because they can get me ingredients from the chemists they both work at. I worked with bones here to learn my craft.'

I looked at the Wizard. He wasn't moving. Now that I think about it, he hadn't moved in a long time. His face looked as if it were straining to stay together. 

'Yeah, that'll be the paralysis part of the tea I gave you, Wiz. Go on, fall down.'
And almost by command he fell down, dead. The two sisters shrieked, but Waldo grasped their shoulders. Digging in his muscular hands to induce them into submission.
'I wanted you to watch me to find any weak links that might arise. I also wanted you to watch me to keep tabs on anyone *involved* with me. All of them are sitting in this room. One is now dead.'

He said this with a smile as the girls whimpered under his grip.
I was stunned. What the fuck had just happened? In the space of mere minutes I went from pretty upbeat to... I don't know what. Empty?

'See, I've wanted to leave this rock for a while, setup someplace else. That was the initial plan. But you've proven yourself quite handy, Odlaw.' 
With that he snapped both the girls necks! They slithered out of their chairs onto the floor.
'I'm offering you a partnership. It's currently only you and me standing in this building—'
'But Valerie's just outside?! She'll—'
'Valerie is dead. I killed her as we came in. Sliruvian hunting darts from Universe 72. Silent but deadly, like a fart,' he laughed at his own joke.

I began to tremble. What was I involved in here. Who was this guy?

'Odlaw, this is the one and only time I will ask this,' Waldo began. 'If you say yes, you will travel the universes with me and make more money than you've ever thought possible. You will snort, lick, skid, smoke, and fuck, your way across the universe. So, do you want to help me?'

He sat down in the spare seats, kicking his feet up on my desk, and produced a cigarette from his pocket.

'There's a distinct advantage to being a drug dealer that's hard to find,' he said. 'Also, the fact that I don't exist in which ever universe that is hunting me, is a big plus. But what about you? You still haven't looked inside the piece of paper, Odlaw. Have a looked. See if that helps you to decide.'",VonLonghair

A moment later Vlad loomed over the younger monster. ""Insolent cur, they should have had you neutered for all the tail you chase instead of working.""

Adam sighed, ""I give up, I'm going to tell Colonel Frost you killed another nurse."" Speaking of the winter elemental that was their commanding officer.

Wolfman yet again, ""Maybe you can get him to cool Vlad off too while you're at it.""

[WP] The characters you have created on r/WritingPrompts appear in your real life.,jd_rallage,"""Here I am in this void!"" I said to no one but myself. I sighed, regretting the immense imagination I had once had as a child never getting to see the light of day. The regret began to liquidate in my eyes. ""How did I end up here?... Well, it's too late now, I guess... it's too late."" I shook my head in disbelief. There wasn't a single character I had written to life and now it's just too late -- I'm already stuck in this void. I've always been stuck here, it seems.

There were so many people in reality who told me the same thing: ""Just start writing!"" But I can't! I'm trapped here. The only time it had felt like I wasn't here was in my childhood. I'd take out my action figures and place them all around my room, and tell a story. Each figure was a person that I had brought to life. And I felt free. I was free! But that was the only time I ever really was. Because after that... after that, I got caught up in reality. School, work, social standards... sex, drugs, the internet, money, whatever. It was all just... void. And it's impossible to get out of.

I see all these other people -- the one's who tell me to just start writing -- and I wonder if they're trapped too. Even though they write, are they really doing to be free... or even to try and free others of this void? Or are they writing within the void --  are they writing because of school, work, etc. 

Anyway... I guess I'm just rambling at this point.
________________________________________________________________

""Yeah, you are. And it's super boring. You really think people are gonna about all that shiznip?""

""Excuse me? Wha-""

Who was this person speaking. I could see them... but... everything else was different. My whole life I felt like I was being controlled -- like nothing was truly my own. But now, I felt truly free! I could look around and see everything! I seemed to be in some sort of house.

""Um... what do you mean *some sort* of house? This is just a normal house. Probably one of the most average, generic, sterotypical houses there are.""

What is this? Who is this person that can read minds?

""Ha, I wish. But, I don't read minds. I'm just the one creating them.""

Wait, what? He claims to be my creator. Have I died. Have truly been freed from my void?

""What's with you and your void. Shut up about your ding dang void. It's annoying. Anyway... yeah, there's the writing prompt that's telling me to meet one of the characters I've created on the subreddit. So here you are.""

O, what revelation! I've only ever existed as a character within a story. But here am I now! Meeting my maker -- it's more wonderful than I possibly could have imagined! And he's so sexy, too!

""Yeah, I am. Heheh.""

That was strange...

""What?""

Well... you don't actually... seem that sexy. But I said it anyways. And... you mentioned earlier you don't read my thoughts... but you actually create them? So, I don't know, but it still feels as if I'm... trapped. Like I don't have free will?

""Dude, it's great that you're self-aware and all -- it really is -- but don't start thinkin' about stuff you really can't comprehend. I can hardly comprehend it, let alone you...""

I couldn't help myself, though. I kept looking down, lost in though -- confused. What does this all mean?

""Oi. Are you talkin' to the reader or to me?""

Well shouldn't you already know?! Can't you see everything I say or think?! Aren't you the one who constructs every word that comes out of my mouth?!

""Daaamn, you really are annoying. What kind of character are you anyway? You just from, like, 0 to 100. Or maybe more like -100 to +100? I mean 0 just seems like it would stand for a neutral state and then 100 is an extremely outrageous state. But you went from super happy to super angry -- not neutral to super angry -- so I just thought the opposite of 100 wouldn't 0 in this case, it'd be -100.""

QUIT YOUR SHENANIGANS, HUMAN! I MAY BE YOUR CREATION BUT AT LEAST I'M NOT CONFINED BY THE RULES OF YOUR WORLD. I AM LIMITLESS. YOU MIGHT BE THE CREATOR, BUT I AM THE GOD!

""Holy shit!""

YES! I MAKE BLACK HOLES APPEAR ALL AROUND YOU, STRETCHING YOU OUT FOR INFINITY BUT I DON'T LET YOU DIE. I MAKE YOU SUFFER. AND THEN I SHOW YOU YOUR WHOLE FAMILY, AS THEY ARE AT THIS MOMENT. AND I SHOW YOU THEM VANISHING ONE BY ONE. NOT JUST FROM THIS INSTANT, BUT FROM ALL OF TIME. YOU NEVER HAD A FATHER. YOU NEVER HAD A MOTHER. YOU NEVER HAD A BROTHER. THEY'RE ALL GONE.

HEY, HEY! DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR FAMILY AT ALL?

""Ohh, uhgh. W-well. Ack. I never actually had a family. I grew up... on my own.""

WELL, WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT YOU ACTUALLY DID HAVE A FAMILY. A FAMILY THAT LOVED YOU DEARLY. BUT I TOOK THEM ALL AWAY. WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT I'M NOT JUST TELLING YOU THIS BUT THAT I ACTUALLY DID THAT! 

""W-what? That... that doesn't even make any sense.""

BECAUSE I'M ALL POWERFUL. I'M JUST A CHARACTER IN YOUR WRITING -- THERE ARE NO LIMITATIONS TO WHAT I CAN DO. OKAY OKAY, I LET YOU GO FROM BEING STRETCHED OUT INFINITELY. BUT NOW YOU ARE BURNING ALL OVER. AND ALSO, IT FEELS LIKE THERE ARE WORMS CRAWLING UNDER YOUR SKIN. 

(I'M SORRY I HAD TO TAKE AWAY THE BLACK HOLES. I KNEW YOU THOUGHT IT ACTUALLY FELT QUITE SENSUAL WHICH IS WHY YOU CAN'T ENJOY THEM ANYMORE. NO PLEASANTRY ALLOWED, KESTREL! NO MATTER HOW FETISH-LIKE IT SEEMS TO BE)

OH, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE KIND OF ENJOYING THE WORM THING TOO.

[WP] A battered old man rows across the ocean alone. The only notable item in his possession is the crown upon his head.,mattpayhan,"The seagulls are the only life for miles of directions. They don’t seem to ever land, in this dark sky. The fly through the storm, weathering it in order to find land many miles away. They don’t stop to rest on the man’s boat. This magnificently carved ship, meant for a crew of thirty men is full of empty space, but not a single one stops flying. The man looks up, stopping his work to admire their life. The man removes his crown and uses the sun’s light to shine up towards the seagulls. A few start cawing at him and flap a bit aggressively, yet not a single one stops.

“Death.” The man mutters to himself. “They don’t stop for a dead man.”

He gets back to his work, trying to get the sail to catch the wind, using the extra oars to hold one corner as he ties the others. After a few hours, he is successful, and the boat is moving.

The crown is now sitting in a pile of water, from all the rough waters the boat has hit. The man picks it up but only to grab the crab meat underneath it. 

A seagull lands. The man wonders if it will stay or it just wants his crab meat. He tosses a piece but the seagull is hesitant, worried about the man trying to harm it.

The man smiles, he is recognized.


The seagull flies off, following the path of the rest of its flock. 

The man makes haste, turning the sail to follow the seagull. The wind is in his favor for a few hours but it dies down eventually. Still seeing the seagull, he paddles with his oars as fast as he could. He starts to see a ship, heavily wrecked, in the distance.

He stops near the stern and climbs up a rope. The royal flag is still flying. There lies the once great king of Spain. He walks over to the queen, newly wed with a tiara on her head. He wipes off the blood from her wedding ring before pulling it off.

“Goodbye my child.” The man kisses his dead daughter before walking over to the king.

He leans in to lift his torso up, propping against the side of the boat. He puts the crown back onto his head.

The old man is tired. He massages his shoulders and works his sore feet till the blisters pop. The crew is starting to smell, still in the stow down underneath. A seagull lands on the man’s coat. He is trying to eat a few pieces of gold the pirates must have dropped. The man picks it up and places it over the eyes of the captain. He gets up and walks back down to his boat, rowing back towards the sunset. The seagulls flying above turn direction and start to follow him.

Bright glass became mountains, hills and herds of buffalo.  Beyond that, the sound of the ocean crashing onto the coast and among the rocks emitted an instant lull to the demonic pounding in his heart.  It was finally another today.

*One hundred twenty months and one day since they stuck the twin black holes in my chest.*

They had torn his body and mind apart; they even saved his stems cell at birth. Pain became a dull breakfast; a thing to swallow and ignore as the artificial intelligence servers across the world melded with his mind. The nanomachines regulated his metabolism, often inducing a calorie intake of many people running a marathon at the same time.  The food was sparse but sufficient to sustain his existence.

*I am ten. And today I get to talk to people.*

The lifelong trauma had melancholic effects: General Anxiety Disorder, mood swings, the need for suicide (the electro-chemical signals were suppressed almost instantly and Dalton could not die if he willed it). The existential dread that filled the minds of many middle-aged people was just a daily struggle for the young eunuch, a person neither an XY or XX. The suffering was only extinguished by the freedom to explore Catalina island as he saw fit.

Dalton had chosen his gender at age 3, when pushing everyone's buttons had led him to believe his antics deemed him a masculine being.  His grav suit zipped him around the island, chasing buffalo, sketching into paper the way hardy shrub cast a shadow on hot days. He explored the coves and fished out the mussels from which he placed into the lab coat pockets of the moderators that tracked his life signal.  They usually met in the ruins of Avalon city.  He knew they would leave their coats on one of the parameter rigs near the island and go home, only to come on the next visit, smelling of dead fish things; a smell so pungent that it would stick to them even when he knew they would throw the coats away after wearing them for only a minute or two.  They never expressed their frustration over this. They never smiled or growled at him. But they would touch his shoulder, or his hand, even his cheek, and all to remind him that he was still human. But that daylight contact could not bring him comfort in the evening.

*I hope they are blind tonight. For fuck's sake, please skip me tonight.*

The island became an uninhabitable place when twilight set in.  Dalton found solace in VR and the many doors that laid before him on the net. The floating dome, pulsating blue on the honeycomb walls of his sanctuary, which called to him against the dull, red light of his underground chamber. It was in this place that the mods would allow him to explore beyond the island.  The servers would always block his true identity or erase him whole as they saw fit.  And most especially when he issued out a cry for help.  Dalton often wondered why the mods did not talk to him about his rampant and obvious attempts to get off the island.  Today, he knew that he was a two trillion dollar project.  He's read the files, the quarterly reports, the black ops accounts that laundered the costs into the other departments of the United States hegemony. 

But tonight, there were no toll roads, no checkpoints, no metallic voices in his head to heed the foolishness of his endeavors. He could not detect the Balkan Coalition forces materializing and being decimated by the island defenses, which mobilized in order to crack open the secrets of his soul. Tonight, he was truly alone. And the world was open, uninhibited and his for the taking. But all he wanted, in all the Galaxy, in all the warp lanes, was to be heard, to be known as the soldier of fortune.

And so Dalton sat, in the dark as usual, his right hand over the console, a message above the receiver for all to see:

*My name is Dalton Ezekiel Esparza. There is a twin black hole construct in my chest, contained in stasis for the last six hundred years, and sustained by a time machine, consolidated and managed by the Human Sol Defense.  I am dying soon and the failure of my existence will destroy the trading hub on Phobos and Pluto Major.  All of your mining companies on the Kuiper belt will perish. I have no wish to see us all die. Please send help.*

Ezikiel sat back on the console, fully awaken now.  All he could think about how rivers cut into mountains.

""The magic of the school bus will keep the children docile enough to accept whatever happens as normal, but if there is a student that makes any comparison to her 'former school' that is the most likely candidate."" Dumbledore replied. Frizzle summoned suitcases from nowhere and placed them in the bus. Her pet green lizard jumped into the bus behind them and curled up on the dashboard.

""Here's your paperwork, and a list of known American wizards affiliated with the Order. Seek them out if you ever need help,"" said Arthur, handing Frizzle a plain manila folder. ""My cousin has a magical garage in America, he'll get your tuneups sorted.""

""Be vigilant, and be safe, Professor,"" said Dumbledore, shaking her hand.

""Are you kidding? Take chances! Make mistakes!"" cheered Frizzle, waving her hands in the air. Arthur and Dumbledore shot small glances at each other as she got behind the wheel. With a push of a button, and a loud crack, she was gone.

Pius stared out the window. It was unnaturally bright and sunny out today; he'd have to make a new round of arrests to keep the public spirits down. A chill ran up his spine as the fireplace burst into green flames. A moment later, the tall form of Lord Voldemort emerged.

""News, Pius?"" he rasped. Pius gulped and took a steadying breath.

""We have not managed to apprehend them, my Lord,"" he whispered, taking a series of small bows. Voldemort's anger exploded around the room, disintegrating paintings and shattering the chandelier.

""HOW? HOW, PIUS? HOW HAVE YOU FAILED TO APPREHEND A GROUP OF SCHOOLCHILDREN?!"" Pius cowered as Voldemort pointed his wand at him and flung him into the air.

""I have sent dozens of my best Aurors, my Lord. But these children and their teacher, they disappear on ""field trips"" at the first sign of trouble. Please, my Lord. Wizarding laws don't apply there, simply let us curse-"" Voldemort raised his wand again, and Pius writhed on the floor in pain.

""Americans remain blissfully unaware of the existence of magic, Pius,"" sneered Voldemort. ""Once we have taken Europe, America will be on our doorstep. Surprise is crucial.""

""My aurors have tried everything, my Lord. They afflicted one child with an illness, and the others went into his body and destroyed it. They tried flooding the town, but the kids just used the bus to open up a wetland. You need to let us use magic."" Voldemort made to raise his wand again, then sighed.

""You are useless, pathetic, and weak. You do know this, yes, Pius?"" said Voldemort in a cold voice.

""Yes, my Lord,"" replied Pius, now on his knees. Voldemort twirled his wand in the air, and a gleaming silver object materialized on the floor in front of them. Pius picked it up. ""What is it?""

""It's a metal wand, Pius. It kills anything you point it at. America is full of them. No one will think twice if you use one of these."" Pius got to his feet and bowed.

""Thank you, my Lord.""

""What are you doing, Carlos?"" asked Phoebe.

""That thing on Ms. Frizzle's desk hasn't stopped spinning since we got here this morning. I can't concentrate, I'm going to put it in the closet,"" replied Carlos.

""Carlos, maybe we shouldn't touch the Friz's stuff,"" said Arnold nervously.

""Oh, relax, Arnold,"" snapped Wanda. ""Miss Frizzle's got like a million trinkets. Like she'll notice this is gone.""

""Yeah, come on, Arnold,"" said Ralphie. ""Check it out, I bet I can toss it onto that that pile of lab coats in the closet from here."" The rest of the class cheered as Arnold hoisted the spinning device and shot it like a basketball towards the closet. It sailed over the pile of lab coats and hit the wall, shattering into pieces and falling to the floor. In that instant, the classroom door opened, and in walked Ms. Frizzle.

""Whoops,"" said Tim, smirking at Ralphie.

""Ah, good morning class!"" chirped Ms. Frizzle, her dress adorned with leaves of all shapes and sizes. The children looked at each other nervously. ""Well now, these are glum faces, aren't they? What's raining on your mood today?"" Ralphie swallowed hard and raised his hand.

""I'm...sorry, Miss Frizzle. I broke something on your desk. It was a stupid thing to do, I'm really sorry,"" Ralphie said, hanging his head. Ms. Frizzle smiled at him as she walked over to her desk.

""Well, that's alright, Ralphy! As my uncle Bernard used to say, ""If you can't fix it with duct tape, you're not using enough-"" She stopped short as she reached her desk. ""Ralphy, what did you break?""

""I-it was a spinning top, we couldn't get it to stop-,"" stammered Ralphy.

""He's a poet, now he knows it!""

""Carlos!"" groaned the class. But Ms. Frizzle's smile has faded. She pulled a small mirror out from her purse and stared into it.

""You're doing your makeup now, Ms. Frizzle?"" asked Keesha.

""What?"" asked Ms. Frizzle, distracted. ""Oh, no, just...thought I had something in my teeth. Spinach, so nutritious!"" The children glanced at each other.

""Are you alright?"" asked Tim.

""Oh, I'm fine. Say, kids. Who's up for a field trip?"" All the kids except for Arnold cheered. 

""Where are we going?"" asked Phoebe.

""Well, today, class, you're going to be learning about pathogen dispersal,"" smiled Ms. Frizzle, the pattern on her dress turning into biohazard symbols.

""Great, let's go!"" cheered Wanda.

""Actually, I'm staying behind, Wanda,"" said Ms. Frizzle, her smile fading slightly. ""There's something I have to do.""

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pius approached the school, a disillusionment charm hiding him from view. He gripped the metal wand in his hand. So far it had been easy; he had found the escaped Order member with no trouble, and armed with a Muggle metal wand he felt unstoppable. He walked through the front doors of the school, causing a metal detector to go off. The security guard scratched his head at this apparent malfunction as Pius crept along the hall to a classroom marked ""Classroom - 2nd Grade. Teacher - Ms. Frizzle."" He could hear the buzz of children talking on the other side of the door. Taking a deep breath, he gripped the metal wand tightly and burst through the door.

He was immediately greeted with a blast of water to the face. Coughing and sputtering, he saw Ms. Frizzle, sitting with a smile behind her desk. She pressed a button on a boombox, and the sound of children ceased. Pius laughed.

""That was your plan? A booby trap and a Muggle radio? Here I thought you'd be difficult to catch,"" he sneered, wiping off his face with a handkerchief. ""Tell me where the kids are and I'll make it quick.""

""No, Pius,"" replied Ms. Frizzle, standing. ""I knew you came here with a gun. Well done. I never expected a wizard to think of that.""

""The Dark Lord himself gave it to me,"" replied Pius. ""Personally. He chose me for this.""

""Well, I can't stop you,"" said Ms. Frizzle, smiling sadly. ""You'll be able to kill me before I can cast a spell. But you've already lost. So get it over with.""

""For the Dark Lord, then,"" Pius said gravely, pointing the metal wand at her.

A long pause. Pius thrust the gun towards her a couple of times. ""AVADA KEDAVRA!"" he shouted. The gun lay silent in his hand. Ms. Frizzle laughed.

""Oh goodness, you don't even know how to use it?"" she chortled, turning the gun into a weasel. ""You have to pull the trigger. Wait...you thought...oh goodness...."" Ms. Frizzle was gasping for breath between laughs now. Pius was turning several shades of purple. Enraged, he whipped his wand out from beneath his cloak. 

""This I do know how to use,"" he said menacingly. ""The Dark Lord will understand, I think...yes, I am far too valuable to him..."" He raised his arm to perform the killing curse, but froze with his wand over his head and began to convulse. ""What...did...you...do...""

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""There it is, up ahead! The brain stem! Pass me the paralyzing toxin, Arnold,"" said Ralphie. The children, clad in scuba gear, were bobbing around in what Phoebe said was 'cerebrospinal fluid'.

""Why are we injecting toxin into some guy's brain stem again?"" asked Carlos.

""Why does the Friz ask us to do anything?"" shrugged Arnold.

""At my old school...this was pretty normal, actually,"" said Phoebe.

""Weird that the Friz didn't come along. What if we got in trouble?"" pondered Tim.

""Please, Tim,"" sighed Wanda. ""We've been on like a hundred of these trips, and you just know the Friz has more planned. What could happen that we're not ready for?""

""Probably nothing that's ever actually going to happen,"" said Arnold said as they approached the brain stem.

""According to my research, we need to inject the paralyzing toxin into the medula oblongota,"" said Phoebe.

""There it is!"" said Keesha, pointing above them.

""Alright, the Friz said we'll have about a minute to escape after the injection,"" Ralphie said, jabbing the needle into the spongy mass. Immediately it began to twitch and shake. The children began swimming frantically for the bus.

""Oblongota get outta here!""

""CARLOS!""

He seemed perfectly relaxed, his buckled boots clicking on the damp cobblestones as he entered a small pub. A faded wooden sign above the door read ""Octopus and Dog."" The barman gave Dumbledore a small nod as he walked through the bar, out a back door and into a muddy alley. Almost immediately, he was greeted by a strange, ""Beep, beep."" Parked in the alley was a plain yellow school bus. His face broke into a wide smile.

""Hello, Professor Frizzle.""

""Ah, good afternoon, headmaster,"" replied the young orange-haired woman behind the wheel. ""Arthur, he's here."" Arthur Weasley emerged from under the bus on a rolling board.

""Dumbledore! Thank goodness you're here. Look at this wonderous invention!"" Arthur said excitedly. He picked up the rolling board. ""Frizzle taught me how to attach a board to wheels. What a marvelous little device!"" He gazed at the dusty wood and creaky wheels like they were a priceless painting. After a moment, Dumbledore cleared his throat.

""The bus, Arthur?""

""Oh...erm...yes,"" said Mr. Weasley, looking embarassed with himself. ""We managed to apparate a standard American school bus here. It's been fitted with every charm standard for black-market magical vehicles. Invisibility booster, transfiguration capacitor, a shrink module, and of course an undetectable extension charm on the inside of the bus itself. It'll be able to get about as far as Pluto."" As though hearing its name, the bus blinked and smiled at the two of them as Frizzle emerged. Her simple dress was a plain blue, free of the colorful pictures she liked to enchant the cloth with.

""Are you ready, Professor Frizzle?""

""As my great-aunt Helga Hufflepuff used to say, 'When the dark lord is taking over, move to America and train a muggle army!'"" replied Frizzle. Dumbledore chuckled.

""Too true, Professor. And thank you for doing this. I didn't know who else to send.""

""Happy to do it, Professor. How's my Muggle Studies replacement doing?"" asked Frizzle. 

""She's taking an extended leave of absence,"" Dumbledore said, clearing his throat and quickly changing the subject. ""You're sure you'll be alright? The Ministry will come after you, you know.""

""Let them come. As my second cousin Ernest Flumple said, 'Why the hell are wizards so stupid?' An army of children armed with basic scientific principles will make short work of the dark lord,"" Frizzle proclaimed with a wide smile.

""Well, yes, but I do believe that Harry-"" Dumbledore started. Frizzle laughed derisively.

""Harry? Hah! I'd think he was a Muggle-hater if I didn't know better. You know in his first year, he complained about every Muggle-observing field trip we took? I swear, if there's a single kid in my new classroom that complains about field trips I'll make him the *subject* of every single one.""

Dumbledore sighed, ""Well, alright. But be on the lookout. We've gotten word that a wizarding family escaped to the town you're headed to, and their daughter went to Durmstrang.""

""Months after rejecting her proposal to teach science and mathematics in Hogwarts, she resurfaced at this location."" 

The minister gave an exasperated sigh and rubbed his temples. 

""She sent a self-righteous howler proclaiming that since we don't care about proper child education, she would find people that do. It didn't even burst into flames afterwards, it's just shouting **the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell** over and over.""

Arthur Weasley shuffled uncomfortably in his seat. 

""Er... so she just wants to teach young muggles math and science? I'm sorry sir, but I don't see how that justifies a man hunt..."" 

""Normally you'd be correct. But it isn't her goals, it's her methods we have a problem with."" 

The images on the mirror shifted to show a school bus puttering down lane. Suddenly the yellow metal shifted and flowed like water, and a pair of wings and massive turbines sprouted from the vehicle. The turbines lit with a roar, and the bus took off into the stratosphere.

Arthurs mouth hung agape. He couldn't contain himself. 

""Do you understand what she just did? That wasn't a simple flying enchantment like what's applied to broomsticks. She actually manipulated the bus until it was flight capable! She'd need to understand advanced aeronautics, then translate it into her magic!""

""I'm glad you think she's impressive, because everyone who tried to disenchant her howler letter agrees. The old masters can't match her talents because she's gone and invented brand new methods.                                        
It's a mess. Since she isn't a dark wizard, I can't sic the Auror's on her. My reputation would get dragged through the mud if I send them to arrest an innocent elementary school teacher."" 

The door swung open, and a young woman carrying a brown tweed suit entered the office. 

""So now the task falls to you, Arthur. You have some experience with ""muggle magic"" and you might be one of the few capable of disabling that beeping monstrosity. You'll need to put that on, by the way."" 

""What for?"" 

The minister reached into his desk and tossed him a polished red apple. 

""We sent the grade 5 teacher on a little sabbatical. Someplace tropical, Lord knows she needed it.

He's arguably a Mary Sue character who gets everything his way with little to no conflict or difficulty, and is kind of an arrogant little brat who thinks consequences don't apply to him.

It's sad, because I mostly agree with most of the the ideals in the story. Death is something to be avoided, if possible, eradicated. The pursuit of knowledge and double checking that knowledge should be the perogative over personal goals. 

And with the obvious spoiler spoiler spoiler as to who spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler his personality quirks do make some sense spoiler spoiler spoiler, but even then the character is a shitty character designed more to progress the story and the protagonist down a certain path than a character that could exist in this world, which, as the author keeps reminding us in the early chapters, wishes JK would declare somehow semi-canon as an AU story he could publish.

I can't be too salty about this story, as it tries to teach pretty basic ideas about science and how to think in a Socratic manner to ensure that what you think is correct, but man it drops the ball on a storytelling front, I feel.

That was Harry's name for his second-grade teacher. Everyone else called her ""Ms. Frizzle."" But then, they didn't know about the brainwashing chemicals she added to their drinks at lunch each day. Nor about the implants that had been surgically added to their brains at the beginning of the year. Nor about the mind control experiment that they were all a part of. (At least, he assumed all of that was true, because otherwise how could everyone believe such ridiculous and impossible things!?)

Harry had tried to explain this to his parents one autumn afternoon after arriving home late due to - as he had put it - a MASS HALLUCINATION EFFECT reminiscent of a CULT! She'll probably have us committing a suicide pact by the end of the year at this rate! HOW ELSE DO YOU EXPLAIN WHY ALL MY CLASSMATES THINK THEY WERE IN MY DIGESTIVE SYSTEM TODAY?

Harry's parents thought it was an elaborate fart joke.

But today, everything would change. Today was Science Fair Day. And Harry had the best experiment.

""Who wants to go first?"" Ms. Frizzle asked.

""Ooh me, pick me!"" said Harry. It was the first time he had shown any enthusiasm for anything the entire year.

""Okay...Harry! What have you prepared for us?""

Harry walked up to the whiteboard. ""This,"" he said, ""this is not real."" And he proceeded to write out equations. Conservation of energy, relativity, quantum mechanics,....the school bus could not exist. The ""field trips"" could not be real. ""We,"" he concluded, ""are part of a high-level government-funded mind control experiment. We're a test. They're using us because our brains aren't fully formed, and they want to show that if they can make us believe something as ridiculous as the idea that our school bus is magic, then they can convince anyone in all of Britain of everything!""

When he was finished, he gave a bow. Ms. Frizzle was looking at him. The entire class was looking at him.

""Well..."" Phoebe said, ""at my old school, it's true, we were unable to violate conservation of energy.""

""I don't want to go on another field trip ever again,"" said Arnold.

Dorothy Ann had been furiously flipping through a book. ""According to my research, Harry's correct!""

""That's enough!"" said Ms. Frizzle. ""Class, it's time for a field trip! Imperius!"" As always, everyone's faces went blank. It was their programmed, ""do as I say"" response. Harry wasn't sure what the ""Imperius"" part meant. Probably it was just some nonsense word to make sure that no one else would be able to replicate the effect by accident.

Within seconds, Harry and Ms. Frizzle were alone in the classroom. ""Harry,"" said the teacher, ""you're expelled.""

""Yipee!""

""Obliviate""

----

""And that's how Harry accidentally released the launch codes to Britain's nuclear silos to the Russians as his science fair project. As a result, we have no choice but to expel him.""

Harry's parents looked at him. Harry gulped. He had enjoyed his time as a member of Ms. Frizzle's class, but somehow everything good just had to come to an end. ""Well,"" said Harry's dad, ""at least he showed a remarkable ability to hack high-level government systems. Maybe he can work for them some day.""",RheingoldRiver

Do you know how inappropriate that is?!"" Shalzor shouted at the cloud of puffy hair before him. He had been searching for this woman for a long time and finally had her at the end of his wand.

""Oh, ho ho!"" The woman heartily chuckled ""now class, today we're going to learn about the mating habits of unicorns!"" She ignored Shalzor as she spoke to an uncomfortable group of children.

""Uh, miss Frizz.. who's the guy with the beard?"" A dumb looking child in a red hat hesitantly spoke ""and why is he pointing a glowing stick at us?""

""Oh, ho ho"" she chuckled again her face slowly changing from it's familiar happy tone to something more menacing ""well class! He's from a place called the ministry of magic! They're unjustly controlling the wizard world to keep you all ignorant to the wonders of magic!"" 

The class seemed to be getting more confused by the moment and fear was starting to slip into the air as Zalthor spoke again.

""You can't just steal a maguffin and go teach muggles just because you got rejected to teach at Hogwarts!"" He shouted, getting more frustrated by the minute. 

""Ohhhhh ho ho!"" The red haired witch chuckled louder her face growing more and more grim. ""Do you know why they wouldn't accept me?! I lose one class full of students to a dragon's digestive tract! One class and suddenly I'm unfit to teach!?"" 

She was practically foaming at the mouth now and the children were moving towards the back of the bus. Zalthor raised his wand level with the red haired mad woman's face and thought about simply using a spell to end this situation, but years of keeping his magic hidden from muggles made him hesitant. 

""Can we just go back to the school Miss Frizz..?"" One child with thick glasses spoke quietly from his position huddled behind the others. ""NO!"" She shouted swinging around and drawing her own wand to point it at the child with a flash of light at the tip. 

""AVADA KEDAVERA!""

The red haired woman fell to the ground stiff, a green smoke flowing around her gently. 

""I'm sorry, children.. Muggles can not know of magic."" 

With that, Zalthor raised his wand again.

""... so how long have you been teaching?""

""Oh, ever since graduation. It's always been my passion."" She gave a good natured, bubbling laugh. The kind that made you want to laugh along with it. Arthur smiled, then felt a pang of guilt. 

""But what about you? You've had quite the impressive career, Mr. West!"" 

""Mhhm? I'm not sure I would call a few years of high school impressive, Ms Frizzle."" 

She laughed again. 

""True, but you're also a champion of equal rights! Defender of those who can't defend themselves! A role model for wizards everywhere. The world has a lot to thank your family for."" 

She smiled and sipped her coffee as Arthur choked on his.

""Also, that bit with the exploding toilets was very well done. Washrooms should be a haven of security and sanitation.""  

Arthur reached for his want before a strange hissing sound stopped him. He turned around and saw a portly green lizard perched on a chesterfield. 

""*Lacerta magna!*""

The creature began to swell in size until it was as large as a Clydesdale. 

""Not very stealthy, is it?"" Arthur muttered. 

Ms Frizzle laughed. 

""Very few species of chameleon change color for camouflage! Usually they reflect mood and temperature."" 

As she said this, the lizard began changing into a grim shade of black. 

""They can, however, launch their tongues at over 41 g's."" 

Arthur dove for cover, but the tongue wasn't aimed at him. A new hole was in the side of the school house, and both Frizzle and the lizard were gone. 

He watched as a bus in the parking lot sprouted twin rotors and climbed into the air. She was as good as gone. 

A loud honk shocked him into attention. A busted up blue ford anglia was parked on the grass. It honked again, and the door swung open. There was no driver. 

Arthur shouted ""*Machina Reparo!*"" as he dove into the seat. Metal bent back into shape, and glass from the broken wall flew into place. The engines purred.

A mad light was in Arthur's eye.

"[WP] Your grandfather, the King, made a contract with a dragon to last for 50 years. Now, you are on the throne and the dragon has come to collect his payment.",urbanflora,"**Rekindling the Old Flame**

Lord Florian Promethean read the contents of the letter over and over, thinking he'd missed something. But no matter how many times his eyes scanned the words, no matter how he held the parchment in his claws, they remained the same. The truth of his kingdom's prosperity was rendered before him in old ink. An entity known as Luxion, The Catalytic Cinder in the Cosmic Dark, had burned in the sky above Maize since before the coronation of Lord Alban, the first Promethean and founder of Maize Colony. Without the warmth of that celestial force to compensate for the dim red glare of Syrinx, the colony would still be limited to the deep tunnels that now comprised the ""Undercity"" of Maize, and the domed castles that dotted the once-barren surface of the dwarf-world.

But now, as Alban's letter stated, the fire was fading, and Luxion was coming to collect what it was owed. However, it was not truly the end of the world, as the letter continued, for the payment had already been arranged, and Luxion was all too willing to renew the contract. What the ""contract"" entailed was not present in the letter, but as the sun grew dimmer, a great chill began to settle in. Whatever the terms of the contract were, Florian was eager to accept them. Anything would be preferable to the cold doom that awaited them otherwise.

On ashen wings, the dragon soared through the cloud cover, still smouldering from the fifty Earth-cycles of facilitating fusion in the Skycore. Florian watched in awe as it drifted down from the darkened heavens, before watching it settle in the courtyard. ""Prometheans!"" the dragon shouted upwards. ""The time has come to renew this contract! Don't dawdle, for the world grows colder still"". Florian made haste to the elevator, dressed warm for the growing cold outside. But as he entered the courtyard, the heat radiating from the dragon made it feel like a midsummer's day. ""Now, son..."" Luxion boomed. ""Let us discuss the terms of this contract-""

""Luxion!"" A greying yet graceful woman, garbed in the raiments of the Dragonfire Church, stepped into the courtyard, eyes gleaming with a warm fondness. ""OH. Ah, go- good evening Erin."" The warmth faltered as mild disappointment crept into the High Priestesses heart. ""Good evening?"" she questioned. ""It's been fifty years, and all you can say to me is 'good evening'?! I don't know what I expected, but-"" ""Mother?"" Florian was perplexed by this development. ""You know the Sun personally?"" ""What do you think?!"" Erin retorted. ""Who do you think you got your scales from?"" Florian was taken aback as things finally started to click. Growing up, he'd assumed that the late Lord Alban was his father and, fool that he was, assumed that his own reptilian features and affinity for blood magick were programmed at the Academy, as designer children were all the rage back on the Core Worlds. But now the truth unfolded before his laggard mind.

""Wait, you never figured it out?"" Erin gasped, realising how much she had overestimated her son. ""My child, I thought you knew?"" ""I truly am a fool"", Florian sighed in awe. ""I thought I was a test-tube child, but I was a legitimate dragon all of this time?! I thought the rumours were just mad speculation!"" Luxion sighed, lightly saddened by how dull his boy had turned out. ""It's true, son. Surprise as it may be, I am actually your father"". ""Oh gods, so that means-"" Florian cut himself short, and tried to suppress the image dancing on the edge of his mind. ""Yes. You were a product of the ritual that enabled this contract in the first place"". ""AUGH!"" the king cried out, trying his hardest to un-think the thought of his parents performing the ""ritual"". ""I could seriously have done without that image!""

""Wrong as it may seem, child, it is true"". Erin confirmed her son's fears. ""Your grandfather called Luxion to the colony, and agreed to the terms of the contract to make this world habitable. One of those terms was establishing a link between the people and Luxion. As a virgin 'sacrifice', I was offered up to facilitate the bond, and through the ritual my soul was linked to Luxion's"". ""We did not expect the ritual to yield a child, but I am proud that it did, my boy"". Luxion smiled. ""Though it is still my regret that, due to my end of the contract, I wasn't there to raise you. If I could have lit up the sky AND been a proper father to you, I would have. But I like to think I was still there in my own way..."" The dragon paused briefly, before continuing. ""But let's get back to business. There is a valid reason why we explained the details of your conception, that being that the ritual performed fifty cycles ago is how we will be able to renew the contract"".

""Surely you jest, Luxion!"" Erin appeared vexed and perturbed at what her ""groom"" implied. ""Am I not enough for you anymore? You need ANOTHER virgin to bond with?!"" ""Will you still be there in fifty years?"" Luxion retorted. ""I know, it sounds cold of me to say it, but I am not so sure. If you should pass away before my return, who would be there to link the prayers of the people to me? The energy present in their prayer allows me to keep the Flame burning as bright as it does, but it also allows me to survive the volatile conditions of the Skycore itself! If the link between the people and I were broken while I was inside the Skycore, the flames would consume me entirely! And then who would there be to keep the Flame burning?"" The grim reminder of her mortality left Erin chilled and unsettled, but understanding of the gravity of this world's situation. As much as it pained her, she agreed to the plans laid out before them.

""...we will make the preparations"", she solemnly declared. ""We shall seek a martyr for this cause. I am sure there will be a pure Sister willing to make the same sacrifice I did. Just... show her the same tenderness you showed me, understand?"" ""I fully intend to, Erin"", Luxion confirmed, smiling reassuringly. ""It is only fitting that I do so. Such a communion needn't be unpleasant or scarring, after all..."" The dragon gave a sly, knowing wink, and Erin rolled her eyes. Luxion hadn't changed one bit. ""OKAY, I'm going to get the hydroleum ready"", Florian declared, not wishing to hear any more of this. ""That is the payment you were seeking, is it not?"" ""That's the stuff, son"", Luxion confirmed. ""With what you've stockpiled, it should be enough for another fifty years"". ""Indeed, indeed."" The king disappeared into the castle, ready to set the plan into motion.

""I know this is hard for you, Erin"", Luxion sighed. ""But the sacrificial virgin is not your 'replacement'. I don't think anyone could truly replace you. Instead, think of her as an apprentice!"" ""An apprentice..."" The notion appealed to Erin. Luxion nodded appreciatively, glad that she understood. ""While she would, if we are being technical, be the one to carry the torch when you no longer can, she would be what you invest in her, what you teach her. By educating her in your ways and nurturing her to be as wise as you, even after death you would, in a way, govern through her"".

**""But until that day,"" Erin pondered. ""I will ensure that we all keep the Flame burning.""**",DrSmirnoffe
"[WP] Your grandfather, the King, made a contract with a dragon to last for 50 years. Now, you are on the throne and the dragon has come to collect his payment.",urbanflora,"Amidst the splendor his rule brought, the king grinned.

As far as history shows, the world has been a harsh and unforgiving place. On a landscape trodden with hooves that would make an elephant whimper and skies beaten to a paste by leathery wings, humans had barely managed to eek out an evolutionary foothold. Progress was slow over the generations, as intercommunication between the burgeoning settlements that managed to stay hidden long enough was nigh impossible. 

It wasn't that the monsters were inherently malevolent. It's just that they were, ya know, monsters. Spiders trap insects in webs, ant-lions set traps, and dragons burn down human villages. It's just the way things work. 

But there were a lot of fucking dragons.

Slowly, a tiny nothing on the outskirts of the Hashidii forest gradually developed into a bustling city, protected by the concealment of a treetop canopy over a mile high. This settlement over others prospered thanks to the unique properties of the leaves they settled beneath, which allowed nutrients vital to plants and animal alike to pass through them to the forest floor, while remaining opaque enough to shield them from the soaring Dragons. 

With added people, came added collaboration. Added knowledge, power, research and of course, trade. But more of coursively, the desire to control this new found avenue of power. 

Thus comes in King Proprietii I. It's unfair to call his rise to power meteoric, because that'd be an insult to how quickly an influential alchemical blacksmith rallied an entire metropolis around his lust for the blood of Dragons. It was an easy task; it's easy to fear the boogeyman when he's real. When you can hear him soar past at any hour. When the tales of lost settlements and burnt lives aren't the things of fairtytales, but of refugees. 

And so, Carpathia prepared for war.

Implements were forged. Iron was wrought. Alloys resistant to acid, fire, ice and the like were created and special units were outfitted with equipment designed to encounter that which they were hunting. They were prepared to be meticulous, and deadly. They rounded up all the stories of those who had witnessed a dragon attack and devised plans, likely attack patterns, and trained against them. 

No human had ever attempted to fight a dragon before. There was simply no point. Would you take a swing at the moon?

And the warriors rode off. By the thousands, battalions of skilled men and women pointed themselves to the various ends of the continent, tasked with seeking out each of their individual dragon types and eliminating them.

The Crimson Dynamos, in shining red, led the forefront of the military. They are the expeditionary force, their armor an alloy of copper and strontium offering a solid layer of protection against any of the threats they might encounter. 

The Azure Devils, clad in arctic furs and armor tinted light green by malachite are sent to the frozen wastes of the land. There they will attempt to ambush the (believed to be) few in number but disastrously fearsome Blue Dragons. Everybody knows the dragons are not sentient, but stories say they seem to take a great deal of enjoyment from freezing victims solid and then shattering the ghastly sculpture. Without eating any.

The Shrews, chosen for their agility and resourcefulness. Their armor is dull and earthy. Due to a rather fortuitous accident where a metallurgist kicked a tub of Golem sculpting clay into a cast, it was discovered that simple earth makes for a very effective anti-acid armor. They are sent to the swamps to hunt down the slithery and quick Green Dragons. 

The Black Dawn. Only the most skilled fighters are adorned with the obsidian enhanced black armor of the oncoming Dawn. They're the best because they must be, for they hunt the largest and fiercest of the dragons. The Great Red Dragon. The human can only hope that the armor they've clad these soldiers in can help them stand up against the white hot heat of their breath. 

And then of course, there was the Violaceous Victors (the king was the cocky sort). Clad in purple so dark it was almost black, a combination of all the protections possible, the great King's Guard unit sought out the fabled Gold Dragon. The human's beliefs in regards to the dragon's nature were remarkably contradictory; while they all collectively agreed that they are no more intelligent than a rabid dog, they also bought into the myth that a great Gold Dragon ruled over the dragon from on high, who had final say on whatever manners arose in Dragon politics.

The city had never seen a celebration comparable to the launching of the Great Dragon Fleet. Every able bodied person who could partake in the training had volunteered with ferocious nationalism. Colors lined the street, children ran screaming goodbyes and goodlucks as father and mother saddled off to wage war with the world. The parade of this army was that of exodus. 

Not a one of them returned. None except the king.

Bloodied and bruised, he declared his nation safe upon his arrival. 

""Through the glory and honor of our warriors, we have removed every last dragon from this plane of existence. But it came with a price."" 

His voice echoed out over the crowd of his stunned but faithful and adoring subjects as he stood upon a fountain in the city center, his head raised high for a mom who supposedly just traveled dozens of miles through the wilderness by himself. 

""Our warriors fought to the very last, until there was no one left to fight anymore. As their missions came to an end and the corners of our home were almost entirely scrubbed of the infernal wyrm, they each exercised their individual and collective ingenuity and cleverness to come upon evidence of the fabled Golden Dragon. And our brave warriors followed their clues and as an army we came together on the golden plains of Shkl'eh. 

What was it we found? That the tale of the Golden Dragon proved true!"" The King, appearing to simper almost, collected phlegm in his throat and spat ""And as that wretched beast witnessed our war band it let out a cry that rang across the dragon world's ears. Every last remaining one of the lizards appeared lumbering in the sky, blackening the sun with their forms.""

The poor crowd, growing larger by the syllable, lost in amazement, gasped.

""And on that day, our nation bellowed in triumph and wept in remorse in one breath."" The great leader, clad in purple and gold, hung his head dramatically. ""For, our warriors made sure that that day that every last dragon lay dead upon the battlefield, but they proved fearsome, and took all of our numbers with them as they die. And ME! YOUR KING! I turned to face this Shining beast and I slew her where she stood. With her final screech, the last Dragon lay DEAD!""  

After years of peace, on his deathbed, Proprietii demanded Carpathia's protective canopy be chopped down, offering his subjects true sunlight for the first time. There was much rejoicing. 

And so, peace and prosperity had became the status quo in the land of Carpathia for decades. Young Corwin had heard the tales of his grandfather's great march against the dragons his entire life, and he couldn't have been more proud. A strong willed child, he understood his destiny to rule from a very early age, resulting in a pragmatic man, proud of his father's achievements and looking to stamp his own name in a few places of the manuscript. 

Today, he held a feast. It was a monumental day in Carpathia's history; it was the
50th anniversary of the day Proprietii returned from his great campaign, and his own 25th birthday. King Corwin I's eyes glazed over as he watched the bustle of the festival before him. The flirting, the cavorting, the nods the winks; it's interesting how overstimulating a brain addicted to stimuli can render it mush. He reached beside him and took the hand of his Queen. Queen Adorania. She is what made him the most unique king of all.

King Corwin I wasn't remarkable for his etiquette, or his skill on the field of battle, his strong back nor his aptitude in playing the Great Game. No, Corwin was unique because he married his queen for love. Brown curled tresses fell down upon olive skin that traced back up to green eyes that were only for him. And it's a good thing too, because Kings aren't exactly known for sharing well. 

A breeze drifted through the courtyard. A breeze that carried the smell of death and mildew. It wasn't subtle. The music gradually faded to nothing and the chatter fell to silence; it was clear something was coming.

There was no boom from over the horizon to describe, but there was a crack. A shot of rainbow snapped across the sky and in the wake of light that shouldn't have been there stood the reflection of a Dragon. A reflection of the largest, most magnificent dragon anybody had ever born witness to, past or present. Not that they were there to say so, but it was generally agreed upon by everybody who saw this with their own eyes that it was probably true.

""Hello, young ruler"" It hissed in an alarmingly soothing voice consisting of chimes that went off in your brain but never quite reached your ears. 

""I believe you've been expecting me""

Silence can be deafening in the right circumstances.

Corwin slowly stood from his chair. Only at the last possible moment did Adorania let his hand leave her grasp.

""You dare address me so beast? To interrupt my own celebration? The end of your kind? What is the meaning of this?""

He impressed even himself in maintaining his royal pomp during this most unexpected of occasions.

The dragon looked unimpressed. ""Well, this is awkward. You see little nothing man, your eldest of Kin, Proprietii, made a promise to me many years ago. And I've come to see he makes good on it today"".

Corwin snarled. ""My grandfather was a great and wise man, he'd make no deal with you!""

**WOW I'M OUT OF ROOM PART 2 BELOW**",Bodongs
"[WP] Your grandfather, the King, made a contract with a dragon to last for 50 years. Now, you are on the throne and the dragon has come to collect his payment.",urbanflora,"The flickering image of a dragon was growing frustrated, and the chaotic refraction patterns across her surface were showing it. ""Do you not find your golden age a bit too convenient? Do you truly believe you happen to be living in a world of unadulterated prosperity and nothing more?"" 

Corwin stammered. He stared. The Dragon bellowed a laugh that is only called a laugh because to truly describe the noise this fractured image of a creature ejected would require a tongue too alien for this.

""How are you here?! My grandfather slaughtered your whole race!""

The sound repeated, but this time somehow sounded more genuine.

""Is that what you believe small pink puppet? That your assembled warriors with their fancy colored armors and pointy helmets marched across the realms and defeated us? Is THAT what your history books tell you? No child, no. Me and my kind tore every last one of you apart as they approached. With your pointy spikes and elemental armors. It was a cute attempt, but you were fools for trying.""

Corwin drew his sword and pointed it at the reflection, truly not sure what he'd do with it if it came down to a physical altercation. 

""You're lying!""

""Your grandfather didn't slay the Golden Dragon, he found it to BEG FOR HIS LIFE. Oh, to think I get to savor the glory of delivering your fate to you myself. You see, when your grandfather realized exactly how outmatched his forces were, he tapped into an ancient source of magic he had kept hidden. This magic was of no use to himself, for it was too powerful to use a human as a vessel.""

The dragon grinned as well as a mirror dragon could and flexed it's holographic wings and let escape a volumetric gas.

""But to us he offered it. To us he offered his greatest secret, in exchange for his life and the chance to return home a hero to his people"" the dragon snickered.

""LIAR!"" Corwin screamed as he charged from his seat, the pleas of Adorania barely audible behind him. He closed the gap between him and the Dragon with remarkable speed, but by the time his blade swung down, the image was simply missing. Corwin tripped over himself, and ended up tumbling onto his back.

The dragon continued speaking, as if not noticing the distraction. ""And that secret was"" and she hissed this with particular dread ""immortality. Humans have long since lost the ways of magic, but not us, no, we've kept our primal channels open to the energy of the world. But we're not capable of creating it the way you foolish pink piles are. Constantly stirring up the most immense force of all without any regard for the power you wield.""

Corwin rose to his feet, aware he is not going to be capable of inflicting bodily harm on this being. ""What do you mean..."" he let slip through his teeth.

""Humans. Pathetic. Think about it. The most powerful force of all, the most obvious magic you surround yourself with yet never seem to question the power of?"" The dragon loomed over Corwin, beating it's translucent wings in his face. ""Think...what can I take that you had to create...""

Corwin's head shot towards his chair. His eyes grew wide. ""No...""

""YES."" The mirror dragon took the pose of something about to dart towards the royal seating, but rather than travel there, the world blinked out of existence for a moment, and when it returned, Adorania was entirely engulfed by the visage of the dragon. She screamed. The world shook. 

Corwin, torn apart by rage, devastation, loss, and grief, tried to keep his balance as the world was torn asunder around him. A voice filled the air.

""Where did you think the crops got their nourishment? Our flesh. The clouds, their rain? Our tears. All the favorable winds you've enjoyed? Our breath. And so, with the sacrifices we made to your well being, you shall return to us. Forever.""

The planet screamed. The earth cracked. Bones shifted. All around them, the skeletons of fallen dragons began to crawl from the earth, screeching their voiceless screams as they immediately took to the skies and began their hunt. The canopy was gone. The promise was fulfilled. Love had won the war. ",Bodongs

""Ms. Paterson?""

""Oh..OH! I uh... I don't really know, I mean, I...""

He sighed as he leaned back in his chair, lightly tapping a pencil tip on the edge of his desk. ""Ms. Paterson, are you quite certain that you're interested in this endeavour?""

""I.. I think so, I just need some.. you know, some time, to-""

""Ms. Paterson, we've been going over this for the last,"" he checked his wristwatch tiredly, ""two hours now. Perhaps it would be best if you re-scheduled for a different day.""

""No!"" She squeaked as she sat upright stiffly. ""It took me 5 years to get this appointment, I can't afford to wait another 5!""

""Then,"" he said while he pushed the folder towards her again, nodding at the series of checkboxes on the side of it, ""I would recommend that you be a little more decisive in the matter. I understand how important these decisions are, but time is a factor.""

Ms. Paterson sighed defeatedly, slumping a little forward as her eyes caught the first section of the sheet again. ""Okay...""

""Good. Now that you've seen the overview.. again.. perhaps you'd like to start with a name."" He slid the pencil over to her side where she stared at it for a moment before taking it into her hand. ""There. Was that so difficult? Hm, now what name have you decided on?"" He peered closer where she'd scribbled.

""Leslie.""

He nodded. ""Very good. I presume this is for a girl, then."" He checked off a box just below where she'd written the name. ""What key attributes of Leslie do you wish to assign the most points into?""

""Artistry, Imagination, Agility, Strength.""

""Interesting mix."" He pondered that. ""Are you looking for a min/max distribution, or evenly altered?

""Min/Max, please."" The woman glanced over her shoulder for a moment at the door before turning back to face him. ""Bit more focus on Imagination over the rest though, please.""

""Ah, making ourselves a little Van Gogh, are we?"" He chuckled as she stared at him. ""She should have a wonderful beginning. Are you planning on raising her in the city or the country?""

""A little of both - city first, country when she's around 9 or ten, I think?"" Ms. Paterson's voice pitch climbed a bit at the end, and the man shrugged.

""Fine, fine. Sounds like a lovely start to a young life so far. First love?""

""Uh... a little boy around her age named Jesse that lives on a farm with his siblings and father and mother.""

""Well that certainly is a decisive and specific set of circumstances, but I think we can manage that."" He turned to the drawer next to him and pulled out a second manilla envelope file that was at least twice as thick. After leafing through several pages he pulled one out that was mostly filled out. ""Ah, here we go, a boy named Jesse. Interestingly enough, he is to have an infatuation with one of his teachers, but that can easily be worked around."" He made several marks on one of the pages.

""Is he a good child? I don't want my Leslie winding up with someone who is destined to be a rebel.""

""No,"" he said as he read further down the paragraph, ""according to this he is supposed to go through several trials and tribulations, the worst of which that will define his character should happen around the same age as these two meet. It shouldn't affect yours at all. Interestingly enough, his Imagination and Artistry are actually quite high, although his parents elected for more of a well-rounded approach so they aren't nearly as high as yours.""

""I don't mind."" She bit her lower lip for a moment as the man finished writing, then slid her folder on top of that again. 

""Well, as you know, we can clearly define any major events although the details are left to be randomized to help add spontaneity to most interactions. Are there any others that you might like to add to further spice your child's life?""

""Only one more."" Ms. Paterson suddenly took on a very serious tone as she leaned forward to face the man at eye level, much to his surprise. ""She must die a terribly tragic death that leaves a strong impact to the betterment of her would-be lover.""

""My word..."" He looked at her wide-eyd, feeling a little sweat trickling down his face at her intensity. ""...after all this, you would cut the life of someone so gifted so short?""

""Yes."" She sat back and folded her arms across her chest. ""It is how it must be.""

""Ms. Paterson, that is certainly the darkest request we've had in quite some time."" He grinned, writing furiously on the page in front of him.

""She must be the daughter of parents that are tired of city life as well.""

The man stopped in his tracks. ""...this isn't for your child, then?""

""No."" She shook her head.

He rolled his eyes but finished the optional section of the paperwork, then pulled out a larger rubber stamp. ""I should have guessed. All the signs were there. Done."" He slapped the page with the stamp and handed the entire folder to the woman, ignoring the sparkling in her eyes. ""As you know the process can take up to a year, and then you will be given access via hidden monitor to any and all aspects of the child's life as you see fit. As is conditional with people of your type,"" he looked over his glasses at her, ""you are forbidden to directly interfere with any aspect of their life or parentage, nor are you to engage anyone else to directly interact. You may choose to do what you will with this information.

""Thank you."" She quickly snagged the stack of paperwork and before he could utter another word was out the door. 

The man leaned back in his chair with a grunt, then slid the other folder back into the drawer. With a sigh he dabbed his brow with a handkerchief, then began typing on his keyboard, muttering.

"[WP] There's a hot new App it will tell you how anyone will die. And it is always 100% accurate no matter they try to avoid it. There's one weird problem though. Anyone born after the creation of the App only comes up as ""Suicide""",BiagioLargo,"YES! I XPOSTED THIS STORY TO NOSLEEP 1/3

""Get that fucking thing out of my face!"" I screamed and shoved Ronnie's shoulder. The phone flung out of his hand and missed the hard pavement by a few inches. 

""Hey! You're an assbrigadier, you know that?"" He wiped the spittle from the corner of his mouth and ran over to pick up his fancy smart phone. I hate those things. 
""Do you know how much I payed for this?!"" he angrily called from over his bent down figure. 

""You know, Ronnie, I couldn't care less. Those things are absolutely pointless.""

He stood up and began an exaggerated march back over to me. Ronnie was a bit of a Drama Queen sometimes. ""POINTLESS?!"" he screeched. A Drama Queen, but I still loved 'em. He was my best friend, and his exaggerated flamboyancy complimented my own personality which has often been referred to as ""dead-pan"". 

""Yes. Utterly. Between all the fancy calenders for when you're too lazy to write it in a planner, and GPS for when you're too lazy to look at a map, and that annoying woman's voice for when you're too lazy to do your own god damned research....and....Flappy Bird. For when you're......for when you're just a stupid bimbo idiot!!!!"" I crossed my arms because I couldn't think of anything better to say. ""Ron, it's all just bells and whistles allowing them to get away with charging you an arm and a leg. Anything you can do on that phone you can do without it. It's like people have forgotten how to live without them.""

Ron nodded a bit. He always agrees that I have a valid point when we argue about smart phones, but he still likes to make a show out of any bit of confrontation. ""Yeah?! Well...your stupid brick-brownie of a track phone isn't going to be able to get you out of a shitty situation like my phone would. One day you're going to end up lost in the middle of the grand canyon and you're going to WISH you had a GPS app. You'll call me and say 'Ronnie!! I'm so sorry, can you please use your awesome and expensive phone to help me find my way out of here?!' And I'll say SURE, NICHOLAS! BUT FIRST YOU HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO MY FACE!!!!"" Ronnie took a deep breath. 

We both stared at each other for a few seconds and then busted out laughing. I pushed him playfully and he halfheartedly said ""I'm serious, Nick!""

""In any case, show me what new App you've gotten this time. I'm actually genuinely curious right now."" Sometimes, though I'd never admit it to Ron, I did find the Apps he showed me fascinating and incredibly cool. A lot of them were duds, though. Especially the free ones. 

""Well....""(he paused for dramatic flair) ""It's called 'Your Time'. He points the screen at me and I see a little square button with a skull on it. 

""Oooohhhh spppoooOOooOooppppy!"" I said in my best ghost voice. ""You didn't pay for it, did you?!""

""I haven't even told you what it does!!"" Ronnie snapped. ""And...yes...this time I payed.""

""Aw jeeze Ro-""

""BUT!!.....BUT.....It was only 5 dollars, and it's been the number one trending App for the past week. It was created 6 years ago but I guess no one's heard of it till recently. Strange, huh? EVERYONE has it."" He clicked on the button to open it.

""Awww RON! You fell for one of those shit apps again."" For a good 3 weeks Ronnie had believed that the x-ray app could really see your skeleton- before I informed him using multiple cited sources that we currently do not have the technology to carry around x-ray machines on our phones, and if we did, we'd be in a lot of trouble. Plus the government would never allow such a thing.

""Ok, big guy. Big guy who always does his research. How about YOU do the research for this app and I'll let that do the talking for you since I OBVIOUSLY never have any idea what I'm talking about.""

Ronnie pointed the phone camera at himself and after a few seconds of fancy graphics a screen popped up that said ""**Overweight from poor food. Heart Attack**.""

""Aw man"" I said. ""It tells you the reason but it doesn't even tell you what age, huh? Do me!"" 

Ronnie pointed the phone at me and the same animated graphic played before the screen popped up. 

""**Knowing too much. Blunt Trauma**""

I stared at it for a long time. Ronnie turned the screen so he could read. ""Blunt Trauma?!?!?! AHAHHAHA...But that first part: KNOWING TOO MUCH?!?!??! HOLY SHIT. That DOES NOT surprise me!!"" Ronnie doubled over and snorted with laughter. 

""See?"" he gasped. ""This thing's good. And it's fun. See, back in our folk's day they'd pay 5 dollars for a board game or some lame toy, right? It's entirely justifiable for me to have bought this for our entertainment!""   

""Yeah, you got me there."" I said.
Blunt Trauma, though? Knowing too much? That didn't sit right with me. ""Hey, you don't think that's a little weird do you? the ""knowing too much"" bit?

""Naaaawwww"" Ronnie cooed. ""Besides, just a stupid App right, Big guy?""

I went home that day feeling a bit uneasy for some reason. It was silly to be affected so deeply from a stupid App. I did what I usually do when I feel uneasy about things: I research. I was going to school for Forensics Investigation. Researching and investigating are the few things in life that bring me true happiness.

I started with the basics. I went online to read the reviews given by others who'd purchased the thing. 5 stars. Every review. A perfect score. 
Statistically, there had to have been someone somewhere who wasn't happy with the App....glitching, bugs, or just some kid who took it too seriously and was disappointed when the thing was wrong. Nope. Perfect. 

I read comment after comment saying things like

 ""Oh, this thing is so cool, and it's really accurate!""

""My Aunt has just been diagnosed with cancer and this thing said she'd die from a Tumor!! SUPER CREEPY"" 

""My wife bought this app and it said she'd die from an Automobile accident...two days later and she's on life support after she was T-boned. This thing is terrifying. Please...use at your own risk.""

""lol my frens an i use this 2 play pranks on our techers! u wont want to miss this app. weird thing is it says my little brothers going to commit suicide.""

The comments were filled about 50/50 with either people laughing at how fun this App is, or warning the public about how accurately this thing has predicted deaths. 

I was sold. It was a case that needs investigation. I called Ronnie to let him know what I found. ""Yeah, told you! And the reviews and stories are all over the internet. Another weird thing is- the reviews only go back about a month. Before that there's nothing written even though the App came out in 2010.""

You'd think that by now there would be some sort of news coverage on this thing if people were accurately predicting their loved ones' deaths. 

The first order of business was to somehow contact someone who had written a review. Without much effort I found a Yahoo Answers thread where someone had asked if anyone else had someone they knew die in the way the App had predicted. 

&gt;**Has anyone else experienced someone dying in the way Your Time predicted?**

&gt;*I'm really scared so please answer seriously. I bought this app 3 weeks ago and I was sitting with my uncle when I first used it. It had told me that I was going to die in my sleep from a stroke, but it said my uncle would die from a seizure. A few days ago my family got the news that my uncle had a seizure while driving and had gotten in to a car accident. He was dead when the paramedics arrived. I also tried it in my 4 year old brother and my 2 year old sister, and both times it said ""Suicide""??? what do I do?! Who do I tell about this? My parents won't believe me and they are too sad to listen to me.*
 
While I read, I had noticed something familiar. The part where this person mentions that their younger siblings' results were ""suicide."" I remembered reading a few reviews on the App Site mentioning this same thing: That children always resulted in the suicide outcome.

I messaged the person over Yahoo, telling them everything I knew, mentioning all the other reviews I'd read where someone had died in the same exact way as the App had predicted. There were, however, just as many people who hadn't died or have not had anyone they knew die from using the app. 

The person responded almost immediately:

&gt;Hello, Nick. 

&gt;Thank you so much for writing. My name is Rene and I am 17 years old. My uncle was 57 when he passed, and he had a history of seizures before the incident. This is why I was REALLY startled when Your Time predicted ""Seizures""...while not deadly themselves, they can be dangerous if you're in certain situations. My Uncle thought I was messing with him, that I had somehow input information in the app to scare him because he and I would play pranks on each other all the time. I frantically told my parents, my friends, and even the police. No one seemed to believe me, or they chalked it up to coincidence. Then...my uncle was gone. He was riding his motorcycle and had a Grand Mal Seizure in the middle of the freeway. I contacted a news station to try and tell my story, but no one was interested. No one believes me. 

I found it so incredibly strange that there was no major media coverage of this App. Rene was far from the only one affected. I offered my condolences and asked about her two younger siblings.

&gt;Hi!!!

&gt;Thank you very much for believing me. It's a huge relief to know I'm not entirely insane. As for my siblings...Jen is 4 and Palo is 2. My mother remarried and my step-dad had 2 kids from another marriage. Both of them consistently show up as ""suicide"", but they're both still alive and both very happy little kids which makes it THAT much more frightening to me. 

Man...Poor girl. She seemed very smart and extremely sweet. God knows how many more people are frantically trying to search for answers. How do you tell people that an App predicted a loved one's death without sounding insensitive or insane? I needed to keep on digging.

I ran upstairs to my apartment and got to my computer as quickly as possible. I didn't even bother taking off my shoes and coat. I popped in the drive and the folder popped up. The folder inside read **Y_119_Time_Invest_2016**. I clicked on the folder and a bunch of other folders popped up, each with a person's name and a time of date. 

I already knew that these were the names of people Sue investigated. I scrolled down quite a bit before I came to the folder entitled ""Sawyer_Report_Y_T_016""  

My sweaty fingers nearly slipped off of the mouse as I clicked. I began reading Susan Sawyers' Report:

&gt;This is Susanna Sawyers. As of January 10th, 2016 I began receiving phone calls from people around the world revolving around the iPhone and Android application ""Your Time."" 

&gt;The Application itself was created in 2010 by a company called ""IlluminateDelta, or, as it's displayed: ""IlluminateΔ""
The company does not appear to have created any other Apps, despite it being founded in 2009. Your Time, although created in 2010, the Application's earliest downloads began on January 1st. I can not find any record of downloading predating the first of this year. The Application, when downloaded, appears as a goofy looking skull with googly eyes on a black square button. The app is opened and displays a camera screen where the user is prompted to click a skull when the ""target"" is in place. When clicked, an animated green loading screen with the same goofy skull appears for about 3 to 4 seconds before a tombstone pops up playing a familiar clip of ""Funeral March"". The tombstone then allegedly reads the way the ""target"" will die. 

&gt;The calls all had information in common: They were concerned people who's loved ones, including family and friends, died in exactly the same way the tombstone predicted. 

&gt;Another common occurrence was also observed. Whenever the user of the app 'targeted' young children, the App reads ""Suicide"". This was alarming many people, as they would always tell me how happy their child was, and insist that they had a secure home life. 

&gt;Included in these files are copies of classified information I had come across thanks to [REDACTED] the CSI. (See documents entitled Y_1118992_9_0220, and Y_3663_9B_0221 in the file labeled [CLASSIFIED]).

&gt;Due to my investigation over the past few months, and now after reading the classified documents and information from other sources, I believe that, without a shadow of a doubt, that there is an underground world power which includes the CSI, and questionably the FBI, who have been actively developing technology over the past 20 years which will be used to act as a 'population control method'. As far as I am able to gather from the legal language used in the documents, IlluminateΔ was created as a means to distribute an Application  which utilizes this techology (which I understand uses subtle sound waves and alpha/ beta waves to induce a sort of mass hypnoses. They have also combined this with another more complicated technology that is able to, with 99.9% accuracy, predict how an individual will die. How they accomplish this, I have absolutely no clue. The issue with this particular form of population control is that it is only effective for use on people's minds that have been born prior to the age of technology. This meant that those who have spent their ENTIRE lives with smart phones and wifi and modern computer screens. The documents state that this subtle difference in brain development as infants allows these individuals to be thousands of times more receptive to the Application. Because of the popularity and accuracy of the application with other people, the popularity and number of downloads is increasing exponentially.

&gt;I am unsure as to WHEN they will use this Application for it's intended purpose. I am under the impression that popular media outlets have been instructed not to cover any stories having to do with ""Your Time"". I believe word of mouth is far more effective of a marketing device, and I am certain that IlluminatiΔ knows this. Please, if you find yourself reading this, know that I have trusted you to pass this on to however many people you can, through whatever trusted sources you have. Convince anyone you know to not download this App, and if they do, tell them to erase it from their phones entirely. 

I sat at the computer screen with my mouth agape, not knowing how to process any of this information. I'm now copying the info on to a thumb drive I have, and as I'm doing so, I keep re-reading the last sentence that Sue wrote.

&gt;I know I haven't much time. I think I've been found out. I have downloaded the app on my phone and used it on myself. The tombstone reads :**""You know too much. Blunt Trauma to the head.""** Please....whoever is reading this. BE CAREFUL.

I simply have to do what must be done. The copy is complete. I hid it in a place only Ronnie will know. I just sent him an encrypted email. I think I keep hearing footsteps outside in the hallway so I'm trying to finish this story up as quickly as possible just so SOMEONE knows. I don't think I'll make it in time to be sure that Ronnie is able to find the copy and get it to his dad. If you're reading this, please...make sure Ronald Pritchard found the thumb drive. PLEASE, for the sake of the next generation.

I think this is supposed to mean that the apps are in their head and when they crashed, everyone died but idk, just interpreting it that way.

It was about 2am when I laid my head in the pile of paper in front of my computer....It wouldn't hurt to take a break....

As I drifted off, I heard it. Very loudly in my head, in a voice I couldn't recognize:

""**Knowing too much. Blunt Trauma**""

*******

I was startled awake by my trac phone ringing. It was 4am. I looked at the ID and it was a number I recognized. 

I had spent the last 18 hours calling every single news-station and newspaper and online news site I could. I had called all the local papers and every major news station, and no one replied. I even called a few police stations....man those guys ARE NOT helpful. It's hard to convince them that a 20-something sounding kid on the phone with a story about an App that has magical powers isn't a hoax. Most of them hung up mid-story. 

I picked up the phone hurriedly.

""Hel-LOW!?"" My voice cracked from a mixture of grogginess and excitement. 

&gt;Is this Nick? Nicholas Mendell?

""Yes! Yes this is!""

&gt;This is Susanna Sawyer from Channel 8 news. I'm calling in regards to the message you left earlier. I apologize for the early call but we start filming very early and this is my only pocket of free time all day. 

""Issok."" I slurred.

She spoke quickly and precisely. 

&gt;Listen, there are a lot of ears and eyes here. I would love to talk with you and I was wondering if we could meet up somewhere. There's a pub on Charleston Street. Do you think you can make it there at 1:30 am tonight? About a half hour before it closes? We can meet then. I'll buy you a drink. That's the only opportunity we have.

Before I could even agree to the plan, she hung up. What other choice did I have? Throughout the day she was the only one who'd answered my call. I called Ronnie to let him know what was going on.

""Ohhhh HO HOOOO."" He chided. ""OOHHHHHH woooowwwwww. Sounds like you're on to something incredible!!! Oh can I PLEASSE GO?! PLEASE?! Don't detectives usually have sidekicks?? Like uhhh, like uhhh Wilton, from uh. From that one guy that Hugh Jackman played?""

I sighed and pressed my temples. ""Watson, Ronnie. And it was originally a book and the main character is Sherlock Holmes. And no. I want you to stay out of this one. This is all really serious and as much as I love your enthusiasm, it makes other people uncomfortable.""

""AWWWWWWYOU SUCK NICK, YOU HEAR ME, YOU SUCK!!"" He hung up the phone dramatically, but I knew he wasn't actually mad. If he didn't agree with me, it would have been an hour long argument. 

Time moved very slowly that day. I tried to play videogames to pass the time. I would have worked on my report for class but there was absolutely no way I was concentrating on writing. 

Finally I looked at the clock and it read 1:00. I put on my coat and headed out the door. Petey's Pub was the only pub on Charleston street, and luckily I only lived about 25 minutes walking distance. It was a small town. 

As for Ms. Sawyer...she was a bit of a local celebrity which certainly wasn't saying much. Channel 8 was our county's main television source for news during a time when no one was watching the television anymore. She was always kurt, to the point, and took her job very seriously. I didn't watch much television but every time I flipped the channel to the news, I always thought of her as one of the few good journalists left in the world. 

I entered the bar and looked around. It was empty except for a stool sitting at a table near the back right corner. There, unmistakably, sat Ms. Sawyer who was pulling from a long skinny cigarette. Petey's was dark and musty, and the music was a little loud for my tastes. This whole thing was beginning to feel like a Film Noir to me. 

""Ms. Sawyer."" I said, to alert her of my presence.

""Call me Sue, please."" She puffed on the cigarette and I was begging to shake anxiously. She must have sensed my nervousness because she motioned to the other stool for me to sit down.

""Nick, I have to be brief. I had Joe turn up the music a little louder than usual. It's empty but you can NEVER know."" I assumed Joe was the bartender, as he was sitting behind the bar wiping a glass, looking like some sort of vigilant body guard. There was something in the way she said NEVER know that made me believe she knew. 

""Nick. As I'm sure you can imagine, you're not the only one who's contacted us about this App. For the past few months I've been getting emails and calls from people who's dads, grandmas, sisters, brothers, friends have all died in seemingly average ways...."" She paused for a bit. ""Not to trivialize their deaths."" She dragged on the cigarette and was kind enough to blow it away from me.  ""Tell me what you know.""

I told her about my own amateur investigation. About Rene and her uncle and her two siblings, and the other young kids who all come up as ""suicide"". I told her that my friend had been the one to first introduce me, and that the App was made in 2010 but there were no downloads until January 2016.

She nodded to everything I said.

""Nick, everything you've told me is exactly what I've found, but I've been doing this sort of thing my entire life. I had to take on this investigation independently, though. You think the app itself is strange? You should see the reactions of all the CEOs of the news companies whenever this shit is brought up. They all get cold and clammy, and none of them will return my calls or emails. Some of them have been courteous enough to send me messages, all similarly along the lines of ""**Between you and me, this is best left forgotten.**"" Some of them weren't so nice. A few replied with messages more like ""You keep your filthy whore nose out of this and if I receive another call or message, you better believe I'll sue you for harassment.""

""Jeeze."" was just about the only thing I could say. What else is there to say?

She put out her cigarette, coughed, and took a stiff drink from a glass.""You're young. You've got your whole life ahead of you. I'm getting old. I'm 46. I'm past my prime. The TV stations all want young hot girls fresh out of Journalism School now. The producers feed them lines from a teleprompter No one knows how to do the job anymore. No one knows how to investigate, and the news stories come straight from the CEO's. They control everything. People think it's a conspiracy but I can tell you first hand, it's very much not.

Nick....I'm in far deeper than you, and I think I found some things I wasn't supposed to find regarding this App. I followed money trails. I followed people I should not have followed. I did my best to eliminate proof that I've been where I've been. I'm damn good at my job, Nick...but I'm not THAT good. I have a feeling I've been found out. I'm not worried about getting fired from my job- that's already something I accepted the first time I could see a wrinkle on my forehead. No, I think I stumbled in over my head.....and I don't know how much time I have to get my story out there. You're the only other person who's contacted me who is motivated and interested enough in this Case, and I can tell, from investigator to investigator, that I can trust you."" She downed the rest of her glass. ""Take this, Nick."" She handed me a cupcake key-chain, which she demonstrated was hiding a thumb drive. ""It's got everything on it. Everything I could find including my own personal written report. Read it, make a copy and hide it, then give it to a cop you can trust. Or anyone really...anyone who has some sort of authority that you can trust.""

Before I could open my mouth, she grabbed her purse and left. Jon was watching her, and when she was out of site he turned to stare at me, slowly chomping on a piece of gum.


*****

As I walked back to my house, I called Ronnie, fumbling the buttons on the phone. I couldn't really process what had just happened, but I knew I had to read whatever it was on the thumb drive. I thought I heard footsteps echoing behind me, but every time I turned around there was nobody. A dead street.""

""OOOHHH MANN!"" Ronnie yelled from the other end. ""Wow you're gettin yourself in to SOMETHING CRAZY! I told you I shoulda gone! I TOLD YOU!""

""Ronnie, shut the FUCK up for a minute and listen.""

Ronnie was silent. He was a lot to handle sometimes but by god he knew when things were serious. 

""I'm going to go home and read it and I'm going to make a copy. Tomorrow, we're going to visit your dad at the fire station and tell him EVERYTHING. I need to be there because you know he doesn't take anything you say seriously. We're going to give him the original hard drive and whatever is going on, we're going to try and forget about it."" 

""Ok...""he said. ""And when I die of a heart attack and we're ghosts, we can both laugh at how silly this whole thing was.""

""Ronnie, You still have the key to the code we came up with, right?""

We hadn't used it in years, but Ronnie and I came up with a secret code in highschool, which we'd use to write notes back and forth about girls we were crushing on and teachers we hated.

""Uhhhhhhyeah. Of course. How could I not?! I AM the creator after all!""

Ronnie was really proud of coming up with that code even though I had to revise it due to major bugs and grammatical errors.  

""I'm going to send you an email in our code after I'm done reading, letting you know where I've hidden the copy. You got that?""

""Rodger."" He replied, and I hung up.

""Mr. Smith, that crowd is getting ugly. We don't have enough guards to guarantee your security. You should cancel the press conference.""

""I'm not worried about it. We only hired security because legal forced us to.""

""I know your company wrote that death app, but even if you trust it that much, there's a lot of bad stuff that can happen that isn't death.""

""Just watch the press conference. I'll explain everything.""

A moment later, Smith walked to the podium and began, ""Six months ago, Singular Systems released the Death Predictor app. We've been getting lots of complaints, and I'm here to explain our long-term-""

An angry man interrupted, ""You liars! You said my wife would die of cancer. She was murdered-"" After a brief struggle, a pair of guards subdued the man.

""Yes, there have been errors. We never promised 100% accuracy, our results were always based on probabilities. We use data from all available social media accounts to understand how people behave, and GPS histories to determine which people are likely to be around which other people, and predict the future interactions that are most likely to be risky. But some crimes and some accidents are more random than others-""

There was another outburst, ""And what about the suicides? What are you going to do to our children?""

Smith smiled briefly, ""I suppose you're asking the right question for the wrong reason. Our newest product-""

His response was interrupted by a gunshot. The crowd screamed and scattered. Smith fell to the ground, instinctively pressing down on the hole in his chest, but doing little to stop the bleeding. 

A short time later, sirens could be heard. Emergency vehicles arrived. A body bag was loaded into an ambulance. The vehicles drove away silently.

""So we're interviewing someone from Singular Systems live on tonight's show? I'm surprised any of them are willing to show their faces in public after the shooting earlier.""

""I know. I think I'd move and change my name. Their representative said it would be the most important interview of the millennium. I can't imagine what they're thinking, but I'm sure it'll be great for ratings. Anyway, their person is in makeup; they'll be out after your intro.""

""So, let's welcome our guest today, a representative of-

""Mr. Smith! You're still alive? They said... What... what happened?""

""Well, yes, that's actually what the press conference yesterday was supposed to be about. Death Predictor was always intended to be viral marketing for our newest product: Mind Uploader 1.0. Our customers will have the ability to save their brain state into our servers and download themselves into a newly grown body whenever it's necessary; they will live as long as they choose to.""

Anyone born after the creation of the App only comes up as ""Suicide""",BiagioLargo,"“So Michel, have you run This One Life on yourself yet”
“Ah huh, that’s quite a personal question for a first date don’t you think?”
“Well, the App knows, which means that the data is out there in the world - why should they know and not me?  Moreover, if you come up as a murder suicide, I probably should know now as it will significantly affect whether I order one course or linger after second coffees…”
“Well...it’s a bit embarrassing”
“Go on then”
Michel pulled out his mobile dramatically and slid to the only app that was on his home screen, comically arranged as part of a picture of his dog, A-pooh.  With a quick swipe the familiar screen came up and, after a short artistic video about the joys of life, revealed his final moments of existence:  A blurry video showed a 50+ year old version of himself slumping over a bar table and falling down into his own vomit.  
“Well, that’s not very nice is it….”
“Ah - it’s just a marketing campaign.  We’ll find out soon enough that This One Life is just feeding data to our health insurance and Big Brother or whatever, forcing people to take better care of themselves so that we cost the state less welfare costs”.
“I suppose….”
“What does yours show?  Death by obesity so you run more?  Death by heart attack so you lay off the steak?”
“Oh… mine’s really nice actually.  I’m very old.  Surrounded by a loving family.  Maybe we are incompatible as I will be living much longer than you.”
“Bollocks - how about I stay away from bars from this day on and you promise me a second date?”

…….

“Annita, Annita, come on sweetheart”
“I’m sorry Mr Anglar, we’ve lost her”
“Nooo, noo….. She is going to live to be very old and me and our many kids are going to be with her at her bedside”.
“The App isn’t always accurate Mr Anglar… I am so sorry - the early versions just aren’t as reliable.  You should have upgraded her software regularly.  Then you could have been prepared for this.”

………


“But dad…. I don’t want to”
“Doesn’t matter Emrin, we will do this every year… every year…….you cannot trust aged data.  Whatever it says is only valid for a year… only a year”.
“Dad - all our results are the same, they aren’t going to change.  Mike is going by gun shot in the face which is pretty awesome to watch and the reason his mom hasn’t bothered decorating that room as she will probably have to burn it after.  Sueann is going by hanging which is a bit boring but it is funny to watch her mum react, the same everytime, like she didn’t expect it.  Jo is going by plane crash which is funny since she has never left New York and cannot fly a plane.”
“It’s not funny Emrin.  We are running out of time.  You are looking more and more like your final version everyday - If I didn’t make you shave every bloody day then we would never know when to expect it”.

……..

“SHAVE YOUR FUCKING FACE YOU UNGRATEFUL BLOODY ARSEHOLE.  WHILST YOU ARE UNDER MY ROOF YOU WILL SHAVE THAT UGLY THING EVERY SINGLE DAY.”
“STOP TELLING ME WHAT TO DO, I AM 23 YEARS OLD AND I HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DO WHAT I WANT, I WILL GO TO COLLEGE, I WILL GROW A FRIGGING BEARD AND SCREW YOU AND SCREW MY FINAL FORM BOTH.  I HATE YOU!”

……..

“So is this the most depressing class reunion ever”
“It’s up there”
“There’s like 5 of us left…”
“Yeah”
“When are you going?”
“Soon, I guess… got my affairs in order”
“Did you ever get that scar you final form has?”
“No- not yet, guess that will tell me when though, it’s fresh on my final form”

…….


Emrin stared at the gash the wine glass had left across his arm.  So it was time then.  By the time the blood dried he would be his final form.  Perplexed, he looked around the room, wondering where he would find a machete knife.  He didn’t want to do this wrong.  It had been over 20 years since anyone has missed their final form and he wasn’t going to disappoint.  The video would be shown at his wake and people would compare notes on accuracy.  He had heard of kids who had botched their suicides so that family and friends had laughed and mocked them during their wake.  There was a lot of pressure on kids to get this right.  And he didn’t have a damned machete……

He had been so careful, he had found the machete he needed on line and usually carried it with him whereever he went.  Go figure, the one time he doesn’t have it on him..”


…….

“Michel, Michel”
“wjup”
“It’s time mate”
“He found a machete”
“Yeah he did….”
“Ok then - I told you what to do when this happened?”
“Yes, mate.  In the circumstances, maybe you should pay me for the whisky first…”
“Mercenary! Ok - here’s my wallet, I won’t need it again.

Anyone born after the creation of the App only comes up as ""Suicide""",BiagioLargo,"I didn't trust the app one bit. Not because it was inaccurate - it was never wrong; and not because it froze my IPhone 7X - it wasn't Kandy Krush in that respect. No, it was because I thought the app was plain out *evil.* Who the hell would develop an app that could predict how anyone would die?

Today, I was on the train on my way to work. On the subway, there was no-one talking to each other; nobody reading the papers or listening to music. Everyone was busy with the app. I disapproved, to put it mildly - I said it was the cult of the app. Society's gone nuts, I tell you! Everything from app implants to app auto-checkers hit the market. It gave a new meaning to the term 'killer app', and I absolutely *hated* what was going on. But hey, who was I to question the wisdom of the masses? I had finally, belatedly, gotten the app when *everyone* around me had it. It was one of those things you regretted immediately after tapping 'install'. Strangely enough, this app had no 'uninstall' function - but hey, that was part of the fun, right?

Bunch of jerks.

My phone beeped again. That was the noise for when the app had new information: how anyone from Horatio Caine to Leonardo DiCaprio to the drug addict in the corner would die. I hadn't been using it much, because I felt it was really morbid, but then curiosity grabbed me. 

Who was it this time?

I took a look at the screen. It wasn't me. It couldn't be me, but it was always possible that the devs had forgotten something and let me see my own destiny. I breathed a sigh of relief - selfish, perhaps, but who could help it? Such was my relief that I didn't immediately note down the cause of death. 

What *was* it?

I flicked back. Around me the train stopped as people filtered through the subway doors. The screen showed 'suicide at Times Square' as the cause of death. Seeing the cause of death only made me a lot more curious.

What was there to stop people from simply swapping phones and seeing each other's cause of death? It would then be possible to avoid your own death. For example, if yours said 'Died of alcoholism while doing a keg stand', then for God's sake don't do a keg stand! 

*Such a simple idea,* I thought. *And yet no-one had thought of it.*

The train came to a stop again. In the mass exodus I tapped the shoulder of the passenger next to me. ""Excuse me, sir?"" I said.

He awoke. ""Yeah?""

""Can I see what you've got for your kill app?""

The man now looked more awake. ""Yeah, sure,"" he said, pulling out his phone. It was easy for him - after all, his phone was inside his head and probably never left it. ""Who do you wanna look for?""

""James Callaghan,"" I said, repeating my own name.

""Alright,"" he said, fingers tap-tapping on the old touchscreen. I waited. And suddenly his eyebrows furrowed. 

""Hmm,"" he said. ""That's odd...it usually works.""

""What's it returning?"" I said. ""Suicide? I can live with that, I suppose.""

""You'd think so, wouldn't you?"" he said. ""There's so many of those suicide ones  these days that I don't even know what's going on. But that's not it. Your name is just a blank.""

He turned the phone so that the screen faced me. There was no photo of me, no ID, no detail, not a sign that anyone by the name of James Callaghan had ever lived. I felt a chill down my spine. In the blistering July heat I looked at my own phone.

And still the man stared at me.

""I'd hate it, you know, not knowing,"" he said. ""Wouldn't you want to know how you would die?""

""Only to avoid it,"" I said, trying to dry my palms. They were sweating so much I couldn't hold my phone steady. ""What's the point of knowing if you can't do anything about it?""

The man stared right through me, as if he had never heard a more ridiculous thing in his life. 

""Of course there's a point,"" he said, putting the phone back in his hair. ""It helps you prepare, you know? It keeps you on your toes. It makes sure you can say goodbye to loved ones. You think you are the first to suggest the idea of swapping phones? Tens of thousands have tried this, for the reasons I said. But many do not like what they find. Death is unfair that way, you know: it kills the warriors in their old age and claims the babies in their youth. You are the first to fail.""

I looked on in silence, staring back at him as the train rushed on. When my thoughts started making sense again, I spoke.

""I don't trust this app one bit,"" I said. ""I'm not reliant on death to dictate my life.""

""Suit yourself,"" the man said. ""A lot of people - those born after the app was created, those who have known nothing else - they have no such independence. Imagine the consequences if the app ever crashed - people can't live without death.""

The train stopped at Grand Central. The man got up.

""Well, I'd best be off,"" he said, smiling at me in that odd, undead way. ""It was nice to meet you, James Callaghan.""

He extended his hand, and I shook a cold, dead fish of a palm.

Then he was gone and the train was moving again. I sat back down, looking at my phone, tapping at the app that had troubled him and me alike. What could it all mean?

I looked at the phone again. The app was frozen. 

And suddenly from all around me I could hear the sounds of a million voices dying.

""You're kidding,"" you say, with a generous amount of skepticism. ""It's like a Death Note on steroids.""
Your friend chuckles as if she hadn't heard that joke before. You can't help but smile in return.

""I guess you could say that,"" Her thumbs return to their respected phone screen. Without offering, she raises it to show you the results of your own demise. ""Weird, right?""

Down to the date and time, nothing seemed out of the ordinary for an average American. You sill had a healthy lifespan, another strong 55 years. You are predestined for a particularly nasty stroke at age 73 on a lazy Tuesday. It happens at night. Her eyebrows raise as yours do.

The bell for third period rings and she shoves her phone in her back pocket. She sighs and shrugs at you, and you offer a fleeting hug before she departs. Her fist collides with your shoulder after a warm ""See you later.""

A quick Google search had shown you that you aren't the only one who was puzzled, with numerous articles about the possible origins of it bouncing around social media and news sites. 

You cave in after some consideration and finally download the app while you lay in bed, ""trying to sleep"". When it finishes and you open it with some apprehension, a presumed terms of service agreement pops up on your screen, but the text is garbled and seemed as if it was in a different language before trying to translate it to English. You press one of the two buttons that were also presented in that illegible text. 
When the box disappears, it's obvious that the app wasn't meant to be user-friendly or have any type of organization. 

You type your name into the singular text box and hit enter. Same result. 
You type her name into the singular text box and you pause. You delete it. 
You type your mom's name in the singular text box and hit enter. It shows the date of when she had died from a stroke three years ago. 
You type your baby step-brothers name into the singular text box. It returns the single word of suicide. No date, no time.

The Internet, as well as your friend, is as clueless as you are.

Since high school, you've both grown closer. You have a ring box in your coat pocket. She looks as ethereal as ever. You watch her talk, but you're intent on her lips and how she holds her fork. 

Her eyes travel to your twice-replaced cell phone sitting on the table next to your cup of ice before you could notice your father was calling. You expect a ""Hey, buddy"" or a question of your whereabouts when you raise the phone to your ear. 

You're greeted with the same tone that you noticed when he had found your mother prone in her bed.

Anyone born after the creation of the App only comes up as ""Suicide""",BiagioLargo,"I’ve always known that death is inevitable and that with the App, avoiding how I will die was also impossible. I also firmly believed that the App was able and will always be able to accurately predict the cause of the death. 

**Twenty fifth of March:**

However, my ideals have failed to stand by my side when it was my turn to learn of how I will die. It all started on the morning of the 25th of March. I received a notification on my Samsung Universe X phone from the Death App which was pre-installed on almost all of the world’s mobile phones. I was somewhat surprised considering that the death of relatives is usually notified through mail, rather than the app itself, however, this was different. Hesitantly, I slid down the notification tab and tapped on the message from the app. It quickly launched and I was faced with the gradient purple interface. A small text showed up on the screen stating, 

“*Your death will take place in one week. 
The cause of death will be revealed in three days. 
Until then, please make sure that you put your affairs in order before your Death. 
Thank you..
The Death App*”

Frankly, I was not horrified or scared about the fact that I will die. On the contrary, it was a motivation for me to arrange matters beforehand, and also guess all the possible ways in which I might face my death. 
Over the course of the three days, I went over at least 80 different possibilities. They were ranging from me slipping down the stairs and getting a deadly concussion to me accidentally choking on some of my favorite large sized gummy bears. Aside from guesswork, I also made sure that all arrangements have been made so that my death does not become a hassle to anyone. I managed to sell most of my belongings, I spoke to the landlord about my impending death so that he can take over my apartment, and also informed my lawyer about my finances so that it’s easier for him to do his work. Still, even though I managed to take care of almost everything, the unknown cause of death still tugged at me and made me wonder, “How will it all end?”

**Twenty eighth of March:**

On the 28th of March, I received a new notification from the Death App. I launched the application to be faced with a new message. 

“*The cause of Death will be Suicide. 
Please keep in mind that the cause is immutable.
Any attempts or lack of attempts to avoid this Death will only bring it forth.
Thank you..
The Death App*”

I was baffled and stared dumbfound at the screen.  Here I was trying to figure out how my end will be brought on, whether it was in some gruesome way or in some epic fashion. However, suicide was definitely not a thought that crossed my mind. I spent the rest of my day trying to think of any reason, whether directly or remotely related to my death. I had a really good life and had everything I wanted. Sure, I didn’t have a partner and I wasn’t the richest man on Earth. However, I had a good paying job and got to partake in all the activities I ever dreamed of since I was young. I couldn’t imagine any reason for me wishing to take away my life. 

The next 3 days were just a downslide from there. I wasn’t sad at all, just confused. It all made my last days feel so vague. It felt kind ironic that the Death App would you tell the cause of your death but would not tell you the reason behind that cause. As the time of death grew nearer, I dreaded that void in my head more and more. It was as if it was slowly eating away at my life. 

**First of April:**

On the cursed day, I was so fed up that I just woke up and jumped off the balcony. I know the most sudden and flat-out boring exit one can ask for, however, I was fed up. I just wanted to end this “life”. I also knew that trying to pull through this day without doing anything will also result in failure as either one of two things would happen. Either the time of my death will be merely delayed once and I will face the same death again in one week, or, Death will force itself onto me. These were the Death App rules. As I reached the ground, a new message was received from the Death App which launched itself and displayed a new message. 

“*Due to the deceased’s date of birth being after that of the creation date of the App, it was unable to extract a valid cause of Death from the Death Records.
As such, it was replaced with the standardized Suicide ending.
Thank you for using the Death App..*”

Honestly, the fact that I died in such a way just because of a systematic error, 
and specifically on this date, is really a sick joke.

&gt;  ""A lot of people - those born after the app was created, those who have known nothing else - they have no such independence. Imagine the consequences if the app ever crashed - people can't live without death.""

&gt; I looked at the phone again. The app was frozen. 

I'm assuming the narrator's result was blank because he outlived the app, and the app crashed because the narrator searched for himself and it couldn't predict a result, leading to an odd time-travelesque paradox.

"[WP] Your favorite television drama is now your favorite sitcom, and vice versa.",BobbyWest87,"Morty Smith entered the garage to see his grandpa Rick laying face-down on the cement, a pool of vomit caked around his lips. ""Grandpa Rick.... a-a-a-are you okay?""

Rick groans, unable to make a coherent sound. ""Uh... mom... mom! Something's wrong with Rick!"" Beth appeared in the doorway moments later and stood in shock for a moment.

""Dad... dad? Are you okay?"" She walked up to him, ""Oh my God. Morty, call an ambulance.""

""Mom?""

""MORTY CALL AN AMBULANCE NOW!""

""Okay."" Morty scurried off to the phone while Beth checked her father's pulse and breathing.

""Good, he's still breathing,"" she said to herself. Morty appeared in the room again.

""Mom they're asking what happened... I said he was laying on the ground.""

Wordlessly Beth took the phone, ""Yes... that's our address. Yes he's still breathing and he still has a pulse. No... he's not conscious. Okay. Okay.""

At this point Jerry had found his way to the garage, ""Beth, what's going on?""

""Not now Jerry! I'm on the phone with the ambulance! Yes... okay.""

""Oh my God... is Rick... is he.... dead?""

""Mom, he's not dead, is he? Oh my God, mom!""

""NO BUT HE NEEDS AN AMBULANCE NOW YOU TWO JUST CALM DOWN AND SHUT UP!""

Her husband and son stare in dumb silence, fidgeting but unable to move away from the garage until the ambulance arrives. The sirens alert Summer to what's going on and she rushes downstairs when she see the ambulance stopped in front of their house, ""Mom, dad, is everything okay? There's an amulance outside and..."" her face fell when she entered the garage, ""What's wrong with granpda Rick?""

*******

At the hospital Beth is pacing in Rick's hospital room, waiting for more word from the doctor while Rick's face looks waxy and yellow. Morty and Summer are sitting traumatized near the bed while Jerry stands outside the room. ""Mom... he's going to be okay right? R-r-r-right?"" Morty stuttered.

""Sweetheart, I don't know.""

A doctor walked brusquely into the room, ""Mrs Smith, I need to speak with you alone."" The kids are ushered out into the hall with Jerry and the doctor urges Beth to sit down. ""Mrs. Smith, this might be hard to hear but your father has extreme cirrhosis of the liver. He's also experiencing renal failure - that is to say his kidneys are hardly functioning.""

""Oh God, dad... no...""

""There's really not much we can do at this point, his body's gone into a complete shutdown. I think it's time that you say your goodbyes...""

Tears are streaming down Beth's face but she nods. ""We have a private room if your family would like to discuss things in private."" She nods again.

Inside the room there are comfortable chairs and multiple tissue boxes. The family is sitting down but everyone can sense the dread in the air. As soon as the news is out Jerry can't help but chime in. ""Beth, this shouldn't come as a surprise. Rick is an alcoholic. I've told you before but you were just so happy to have him back in your life that you were blind to everything!""

""Jerry, this isn't the time for that... please... the kids are right here. He's dying now anyway, what good is this going to do?""

""If not now, Beth, when? Kids, look, I know you're upset that your grandpa is sick but we need to discuss this, its gone long enough unsaid. Once he's gone I won't be able to say anything because it won't be the right time then, either. Beth, I know you were really happy when he showed back up again but he's the same person who abandoned you and your mother, he is a drunk and a bad influence on the kids. Morty's been missing school, his grades are getting worse and Summer doesn't spend time with the other kids from school anymore. It's like he's sucked the whole house into some kind of dimensional warp where you're okay with him ruining your life for a second time!""

""Jerry... stop..."" Beth has been reduced to sobs. ""I just wanted to have him around.""

""And you've been enabling him the whole time, and any time I brought it up that it was a problem you shut me down. Now look what happened! He's leaving you again because he's slowly been killing himself the whole time!""

""Dad... dad grandpa Rick was really cool. He's the one that taught me to set the bar low and that school is for stupid people anyway...""

""See Beth? Our impressionable son who needs all of the help he can get thinks that school is a *bad idea*.""

""Dad... still, he's cooler than most of my friends anyway.""

""Beth, your alcoholic father is apparently a better person than Summer's friends her *own age*. This family is falling apart because of him. And it hasn't helped that you haven't said anything about his open hostility for me. Every chance he gets he reminds me that I'm not good enough for you. And you don't say anything. So Beth... am I not good enough for you?""

""Jerry, this is *not the time to talk about this*. Not in front of the kids!""

""Then when, Beth? When? Do you really agree with Rick? Are you only in this because of the kids? Because I can't take it anymore.""

""Kids. Go outside. Here's some money, go to the vending machine."" Morty and Summer walk out in a daze but are more than happy to get away from their parents.

""Jerry, maybe he's right. My father is dying and all you want to do is tell me that it's my fault he's dying.""

""Open your eyes Beth, you haven't done anything in the best interest of the family and I want you to see how that's really hurt everyone here.""

""Well, Jerry, if that's how you really feel, you can leave. Go, right now. Let me say goodbye to my dad, and let the kids say goodbye to their grandpa, and you can just leave. Don't come back."" Beth had been reduced to a crying mess.

Jerry walked out of the room, crossed the parking lot, got in the car and started driving. The kids came back, ""Mom... where's dad? Is everything okay?""

""No, everything is not okay. Dad's not going to be here but let's go say goodbye to your grandpa.""

""Mom..."" Summer trailed off, not sure where to go but wanting to comfort her mom. ""Yeah... let's go."" She grabbed Beth's hand, her mother thinking she was seeking comfort and Summer wanting to do something for her mom.

In the hospital room Rick looked worse than ever. Beth walked up to the bed and grabbed Rick's hand. ""Well dad, I guess this is the end.""",Trish-the-Stalker

""Truly a little something for everyone there, Hugh.""

""Indeed, so they have.""

""If people are really making that comparison, all I can say is that I'm honored. As a young man I watched their documentaries over and over, just fascinated at what they had discovered about the man behind the Arthur legends. Their exposition of what life was really like for the average man and woman in that distant time. And then they went even further back, to Biblical times, what life would have been like under Roman occupation; the serious questions they asked that are with us to this day, you know? Like what have the Romans ever done for us? Don't we all ask that in some way or another? And even when there are answers, there are always more questions, and people who don't want to know the truth even when it's explained to them.""

""So insightful, and timely.""

""Truly ahead of their time, they always were. And the subjects they would explore in their weekly documentary show, I'm surprised they weren't censored off the air.

And who hasn't felt that he has been hoodwinked when buying something as simple and necessary as a pet? Really eye-opening stuff that honestly I don't think anyone has come close to in the time since.""

[WP] A 24-hour countdown mysteriously appears on your phone. You find out it's simultaneously running on every cellphone around the world. There are 3 hours left.,King_Shmulz,"Nothing piques the interest of the public like a true mystery. The countdown first appeared twenty one hours earlier as a plain, almost unnoticeable blemish on every modern device. There was no header nor indication of purpose. Just a clock, harmlessly ticking backwards.

Theories ranged from World War Three to alien visitation to extinction event via asteroid collision. The media took proper care to not only amplify the rumors, but convince the people that some version of all of them was possible. Just moments ago a news anchor consulted some hick who talked about how ""dem terrurusts be takin' ovah"".

Frankly, I'm a little insulted that anyone could think that a bunch of goat-fucking terrorists in buttfuck-nowhere had the brains to do this. It says a lot that so many people think of terrorism as the greatest threat on Earth.

I guess fear sells.

Sensible voices were extinguished like a spark in a monsoon. Did you think it was a harmless advertising ploy? If so, you were called a brainless idiot, or even more ridiculously, a ""useful sheep"". Were you not with your family, hugging them in anticipation of the ""Rapture""? Dumbass, don't you know that your time on this Earth is dwindling? Millions crowded around populous areas, some of which were wearing tin-foil hats to greet the aliens, or the angels, or whatever else the media dreamed up for ratings. 

The real fun was only beginning. Nothing could be more worth it. I altered the timer to have a background of an asteroid collision, and for good measure, I ""authenticated"" the image with a NASA symbol in the lower right corner of every phone, pc, and modern device on the planet. 

Things were getting wild now. People crying everywhere, devastating riots, and just outside my window there was some naked idiot running around screaming something about how his ""euphoria"" would keep him safe.

Ten minutes until the media realizes they goofed. Ten minutes until the people realize their riots and tin hat shields and rapture-goodbyes were all for nothing. Ten minutes (my chest seized up) until the hype would die down and I'd surely get executed, tortured, and, I would bet, widely hated. 

But you know...it was certainly worth it. These reactions and the impact my actions will have on history will surely carry on a legacy. Okay, not a *good* legacy, but that's fine by me. I wasn't content with the idea of living a life where I worked meaningless work, and died in a conclusion to a meaningless life. 

Five minutes turned to one minute, which turned to ten seconds.

And then the countdown ended. A 00:00 flashed on Times Square, in Beijing, in Tokyo, Mexico City, Rome, London, everywhere. 

I just wanted a little fun, and people had to assume the worst. In truth, it's probably more their fault than mine that their countries are in shambles, when it's all said and done. Fear *does* sell.

I slowly pushed in, and heard a CLICK. The robot's insides whirred.

I pulled my finger from his eye with haste, and stared into his open eyes with bated breath. 

One breath.

Two breath.

Three brea-

""Hello.""

I screeched and scrambled back, sending a wrench skittering across the concrete floor of my garage. The robot stared at me curiously, and smirked somewhat. ""Watch where you're going, human,"" he said with arrogance. I gaped at him, not moving a muscle. 

He seemed to take that as a challenge.

""What? In awe?"" He said as he spread his arms wide, baring his torso. ""I know I'm PERFECT, human, but-""

""Open Word.""

The robot froze in the middle of his speech and stared down at me. ""What?"" He asked, anger leaking into his voice. I grit my teeth and scowled up at him. ""Open WORD, you hunk of tin! I didn't spend five years of my life to listen to you ramble!"" I hissed and slowly stood up. I didn't remember installing any kind of personality in him, only the basic A.I. package.

[WP] World history if America decided to be a monarchy.,PaperLuigi3,"President Roosevelt stood solemnly before a joint session of Congress, an array of microphones splayed out before him, and began to speak, one hand massaging his upper thigh as he surveyed the gathered Americans before him. ""Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives: Yesterday, December 7th, 1941 -- a date which will live in infamy -- the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of ... ""

Upon finishing his seven minute address, his leg braces where digging into the flesh of his legs and beads of sweat gathering at the small of his back. His son, James, led him out of the eye of the gathered Congresspeople and Senators. Within an hour, Congress declared war on the Empire of Japan and Roosevelt was meeting with his cabinet.

Henry Stimson, the Secretary of War, was uncharacteristically cheerful as he joined Roosevelt and his peers in the Oval Office. Reports were delivered from the Departments of State, Interior and finally War. After everyone was dismissed, Stimson remained after and approached Roosevelt's desk.

""Mr. President,"" he began solemnly, ""the American people need a strong leader in the coming years. You have led us through a depression and now you will lead us against the Japanese, but you need to cement your base. I've received word from  General Marshall, General Arnold and Admiral King that they support you in everything.""

The President smiled softly as he fumbled through his desk for a cigarette and responded, ""Mr. Stimson, stop beating around the bush, what are you saying?""

""Great men rise Mr. President, in times of great struggle and disorder the Romans would appoint one man to lead them through the conflict. I've already advised you that Germany is likely to declare war against us in the coming days, and I don't think we can fight them in Europe while driving Japan back to their homeland. You must take charge, it is time to suspend the Constitution. ""

In the coming days thousands of young men volunteered for service and thousands of reporters, isolationists and other dissenters were transported to internment camps. The public applauded Roosevelt's swift action and Congress had no choice but to accept his mandates. Slowly the United States of America fell under the control of Roosevelt and the military. 

On April 12th, Roosevelt passed away on a trip to Georgia, and Vice President James Roosevelt took the place of his father. Under his orders, combined Wehrmacht and allied forces pressed into Russia. The Russians allied with Japan and waged a two front war against the New Allies, but by September of 1945 allied forces took St. Petersburg and the Mariana Islands. From these locations, simultaneous attacks against Moscow and Kyoto ended the Second World War quickly.

[WP] That's what 3 a.m. is for.,PennyPriddy,"3 a.m., the real dead of night. Midnight's just early enough to escape 3 a.m. by sleeping. 6, 5, hell, even 4 a.m is late enough to stand up and face the day. But 3 a.m.? That's not the time for action. It's the time for lying in bed, contemplating your life, the mistakes you've made. Time to look over at your lover, asleep next to you, unaware of the questions 3 a.m. is asking you. What will the future bring? What of the past? What of my children? You'll never be able to fill the deafening silence with an answer. You'll be trapped within your own insecurities, alone with yourself in the 3 a.m. gap. Some men try to stare the gap down, but are horrified when it stares back with their own visage. Some hide in fear. Some even take refuge in sleeping pills, hoping against hope that they can avoid it. And for a time, they do. But the gap is vengeful. If they, in the forgetfulness of old age or the recklessness of youth, forget  to hide, the gap will put the consequences of their cowardliness on display tenfold.

When you try to join in, the voices tell you to shut up.",QuillCorner,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I peeked around the corner, flecks of brick falling away from the old office building. Another volley forced me back, but I counted three shooters now. Green-sleeves by the look of them, inked with two emerald dragons, intertwined, on either arm. I took one quick, deep breath and peered at the building opposite me. It was practically identical, this had been a business park once, but scrawled across its brick in fading neon orange was ‘Bad people ahead, turn back.’ 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I should have listened, I should have run. You don’t fuck with Green-sleeves in this particular area of the city, Mercer runs his own personal kingdom. Why was I here again? Exploring? I think I was exploring, but why did I turn into this alley? 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A break in their fire convinced me to peer around the corner once more, probably bait but what else was I going to do? I checked the chamber and shouldered my rifle’s stock, leaned into my right foot and pivoted to look down the range. Three men, reloading their weapons stared back at me and shouted incoherent drivel spiced with clear profanities. I looked down my sights and curled my finger to the trigger, but suddenly I was struck dumb. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“What are you doing?” a voice asked from behind me, a little hoarse and clearly not my own. Was this some magic, was this the trap? “I’ve told you a hundred fucking times, don’t touch my stuff.” 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Another voice, younger and bemused, replied, “I’m helping you, look where you are now. Mercer’s territory, we can kill some Green-sleeves and make it look like Dead-heads did it. I read about onlin-“ 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Goddammit. Give me that,” said the hoarse voice. “If I wanted to start a war with Green-sleeves I would have, fucker. And you used all the save slots?” 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Getting here was harder than I expected,” said the young voice. “I had to quick save like 4 times just to reach this alley.” I heard a slapping sound, followed by what could have been a brawl. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I’m telling mom,” snarled the hoarse voice. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Excuse me,” I said. “Who…What…?” I wasn’t sure quite what to say. Were there gods in my head? People had preached for centuries that we were all actors, playing roles to bemuse deities. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Since when does he talk?” The hoarse voiced waited for reply. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I don’t know, first time I’ve heard it.” The younger addressed me directly now, “This is a private conversation.” 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Private my ass,” I shouted. “I’m not some puppet!” 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Shut up,” said the hoarse voice. “Well, what can I do now… 90 hours in, I’m not starting over, I guess we kill some Green-sleeves.” 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Great,” said the young. Suddenly my hands were unfrozen, my eyes focused once more on the sights. “I’ll use the RPG, we can hit the one the middle and knock the other two off their feet.” 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The empty barrel of an RPG appeared in my hands, spurring me to reach into my endless pack and retrieve its ordinance. As I loaded, the hoarse voice said, “Hey, hand it over. You’ve messed up my day enough.” 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Just let me do this,” said the younger. “I just want to blow them up.” 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I’m saving the RPG rounds, they’re the only way to take out Marauder heavies in the badlands. Don’t waste them,” said the hoarse. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I’m not going to spam them, I just want to use one.” 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I only have 3,” said the hoarse. “Give me the goddamn controller!” 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My foes had taken the time to reload their weapons, and they readied to aim. The RPG in my hands was ready, but my fingers couldn’t find the trigger. Within me, I heard the shouting. The hoarse and younger shouted profanities at one another and crashed about- at least I assumed as much from the sounds. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Let go! Let go! Let go!” shouted the hoarse. Suddenly my aim shifted left, squared on the wall and released the rocket. I flew back, bouncing off what must have been the other office building. Bright lights, no sounds, and hovering over my eyes: “Game over. You’re dead.”

My eyes snap open. 

'You can't talk to me like that out loud! Not here!'

I was laying in bed, half asleep. I thought a woman in my room was screaming at me, right in my face, but if there was, she was invisible. 

""H-Hello?"" I squeaked, pulling the covers up to my chin. 

'Have you nothing to say?!' The voice shreaked back. It began to dawn on me, the voice was on my head. I was going to attempt a quick hello, but-

""I heard you, woman. You can't talk to me like that, anywhere!""

I lay still, confused, eyes wide open, heart pounding.

""And I swear to god, the next time you do-""

""What?! What will you do Frank?""

My mind was so full of noise, so jumbled with this argument in my head, I felt insane. I was insane. A brief silence followed the woman's question. Me, not being Frank, I stayed silent. 

Finally Frank found his tongue. ""You know how important this shit is, you know what's on the line here, what are you doing?""

""I'm working! I'm trying to fit in!""

""By undermining my authority?!""

Another brief silence. I realized it was now or never, I had to figure out what was happening in my head. I wasn't insane.

""Hey!""

""You shut up!"" 

Frank, and the mystery woman both shout this at once. It must have been pretty loud or something, because I totally blacked out for about ten minutes. When I came to, the voices were gone. Nobody in my house heard any arguing, so it must have been in my head. Maybe I picked up some of a conversation, from a cellphone, somehow.. Maybe I briefly went insane. 

Maybe two telepathic government agents used my head to host their private conversation? woah.. (7)

[WP] They made a statue of us,SqueeWrites,"John walked down the path of the park, leaning heavily on his cane. His leg was getting better but somedays it was worse. Today was one of those days. the doctors said it would take a while for it to heal and even then the pain might never go away. Okay, he thought, if that is all the punishment i get for that im lucky.

He could feel the cut every time he took a step, almost like it had never healed. On days like this he would have stayed inside, but today he had to meet someone. The path led to a clearing in the park with benches, trees, and a large statue of two men in the center.

The two young men had masks and capes on, real superheroes. the shorter ones shirt had a red lion ensigna on his chest, and the tall one had a bear. The statues didnt have any color, but john knew it was red. 

There were alot of people here, some sitting, some walking through. John saw an old man sitting by himself on a bench and headed over. The old man didnt notice john untill he sat down next to him. Finaly, he broke his study of the statue and looked at john.

""David Burdock, i presume?""

""You made it. Hows the leg?"" He croaked out.

""It hurts, but ill deal.""

""You better deal with it, you got off easy. Look at me."" he said raising his arms and facing John.

""Yea, Look at you. i knew the vortex rapidly aged you but, yesh. you look like my grandpa."" John chuckled 

""I look like My grandpa. I guess im just lucky it didnt age me to dust like the others."" At the mention of that memory, they both fell silent. John cleared his throat.

""Now i know you didnt want to meet me just so i could look at your pretty face. You know i dont get around very well anymore. So what do you want."" David was quiet for a moment as he studied his hands. 

""John, did we do the right thing?"" he looked at john with an almost pathetic senserity.

""Of coarse we did, we saved the city.They made a statue of us. We lost a few freinds, but everyone is safe now."" David looked away again.

""Im not talking about that. Im talking about Brughl, and Cathrine, and The Other Side. It was our fault the city needed saving, none of that would have happend if we hadnt let Brughl cross over to our dimension.""david was talking into his hands.

""Hey we were tricked by Brughl, okay? We thought we were doing the right thing, it turned out it werent. But we fixed it and the city is safe. We re heroes.""

""We both knew what Brughl was and what he ment to do. We were ready for him to end it all and start fresh."" David said, shaking his head. 

""tricked. We knew excacly what we were getting into."" John looked at him, his eyes narrowing. 

""What are you getting at?"" david looked up at john. looked him right in the eyes.

""We fought for this city. fought evil everyday."" David stood up and started to pace. 

""but it never mattered how many lives we saved. how many criminals we put behind bars. it got worse and worse. we both knew it. But Brughl offored us a way out. A way to start over with us at the helm."" He stopped his pacing and faced John.

""He could have made us gods. We would have shaped a new world free from evil. If the others hadnt shown up, i really think we would have destroyed everything."" he sat back down next to his freind staring at the statue of his lost youth. 

""But hey, they did make a statue of us. so i guess we re heroes.""With those final words,  David got up and left. John stayed on the bench a while longer, rubbing his legand thinking about Davids words. They had been so close, if only Catherine hadnt interfered. The thought of Catherine sent a fresh jolt of pain down his leg.

When it passed, he got up and took one final look at the statue. The two men in the statue had saved the city, John and David had almost destroyed it. The people needed the two heroes, needed to belive in them. They didnt need John and David.",ehSteve336

"[WP] Enemies of the crown are to be hung until dead, you've been stubbornly hanging for 3 days.",TheGinofGan,"**Day 4**: Three days I've hung. For three days I've not seen the sun. I'm not sure if that's lucky or not. At this rate, I'll long for the searing light of the sun's fire within the week. See, the townspeople didn't know how to kill me, but they sure wanted me dead. Everyone wanted me dead. My kind dead. Still, I took them for fools. Restrain me with iron chains, and then what? I knew the only thing that they knew could hurt me was one thing they couldn't control. So they hung me until it would arrive and burn the flesh from my bones. But the sun hasn't come. For three days I've hung in the snow, frozen water on my frozen flesh, sky the color of my skin. I know not when it will be done. At this rate, I will starve before the sun kills me. I already feel it, the hunger, the *lust* for blood. I needed to kill. So many exposed, juicy sacks of blood walked around me each day, tempting me. I could hear their heartbeat, smell the sweet aroma of my prey.

**Day 7**: I've hung here for an eternity. I have lived for what most would consider an eternity. But this was torture. This was hell. Only a monster more cruel than even *me* could dream up such pain. I wanted to destroy them. Destroy them all. Drain them of their blood in front of each other. Tear them limb from limb. One of them stabbed me. Out of spite he stabbed a hanging man. It took an hour to heal. So much longer than it should. Not much longer to heal. Need to feed. *Need to Feed!*

**Day 15**: *Food. Need food. Blood? Where blood? There! Small, weak, mine! No. Still can't reach neck. Still can't reach neck. Still can't move. Still see. See all necks, see all blood! See bright light.*",oddjobbber

"[WP] Enemies of the crown are to be hung until dead, you've been stubbornly hanging for 3 days.",TheGinofGan,"Is he dead yet?""

""No,"" I attempted croak in response. The noose was too tight to let any air flow actually pass across my vocal chords. The word didn't actually pass my lips, but I did stare quite vigorously. Well, staring was a bit of a stretch as the crows had eaten my eyes the night previous.

""I don't think so. I think he just stared at you quite vigorously.""

""Huh, well isn't that a thing.""

I was having such a wonderful dream when these two deep thinkers decided it would be a good time to disturb me. I was in a tug of war contest with ten of the most beautiful women in the world. All I had to do was lose and I could experience all their worldly charms. It really pissed them off that I refused to let go. Letting go was for pussies.

""So, what do we do now?""

""You leave me alone, you dumbasses,"" I really wanted to tell them.

""I don't know. Usually they are dead by now.""

The first clown stretched his leg out and kicked me, setting me to swinging.

""Was that really necessary?"" I didn't ask them.

""I think he just stared at you vigorously again.""

""That's just creepy.""

""So what do we do?""

""I don't know.""

""You could cut me down.""

""We could cut him down.""

""What for? The birds have pecked out his eyes and his liver and his.... uh, his other stuff.""

""Don't talk about that. I have been trying to avoid looking there. Makes me shiver just thinking about it.""

""Pussy,"" I didn't call him.

""Is he dead yet?"" a third voice asked. A new voice. Were they having a damn party?

""Sir, it doesn't seem so.""

""He keeps staring vigorously at us. Um... sir. Sorry.""

""Damn, that's creepy.""

""What should we do with him, sir.""

The third voice was silent for what seemed an eternity. Technically everything seemed like an eternity since all I had to occupy myself with was hanging here providing a feast for the local murder of crows. The greedy bastards.

""He was always a stubborn bastard,"" he sighed. ""Alright, you win. Got it? You always win.""

""Well it's about time you realized that, you stupid idiot,"" I didn't sarcastically spit at him. And then I let myself die.",Levitar1

""Oh hello!"" The woman batted her eyelashes, turning towards her own hallway, intermittently glancing casually away from the door as she spoke, as if someone else were watching. 

""Hello ma'am."" The man's voice was deep, I daresay, chocolate-y. ""Someone ordered a **big sausage pizza**."" 

The woman giggled, and leaned forward, exposing her chest from her low-cut top. ""Oh yes, I really love **big sausage pizza**... I just hope its big enough."" 

The man chuckled. ""Oh, its big enough alright."" 

""Would you like to come inside?"" The woman asked, huskily. 

""I always come inside."" The man said slyly, stepping through the door. They walked into the living room where the woman had set out a single plate with a fork and knife for herself. As she sat, the man spoke again. 

""Are you ready for the BBC?"" 

The woman laughed again. ""So you noticed my penchant for British media?"" She indicated towards her flat-screen TV - BBC America was playing a marathon of *Dr. Who*. 

The man smiled. ""Who doesn't like BBC?"" He put the pizza down, opening the box  revealing a **big sausage pizza**. ""Now..."" His chocolate-y voice became even more low and sultry. ""About my tip.""

""Fuck. They said 35-45. I hope they didn't undercook my lunch..."" I muttered.

It rang again. I tucked in lil me under the waistband of my pants and ran to the door. I swung it open just as the doorbell rang once more.

Before me stood a beautiful girl, maybe 17? 18? You can never tell nowadays. She wore a skin tight shirt, and cutoff jeans. I've got a thing for blondes, and holy shit did she fit the bill. Her long, supple legs seemed to continue forever. It must've been really hot out today, because a gentle sweat had formed on her brow, causing her golden locks to stick to her face cutely. A soft, slender hand pushed the hairs out of her eyes, and behind her ears. 

""Uh, that'll be $15.75, please"" She said. Her pouty red lips were talking to me, though her eyes were slowly drawn south, paste my hard, chiseled abs, to my pants. I guess I hadn't tucked in properly cause lil me was pitching a tent in my sweats. I involuntarily throbbed, causing her to gasp sharply. Slowly, she began to reach for it. To tell you the truth, I didn't even notice, because I couldn't tear my eyes away from the sexy, large round beauties that lay right above her tan, taught midriff.

""I don't take kindly to lemon thieves, you know. I have no sympathy what-so-ever.""
Of course, I was pulling her leg. I didn't give a damn about a few lemons, I have a whole orchard in the backyard. Before I could even utter a word, she says

""Oh my god! I am so sorry! But these lemons looked so tasty... c-could you let me go this time? I really love lemons, especially yours. Is there anything I can do to change your mind?""

As tempting as her figure, I knew I was married. With a wife and two kids, one boy and a girl. I loved my wife, but god damn did this lemon thief have a good body.  

""I don't give a damn if they looked tasty, I'm about to call the cops.""
As I turned around, I heard a bang. I looked to my stomach and saw red. I turned around, and fell to the ground. I saw my own blood drip down the backyard white marble steps, dripping away to the very person who shot me. My grip on life was fading, and so was my vision. The lemon thief laughs at me in my final moments. Too bad for her though, those weren't actually lemons. They were really C4 lemons.

'I forgot to remove my ring,' Lyla said. 'It slipped and fell down, and now I can't get it out because my hand is stuck in there.'

Jake grabbed her arm and tried to pull it out, but his mother whimpered at the discomfort.

'We'll have to cut through the sink, or maybe cut my hand off.'

'Stop being dramatic, mom,' Jake snapped at her. He immediately regretted his tone. 'I'm sorry, mom. Did you try oil?'

'I can't reach oil from here,' Lyla replied. Jake looked around for a bottle of oil. He found Coconut Oil in a drawer, but the bottle was almost empty. He had a thought, so he quickly turned around and left the kitchen.

'Okay, now stay still and move your hand slowly while I do this.'

Jake held the bottle and poured the substance on his mother's hand. Her wrist was coated by the sticky, viscous liquid and her skin was slippery.

""I just want to thank you guys for letting me stay here through this whole mess,"" Eve said solemnly, looking down at her plate.

""Of course, Eva,"" I said. ""I know this must be a difficult time for you. I know it's still so soon after the divorce, but do you want to talk about what happened?""

My wife, Mary, elbowed me and shot me a glare that would make a wild buffalo recoil.

""It's fine,"" Eva assured us. ""We just grew apart. Fell out of love."" She paused, doing her best to hold back a tear. ""I suppose it's for the best,"" she continued, regaining her composure. ""I'm young. I'm not sure I was even ready for marriage.""

Mary put a hand Eva's and smiled comfortingly. ""You are young,"" she consoled her, ""and you have so much time to figure it all out. You'll meet so many new people, and one of them is going to be the perfect fit for you.""

Eva looked up, smiling, though her eyes were filled with sadness. ""I hope so,"" she said.

""That's the spirit,"" I said. ""We're pulling for you.""

Mary smiled and nodded. ""So. Were you thinking about going out with the girls tonight?"" she asked. ""It might be nice to get out there and have some fun.""

""Yes, actually,"" Eva said, ""but I was sort of hoping you'd come with me. Remember all the fun we had in college?""

""Not really,"" joked Mary, laughing. ""I spent most of those years too drunk to find my car keys.""

""It could be so much fun!"" Eva said, her face lighting up. ""You were such a party animal!""

""And then she grew up,"" I said, winking at Mary. She kicked me under the table, playfully. ""Jim's right, though,"" Mary said, turning back to Eva. ""Those days have passed. I don't think it's really my scene anymore.""

Eva nodded in acceptance and continued eating. The rest of the dinner was silent, though only in sound. More than a few times, I saw Eva stealing glances at me. I was beginning to think this might not have been the best idea...
**********
Later that night, I was coming back to bed when I heard sobbing through our bedroom wall. Mary's eyes were full of concern.

""Is she alright?"" I asked. ""She's been crying for a while now.""

""She's really vulnerable right now,"" Mary replied. ""She tried having fun with her friends, but she can't seem to get her mind off of Tommy."" 

""I wish there was something we could do,"" I said.

""We can only let her wait.""

I nodded, agreeing. I asked, carefully, ""Do you have an idea as to how long that might take?""

Mary shrugged her shoulders and sighed. ""Few days. Weeks. I'm not sure. Heart break is a tricky thing.""

I felt uneasy. I was sincerely hoping that it wouldn't take that long. With our history, it wasn't a good idea to have her here for so long. Things were fine while she and Tommy were together; now that they were splitting up, and seeing the way Eva looked at me last night, I was starting to think things were going to get much more complicated.

""As long as it takes to help her, then,"" I conceded, and went to sleep.
****************
I woke up the next day and headed to the bathroom. I opened the door and saw Eva sitting on the tub, still in her clothes from the night before, sobbing, her head bent forward as her shoulders quaked. 

""Oh,"" I mumbled, ""sorry."" I turned to go but she called out to me.

""No, I'm sorry,"" she said, getting up to her feet. ""I can go.""

She walked towards the door but stopped beside me, lingering. I could almost feel her holding her breath. She looked up at me, her eyes, puffy and red, still somehow stunning, as green as if they'd been wrought with the first leaves of spring.

""Jim..."" she began, choking up a bit. ""Jim, you've been so good to me. Now and before. I know it must be a little tense for Mary, knowing our history, b--""

""Wait,"" I said, and turned to the bathroom door. I looked around, but Mary was nowhere close to us. I shut the door and turned the lock. ""Eva, you have to be careful talking about that,"" I whispered, ""especially when Mary's home. She doesn't know about us--that we ever--you know...""

She looked up at me, confused. ""You never told her?""

""No,"" I replied. ""Mary and I were on a break when I met you. I didn't think we were ever going to get back together, so I didn't see any harm in you and I pursuing anything. I was scared to tell her; I didn't want her to think I was cheating on her.""

""But you weren't..."" she said. ""Like you said, you weren't together at the time.""

""I just can't let her know I made that kind of mistake when we were so committed already.""

She looked as if I'd stabbed her through the heart. ""I didn't think it was a mistake,"" she whispered as a single tear rolled from her emerald eyes. ""I know we weren't together long...but I cared about you. You meant so much to me. You made me so happy..."" She reached out and held my hand.

I paused. I couldn't bear to tell her that I was happy, too. We had fun. She made my heart skip whenever she called. I hadn't felt the same since Mary and I got back together.

But we were back together, and a commitment is a commitment. I couldn't fill her with any false hopes.

I pulled my hand away. ""I'm sorry, Eva. I'm sorry."" I walked out.
******************
I rinsed the soap from my hands at the kitchen sink and began drying the dishes. I turned as I heard a shuffling behind me. Eva. I knew what this was about. Thankfully, Mary had left earlier to go shopping. I was safe, for now.

""Jim, I have something to say,"" she said, resolutely.

""Look, Eva, I'm sorry for wh--""

""Let's run away together.""

I stood there in shock, trying to process what she'd just said.

""You and me. Let's go,"" she said.

I started to piece together what she meant. I should have seen this coming. ""Eva, you don't know what you're talking about,"" I said, exasperated. ""You've only just recently got out of a relationship. You're emotional.""

""No, Jim,"" she said, coming closer to me. ""I'm not. I know what I want. I know what I've always wanted. Do you know why Tommy and I 'grew apart?' Why we 'fell out of love?' It's because I've always loved you. And I know you've always loved me too.""

""Eva, no..."" I started, but faltered. Maybe she was right. Mary and I were happy enough, but it wasn't the same as when I was with Eva. The euphoria of being with her was still ingrained in my memory. And, as much as I hated to admit it, I did miss her. Maybe that's why I had suggested she stay with us in the first place....

""Do you remember?"" she said, coming closer still. ""Do you remember what you said? How you took me in your arms and told me that no one had ever made you feel the way you did? How time stood still, and all the better to make the moment last? You loved me Jim. You still do.""

I looked away. I couldn't fight her while looking into those eyes...those eyes that held so many memories, that held so much meaning to me. The ones that have haunted my dreams since college. ""No, Eva, I don't,"" I said, unsure if I believed it myself. ""I'm with Mary. I love her. We're married.""

""So was I!"" she said, her voice raised in desperation. ""And look how that ended! With him walking off with some cheap floozy, only cementing what I knew then to be true -- that the biggest mistake of my life was letting you out of it!""

I turned to look at her, and saw that she was only inches away. I longed to reach out and hold her.

""Say it,"" she demanded, or rather pleaded, ""Say you love me. Say you always loved me. For once, be honest with me. With yourself!""

I couldn't take it anymore. I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her in, and kissed her deeply. It was so exciting, so new, yet so familiar. As if they were the lips I'd been meant to kiss for the past 6 years, not Mary's. She hugged me in close, pulling herself in close, as if for fear that she might not be able to hold on again.

I pulled away and looked deeply into her eyes. For the first time since we'd last kissed, I saw light. She was happy. And I was, too.

""Eva,"" I said, just barely above a whisper, ""I love you.""

""What?"" she sighed, her face lighting up, splitting into a brilliant smile that was at least six years overdue.

""I love you,"" I said. ""Eva, I love you!""

*Crash*. The sound of metal hitting the floor made my heart drop. A single can of green beans rolled through the kitchen, coming to a stop between Eva and myself. I turned to look, knowing my worst fear was to be realized.

Mary stood in the doorway to the kitchen, eyes filled with fury and with tears. A torn paper bag with spilled, cracked eggs and a leaking gallon of milk stood at her feet as she stared at me, with death in her eyes.

""Go."" she rasped.

I let go of Eva. ""Mary,"" I pleaded, stepping towards her, ""Mary please, it's not what you --""

""I. Said. ***GO***,"" she bellowed. ""*GET OUT! NOW!"" She stormed away, heading for the door.

I heard it slam shut, leaving me standing in the kitchen, confused, wondering what was to come next...",meat_sword

Soon there were lots of men coming to Linda's house wanting their chance to make Linda happy. It was just like the Princesses who tried to fit into Cinderella's shoe. The men had no trouble fitting into Linda's shoe; sometimes two men tried on Linda's shoes at the same time and once three men had on three of Linda's shoes at the same.

The Doctor discovered Linda had misplaced her happy making parts. Fortunately he was able to reach her happy making parts with his special equipment and Linda burst into a wave of happiness the like of which she had never experienced.

Linda was selfish and insisted Doctor John make her happy over and over again until Doctor John's happy making equipment could not aspire the the heights it had once been able to achieve.

"[CW] Take the plot from any pornography, and make a non-sexual short story out of it.",boredguy456,"I liked Gigi. We'd lived across the street from her family for a dozen years. She was only six at the time, running around in pigtails and learning to ride a bike. Now she was a senior in high school; 18 years old and the pigtails were nowhere in sight. 

She'd been babysitting for us for several years, and as time wore on I'd noticed some changes. They weren't big at first, but over time they became more noticeable. Sometimes it was that devilish grin or a knowing look. Sometimes she'd linger for a moment before walking out the door after I'd paid her. 

For a while I'd managed to push the thought out of my head. Surely, I was misreading things. Gigi was a good girl, her father and I were close friends. If I acted on this, there was no turning back... No, I wasn't imagining it. 

I rememeber it vividly. My wife was called away from our date to attend to a patient. It was late enough that the kids would already be in bed. I'd be alone with Gigi. I could act. 

As I walked into the entry way, I closed the door quietly behind me. I could feel my temperature rising and my heart pounding as I anticipated what was about to take place. 

""Gigi,"" I called as I rounded the corner into our living room.

""Oh! Hi, Mark, I didn't expect you home yet,"" she replied, a saccharine sweet smile playing across her lips. ""Where's Mrs. Spaulding?""

""She was called in to see a patient... Look, Gigi... I need to talk to you, and I need to do it now.""

""Sure, Mr. S,"" she said with a slight hesitation, ""Anything you want.""

As I looked into her eyes, I found myself more sure than ever. Every suspicion I'd had was true. As I took a single step forward, placing a hand on her arm, I asked her the question I'd needed to for months.

The pool was a private affair, one of those double ovals with ornate tiles. ""The thingy stopped bubbling.  It's supposed to bubble."" Selina pointed daintily at the filter exchange, and then bit her finger playfully.

Randy, the pool boy, got into the pool.  Flecks of water sprayed onto Selina's face, who gave a crisp little ""eek!"". 

The cool, clear water soaked through Randy's tight shorts, revealing an impressive bulge and six pack abs.  After a moment, he looked up at Selina.  ""I'll have to shove something into this hole.""

""Please do,"" Selina urged.

Randy pulled out his instrument, and with a swishing wet pop, shoved it tight into the filter exchange.  There was an ecstasy of surging, pushing and pulling.  Then something exploded out of the exchange.

""Well, here's your problem,"" Randy said, lifting up a bloated, soggy rat. ""This little  sucker went for a late night swim and got stuck right in there.""

Selina heard only half of this, as she threw up in the beer cooler.

""Something else you might want to consider is your PH levels here."" Randy lifted the marker out of the water and pointed at the red line.  ""It is WAY too high.  Let the chlorine tab dissolve fully before you add another one.""

"[WP] You step into an elevator. Far below the standard button panel, just above the floor, you see a button marked '-666'.",drewhead118,"My finger hovered above the button. *What's the worst that could possibly happen?* a small voice inside my head asked. It went pretty well for Charlie and Wonka, but ""Up and Out"" was a bit more descriptive than just... -666. *What's the* ***best*** *that could happen?* another voice asked and I nearly listened to that one. After all, the devil's number... and negative? The wise voice inside my head audibly shuddered but the curious one prevailed and I pressed the button.

I felt the elevator lurch into motion and it slowly started downwards. The floors *dinged* by and I unconsciously counted in my head, marking off each one. It paused at thirteen and a slender man in a plain white suit stepped on, nodding at me curtly with a sly smile. ""Which floor?"" I asked politely.

""Same as you,"" he answered and I felt my skin crawl. I stepped towards the doors, deciding to just take the stairs, but they closed before I could reach and I sighed and stepped back into my corner. He stood confidently in the middle of the elevator, ignoring all etiquette that would have had him in an opposite corner or at the very least against a wall.

I might have imagined it, but I swear I could hear a devious cackle echo down the elevator shaft. I reached for the button marked **G**, hoping the elevator would respond before we passed it. We were at the tenth floor now. ""Just to bug the next person?"" the slender man asked, turning towards me. His skin was pale and his eyes were a strange brown that almost seemed red in the dim elevator light.

""I... That's ground,"" I mumbled softly and he shook his head. I glanced next to the **G** at the 1. ""I guess not..."" He smiled again and I shivered. It wasn't a comforting smile. It was more the type of smile that could make a baby cry, which is a meritorious skill but I was afraid I would start crying instead.

The first floor *dinged* by and I slouched back into my corner in resignation to await the next six-hundred and some floors. He glanced at his watch and I noticed again the pale skin and the long, untrimmed fingernails curving into what looked like claws. He caught me staring and I glanced down nervously. ""Go there often?"" he asked quietly and I nearly shat myself when the cackle definitely came from deep within him this time. 

""N... I... Where?"" I finally opted to ask. I could feel his sly smile and I tugged at my tie, the growing heat starting to become unbearable. He lazily lifted one of the razor-sharp fingers and gestured towards the door, or maybe downwards, I couldn't quite tell. Either way, I knew my curiosity had finally bested me and here I was, stuck in the elevator with Satan himself, or perhaps one of his spawn.

The elevator *dinged* one last time and the elevator came to a stop. I was cowering in the corner, hands over my head as he awkwardly stood by waiting.. I glanced up through the cracks between my fingers as the doors hissed open and hot steam crept in through the opening. He was standing right above me, looking down at the miserable mortal curled at his feet. I winced as he reached into his pocket.

He pulled out a business card and let it flutter down to the ground by my side. ""You may want to work on your elevator speech. It was a bit weak,"" he commented as he exited the elevator. The doors hissed shut and I cautiously reached out for the card.

**Bill Gates, CEO**, it read in bold letters across the front and I sobbed into my sleeve as my heart finally returned to its normal pace and the doors opened at the first floor.

[WP] You are gifted the power to swim in volcanos. What you find under Yellowstone changes the world forever..,green__dino,"PT. 2    
And so the sloshy swish of magma mush pulsed on indiscernably across my eyes and yes, my entire naked (but lube-protected) body.  I'd taken a good gulp of air back at that misplaced tea party and if that snooty lord was at all correct, I'd get to some place sooner than later.  The flow I was engulfed in, at any rate, was chugging along faster than blood to a boner.    
It gave me the briefest moment to reflect for a short instant on the chain of events leading here; *Magma Lube?  Jump down a volcano?  This sounds like creative license when I repeat it in my head, but what the Englishman said stood to reason.  ""Anomalous improbability.""  As soon as one totally unlikely thing occurs, the probability of another occurring increases.  Some sort of strange dream, I recall now.  That was it.    
Am I in the dream?  This seems pretty dream-like; waking up with a bucket of magma-retardant and impulsively leaving my cabin at Yellowstone to jump down a volcano.  And yet... it doesn't.  I can feel the purpose.  There's a reason for going down he--*    
The stream of thought ended as abruptly as the stream of magma, which poured out like a waterf...like a firefall into a massive and ungodly lake of fry.  I tumbled helplessly wailing out unnecessary vowels for the word 'fuck' (fuiouaeeouaaauuaack) before plopping in with a massively satisfactory *kersplunk*.  I splish-splashed to the subterranean surface of this endless cavern and found hardened land in the form of some black and glittering rocks.  Pulling myself to the surface in the midst of falling ash and giant boulders dislodging I gaped in awe of this totally fucking metal scene.  Just picture it for a second; I'm on this jagged volcanic rock, now with a sort of sporadic dirty mineral obsidian suit forming on my body, beholding this endless immense cavern full of glowing embers the size of basketballs getting chucked around; fire is pouring out in massive gushes from every which way along the walls and my ears are vibrating from the sheer rage of so much shit being on fire.  I'm standing there, in complete and utter awe of this underground nightmare when won't you guess who showed up.  That's right.    
The goddamned devil.    
His unfathomably massive form surged out from the lava in a fireworks display of magma sputter, rearing horns the size of airplanes and leering with orange eyes whose gaze was making the air crackle.  His wings shot up at each side and just barely scraped the massive cavern ceiling, causing stalactites and debris to come raining down.  Waist-deep in the magma with long black arms outstretched to show he could at any moment crush my bitchass, he let out a snarl from his magma dripping mug that sent unholy echoes in every direction.  To say I was scared would be stupid.  I was in complete goddamn metal.    
The demon spoke thus: *""ROO TAH MA LOO""* its booming voice was rattling out complete fucking gibberish, but I must admit it sounded cool as shit and totally made the scene for me.  I nodded and slowly realized I could actually make it out.  It was actual gibberish, but I got the drift.  He was saying *""Isn't this whole scene so FUCKING COOL?!""* to which I replied *""MA TOOOOO""*    
This whole exchange went on for a few minutes.  If I had a video of it you'd shit your pants upon watching it.  The conversation revealed some important points.  Firstly, not the devil.  The creature's name was ACHOO who ate rocks for a living and jumped at any opportunity to be epic as fuck.  Secondly, there is clearly some shit down here that will change the world forever.  I didn't actually get from ACHOO.  Excuse me.  I didn't actually get from ACHOO what specifically was down here but he did point me in the right direction.  You should've seen him point his huge fiery finger off into the distance, all hulking and fiery-eyed, it was fucking Gandalf epic.    
So I thanked him with a high-pitched *""WAAAAAAAAAA""* and gingerly worked my way along the lava bank.  As I departed he gave a slow smug nod in mutual appreciation of his coolness, and slowly sank back into the swirling magma.  I was getting close to something.

[WP] You are gifted the power to swim in volcanos. What you find under Yellowstone changes the world forever..,green__dino,"It was afternoon when I made the brisk trek out to the primary spring I was acquainted with.  It was the closest in my mind to any sort of volcanic ""entrance,"" as it were.  The weather was fair enough to just my flip flops and a robe, and the boardwalk steps made the path an easy one.  There were still some passersby having a look at the spring, trying to glance over to see how far down that blue rocky hole might stretch.  I placed the heavy bucket down near them, the one conspicuously labelled ""Magma Lube"" and opened it.  As soon as I started rubbing copious amounts of the material all over my body the passersby began to stare and inquire.  Their questions would have to wait.  A vorpal sensation rose in my guts and I took that to believe the lube was kicking in.  Not a moment to spare.  I climbed atop the boardwalk railing and dove into the scathing spring, immediately kicking down and away from the screams of shock above.    
Now just upon passing down and out of sight a few realities sank in.  One was that I had no light source, and the other was that I had no air supply.  The outcropping had narrowed to the point where feeling my way about would suffice, but I was on the verge of drowning before I discovered the first tiny rise in rock which provided an air bubble.  I stuck my head up and took a deep breath before spelunking back down, ever deeper and hotter.    
The water itself only struck my mind as lukewarm, though a tingling sensation rippled over my skin and reminded me of the growing intense simmer that surrounded me.  Deeper and deeper, the simmer grew to a boil.  A faint toaster oven light grew into a hellish orange-yellow brilliance, all-encompassing yet turgid with mineral variety.  I was lost in the blinding bedlam, swept this way and that by magma flows as my trunks were incinerated off.  I was a cursed soul in the abyssal underworld desperate for air and any sense of direction or purchase.  In the terror of my lava swirl my hand finally gripped an object that halted me.  A...a door handle?    
I turned it and spewed with a sizable mess of magma into a wide and cozy room, gasping and sweating.  ""I say,"" exclaimed an irritated English accent.  ""How does one so shamelessly intrude unclothed and with females present!""  I looked around to see a group of Victorian aristocrats gaping at me over tea and biscuits.    
""Well what the fuck me?"" I replied, wondering if my brain had been hard-boiled.  ""How are you down here having tea time in a volcano?"" The Englishman scowled disparagingly and said ""Typical American cad.  Anomalous improbability, of course.""  I repeated 'anomalous improbability' skeptically, covering up my obsidian semi-encrusted junk with my hands and standing up.    
The Englishman looked impatiently at his other guests and said quickly ""Having tea in a volcano is no more improbable than swimming in one, old boy.  Any explanation for how you managed down here?  Eh?""    
""Touche,"" I conceded, standing there awkwardly now.    
""Jolly good, now if you'd be on your way I'm sure you'll get where you're going.""    
""Uh...alright but can I just catch my breath for a second?""    
The Englishman flared his nostrils and nodded after a beat ""very well.""  It took me about 2 minutes before I was breathing normal again, all the while with this crew of Victorians gawking at me.  ""Ok,"" I said uncertainly.  ""Gonna...leave now..""  I stumbled a bit over the cooling magma, walking backwards, before gently opening the door slipping back into the swishing hot ooze.  It took some leverage to close the door behind me but I was able to do so with only a minimum of lava leakage.  I released the handle and was once again swept off.  (continue?)",PalmBeacham

Not far down my path did the shoreline begin to widen and grow, though still perforated with interspersed veins of bulging magma.  The white hot stuff had always fascinated me and having it all over my naked body now made me curious of its taste.  I mean uh...wow that rock looks like a hot chick with big boobs.    
Thankfully, in any case, I wasn't straight up naked anymore; after emerging from the magma enough of it had cooled to form a craggly shell around me, and during my stroll I'd chipped away here and there with my magma-lubed fingers to look like less of a rock lobster.    
A startling realization was dawning on me, flanked by a peculiar apprehension at the particular ease of my journey.  I was trying to recall the dream I'd had, and the man who'd given me the bucket of Magma Lube.  *The man!  It was a man, that's right.  He was...green?  No...he had big eyes, black eyes.  A long nose, freakishly long.  No mouth, but he said something.  I asked him a question and he said ""probably.""  What did I ask?? Will....will...will something*    
A twinkle caught my eye and cast my thought aside.  I looked about and lost it; took a step back and again *twinkle*.  I focused and squinted then found it.  An opening at the base of the rock wall, quite small but clearly rectangular, and framed in solid diamond.  I ran over in excitement and stopped at the entrance, peering in cautiously.  ""Wow"" I said with a small crackle as some obsidian chipped off my face.  It was a downward passage, a smooth descent spiraling with Fibonacci precision, composed top to bottom of solid diamond.    
I entered quickly and began feeling up the walls, checking where they met with the floor.  ""It's one fucking piece, it's one solid fucking diamond"" I was muttering to myself in fascination.  I noticed a faint auroric glow deeper in and began to descend, rock slowly chipping off my feet and causing a strange harmonic echo.    
Once my feet were completely bare (notwithstanding the Lube) a strange feeling began to course through me with each step.  The harmony had intensified to a chorus and I could feel my brain humming with it.  My feet felt smooth against the diamond, smooth enough to slide.  With a sure step, I struck downward and the diamond rang out like a celestial bell and began sliding down the spiral like a downhill racer.  My feet were like fingertips on a giant wine glass, sliding down and ringing so loud I thought my skull might shatter.  Faster and faster, leaning to the right to follow through with the endless turn.    
But soon I could see it wasn't endless.  The passage was narrowing.  Slowly but surely, it would become too small to continue, and yet I couldn't stop myself.  I was going incredibly fast at this point, and the distant glow had intensified to meet the omniscient harmony.  Shimmering streaks of light began to pulse past me, singing their own note in the harmonic chorus as I bolted down and down.  The streaks increased with my speed until it appeared my descent was somehow activating a machine.  The trapezoidal passage was almost too narrow to continue, slowly becoming more elliptical as well.  The streaks of light were rippling all around and the smooth crystal was becoming an ecstatic blur.  With bent knees and squinted eyes I could no longer fathom how fast I was going, only that the shrinking passage was about to crush me.  When the harmonics and the light reached their apex I let out a shriek of terror and exhilaration and a sound like a clap of thunder made my world black.    
Darkness.  Strange endless musings consisting of neither word nor image.  Pure infinite nothing.    
Then the sound again.  The sound of pure light.  Then the thunder.    
BOOM eyes open as fuck and I'm looking around wildly screaming ""HOOO LEEE SHIIIIIIT""  before the lightning fast next 40 minutes flash by and I am calm and stationary enough to realize I'm still way way way down underground, deeper than deep.  Behind me, a solid wall of diamond with no apparent entrance.  In front, a yawning cavern with the occasional intricate crystal formation, steam spewing from distant alcoves but not a large concentration of magma, that had become sporadic.    
It was comforting though, the ground.  I wanted to put a little distance between myself and these eldritch-whatever-the-fuck-diamonds that had just shot me through fuck-all.  ""I'll get back to what the shit just happened later, I suppose.""  I said to myself.    
*Good*, replied a voice in my mind.  I looked around wildly again and saw nothing in my midst, then heard to my left a harmonic hum and went bug-eyed as I spotted its source.  ""Oh hell fuck shit dick no.""    
*'Hellfuckdickshitno' to you too.  Or you say 'hello' for short, right?*    
""Not to be rude, but after that wild as fuck ride I just took I'm not sure how I feel about mystic crystal revelations.""  I was talking to a diamond or some such whatthefuckery.    
*I'm not a mystic crystal revelation, I'm sentient crystal flora.  Sentient crystal flora.  Sentient crystal flora.*    
""Why say it three times?""    
*Because I read your mind about to say ""A what?  A what the fuck?""*    
""True,"" I said.    
The thing was a knee-high arrangement of translucent terraced window-squares and rectangles, projecting out and receding within here or there, depending on your perspective.  I felt like I lacked the ability to see in enough dimensions to fully fathom what I was looking at.  Despite encountering subterranean Englishmen and a behemoth Cool-Demon, something about this entity gnawed at me.  Call me a dirty racist but I wasn't about to trust one of these goddamn sneaky no good sentient diamonds.    
*It's sentient crystal flora, not diamond...and that's very hurtful.*  The sentient crystal flo--the fucking SCF radiated a flare of taken-abackedness.    
""Oh...well...hey man--hey rock I didn't ask you to--*    
*Wow, rock?  Jesus Christ, mineral, if you have to call me such names.*   
""Well hey min I'm not asking you to probe my mind, if you're gonna read it you're gonna come across the occasional fucked up shit.""    
*I'm not probing your mind, shitbag, you just happen to be bombarding me with psychic nonsense, all you humans pollute the psywaves with your incessant shit talking.*    
""Jeez, then...I'm sorry for psyching you out.""    
The min hummed what must've been a sigh and moved in such a way that my eyes involuntarily crossed upon seeing it;  must've been a shrug.  *Just because I'm a 9th-dimension being doesn't mean I don't have what you Spacelanders call 'feelings.'*   
I negated attempting to imagine what the 9th dimension entails and stood there feeling abashed.  ""Um...can we maybe just start over?""    
*That would be great.*    
""Great.  So I'm looking for--""    
*You don't even know what you're looking for, I can read that in your psych.  I know what you're looking for*   
""Of course you do."" I rolled my eyes.  ""Where to then?""  Let me just say 'it nodded its head in the direction of a steep canyon in the distance' rather than lose my sanity trying to put into words the quantum shift in spatial reality that actually occurred in this being's extradimensional movements.  Dirty....sneaky, tricky, no good crysta-- *My god, do you even hear yourself?*    
Oh...right.  Sorry.

( 23:17, Thursday, 1st of Thaw, 348, Terran Coalition) 
A ruthless wind sweeps across the valley. A circle of yellow and blue tents are obscured by the white wrath of the skies. A blizzard is coming. That is inconsequential. The will of the north cannot stop progress. I look ahead, a great mountain towered in my path. It has begun. My team, Marked by their bright orange parkas were all trailing behind the guide. The guide made a gesture, informing the group that we had reached the first fork in the road. I can still remember when we first discovered my ability. it was during the great fracturing, while our world was changing. Africa split in three parts, the subcontinent India reversed it's path and began floating away from Asia. I was on Everest the day it split. I was there. I fell in the great chasm and I thought I was dead. It was weeks could before they pulled me from the molten bosom of the earth. My clothes were singed off. I was shamelessly exposed in the nurturing core of the earth. but, the team who rescued my were all in fire retardant and heat resistant full body suits. As soon as it was exposed, it was exploited. The governments of the world put me to work, and I was a international celebrity. I became wonderfully wealthy. I was fantastically, extraordinarily, and unfufilingly (I think that's a word) wealthy. My body is worn and frail, and I am old, yet my people have pulled me from my retirement to do this one last mission: Yellowstone. Whenever the new sub-plate satellites (To determine the location of earthquakes and whatnot.) pass over this area they light up like an earthquake was going to happen right at this moment, but never did. a sort of regret came over me. I wish that i never had my power, that i could lead a normal life, not  be some kind of surveying tool for whatever government I work for. My group had now reached the foot of the mountain. the trek from now on would be excruciating. my group hauled up the mountain, past mountain creeks and trees. and the occasional sighting of wildlife. Oh how I wish I could visit here while I was young, and I was not a slave to the will of gods, or kings. the blizzard had subsided while we were this trail of remembrance. and we were now on a relatively flat ground the scientists will set up base camp, while I and a few choice companions will set up at the point of entry. This new way, to the entrance of the volcano(?) was much more difficult, it was little more than a game path, and the the animals did very to maintain the path aside from preventing it from being overgrown. This, this time, I had a suspicion, this time, I will not come down from the mountain. as I near the geothermal ventilation shaft, the feeling only grows stronger. The wind roars in our ears, and I nod that this is the spot. I can sense it. it calls to me. I strip down despite the hostile weather. No god or king can stop me from shedding my chains. I delve deep into the darkness of the hole, with an indescribable fervency, hunger even. I see the soft, welcoming glow of the magma. I am probably standing in head that would kill any other. Not me. not me, no god or man can stop me. i swan dive into the pool. 

""SWEET EARTH MOTHER, WELCOME ME."" I shout hoarsely as i dive in.

the life blood of the planet sloshes in my wake. When i open my eyes, there is no magma, no welcoming mother. Only a cold hard chamber with thirteen thrones carved in the wall. The thrones radiate an intoxicating feeling, drawing me in ever closer. I can now see clearly where I am. I am at the throne room of the world, ruled jointly by thirteen supreme beings. I must appeal to them, for their mercy.

""Forgive me. I am ignorant. Please forgive me."" I chant closing my eyes as doing so. 

""There is no forgiveness, no mercy in the world we have created"" A voice echos back.

Stunned, I open my eyes now seeing the figure that the stone bore. I now realize that mercy is a human creation. a weakness. 

""Nature is cruel, so we must be cruel too,"" The figure that the stone bore continues. 

""For your insolence, your people have been punished, but they have escaped their punishments. But YOU cannot escape US."" The punctuation seems to petrify even time itself, these words are being said now, yet at every moment at once. I now understand that this room is above time itself.

""You will now be punished."" 

The ceiling falls in. 

( 02:17, Friday, 2nd of Thaw, 348, Terran Coalition) 

""The idiot swan dived into the molten rock, are we sure this dude is even sane?"" Chris chuckles

""The brass seems to think so."" I reply coldly.

""Loosen up, I'm already convinced that that your a robot, so you can stop acting. What do you actually think about this guy?"" Chris inquires. 

""Well hes don-"" I am cut off

""Holy shit he's gone dark"" Chris panics

""WHAT!!!??"" I scream

Chris' fingers scramble accost his laptop, frantically searching for some kind of scrap that he is wrong. 
Thirty minutes pass and proves hes right. Humanity will never know what lies under Yellowstone.

[WP] Luck is a finite resource.,hpcisco7965,"“What you gotta ask yourself is: are you feeling lucky, punk?” Andy asked the switchblade wielding slacker in front of him. The young man’s knife hand wavered uncertainly although Andy hadn’t made a move for his gun.

Fun fact: A Seer once told Andy that there was a nearby parallel universe in which that line was a quote by someone called “Dirty Harry” instead of Larry Page, as it was in this reality. Andy had no idea who “Dirty Harry” was — he presumed it was a porn star over in that reality. But the thought always brought a slight smile to the corners of his mouth, and he loved the way that enigmatic smirk always unnerved the perps.

“Well? Do you?” he asked and put his hands on his hips in a way that placed his right hand dangerously close to the holstered gun. He locked eyes with the wannabe gang banger, and just kept up that confident smirk that seemed to have left the kid frozen with doubt. Then a siren blipped briefly as his partner rounded the corner and pulled up beside him. Even before his partner could hop out of the black and white, the kid had dropped the knife and put his hands on his head, apparently deciding to save his Luck for some other day.

“You have got to be kidding me,” Andy’s partner Rachel told him after she had cuffed the perp and put him in the back seat. “I *told* you not to pull anything until I got here. You *knew* I was less than sixty seconds away. But you had to be a goddamned hero again, didn’t you?”

“Kid would have gotten away,” Andy said simply.

“Trivial offender,” she replied. “Kid’s a shoplifter.”

“With a knife,” Andy reminded her.

“You’re not helping your case, Andy. You realize that?” she told him, as they climbed into the car and returned to the station to book their perp.

It was the usual hassle getting the kid through booking, giving statements, filling out reports. Paperwork. Worst part of the job. The Lieutenant wasn’t happy when he read the report. Gave Andy the usual bawling out for being a cowboy. Then on his way out, he glared at Rachel on general principles as if it were her fault she didn’t act more like a mother hen. 

“He’s got a point, Andy. Nobody has a limitless supply of Luck, you know.”

“So they keep telling me,” Andy replied. “That’s why I don’t rely on Luck.” 

“Oh give me a break. You face down armed perps without ever drawing your gun. You don’t wait for backup. You piss off your superior officer on a routine basis. Oh, and don’t even get me started on winning the office 50-50 raffle last week.”

“Come on! That last one isn’t even fair. I’m not so stupid as to use up any Luck on petty gambling. What was the pot? Forty-seven bucks? That just happened.” 

It really wasn’t fair, actually, and deep down Rachel knew it. *Nobody* was stupid enough to use up their Luck on gambling, because it only pitted you against other people who wanted to win just as badly as you. And when Luck played against Luck, it was just a speedy way for everyone to waste their Luck. Still, she wasn’t about to admit she was wrong so easily. 

“Nothing just *happens*,” she told him, glibly repeating the common wisdom.

“Bullsh*t! Listen, you wanna know what I think? I think people obsess about Luck way too much.” He paused a second while he thought it over, picking his words carefully. “There’s two kinds of luck in this world. The capital ‘L’ kind, and that’s all anyone ever thinks about: where you get to bend fate in your chosen direction. And we all know you can only do that so much until it’s gone. So who wants to be an idiot and use it all up? Then there’s regular lowercase ‘l’ luck. That's just stuff happening. Good or bad, it’s still luck.”

They emerged from the station house and reclaimed their vehicle, Andy insisting he wanted to drive for a while this time while they resumed their patrols. “I still think you’re making excuses,” Rachel told him as she slammed the door and belted in. “You take way too many chances for a guy who ‘isn’t relying on Luck’.”  But Andy was silent for a long moment while the patrol car pulled into traffic and began its first slow cruise through their beat. 

“What if I told you,” Andy began hesitantly, as though he wasn’t sure he wanted to admit this. “That I haven’t used any Luck at all even one day on the job for eight years now?”

Rachel turned sideways in her seat to stare at him, searching carefully to see if there was the slightest trace on his face that he was kidding or lying. She was pretty sure he wasn’t kidding. And she’d ridden with him for four years now, so she felt reasonably confident he wasn’t lying. At least, if he was, he was *really* good at it. Every halfway decent cop had to learn how to spot a liar. It was part of the job, after all. “You haven’t?” she asked, genuinely shocked.

“Nope,” he said simply, and his face was a study in perfect frankness.

“Why the hell not? You’re in a dangerous job, Andy. Not using your Luck could get you killed. Hell, you could get *me* killed, for that matter.”  She was genuinely aghast at the way this conversation was heading. Then her eyes narrowed. And she asked: “You’re not one of those hoarders are you?” 

Hoarders were almost universally scorned. They saved up their Luck for years, or sometimes their entire lives, supposedly because they thought someday they might want to use it all on something really big later on. But it was like a sickness, and most of them never did find their One Big Thing that they always talked about. So they just went through life drifting from one bad situation to another because they never wanted to waste any Luck to help themselves.

“Nah,” he said quickly. “Nothing like that.”

“Well why then? What is it? A pride thing? You think you’re too good for Luck or something?”

“No! Hell no. It’s not that,” he assured her. “It’s just…” He trailed off, and stared at the taillights of the car in front of him for a moment before finishing. “It’s just that I used up the last of my Luck the day of that gangland shootout when my last partner was killed.”

Rachel stared at him for a long moment, silently willing him to say that he was only kidding. Hell, she almost tapped a little of her own Luck to encourage him to say it, although she knew that saying it wouldn’t make it true. “So, all this time we’ve been riding together, my partner hasn’t been using Luck because he didn’t have any to use?”

“That’s about it.”

“Does the Lieutenant know? Does anybody at the station?”

“Hell no! I was afraid they’d push me out of doing the job.”

She nodded. They certainly would. At the very least, he’d be riding a desk the rest of his career. The union sure as hell wouldn’t help him. They’d probably tell him it was for his own good. 

“You gonna rat me out?” he asked. She did a double take and stared at him, a little shocked at the bluntness of the question. It took her a very long time to consider the matter.

“No,” she said at last. 

“What if I get myself — or you — killed? Like you said: it’s a dangerous job.”

They rode along in silence for a time while she thought about this, wondering if she had fully considered all the implications of her initial answer. But then finally, she turned to her partner and told him: “If it comes right down to it, I guess I’ll have to be Lucky for both of us.”

I held the gun as level as I could while shrugging. It wasn't easy. ""Regardless,"" I said. ""That's why I'm here.""

She screwed up her face.

""What are you doing?""

""Quiet,"" she told me. ""I'm thinking.""

There was an awkward moment. ""What -""

""Sshhhh!""

""Hey!"" I said. ""Think later. Wipe the primary and hand over the discs. Jesus.""

She didn't move. ""We've got a team,"" she said. ""Whole team of people thinking up paradoxes. I don't think we did this one. I'm trying to figure it out myself. It's difficult. Normally we've got, like, six others people thinking too.""

""What?"" I asked. ""That's fucking ridiculous. Why would I be here if you *didn't* invent time travel?""

She looked around. ""Because,"" she said, ""the thing is...""

I gaped. ""Are you looking for a pen?"" I asked. ""Are you going to draw me a fucking diagram? I'm a fucking time traveller from the future! Don't patronise me!""

""I'm not, you asshole!"" she said, loudly but without unkindness. There was a resignation as she abandoned the search for whatever crayons she felt I deserved. ""I'm not saying you can't change the past. But all the changes you made? You could make them because you knew about them.""

I couldn't see what she was saying.

""The fact that you *did* time travel is... proof.""

I started to get a sinking feeling. 

""Listen. If you time traveled, then you're not capable of stopping time travel. If you're here, stopping time travel, then *we* didn't invent time travel.""

""Who did?"" I asked.

She shrugged. ""All I know is,"" we got the credit for it. Someone made sure that this lab was given the credit. That way all time travel leads back here. Someone out there has covered their tracks and made sure that the trail ends here.""

""Fuck,"" I said. I thought of the horrors ahead. The wars, the famine. ""You know what this means?""

She smiled. ""Yeah, I do,"" she said. ""I'm going to be rich!""",Guybrushes

His head pounded; maybe tequila had been a bad idea. He reached his hand up to his face to wipe the sleep away.

It didn’t feel like his hand.

His eyes flew open and he saw his arms, string beans, half the size that they were when he went to sleep. He reached for his glasses on the nightstand, smacking into a wall of cold metal. Looking through a glass pane to a gray warehouse ceiling, he found is vision was perfectly fine. A cloth band was wrapped around his chest, partially elastic, his ankles bound by the same material. 

Panic set in. With his arms free he attempted to tear open the cloth straps. They were locked to whatever he was laying on. He couldn’t sit up. He realized he was screaming.

“Jared? Jared, I need you to calm down,” a voice said, echoing in Jared’s metal chamber. Was it his father’s voice? “I know this is a bit overwhelming but you need to relax. I’ll be right there to get you out.”

“Where the fuck am I!?” Jared shouted. “Dad? Is that you?”

He could hear breathing through the speaker. “Well,” the voice finally said, “sort of. Just - just hold on for a moment.”

“Am I dead?”

The voice chuckled. “Far from it. Hold on.” The speaker clicked off. Jared’s head was spinning. He ran through the last day in his head: wake up at noon, class at 4, hit the bong after class, pregaming at 8:30, get to the mixer at 10, back to his dorm room by 3 in the morning, then sleep. Had he been so drunk that someone had been able to kidnap him in his sleep? He wasn’t even sure he had made it back to his room - he had blacked out.

His father popped his head over the glass pane on the top of the chamber. “Good morning.”

“Dad! Holy shit.” Despite his father’s presence, he could still feel his tension tearing at his body. “Dad, where am I?”

“In California. One second,” he said, moving away from the chamber. Jared waited anxiously for several seconds before he heard a loud mechanical click. The chamber began to open slowly. He could feel the air pressure change around him, and he noticed that the straps on his body were loose; the locks had popped open. Being able to move he finally noticed the extent to which his body had changed. He was thin, near emaciated. His clean shaven face had a short beard growing, and his hair was near his chin. The shock set in and he found himself immobile, staring down at his body.

“Dad what the fuck is happening. What happened to me? Did I go to the hospital? Am I in the hospital?”

“Look, Jared,” his father began, coming to stand next to the chamber. “You’re going to have a lot of questions, and I’ll do my best to answer all of them. No, you are not in a hospital, but you’re going to see a doctor in the next couple minutes. Just know that everything is fine and it’s all being taken care of.”

“But...where am I?”

His father sighed and put a hand on his shoulder. The touch was odd, almost painful to Jared. “Welcome to reality.”

It's me, your brother,"" he said rudely as he plopped down next to me on the bench in the park. He smelled a bit worse than the shit I took that morning and looked pretty damn homeless. That, combined with the fact that I was an only child, made me doubt the fact that he was my brother. 

""I don't think you are,"" I explained politely, edging towards the end of the bench. He inched closer. ""

""I meant your cousin. Hi. It's me, your cousin."" I shook my head as I smelt the whiskey and cigarettes on his breath. ""May I bother you for a moment?"" he asked.

""You already have,"" I answered and got up to leave. He grabbed my arm and I tensed, ready to ninja chop his jugular, just like Mac had taught me.

""Seriously now, listen to me, Charlie."" I froze. How did he know my name? He grinned a toothless smile. ""It's me,"" he repeated and I shook my head. Dumb luck, most likely. ""I mean, it's you. I'm you. Or you're me. I'm from the future."" My jaw dropped open, appalled at the level of stupidity I was being confronted with. He must have sensed my doubt. I shook my head and wrenched my arm free from his grip. ""Your name is Charlie, you live with your dad and you work at a bar."" I frowned. Oddly accurate. Too much so, in fact, for it to just be luck. I sat down again.

""Alright, future Charlie,"" I said to him, settling on the most likely explanation. He must be a time traveler. He grinned again and I shuddered, hoping I wouldn't turn out like that before remembering I already had. Or hadn't I? Or would I? A little bit mind boggling, in all honesty. ""What can I do for you?""

He grabbed my hand with his filthy, veiny hand and inched a little bit closer. ""I have an important message. From the future. From me. Or from you. Because you're me and I'm you.""

""I got that, man. Can you hurry it up though? There's rats to kill."" 

""It's about that, Charlie. You have to stop killing rats."" I frowned. Killing rats was my lifeblood. Drown 'em, whack 'em, nail-bat 'em... I couldn't stop. It's what I did best. I shook my head. ""Seriously, you have to. The PTSD gets to you and you wind up like this. Stop now, man. While there's time."" With that, he let go of my hand and stumbled off the park bench before face-planting into the concrete path.

""Ahh, shit, I think he's dead,"" I mumbled as I turned him over and saw the pool of blood starting to grow. I shrugged and left him there, just like Dennis would have.

""Guys, I'm done killing rats,"" I announced as I entered the bar. They were huddled on the stools discussing some devious scheme.

""Shut up, Charlie. We're doing something important,"" Dennis spat at me. ""What do you mean you're done killing rats? That's your job. Go in the basement and kill rats until you're done with these stupid ideas."" He thrust the bat at me. ""Go, peasant. Run along."" 

""No, seriously,"" I objected and he stared at me in shock. ""Future me told me I had to stop. I can't keep doing it.""

Dennis glanced at Mac and then at Dee and then back towards me. ""You been drinking paint again, Charlie?"" Had I? No, I had cereal this morning. Cereal with what? Oh. With paint. I nodded. ""Exactly. Run along."" I grabbed the bat and made my way into the basement, hunting another rat to kill. As I smashed its head in, the faint smell of whiskey and cigarettes whiffed towards me and I took a sip from the open paint can to keep away the images of the thousands of rats I had killed.

""Not a whole lot Synthia."" Joah said looking like he was on auto pilot his brain a million miles away.

""So there’s nothing we can do?""

""No, the military is totally unprepared for this situation and every last Super is unaccounted for.  We have to assume…""

""assume what?"" Synthias usual monotone expression desperate for a response

""That they are Dead Synthia"" Tears dropped from Joah's cheeks and the station cut to a commercial about cat food.

***

""They are all dead? HA no more Mr. Limblifter, Dr. Dragon, or The Bastion to stop us. Ooooooo No Bastion! YEAH!"" There was an uproar as the council clapped, cheered and hugged.

“Fools!” Bannic groaned as he pursed his lips, everyone looked at him for a second only giving him a seconds look as he got up from his chair, leaving the table with now the most powerful men on the planet.  The Council of Calamity, a group of the best super villains on earth sat in their chairs cheering clapping each other on the backs.  Bannic turned looked at them all as he walked out of the room.  “I could have used them” He said to no one, Bannic had a habit of talking to himself.  

Once outside Bannic proceeded to grab the corner of the building, arms pulsing as the walls started to crumbled, then focusing his other abilities that he rarely used, focused the pressure evenly across the two walls creating the whole structure to start tumbling. Bannic heard the door rattle but he had wedged it closed with something uncrecognizable, ""That better hold them"" Bastion muttered to himself. Being the last to show up he had barricaded all the doors and this was a warehouse no windows to be seen.  Within a few minutes the whole council was ground to dust.

“Amateurs” Bannic said as he got in his Corvette and drove off. The night sky was extra bright tonight, there were glowing dots protruding where stars should have been.  They didn’t look much different except that they were brighter and if you watched long enough you noticed that they moved relative to the other stars.  They were coming and something needed to be done.

Bannic had gone to the council seeking help, telling them that the Heros were all but destroyed.  Of course most already knew, and no one gave him much notice. Everyone thought he was a low level thug and never put much stock into his abilities so they never expected him to do something so drastic. 

Interpol was the first to report globally what had happened. They had been tracking The Human Mine for months using government sat time. They had been putting together a case and were just waiting for the show to drop when the whole building had come down on their little project. What was this madness Bannic was a low level thug, his big claim to fame was that he had fought every Super hand to hand and lived to talk about it.

No government agency had any reports of Bannic being able to take down whole buildings let alone some power that allowed him to use it to crush an elite squad of the world best super villains.  There were few heroes that could do that and they just never did.  It was against their code, and the 1976 Charter of Heros. It prevented vigilantes and defined clear lines that you just don’t cross. By the end of the hour every government that had access to a government imaging was pointing one or more at Bannic trying to figure out what this meant.

In the meantime Bannic drove, and went straight west on the i180 going over 190 mph passing everything from trucks and cars to police, who were told quickly not to engage in the individual.

“Where the hell is he going?” A tall man in a military uniform asked  someone sitting at a console staring at a monitor.

“Well his projection points him going directly the L.A. but there’s nothing left out there, hasn’t been for 30 years since it was torched.”

“Well there’s something out there, you don’t go kill every bad guy you ever worked with one day and drive out to one of the most restricted areas for nothing.  Something's out there, I want to know what he’s doing, why and what we have to expect.”

“What about the Fleet sir shouldn’t we be watching them?”

“Yes but it’s pretty easy to look at impending doom coming down from above and realize there’s not much point in watching it.  They will be here when they get here and in the meantime I want to know what the hell is going on.”

“yes sir”

***

“Welp this is it” Bannic stood in front of the shell of a large mansion as the sun came up in the horizon.  The whole thing had been burnt out and the stone structure that was left was crumbling and covered in black ash. Bannic hopped up the steps and walked through what normally would have been the entry and went through the rubble looking for something.  Once he found the right spot he closed his eyes and pointed himself east. LIfted up his left hand looking for a lever that wasn’t there then took two more steps forward. He opened his eyes and looked.  Banged his foot two times onto the floor.  Nothing happened.  With a small groan Bannic kneeled down and cleared the debris away the grabbed two floor boards and pulled as hard as he could.  There was a small creek then a pop and a crack as Bannic pulled the floorboard out. He exposed the guts of a machine connected with wire and other pieces. They had long lost their power and backup batteries if functioning damaging the building no longer had juice.  Bannic cut the wires and kicked a few of the internals until a small dial was exposed.  THen taking care to not damage things further he took out a crowbar ramming it into the dial and turned. The stuck latch moved slowly but it did move. 

Once there was enough of an exposed gap, Bannic slipped through and slid down through the hole to some stairs.  Then made his way down into a vast exposed hall. It was filled with many different things, large guns ,small guns, odd trinkets with dials and jackets.  It looked like it was a thrift shop based in a clothing store that was doing a poor job to cover up a military depot. At the end was a blue suite with a helmet on top, it was accented in green and was made with some sort of metal. It shined bright even in the dark hall with no light at all the whole place light up. Getting closer Bannic saw that it had a thick layer of dust on it but it still looked brilliant even in this dark pit.

He lifted off the helmet first.  Put it on and it immediately ran up form fitting to his head as it booted up. The helmet grabbed him and pulled so close that Bannic thought he was going to be choked out.  He push back at the helmet and it just latched on tighter.  Just as he thought he was going to start gagging for breath it eased up. Noticing that he had closed his eyes in terror, something he hadn’t done before, he suddenly thought he had knocked the helmet off. He looked around but there was no edge the visor at all. He could see as if he hadn’t had it on at all. The only way he could tell it was on was by the feeling he had when he touched his face.  His fingers told him that he was wearing it but his head had other ideas. Finally a heads up display popped up in front of him.  This gave him statistics on everything labeling things around the room and giving all kinds of information that he couldn’t process at the moment.

After taking some time to adjust to the display and helmet Bannic put the rest on.  This time he was ready for the suite to form to his body and he found that the rest of the suite was much more barrable to put on. 

“Computer what does this thing look like on me anyways”

The computer took him to a mirror.  Looking into it he saw himself. The perfect image of the Blue eagle. Well maybe not perfect, his shoulders were much broader and he stood probably 6 inches taller, but from far away no one was going to know.

Bannic kicked his heals and before he could say “let’s get the hell out of Dodge” the suite shot him up in the direction he chose and he blasted out of the cave flying. 

“Hrmm that’s going to take some getting used to” Bannic said to himself, as he flew past a fleet of military trucks and cargo vans surrounding the estate.",oqnet

[WP] Make a Fantasy War Adventure in an Ancient Magical World...,20Survivor20,"There was no way that he could have beaten Nou.

Her enemy was just a one-daggered Brute. While he may have been stronger with the buffs his blade gave him, she still had almost a hundred Haste daggers on her, providing her with extra speed and agility.

From the way the Brute held the blade in his slightly quivering hand, Nou could tell that he had never used a Strength dagger in a fight before. His grip looked closer to a Rock's defensive stance, and his balance was slightly off. Nou shook her head softly.

Before the man had a chance to react, Nou reached into her pouch and grabbed some of her own daggers, tapping them in the process. She quickly jumped forward and flung two spinning blades at her opponent. Normally Dashers wouldn't rely on ranged attacks, but she wanted to test her enemy's true skill, and plus, a bit of confusion never harmed anyone. Except her targets, of course.

A puzzled look came over the man's face as he flung the flying blades away with a practiced parry. No one had seen a double-Attributed person in the past hundred years... or had he just imagined Nou's speed? *Looks like my practice paid off,* she thought as her foe adjusted his grip into an anti-Ranger position, designed to easily block off any thrown attacks with the flat of the dagger.

Seeing her chance, Nou dashed forward, grabbing a few more daggers to increase her speed. Her opponent tried to change his hold on his dagger into a more stabby position, but too late - Nou had already sunk her knifes deep into the Brute's vital points.

He gasped for breath. ""You... were you... doubled?""

She shook her head, picking up his blade. ""Just practiced."" She flicked the thick, curved blade. It rang softly. *Good metal.* Some would pay a large sum for just this one knife; it stored a lot of power. She dropped it into her pouch.

Behind her, the man stopped gasping. She pulled her knifes out and walked away.",Iy13n

"[WP] A small port is found ransacked and utterly destroyed, all are dead save a lone boy who speaks of a flaming ship captained by Lucifer himself.",Adolf-senpai,"Looking back with the wonderful gift of hindsight, I'm not so sure what I saw that day was supernatural. I no longer know if the thunderheads were really there or if I imprinted them in my memories after the fact to assure myself of the sinister nature of what I saw. I was a young boy of nine or ten - many years ago now. I often sneaked off to the docks to see if I could steal a fish or two just for the hell of it - we weren't wanting for food or money even though we were far from well-off. I do know that I noticed something in the distance, off on the horizon. Others did too.

Smoke billowed into what I recall as a dark and threatening sky burning red. It was still early morning, only the fishermen were about. It wasn't a wealthy town but the fishing was good and was our largest trade, pocked by prostitutes and the few wealthy merchants with ships going to and fro from the pier. Of course the ladies of the night were not out at such an early hour, just the bustle of men loading up their ships to make their catch for the day and a small mercantile vessel headed back to whatever strange land it came from.

The ashen cloud rising into the crisp morning sky caught the attention of the sailors. The business of the morning turned to urgency as the source was determined to be a ship caught fire. A few of the fishing boats loaded up quickly to meet the vessel and launch a rescue. I watched from the tip of the furthest dock, careful to stay out of the way of the heroic men rushing off to aid the ship.

As the ship drew closer and the fishing boats shrank into the distance I could see black sails all alight with flame. Unfortunately the flame spread from the source to the surrounding vessels. The boat had drawn close enough that I could see the rescue mission abandoned as men dove into the water, all of them on fire. I couldn't believe my eyes. The urgency on the docks had hit a fever pitch now, the remaining fishermen and dock workers struggling to decide what to do next.

The flaming ship drew nearer, it was a schooner and approaching quickly. The merchants panicked, leaving much of their wares behind and opting for an attempt at escape. All of the rescue boats started to flounder and sink while the black sails loomed ever nearer. The smell was brought in by the ocean breeze, not just ash and smoke but the scent of burning flesh seemed to linger in amongst the more familiar scents. I instinctively covered my mouth.

Once the merchant ship set sail it had no choice but to go past the schooner and out of the cove. I am certain I saw flaming debris fly from the fiery vessel to the even smaller ship. The sound of cannon fire led me to believe the ship was fired on intentionally. The merchants didn't even have the luxury of catching fire, the small boat sank like a stone.

The blaze on the ship was awesomely terrifying. I sat in horror, transfixed by what I was seeing. The same as the rest of the men at port. My skin crawled but I couldn't tear myself away. It loomed threateningly, ever closing in the distance to the shore. None of the men ran, I remember it vividly. It's not exactly a difficult concept to grasp anyway, this pier was their livelihood. They armed themselves with fishing spears and sticks and whatever weapons they could find. They were ready to stand and fight, if they didn't die there they would surely die in poverty.

At this point, when they took arms, I shrank back, hiding behind a fishing stall, terrified but still unable to run. Once the schooner reached the docks it simply kept on sailing. I was certain it was pirates at this point, and now as I look back with the eyes of an old man I believe I was right then.

But as it approached I could see a man standing at the prow. He was burning. An ungodly sound came from him. I withered in fright. Surely this could not have been some lunatic pirates, they would have burned to death by this point. The boat crashed into the dock, burning tinder broke off and smashed about the piers. The fishermen raised their weapons as fire rained down on them and I cursed myself for cowering while they stood to fight. Of course I was a boy and I don't regret my cowardice.

Men leapt off the ship, some landing in the water and some making it onto the docks. Flames caught on everything, even the soaked wood. Everything began to catch fire. These were the flames of hell and I no longer felt like I existed at this point. I was merely experiencing something terrifying. The man on the front of the boat cackled madly - or what I might look back and say were horrifying screams as he burned. At the time I was convinced that it was the devil himself, come to take us all away aboard his ship of the damned.

Everything was on fire and at this point I ran. I ran for the nearby village, away from the terror. I never saw to completion what transpired. But I heard a thunderous sound, but I never looked back to see what it was. I met townsfolk on the way, the inferno unfolding at the port had finally drawn their attention.

I screamed and rambled. I'm sure I told them about Lucifer bringing hell to engulf us all.

By the time anyone reached the port it was charred and unrecognizable. I will never fully know what happened that day. The town's economy fell apart after that day, most of us ended up impoverished and everyone fled to a new life. I think the village stands as a ghost town even now.

I like to think that my over-active childhood imagination got the better of me. The man on the prow was simply burning to death as I watched, which is honestly of little comfort to me. I imagine some explosives or such had been housed on the ship. No one knows, everything was burning so hot that no one could do anything to prevent the destruction, complete immolation of the lively port was the only possible outcome.

I do know though, that even if all I saw were dozens of men dying that day, if all that I saw was a man dying in front of me, if the men who stood to fight at the docks were caught in an explosion, I certainly looked directly into the mouth of hell that day.",Trish-the-Stalker

The old man sitting in the chair across from me blinked and nodded slowly.  His kids - both adults - rolled their eyes.  I did my best to ignore them.

""Why...yes, I do,"" he said, after a moments hesitation.  I nodded my head and glanced off to the side, where the ghost of a young lady with blonde hair bounced excited.  She raised her arms over her head and bent them to form an ""M"", as though she were acting out the moves to YMCA.

""Is her name...Mmmmmm...?""

""Margret?""

""Dad, you're not supposed to tell him,"" his son sighed.  The daughter just rolled her eyes and checked her watch.  The ghost of the young woman nodded her head feverishly, then indicated to her ring finger.

""And Margret was your...wife?""

""Yes!  How did you...""

""Because it's OBVIOUS, Dad,"" his daughter interjected.  ""Of course he knew it was about Mom, he just guessed by your age and the fact she's not here - ""

""And Margret was blonde, with kind, brown eyes, right?"" I was getting desperate, looking over the ghost for information.  ""Wore glasses...? Small, pointy nose?""

The old man smiled with joy.  ""Yes!!! That's her!  You described her perfectly!""

""He's basing her description off us, Dad.  Beth has blonde hair, I have mom's nose, and we both have glasses.  You don't have any of those things.""

""She's trying to say something about..."" the ghost panned out her hand and pantomimed putting something on the table.  ""...something about money?  She's saying something about money.""  The kids groaned out loud at this, but the ghost continued on.  

""She's writing...a letter?""  The man opened his mouth the speak, but the ghost was already shaking her head.  ""No - a check?  She wrote a check?  Something about a check?""  This was getting pretty difficult.  The blonde, ghostly woman pretended to write something down with exaggerated hand motions, then made a show of picking it up and putting it in...something?  Oh - an envelope, judging by how she was licking the air between her hands.  ""She says a check had been mailed.""

The man sitting across from me frowned and pondered on this for a moment, his kids impatiently tapping their feet behind him.  The ghostly woman waited anxiously, hovering over his shoulder.

""Well..."" he said after a long moment.  ""I was...supposed to make a mortgage payment last week...but I keep forgetting to get around to it."" The ghost silently clapped her hands together, triumphant.  That was it?  They contacted me from the afterlife, just to make a mortgage payment?

""Margret usually handled the finances, see...""

""Dad! Don't tell this guy about your finances, he's scamming you enough already without you handing out your social security number, too!"" Margret was already fading, however, her unfinished business now complete.  Silently, she floated down eye-level with the old man and leaned forward to plant a gentle kiss on his cheek.  She pulled back, wisps of ghostly image slipping off her as the seconds passed.

""She says...she says she loves you very much,"" I said after a moment.  The old man touched his cheek where the ghostly lips had been, eyes staring off in the distance.

""Oh Margret...I miss you every day...""

To their credit, his kids had stopped with their eye rolls and seemed genuinely sad.  Even if they didn't believe me, they obviously still cared for their father.

""She's gone,"" I said after a moment.

The last trails of ghost dust vanished from view as Margret the Ghost, Mother, and Loving Wife disappeared from view, leaving only the living.  We sat like that for a moment longer before the son coughed awkwardly.  ""So...uh...how much do we owe you for the session?""

~~        ~~

As I was seeing them out the door, the daughter stopped behind.

""Listen,"" she started out.  ""I know it has to be a sweet gig doing this, and I *despise* how you prey on the old and grieving - "" 

I bit my lip.  I knew not everyone believed and how bad the whole thing looked - talking to the dead, working out charades for information, guessing my way to the answer - but I'd been given a gift.  There weren't very many other jobs out there that let me use it, and I wasn't prepared to let it go to waste.  I opened my mouth to say all this, but she cut me off.  

"" - but thanks.  For the piece of mind.  He's been...different.  Ever since mom passed.  We wouldn't have come here at all, but my friend Jill was talking about how people need closure and how ghost-whisperers can help and...well, thanks.""

I nodded my head silently, and she turned to follow her remaining family out into the parking lot.  Once they had disappeared from view I retreated into the dim interior of my office.  Very rarely do I get thanks from the friends and family members of the people who visit me, and what the woman - Beth, I think her name was - said had left me feeling...well...happy?  That was a rare emotion for someone in my line of work.

I settled down in my office chair and closed my eyes.  This job could be stressful; I'd learned long ago the dead and living can't speak to one another, not even through me.  It was all guesswork and charades (which I'd never been great at).  It wasn't that the dead couldn't talk, as I'd realized after a years of working in this line of business.  

The living simply didn't listen.",evictedSaint
[WP] An ancient evil has fallen asleep.,Cunt_Bucket_,"""That's what she said.""

""You really believe that?""

""Uh, yeah?""

The two men stood atop the cliffside. One looked over the edge, while the other smoked his cigarette, breathing in and out the fear of what's to come.

""Look,"" said the smoker. ""This evil has taken on many forms throughout our close circle of friends. It was J's abusive husband. Then it was N's alcoholic father. Then it left E after she killed herself. And for a while, it was your sloth and my pride.""

""And now you think it's just asleep? Yeah, and you'll meet Gaijin Goombah in real life one day.""

""I will! I just need to pay attention to his con schedule.""

The smoker rolled his eyes. He tapped some ash off his cig into the ocean.

""We survived it thanks to those inoculations.""

""No, I was inoculated. You accidentally swallowed the vaccine after eating her-""

""Point is,"" interrupted the smoker, ""we both rejected the evil. Saw it leave our bodies, form into the shape of an evil face, and then disappear into nothing.""

""Never before has puke been so terrifying.""

""It is terrifying! This creature fell from heaven, took over innocent people to drive them to darkness, and just when we are about to kill it, it disappears.""

""Yeah. Until Trump wins the election at least.""

The smoker sighed, annoyed. ""Ha ha. Seriously, we tracked it here. Now what?""

Both looked over the edge. Under the water was a faint silhouette of a large creature. The tail, the body, the wings spread out, the long slender neck, all of it could be seen from above.

Worst of all, it looked at big as a football field. And they wanted to kill it.

""How did Amanda know this was here?"" Asked the smoker.

""She's read tarot cards for a living. Why wouldn't she?""

""By that logic, your Cards Against Humanity Let's Play will boost your comedy career."" 

""And you asked how I would meet Gaijin!"" He said proudly.

The smoker realized how little sense he made. ""You're an idiot. What's the plan?""

The nonsmoker looked scared. ""Wait, you don't know?""

""No. I thought you did!""

""Me?!"" Yelled the non smoker echoing into the ocean. ""You're the leader! You should know!""

""Well!"" Screamed the smoker, throwing the smoke onto the ground. ""If neither of us know, what's left?""

""I could always get inside you again.""

Both froze in place, then looked to the sky. Before them was a dragon's face, with black eyes and blue scaly skin. And the cruelest smile on its face.

""I'd guarantee a better time than your attempts at playing Super Mario Maker.""

""Hey,"" said the non smoker. ""If the Completionist can do it, so can I.""

""Run, you idiot!"" Yelled the smoker.

And they did into the night. Unsure whether this was worth continuing.

And while their bickering awoke the ancient evil, at least they didn't suck at separating sentences in a Reddit post.

[WP] An ancient evil has fallen asleep.,Cunt_Bucket_,"She slept.

I felt my mind relax as the onslaught abated.  My body followed and I slumped to the ground.  I squeezed my eyes shut, as if that would help wash the memories of agony from my memory.  I slowly exhaled a heavy breath, once, twice, three times.   Fatigue washed over me and for a moment I felt the urge to let my self pass into unconsciousness.   Oblivion, as momentary as it might be, pulled heavily on me. 

I couldn't.  I couldn't shirk my duties.  I struggled back to my feet and gazed down on my mortal foe.   The source of all evil and hate in the world.

She didn't look evil while she slept.  Her beauty, normally hidden behind a hideous visage, crept out from its hiding place, rising and falling with each gentle breath.

No, she wasn't beautiful.  That wasn't the word.

Vulnerable, maybe.  Definitely.  Vulnerable, yes, that was the correct word.

Then it struck me.  She was vulnerable.  I could end the madness.  I could save the world from her madness.  I could save innocent souls from her wrath.
I could save myself from a life of agony.

Could I do it?  Could I strike now?  Could I muster the will?  Could I muster the courage?  Could I muster the strength.

No.  I couldn't do it.  Who would take the kids to school tomorrow?

the longest day ends in a bed

the entire world is now dead


She sleeps and dreams and shakes and shutters

Half-awake she mumbles, mutters

""Leave me, leave me. Thousand souls

tortured, burning in black holes

I had no choice i had to take you

i wish i could've spared a few

it was my nature not my wish

a lot of you sleep with the fish

you can't forgive me easily

when i wake i want to see

what eternal life can bring

after winter maybe spring

Forgive me, for i have sinned

a million voices in the wind

heavy dream and restless sleep

i'm not awake but still i weep

Please forgive me i'll ignite

a candle in this longest night

a light for all you souls in pain

to light the twilight once again""

On the morrow she wakes up

lights a candle on a stub

carries fire carefully

builds a wooden pile at the sea

then burns herself on a stake

and all the souls are now awake",onaeronautilus
[WP] Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't win the Oscar for The Revenant. He becomes reclusive and disappears from the public eye for awhile. Then members of the academy begin to disappear...,CyborgBurger,"Leo felt that it was a cruel and unusual punishment, that he'd have to watch the Oscars in prison, but a part of him wanted to see who would win this year, who would steal yet another one of his victories, and so kept quiet.

Spotlights and curtains on the TV. It was all very familiar to him. Leo'd been in that same room, walked that same carpet quite a few times by now. He had to remind himself not to spit on the screen.

His beard and hair were unshaven, down to his shoulders and with flecks of gray from the years and the stress. Something of his boyish good looks would have remained, had it not been for his eyes. They were cold blue, and as dead as a starless sky.

He hadn't meant to do it. Not at first. It had all started when one of the Academy had invited him to a private dinner. They had talked, and they had laughed, and things had been going relatively well until she'd brought up Django Unchained and the character of Candie. And then Leo found himself standing over a corpse. He'd used a wine glass. The blood was real and red on his hands. And he had enjoyed it.

One by one, once a year, Leo killed them. Another rejection, another corpse. Someone should've caught on by then. But no one did until number seven.

It'd been seven years since the incident with the dinner. This year, Leo had played Albert Einstein. He was getting wild and old enough to look the part. He'd studied every breathing moment for that role. He'd even created a new quantum theory, in his research.

And he'd lost, to Samuel Jackson, who'd played Morgan Freeman in a biopic. The nerve! All he had to do was make his voice sound deep and croaky! Leo chose a baseball bat that night.

His victim was tougher than he'd thought. He lived a bit longer to. Long enough to write the word ""Leo"" in blood on the floor. The trial was quick. All the pieces had fallen into place. Leo was tried and imprisoned for seven counts of murder and a moving violation.

The story was sensational. Hollywood's golden boy, a murderer all this time. Crack theories and new revelations would linger on headlines for months. They wrote books about it. Some idiot even made a movie. *Oscar Bait,* it was called. It looked fake, dumb, and poorly written. Leo hadn't bothered with it. HE was too busy waiting for the electric chair.

He blinked away from the television and stared at the wall. It wasn't fair. Just one time. One time, and he wouldn't have had to kill all those people. A single teardrop rolled down his wrinkled cheek. He stared at blank white until he heard the word ""Best Actor"" come from the screen.

He whirled around.

""And tonight's Best Actor award...""

He held his breath.

""Goes to...""

Who would cheat him now?

[WP] Your Xbox Live friend is God. Unfortunately he's not very good at video games.,Holidaythief,"I'd met Caesar while playing Call of Duty 4 back in the day. Day after day we would play together, and day after day Caesar would get absolutely destroyed in game. What I didn't notice, however, was that every time someone no-scoped, ninja defused, noob tubed, or any other humiliating thing against him, they would just disconnect. 

It took me a while to put two and two together, so one day I confronted him about it. I asked him if he worked for Infinity Ward or Activision and was banning people or cutting their connection when they would embarrass him. 

He laughed a good bit at that, but said no. 

That's when he explained to me that he was in fact, a god. He was capable of controlling anything and everything in the physical world, but couldn't affect anything in the game world. So when someone made him mad in game, he just... disconnected them in the only way he was capable. 

A first it scared me a little that he was taking out in game frustration on real world lives, but then it hit me... my Xbox buddy is a god. So we talked some more and he hooked me up with everything imaginable. A new house with the most incredible gaming setup anyone had ever seen, beautiful women, a great job, you name it, he provided it and life had been pretty great having Caesar as a friend. 

We were playing a game of Search and Destroy yesterday. It was Caesar, myself, and my clan mates. I had a pretty great team, and Caesar has always wanted in, but I always told him our roster is full, and honestly, he was so bad that I didn't want him joining. 

It was the fourth round in the game, and we were winning three to nothing, but Caesar dropped a doughnut and gotten zero kills.

""FUCK. Fucking faggot noob tubed me again!"" he yelled. 

""It's all right man, we're still gonna win this thing,"" I said, trying to calm him down. 

""Yeah! Because of your clan! You know what? I want on it. I want to play competitive with you guys!""

""Uh... sorry Caesar, our roster is full.""

""Bullshit,"" he shouted into his headset, ""I know you guys lost xx420xN0xSc0pExx earlier today, you have a spot open!""

Shit. I couldn't believe he knew. This wasn't good.

Caesar continued, ""I know what it is. You don't think I'm good enough do you! You think I'm shit like all these other fuckers on Xbox Live!""

And then Caesar said the one thing I had dreaded since the day he revealed that he was a god...

Unfortunately he's not very good at video games.,Holidaythief,"Russell was an all-conference point guard competing with his high school varsity basketball team in the state title game.  He was also the second coming of Jesus Christ, which created a problem for him.  He could easily score over 100 points a game, basically any time he got the ball, but his mission required that he stay discreet and down-low, so he averaged 12.5 points/game, several steals, quite a few assists, and zero turnovers the entire season.  

With eight minutes left to go in the game, Russell brought the ball into the frontcourt.  He glanced at the scoreboard.  His team was down by 17, but he thought that there was still enough time to make a difference.  His power forward staked out a position right under the basket, and Russell executed a godlike precision pass to him, threading the needle between two defenders who were close enough together to have sex if they wanted.  The power forward caught the ball and...promptly dribbled it off his foot out of bounds.

""THIS DOOR WON'T OPEN,"" the voice said.

""It's not *meant* to open. Just go up the stairs behind you,"" Jimmy said.

""HAHA, GOOD ONE,"" GODOT_007 said. ""I'M STEALING THAT.""

The team was in place. Jimmy's Paladin attacked the closest Bomb and lured it away from the other enemies. The Archer began tagging it with arrows. The Conjurer healed the Paladin after every minor scrap of damage. Jimmy was hoping the Conjurer would help attack every now and then to make the fight go quicker, but three damage dealers would be more than enough to take down a simple, one-trick pony of an enemy.

The Bomb's HP wasn't going down fast enough though. If it didn't die soon it would explode, taking over half his hit points away. It would be a solid hit, but with the Conjurer on duty, he didn't see it as a problem.

""HEY GUYS I FOUND ANOTHER BOMB."" GODOT_007 announced.

Jimmy quickly spun his camera around to see GODOT_007 running at him with an angry Bomb right behind. Both Bombs were ready to explode.

""Shit! Move!"" Jimmy said.

His Paladin was able to escape one blast radius, but not the second. He took critical damage, but was still standing. Thankfully the Archer and the Conjurer had kept their distance, and were unharmed. GODOT_007 on the other hand was hit by both Bombs and was killed instantly. His dead Monk warped back to the start of the dungeon. The Conjurer angrily shook his fist in the air, then pouted twice in a row. The Archer sat down.

""HEY GUYS I FOUND ANOTHER DOOR."" GODOT_007 announced.

His teammates said nothing, waiting for GODOT_007.

[WP] Your Xbox Live friend is God. Unfortunately he's not very good at video games.,Holidaythief,"It was an ordinary day. I had just gotten back from campus after being there all day. I wanted to do my usual relaxation method, and play Battlefield 4. I loaded up the game as usual, chose my character, and loaded into an immediate massive battle. Me, not being that great, but doing decent as usual became aggravating.

""Dammit, come on guys. They're capping B!""

Per usual, my team was not much help. We were getting spawn camped by aerial vehicles and snipers nested on the rocky mountain above us. However, there was this one guy in my squad who was standing out in the open. He was looking up and down in a sloppy motion and running back and forth. It looked like someones little brother got a hold of the controls while his older brother went to piss or something.

""Hey, buddy. If you don't know how to fucking play, go play on the beginner servers."" I yelled out of annoyance.

""That is not holy language you are using there, son."" The nooby player responded.

""Oh, shove it old man. You are part of the cause of us losing. Have your son show you how to play.""

""My son is far too busy to be playing games, especially with the likes of you.""

""Does he have an actual job unlike you? I bet you mooch off of him and play his games all day."" I replied.

""You know not who I am do you?"" The player responded.

""We know you're a clueless old man that doesn't know how to play a fucking game."" My friend I was playing with chimed in before letting a cackle echo through the microphone.

The terrible player suddenly stopped moving, as well as my friend stopped moving. My friend's character vanished from the game and then the nooby player started spazzing again. After a few minutes, my friend texted me.

*Dude, I almost died.* the message read.

*Holy, shit. Are you ok?* I replied, fearing he may have been burglarized or something of the nature.

*It was crazy. My Xbox was just hit by lighting. There's no clouds in the sky either!*

*Maybe it short circuited* I, looking for a logical explanation replied.

*No man, it came through the window, and the weirdest part, is that nooby guy was laughing when it happened.*

*Maybe he's a hacker or something* Still looking for an explanation

*I don't know, but I'm not touching my Xbox for a while.* he replied

""Hey, did you fucking hack my friend!? Do you really suck that badly?"" I yelled through the microphone trying to sound tough.

""Fine. I'll improve my playing then, and no, I am not a hacker.""

Me in my rage gave up trying to win a lost cause, and began team killing the player over and over again. Apparently he had enough.

""That is it! You shall pay for your sins mortal!"" He yelled at me.

The game seemed to come to a standstill like it was lagging, but everyone was still talking clearly through the mics.

""What the fuck."" ""What's going on? I can't move!"" ""Dammit, no~, I was on a spree with my Little Bird!"" A few players were obviously disgruntled.

""Now, as your punishment, you shall be as the mortals say now days, *Wrecked*""

Everyone's players started being brutally killed. Decapitation, Burning alive, Swarms of locust, and one guys character was even crushed by a stone.

The kill feed was going by at miraculous speed with the nooby player's name preceding all of the unlucky players.

XHoly_Frag_GrenadeX has killed you. 

I sat there in awe with my mouth wide open before I came to a realization that made me feel sick to my stomach.

""You...You are...A HACKER!"" I yelled furiously

""Get Rekt!"" was the last thing I heard before I was kicked back to the main menu.

[WP] Your Xbox Live friend is God. Unfortunately he's not very good at video games.,Holidaythief,"“Why do you do this?” He asked me one rainy afternoon, a warm voice from my headphones. I hesitated, almost long enough for a mob to shoot him. Almost.

“Dowha?” I responded without really thinking about it, my mind on the game. He picked a tense moment to get philosophical. He always did, really. He said that’s when I’m most sincere. Maybe he’s right.

“Why do you keep playing with me?” He insisted. Iam, that is. That was his gamertag - just “iam”, lowercase, with an M. I kept calling him Ian for weeks before I noticed. He just laughed, that small, warm, friendly laugh of his.

“Don’t know…” I muttered, getting in position where I could take down the mob flanking him. “Maybe I like the challenge. No offense.” I added, just as he reacted too slowly and was downed.

“None taken.” He said, patiently, crawling in my direction, and dropped the subject. I didn’t bother counting how many times I had to revive him, in this game or the ones before it, in the… years we’ve played together. But the question gnawed on me. Why was it? Was it the challenge? I was a good player, great even. I’ve been gaming since I was a kid, and had enough… general experience to pick up nearly any new game. And I looked forward to whenever I’d run into Iam in a game, slowly trudging alone.

Iam, well, he wasn’t a great gamer. It wasn’t that he was deliberately bad, not trolling bad, just… poor. His timing was off, he kept forgetting things between respawns, but he had the patience of a saint. And I enjoyed doing co-op with him. Co-op anything, really. Sure it was a bit harder than just solo but… that was just another challenge for the game to throw at me. Like a neverending escort quest, with a poorly coded partner who’s nevertheless too likable to be frustrated by. Sure, sometimes he flubbed an easy jump, or mowed me down along with the enemy behind me, but it never really felt like it was… cheap, if that makes sense? I could always talk him through it. I could have stood in a safer place.

And I figured it out. The answer.

“No wait, I got it.” I said, rather suddenly, admittedly.

“Oh?”

“I figured out why I like playing with you.”

“Yes?” He asked, eager, earnest curiosity in that old man voice of his.

“It’s because you enjoy it. It’s not just about me having fun - it’s something somebody else appreciates, you know?” I paused for a moment, thinking I heard a chuckle on the other end. “Sure, it might take a while, but we get through eventually and I swear I can hear you smiling back there. So yeah. Because somebody appreciates it, and that’s all the reason I need, I figure.”

I fell quiet, thinking I could have said it better. Certainly sounded better in my head. But then I heard something like… a quiet sob.

“You okay there, man?”

“Yes, yes.” Iam answered quickly, sounding touched. “It’s just… it’s why I do what I do, too. It’s nice to be understood for once.”

For a moment, I wanted to ask. He never shared much about himself, and I never asked. “You’re welcome, Iam.”

There was a chuckle, then. Something deep and mysterious. “You know… it’s pronounced I Am.”

As regards the tribal fighting, that was mostly an issue in Yemen and Iraq, much less of a problem in the majority of Ottoman territory.

The Ottoman empire had been in decline for over a hundred years by the time of World War I.

The Turkish national movement pretty much created Turkey and brought a full end to the Ottoman Empire. But it isn't surprising; the Central Power empires all fell after the war, as did the Russian Empire.

&gt; 3) Africa, yes Africa did not immediately implode after the Europeans left. It managed to stagger on for quite some time. Mainly because those in power were the only ones with enough wealth to buy guns. After the Soviets and the US began throwing guns willynilly into the continent anyone who wanted to start a war had only to tell the US/USSR they were on their side.

Africa was an utter hellhole before the Europeans got there. It was often not so great while they were there. The idea that the US/USSR is responsible for them murdering each other is laughable. They were doing it without their help, and they continue to do so afterwards.

2) Iran in '53, the idea that he was turning himself into a dictator is the sort of nonsense spewed by those who are ignorant as to what occurred in Iran. The Prime minister did convince parliament to grant him emergency powers but with a six month limit on them. He then proceeded to use those powers to curb the privileges enjoyed by the Shah and to strengthen democratic institutions. Not turn himself into a dictator. So, wrong on that count too.

[IP] Noire,MajorParadox,"When his phone started ringing, Devereaux tipped the glass back and let the creature slide down his throat with a familiar, languid burn.  He set the tumbler down and poured himself another before rising unsteadily and walking to the bed.  After fumbling about in his discarded coat, he found his mobile, and scowled at the screen before tossing it and the coat back on the bed.  The ringing stopped, and a minute or so later his door phone started buzzing.

Muttering to himself, he drained his whisky glass and walked to the door.  ""Goddammit, what?"" he barked into the receiver.

There was a pause on the other end, and then Angela's clipped RP tones flooded his ear.  ""Fuck's sake, Michael, are you drunk?  Let me up.""

He fought the urge to hang up.  ""I'm not *drunk*, Angela, I'm *drinking*.  There's a difference.""  He hated the defensive whine that crept into his voice in those last two words.

Downstairs, Angela made an angry sound.  ""Michael, I haven't time for this.  Are you going to let me up, or am I going to have to wake the section chief and explain to him in detail the nature of the d-notice we're issuing?""

That almost sobered him up.  Christ, it hadn't gone as badly as all that, had it?  Then again...  He sighed and pressed the button on the console.  Two floors down, the lock buzzed.  He made sure the door was unlatched, then sat back down in the chair next to the table and poured himself another drink.

As the creature snaked its way down his throat he heard her footsteps on the stairs.  ""Michael?"" she called as she pushed open the door.  For a moment she was framed in the bright lights from the stairwell, still dressed for the office, her dark hair falling on either side of her face with an effortless sort of grace.  The effect was spoiled, or maybe enhanced, Devereaux was never quite sure, by the corners of her mouth turning down and her arched eyebrows furrowing in irritation when she spotted him, bottle in hand.

[OT] SatChat: Are you working on a book? Why or why not?,MajorParadox,"I didn't start writing with a story. In a classroom with some friends, I started by writing arguments. For several years, I did debate to some success. I enjoyed thinking on my toes and verbally sparring with another, trying to deconstruct their logic while simultaneously reinforcing my own. 

Eventually, I hit a wall. There was always something to learn when it came to debate and argumentation, but I slowly grew tired of it; over the years, there were less people to clash with, less ideas to grapple with, and less drive to improve. I became less interested in navigating through the world of what was and is, and became fascinated with exploring the world that was not and won't be.

It is at that time I started writing stories. It felt like a breath of fresh air, going from the realm of logic to one of possibility. Ideas and narratives flooded my mind and my scratch paper, but I grew particularly fond of one. I focused my efforts and began writing so that I could tell its story, not because I wanted anyone to listen to it. 

As of now, I'm about a third done I would say, and it certainly has not been an easy process. Between my other commitments, I only get to write pieces at a time, turning the project into a collection of little chapters. Also, at times I feel my background stalls me. I never learned how to write creatively, so writing the story is as new to me as the process itself -- and my debate experiences don't exactly correlate one-to-one to say the least. I'm not sure of what I'm doing right,  nor am I sure of what I'm doing wrong, but either way, it is a process I am enjoying. As long as there is a story I want to tell, I suspect I will continue to write. 

At the request of a friend some time ago, I created [this wordpress](https://wasabilinus.wordpress.com/the-forerunners-odyssey/) so that people could read it, and for a time I did post it around random places. More often then not, I would forget, so I'm just confining myself there as of now. ",Zaidbenh

* **Valhalla Corps** - a string of connected short stories centered around various military units misplaced throughout time for a reason. Just what is that reason? This one is at about 11k and currently heading for the backburner. Just not enough time in the day. 

* **Genesis** - First in a planned series of 6 novels. Centers around a young man who has to deal with his loss of humanity and the galactic conflict he finds himself increasingly drawn into.

[OT] SatChat: Are you working on a book? Why or why not?,MajorParadox,"Yo, Scherazade here. 

I'm a whitish dude (but of course, internet, so I could be a bot controlled by a multiracial multigendered team of boffins for all you know), from sunny (this is a lie) Wales (this is true).

I keep on starting to write a book about superheroes and superpowered people, specifically about a kid who has powers that do not meet her ideal of what a superhero should be. I wrote a bit about it as a prompt response last year, about a kid accidentally outing herself as a superheroine, but it's... awkward.

The main problem with my writing is... I'm not a social person. I've dated one person in my life and that was not a healthy relationship and I am so glad that's over. My friends at school were fairly shy fellow nerds, of which I, while able to keep up with them, was the stupidest (but also the most muscular and manly (this may also be a lie)).

I'm almost a recluse if it wasn't for my job and trying to lose weight to be healthy one day in my spare time.

As such, interpersonal interactions between characters, especially in a time of crisis, is incredibly hard for me to do. If you've read my stories on this sub, dialogue is often stilted and robotic: that's why.

It helps to take refuge in audacity to cover that up though. My characters hide their crippling lack of social-fu with a sense of 'screw everything, I'll do this my own arrogant way!'

I can type pretty fast, about 6 letters per second on a quick timer I just did, but my fingers cramp if I do it too fast.

My motivation to write is to make sure cool stories are out there. As a kid, it always upset me that X story didn't exist. There's a lot of literature out there, a lot of stories, but it seemed I always wanted something that, to my knowledge, did not exist yet.

Take superheroes. Formerly never in printed word, always in comics and visual media. Now works like Worm, Wearing the Cape, Soon I Will Be Invincible, and many more, exist in ghe current superhero fad-bubble the recent superhero movies have made.
And that's beautiful.

As a kid, I wrote a fun story about a plant wondering about what these strange beings, these non-plants that use its tree bretheren and the earth to grow non-plant structures almost like plants. Spoiler: they're humans.
I love non-human perspectives. I recently burnt through reading The Crystal Society, and man it's good!
I've got The Bees on my shelf ready to read soon. Been meaning to read that.

I want all the stories to exist. An impossible endeavour, but then, all things can happen, given time.

For example, I've yet to see a written word book that uses mechs in a manner like Pacific Rim, filling you with a sense of... not quite awe, but... um... seat-of-your-pants-in-the-zone-victorious-Imperator-powerfulness?

I live in Hull (no guesses there), UK, and I've been writing since around about Year Six. It really started to blossom as I made a forty page story over the course of a few weeks, and just about last year, I started a 153-page, just under half a megabyte story named 'Constable Centaur' on DeviantArt, based off of [these](http://www.deviantart.com/art/Royal-Canadian-Centaur-430350345) [images](http://www.deviantart.com/art/CentaurSoldier-513233995) , the former being a kind-of mental guardian angel for a little while following a confusing dream. Fast forward to now, I'm working on the sequel, probably going over 200 pages soon, some canon related to fictional Canadian politics, a separate project based on...less male interests, and a fourth, only started on Friday afternoon, which I attempted to prompt, but failed miserably.

I sometimes look back on 'Constable Centaur', and cringe. I'm looking at a mass purge of formatting, possibly adding a few pages or two, and replacing words and misinformation. But who cares, copyright, especially RCMP Foundation won't let me publish. And I'm not trying.

I am currently writing/thinking (about writing) three novels. One is doable, and in progress. The other is a notion, half-baked and driven by emotions I feel when imagining my way through scenes. The last is a dream, I can't even think about approaching it until I have the means write more than I work. (A stupid thing to say, but ""living"" often gets in the way of living- right?)

I've been working on the first novel for the last two months, before that I wanted to created comic books and graphic novels. Trouble with that is I can't draw poses or action, so I spent years trying to improve that skill set- to little avail. Now I've shelved those stories and started anew, and I have to admit it is liberating.

[OT] SatChat: Are you working on a book? Why or why not?,MajorParadox,"I'm no longer working on my book. This would be the second project I've abandoned. 

I have almost everything in place. Characters, conflict, motivations, you name it, but I can't get my head around where the story is eventually going. There's no single way I see of resolving the storyline in anything close to an acceptable manner. So it's hovering above the proverbial recycling basket. 

First project I've stopped working on was because it shared 50% of the plot and premise of The Last of Us. Everytime I'd explain it to someone, they'd go ""oh, just like The Last of Us then?"". I'm guessing the writers on that saw the same nature documentary I did, at around the same time.",SoreWristed
[OT] SatChat: Are you working on a book? Why or why not?,MajorParadox,"Hey everyone! Sniper here again. Hope everyone is having a good week. If you don't me, I'm a male from New Jersey. 

I am actually working on a novel right now, and might start working on a second one. But I wanna say I'm always working on some big project in my spare time, even if it's not a novel. For instance, the past few years, I've had a worldbuilding project going, which every month or so, I'll take a weekend and work on just that. Novels are different obviously because you have to actually *write* words that a story, while worldbuilding is kind of setting everything up.

The novel I'm working on right now, I've started to post over to Wattpad. There's currently eleven chapters out right now, with many more planned. And since Reddit doesn't like Wattpad links, here's the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlankPagesEmptyMugs/comments/47jki0/the_grand_spartan_empire/) I made on my subreddit for it. The novel is based on a prompt from here and the current elevator pitch is this:
&gt;The Spartans haven't lost a battle since King Theonidas' last stand, and heroic victory, against Persia in 480 BC. For the past twenty-five hundred years, Sparta has consolidated its power and grown into a mighty Empire. Now, they're attempting to conquer the modern world.

I've been having a lot of fun with it and can't wait to write more.

The second project is (again) based on a prompt from here, but has been going slowly. It's hard working on two things at once! But I'm hoping to make a dent with that soon.

As always, my subreddit is /r/BlankPagesEmptyMugs and I finally have my own wiki there, with all of my stories and ongoing series in it. And my novel, *Forever Roman* is still available for purchase on Amazon, and to read for free! Thanks!

P.S. The wiki here looks great.",TheWritingSniper

[OT] SatChat: Are you working on a book? Why or why not?,MajorParadox,"Hey everyone! I'm Matt, an aspiring writer in the military currently residing in Connecticut, USA. I've been writing for awhile now, it started with journal entries then it kind of became a passion of mine. I've always loved reading and literature growing up, so I kind of just decided that I wanted to take a stab at it. So far its been a blast. A huge inspiration for me is the astounding feeling of being able to take on the world after reading a great book. Books have always been there for me to lean and I hope one day my writing can encourage people to do whatever it is they are passionate about or maybe just give them a chance to escape whatever bad situation they may be in. 

Currently I use Evernote to write a lot of my stuff, its simple and allows me to work on my stories from any device regardless of where I am. 

As far as typing goes, I only type around 40WPM.

I don't have anything to really promote right now, I'm currently working on a collection of short stories about growing up and nostalgia, specifically with focus on growing up too fast due to childhood trauma.

What's on my mind? If I should order another cup of coffee, and what album to listen to next on Spotify. 
I think that's it.

[OT] SatChat: Are you working on a book? Why or why not?,MajorParadox,"Yep, got what is technically the first draft done for one of them a week ago. I publish as a serial with an editor, a chapter somewhere around 4500 words a week per chapter. So it's intresting going back and re-editing the older chapters even as I'm working to write ahead in the entire series. 

I tried writing before, but I couldn't get it going. Once I started doing a serial though it works for me. It forces me to write every week, and by this point I'm several chapters ahead of publishing them each week and endeavoring to broaden that gap so I can go back and start editing the second book for publishing. 

Although as a joke last week for my cake day I wrote and published on Reddit what I thought would be a fluff piece to cash in on my cake day, nope! Turns out people like the fluff and it's now my most most popular story of all time. Now its my job to continue it as another serial.

""*BOTH of us had secret agents?*"" asked the leader of the Xargon Confederacy.

On both sides of the diplomatic table, a person was standing, each pointing a gun at the other. 

Nova stood on the side I'll call ""right,"" even though this meeting took place in deep space, and describing the direction is impossible. His eye twitched. He certainly wasn't expecting to have to get into actual conflict.

Dep had assumed a strange position with his arthropod legs. Had anyone else in the room watched *Attack of the Gumbo Bums,* a movie Dep had watched eight times, they would realize that it is the same position lead actor Ghor was in before he shot the villain dead. Unfortunately, nobody had watched the movie, so nobody felt threatened.

As soon as the guns had been drawn, everyone knew what was going on. This was perhaps the most important meeting between mankind and the slightly older Xargon Confederacy there had been to date, and many interstellar and interplanetary boundaries were to be decided. While the meeting would be diplomatic, the Human Coalition decided to sneak in an armed agent disguised as a diplomat onto the team in an attempt to... persuade the Xargonian leaders into being more generous. It now appears that the Xargonians had exactly the same idea.

""Well,"" said the president of the Human Coalition as he clapped his hands. Dep immediately pointed his gun away from Nova and towards the Xargonian leader. ""Your agent here was, in fact, a double agent working for us.""

""Oh,"" the head of the Xargons responded, clacking their mandibles together especially loudly. ""Well, Nova over there is really a double agent working for the Xargonian Confederacy."" Almost immediately, Nova produced another gun, this one an automatic beam weapon, and pointed the black armament towards the other human.

""Whoa, no way!"" yelled Dep. He pulled an identical black gun out from a recess in his back. ""I have the exact same one!""

""...wow,"" reacted Nova, ""you know, I think we're a lot alike.""

""I'd have to agree,"" Dep responded, ""I don't really want to harm any society this similar to ours. Besides, I didn't even really want this job in the first place.""

""Me neither!"" Nova was totally oblivious to both the leaders' complete confusion. ""I always wanted to be a...""

""...filmmaker?""

""YES! Wow, we're like, brothers from another mother!""

""There is a phrase in the ancient Krinlyc that's similar to what you just said. It is 'united livers drinking from the same breast.'""

""I like the English version better.""

""Yeah, me too. Hey dude, want to get out of here?"" Dep put away his weapons.

""Oh, totally,"" said Nova, doing the same.

They both exited the room together, leaving the two men to squabble amongst themselves. ""Oh yeah,"" said Dep, ""I just *have* to show you *Attack of the Gumbo Bums.*""",gmfk07

""Stop calling me that. My friends call me John.""

""Dear, sweet John..."" the woman sighed, took a step closer. John tightened his grip on the gun, thumbed back the hammer. The woman ignored it. ""If only you hadn't walked in on us, I could have let you live.""

""You'll be the one to die, cunt,"" John spat. ""I thought you were low, but that...? What kind of psycho are you?""

The woman shrugged. ""Money's money. Oh, don't give me that look, John. I know you understand me. If it weren't for my income, we'd both be out on the streets.""

""Could have? When you've been looking for years and never found it? You're useless, John. You're a liability. Who the fuck would want to hire you?""

"[OT] Sunday Free Write: Leave A Story, Leave A Comment - Illustrating Wonderland Edition",SurvivorType,"I am an amateur writer, can't write even moderately good stuff, but here's an essay I wrote in class. I would definitely appreciate any critique. :

**Dreams**

The town, Hirokshima had surrendered in front of our armed Korean soldiers. ""Naturally, what would be done is to take some captives and leave the rest"", I thought. But no, we move towards the epicenter of the town with hundreds of enemy soldiers lined up, stripped off their weapons. And there came the barbaric order. We have to kill those unarmed soldiers, along with some civilans.

Rejection would result in termination, for the greater good of the country, I decide to go with the flow. The muzzling firearms went into action. But though I don't know how many people I shot, it was clear that I feel a mountain in my heart. I move towards the general's quarters, gun still loaded. Without knocking, open the door,raise my gun, and ""Duzz"". Few more shots follow. I had been shot. I lost consciousness.

Then, I wake up. It was just an alternate ending of the guilt-ridden operation I had been on. I never had the courage to move towards the quarters.

I wake up in the CIA quarters of Baghdad. Head towards the showers and then proceed towards the briefing room. Surprised to see that all members were already seated, even though the wall clock on the General's six showed 0250, while meting was supposed to be at 3.

""Come Along, Snowden"", the General exclaimed, ""We had been waiting just for you"".

I am about to say that seeing them assembled this early didn't seem good, just when he interrupts ""We have received Intel. There's going to be an attack on the political rally today. We need to conduct a stealth operation, snipers on all suspected locations. Any confirmation of threat, assassinate the target.""

""Any information on the identity of the attacker?"", I asked. ""No, I'm afraid not. Though, we have suspicions it may be a woman or child ..."", he replied in a dismal tone.

We leave in a covert convoy, and disperse to rooftop upon arriving. 1700. The sun was setting, a perfect moment for an attack.

""There's someone coming out of the building on the South."" I pointed the scope on my Remmington .307 rifle towards the building. The informer on the walkie-talkie was right. A woman in veil, and a child. She handed a package to the child.


Upon further inspection, it became clear that it was a bomb. He started brisk-walking.

An innocent child. Just doing what he was with no motive, except for maybe some food to stay alive. The life of a baby destroyed due to the actions of some. I pulled the rigger. The child stopped ... dead.

But then the world passed before my eyes, vanishing into blackness. I open my eyes and see myself laying in a battlefield.

I am in my late 50s. The intensity of the pain told me that the gunshot wound had progressed to an infection. No one was around, either all were dead or had left me for dead in a hasty retreat. 

Dreams. For me, nothing but a tribute to the armed services.

It was no guarantee, I was still not in a dream. Dying was the only way to find out.",HumbleDino

I love the drawings, normally when it comes to illustrated books I see the pictures as a distraction, I mean I'm trying to get through 'A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' but the pictures are so large and the text is all squished around it and I don't really appreciate the art unless I go back and look at them specifically.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The door cracked open as daylight poured into the lobby. From inside the building the open door looked more like a portal to another time with modern buildings and cars juxtaposed against the 1960's motif of the lobbies interior. Well past its prime the place smelled of mold and depression.  


In to the lobby walked a man with a tired look in his eyes and suitcase in each hand.  Pausing to allow his eyes to adjust the man reached in his pocket and pulled out his phone.  
6 Missed calls, 10 new Text the phone displayed as he tapped the text icon.  
Text from Laura. “FUCK YOU ASSHOLE” 


The visitor rolled his eyes and pocketed the phone grunting out “fuck you too bitch.” 
The man lugged his stuff past the dusty old grand piano and over to the guest service counter.
DING! The sound pierced the silence like a razor blade as the man struck the bell marked ring for service.  
“I’m coming, hold your dam horses!” a gravelly voice wined from the back room. 
The man pulled a phone from his pocket as he impatiently waited for the staff to emerge from the back room.  A new message appeared on the phone.  

New Text from Bob: “Fuck man, I know we been buddies for a long time, but damn you went too far.  Cops are looking for you.” 


The man ponded the phone onto the desk cracking the screen.  “That no good fucking bitch” 
Rage filled the man’s eyes as he hit reply and sent back “That whore had it coming.” 
“Woman problems huh?” The gravelly voice startled the man looked up from the cracked phone to see an old man dressed as a bellhop standing behind the counter.    


“None of you’r damn business.  What took you so long!” Barked the guest. 


“I was tending to my garden. Names Gus, how can I be of service.” The old man said in his clearly forced customer service voice.  


The man looked past Gus like he was nothing saying “Shit didn’t see you walk up. I need a room, willing to pay cash to avoid any names on the register.” 


“Uh, huh. You’re not going to be any trouble are you.” Gus replied as he shot his eyes towards the man’s bruised and cut up knuckles. 


“No Trouble. In fact, there is an extra fifty in it for you if tell anyone looking for me that I was never here.” The man said sliding a crumpled wad of cash across the counter. 

Gus looked around as he snatched the money off the table.  

“Anyone going to come looking for you here?” Gus questions in a hushed tone. 

“Nah, I told my soon to be ex-wife that I was leaving town, but I have a few more things to do, people to visit.”  The man replied.  
“Great, just the kind of guest we like around her, the ones that are nice and quiet. Let’s keep it that way ok.” Gus replied in a cheerier tone.  
“Sure what ever, so are you going to show me to my room?” The man questioned as he shifted the weight of the suitcases in his hands, adding.  “these fuckers are heavy.” 

“Oh no sir, I have a, well it’s my legs…” Gus said before being cut off by the newly checked in hotel guest. 
The man tried to peer down at the bellhop’s legs, but the counter was too tall. He was probably fine, just making shit up to get out of work. The man reasoned. 
“Whatever just give me a room.” The man said cutting Gus off mid-sentence.
“As you wish Sir, but before you go, are you going to be having any guest up into your room.  If not, it can be arranged.” 
 The man had heard of this before. Hookers kept on retainer by sleaze bag hotel managers moonlighting as pimps. 
“Uh, huh.  I think I got it, thanks but no thanks.” The man said in a slightly offended tone. 
“Sorry if I offended you, here take this key. I have you on the first floor. Room 101.” Gus said in way that appeared to oddly satisfy him 
“If I change my mind I will call down to let you know.” The man said as he snatched the key labeled 101
Gus watched as the man hauled his shitty suitcases deeper into the maze like corridors of the hotel. As the man turned the corner and disappeared from sight Gus snaked back into the back room. 

The suitcases grew heavy in the man’s hands as his fingertips grew dark purple from the cheap plastic handles.  He breathed a sigh of relief when he spotted the small plastic placard labeled 101.  

The man huffed as he dropped his belongings in front of his door and pulled the antiquated metal key from his pocket.  Just as he placed the key in the keyhole he paused.  Laughter could be heard from inside the room.  
“What the fuck.” The man whispered as his placed his ear against the door.  Again from inside the sound of laughter, from at least 2 people.  

The man turned the key and the door opened to the unmistakable odor of cigarettes and marijuana.  Greeting him at the door were two fit and attractive women in their early 20s wearing next to nothing.  

“We have been waiting for you” the two buxom brunets said in unison.   

The man standing before them could barely take his eyes off the two, but when he did he spotted something just as appetizing in the room beyond them.  A table full of his all-time favorite party favors.  Pot, Coke, Pills, a box of cigars, and a bottle of very expensive brandy all called to him from the cheap hotel table. 

Confused the man stepped back in a mixture of shock and happiness as a shy grim crept up on his face. 
“Hey ladies, I told Gus I wasn’t into having company right now.” The man said and his brain chugged along struggling to process the logic of it. 

The two girls wrapped each other in their arms and started to make out. 

“What the fuck, why not. I have always wanted this.” The man said leaving his luggage at the door and B-lining it straight into their arms.   

Right before closing the door the man reached out to hang sign on the knob reading “DO NOT DISTURB”  
That man received his wish, he was not disturbed, not now or ever. 

 Gus returned to the room. He slithered out from a panel in the wall revealing his true form.  Towering over the empty room the creature known as Gus had a body of an old man dressed as a bellhop attached to a large winding tentacle. 

The hallucinogenic gas emitted by the pustules on Gus’s monstrous form pooled into a dense fog covering the floor.  Scattered among the fog lay a number of bodies in various states of decay with black tentacles emerging from the eye sockets. 

“Yes, my garden grows strong.” Gus said and he moved over to room 101’s newest resident.

 Gus held his hand up to his mouth as he vomited up two small red eggs.  “Yes you will do nicely” He added as he placed one on each of the man’s eyes.  

Gus looked over the room with a sense of fulfillment as he watched his family grow. 

“DING” a bell rang in the distance. 

“Ah good another guest.”

"[OT] Sunday Free Write: Leave A Story, Leave A Comment - Illustrating Wonderland Edition",SurvivorType,"      Stress overtakes me as I uncontrollably thump my mattress with clenched fists. I had been lying, flat as a pancake in my bed all day. I stare at the time on my alarm clock, 5:00pm. Another wasted day. Since waking up in the early hours of the morning, I had been replaying every little thing that has gone wrong in my life.  tears rebelliously start to trickle down my cheeks as I begin to recall everything again, and mentally kick myself for being so blind to it all in the past.  

Feeling shaky and light headed, I bring myself back to the thought that I am not in any respect healthy, food has never been a love of mine. I eat to live, I definitely do not live to eat. Lack of nutrition and a sedimentary lifestyle left me under developed and with much more fat than muscle despite my age and weight, despite being technically 'thin as a twig' I had cellulite. I knew what an attractive young lady of eighteen was suppose to look like, and I certainly wasn't it.                                           

Who could ever find this attractive? I routinely play through my head. I mull it over as I always do before confirming my decision in my bedroom mirror. I rise out of bed and stand on the spot to wait for the head rush to disappear and my vision to return.
I shuffle over to my full length mirror and take in my image. My hair hangs down just below my shoulders, Despite my anxieties, I've always made a point of making myself stand out, be it with make up or hair. I watched the reflection of myself smirk as I thought of this self destructive self analysis, and felt a disturbing tingle as I saw the right side of my lip turn up in an almost sadistic smile. I did not mean to smile, I couldn't understand why I would. 

I suppose my looks aren't half bad, I chant to myself. I had decided to bring my hair back to its natural brown in an attempt to bring me back... To myself I supposed.

Gazing at my expressionless face for what feels like eternity, I note - as I always do, that my skin is pale, and very oily with cratered pores. I shuddered at the acne spattered across my face.  I stare directly at myself... as I always do. Trying to wait for an involuntary reaction that will never come; a smile I didn't smile, a shiver of the hand, possibly even a  spontaneous spasm? Or something as simple as a twitch of the eye.
 ...I guess I have always liked my eyes; I've always thought that my striking green eyes - if I do say so myself, made me look feral, wild, almost. Eccentric would be the best word to use when describing them to people, I mused. although occasionally I thought I could see some strange, unnerving... Amazing spark of insanity in those eyes of mine.",ColourfulCynic

He leaned  his head against the seat and tipped his hat over his eyes.  Around him came the soft murmur of voices, the quiet whisper of the wheels on tracks, the hush hush of forward movement.  He couldn't sleep. He wouldn't try.  Thoughts circled like water down the drain. Against his leg, between the seat in the wall, he could feel the thickness of the file. The file that held everything he knew about the girl but gave him nothing in return. Nothing he could use. 

He wouldn’t talk to Mrs Henry Willson again. He had no interest in anything she had to say.

When he closed his eyes he could see nothing but darkness. And when are he opened them he can't see anything but the dim weave of the fibers of his hat. He didn't have the energy to tip up the brim let the light seep underneath. His hands were on his lap. They felt too big, too heavy to move.

Outside the window the world blurred. Outside the door into the corridor was the loud sounds of people moving to and fro. They spoke loudly, gaily about where they were going. About what they expected. The man listened to them as he sat there alone in the quietness of his stranded thoughts and let the miles past underneath him.

***

The train groaned to a stop at the boardwalk platform in Fort Means. The man smelt to the city before they arrived. It was heavy scent that colored the air - clotted blood, manure, the heavy dust that seems to attach, to set alight like dust in an abandoned house. That was the true announcement of the city as the train pulled to a stop. As  the engine cooled the sounds slaughterhouse, not even a full block away, began to echo.They kicked the sides of their cars and the man could hear the rattle. During the ride they had been quiet. Now they reacted to the smell and the noise, the sound of their swift death. 

The man stood quickly, the file secure under his coat against his chest. The Ticketmaster must have come through at some point in the night hadn't woken the man. He would have to leave before the Ticketmaster remembered. The man had never bought a ticket in his life. The hallway was mostly empty. He turned right, to the back of the train. The door between carriages was left ajar. He wouldn’t be the only one to exit this way. The drop to the ground was short but jarring. It sent a flash of pain from his heels to his jaw. 

A few years ago he had been heading north. He had stumbled upon a hanging tree. He and some Tennesseans cut the bodies down. One helper had jumped from a low branch and landed on his heels. He dropped instantly. The local vet took a look, but only said the man’s neck had severed, like he been dropped by a noose.

The man’s boots sunk into mud kept warm by the friction of the tracks. He rolled his shoulders. There was a dry twist in his neck. He ignored it.

The man carried nothing of importance with him, nothing of value, besides that file and the memory of the cameo and the girl. He hadn't had money in a while - expensed the last of it on a glass of water and dry toast weeks before. The street was cobbled and on top of the stones was a sheen of mud that made it difficult to walk on. Carriages passed and unshod hooves clattered over the stones. The sidewalks were crammed with people. The man took his chances close to the buildings. As he passed an alley he saw a pair of boys throwing stones at a cowering dog. They yelled as they attacked. When one rock hit with usual accuracy the dog let out a scream. The noises they made were lost in the roar of the city.

It would take a while to find the hotel the woman had stayed out.  The man was not someone people talked to easily. He knew that when he was younger he tried to fight it, tried to make himself more vulnerable, more approachable. It didn't work. Trying to change the nature of things never did.

When he was far enough away from the station and slaughterhouses that the sound faded he stopped by a druggist, an old building leaning towards. a grocer's. The awning kept the hot sun off the latest delicacies from afar - oranges and  apples in opened crates and in the window one perfect pineapple.   

He smelled pineapple once when he was very young. Someone in town had just died and he and some other boys were sent out to dig the grave. All the men drank to or to forget the memory the person who had died. The man never knew who it was. There was a young woman, the wife of a traveling preacher, who had a box of candied pineapple. She would walk down the street with it. The man remembered how she would take one out and study it like a gem then place it in her mouth. It had sharp bitter smell, he remembered, something like acid. It was harsh, like gripping a piece of rusted metal.

In the garbage behind the grocery he found a sandwich, the bread soggy and the meat warm. He stood in the shadow of the building and ate it as people passed by. 

***

He kept north of the tracks. The wind held the smell back. It was cleaner here, the sidewalks wider and in better repair. Every few feet gas lamps sputtered on. They cast warm soft circles and made the darkness beyond them deeper. Near the intersection of Crockett and Mayweather the man heard the crash of something against a wall.

“That was from my mother, you animal!” Through the open window the distorted forms of a man and woman warred. The sound of his slap was sudden and sharp. 

She staged backwards and the man could imagine the blood on her fingertips after she touched them to her mouth. There was a hushed shocked silence. 

She began to scream again. 

***

A post office seemed swallowed by the towering buildings around it. In the back was the loading bay. The rolling door was unlocked. The man pulled it up a half foot then crawled underneath. A hay bale was cut open for packing. He kicked some into a pile. It scratched through his clothes as he lay down. Dust was thick this close to the ground. He sneezed so hard his eyes watered. 

He slept short and hard. 

****

He saw the house out in the field, the light on the porch flicking on and off, on and off. The sky was dark with could and held a sickly urine tint. The man knew he was dreaming because there was no smell. No heavy wetness of rain or the flat dry stink of summer grass. 

The light kept blinking in the dimness. He knew what it meant. Distress. 

The way he moved was dreamlike too. He didn’t walk. Instead he seemed to jump forward like the quick changes of photos on a Kodiak Carousel. Click. The roof was sloped. The rails on the front of the porched gaped like broken teeth. Click. Every light was dimmed. It seemed to flicker but there was no smoke from the chimney. 

He could hear the thin whine of electricity but saw no wires. The house had capsized here. Click. The man was almost standing on the bottom step. It was warped and nails jutted though the softness. 

When he mounted it there was no sound. Under his feet the wood wept like it was infected. It was soft, uneasy. The feeling of being watched skittered across his back. There were no more cuts. No easy ways to enter. The man climbed the steps. As he pushed the door open – it had no handle and no lock – it scraped on the floor.

It was somehow darker inside, despite the lights hanging from the ceiling. There were dozens of naked bulbs. They dimly pulsed. The bottoms were tacky and clotted with insects. A few filaments glowed cherry-red then snapped out. The floors were dirt and the rooms were bare. He wandered through them. A wind picked up and made the bulbs sway. Even though they touched they made no noise. 

The stairs to the second floor were torn down. The wood was collapsed in a heap. 

Dust and cobwebs covered them but the man saw nothing move as he kicked a piece free. Overhead a few more bulbs went dark. The windows left the muted tinted light pass though. It wasn’t strong enough to throw shadows. Near the front door was a mirror, the reflected corroded into blackness. 

“You’ve finally made it, Jack.” The man turned. 

She was haggard. With little hair she had was wispy. It floated around her head, twisting in the currant of her movements. Her eyes were shut and kept that way by a neat line of stitches. The thread was white. The edges made the holes irradiated, red and oozing.

He wasn’t Jack.  She cackled. Then she coughed harshly. Her breath rattled like rocks in a pail. It was harsh and grating. The man hated it. 

“Oh, look at you.” When she moved it came with the sound of snakeskin over hard dry earth. Her skin was paper-thin and hung off her bones. “You’ve finally woken up.”

The man knew he was sleeping. He remembered looking out the window. The sun had finally set but the sky was still bruising to darkness. Then he had turned to pour a glass of water… and found himself in a field, the green-sliver grass to his knees.

Over the top of his shoulder the skin felt too tight. It itched like a bad sunburn. His foot scuffed the floor as he backed away. Though the stripped dirt her could see cheerful laminate ties. The faces of the cowboy seemed jeering behind their dead cartoon eyes. Across the band of their hats proclaimed HOWDY and THE BILLY THE KID SHOW.

As she slithered closer something in the woman’s chest rattled. “I know you don’t talk much, but show an elder some respect. Say ‘hello’.”
This was a dream so he must have make her, make this place, in the twisted back of his mind. Then she knew why he didn’t – couldn’t – talk. She laughed louder. 

He was almost by the ruined pile of stairs again. She was standing between him and the door now. The man knew the windows wouldn’t open in the same way he knew they wouldn’t break. The only way to leave was though the door. Or to wake up, if he could remember how.

I had always felt that everyone I met in life either was just waiting for me to be something extremely incredible or hated me. It, the feeling, seemed to follow me everywhere; school, home, on the streets, even when I was alone. It all makes sense now. Sadly, nothing else does.

I wake up because I am acutely aware that I cannot breathe. White walls surround me, closing in; they seem to be alive as they hum. They are surely glowing, they are surely alive. I on the other hand, am not. Remember, I am choking. My legs start kicking involuntarily; because I am choking. I sit straight up because I am choking. I do not die though, but I am choking anyway. I know I will choke forever.

That is when the beeping starts and I know there are worse things than choking. It is so loud that I fall to my knees and my hands previously at my neck fly to my ears. I never knew humans could hear a pitch this high. The walls, the light, the beeping, my lungs, my soul, we all scream in unison as I realize I can only be in hell.

I am not in hell. The door opens as someone responds to alarm I tripped off – the beeping. She steps into the room and it stops. Orange shoulder length hair falls between her eyes and she automatically swipes it off. She walks up to me, kneels next to me and takes my hands of my ears. I feel a complete calm, of an unknown source. So I tell her my name and we both stand.

‘I know your name,’ she is taller than me with about an inch, ‘my name is Seta.’ Star. I remember the direct translation of the name. ‘Seta.’ I repeat the name just to be sure. She nods and our eyes meet for 2.3 seconds. I know because I can tell that sort of thing now. Now that I am something incredible; now that I know someone incredible. Seta; I am guessing now that I have made a new friend.

I realize that I still cannot breath, but I am no longer choking. I can never choke again, because I am incredible. Hate me if you want. It all makes sense now.

Her fingers stretched up into the sky, as is if she was hoping to tear through the eggshell blue morning and touch the darkness beyond.

He squinted through the harsh sun. Behind he heard the horse paw at the ground. There was no water here. 

“How long, you think?” 

He rolled his shoulders. Sweat made his shirt stiffen and he could feel it chafing his back. There was no way to know, so he shrugged.

Her skin was thin and brittle like the pages of a book. Her fingertips were bare, the ends stripped by sand and time. She had all her teeth. The top of her skull gleamed.

“Scalped?”

The man shook his head. Despite knowing, he was still hesitant to touch her. A lizard darted away as he rolled her over. Her bones rattled like a rain stick. It surprised him how simultaneously light and heavy she was. Her dress was a faded blue, the pattern one of the more popular from the King Arthur bags. She could have come from anywhere. The sand had swallowed her footprints. There was a broken cameo pinned into the hem of the skirt. There was a paper under the pinback. He pocketed the camo. The metal was hot thorugh his pants.

A shadow fell over them. The man knocked his hat up. The finder - the hobo who found her - was uneasy. He pointed to the skull. 

The finder had a worn face but soft hands. When he spoke everything sounded like a question. Sometimes he would pick at his nails and mutter to himself. He was easy to ignore.

“Sure she wasn’t scalped?” The question was a whine.

He nodded. There were scratches visible, the frantic pawing of an animal. He was sure. When he stood his left hip seized with heat. He knocked a fist against the pain until it leached away. 

“Oh God. Who is she?”

The man swung up onto the horse. From above the body looked like a fig, shriveled and dusty. The sand threw up the sun so it was blinding. 

“Should we bury her?”

There was no way to. Neither of them had brought shovels. The sand would be impossible to dig through and they would only waste the water they had trying. He turned the horse. There was nothing left here.

The finder lashed out. The horse sidestepped easily. The man looked down on him. He was faded and dusty as the waste around them.

“When are you going to wake up?” The question hissed like a snake’s rattle. The finder’s teeth were crooked and black. His tongue flicked like a dying thing in the cavern of his mouth. The man just tipped his hat forward and jigged the horse on.

***

That night the fan spun in circles. It clicked over a loose bearing. He lay on a cot and tried to match the beat of his heart to it. The paper had writing on the inside, a name. A Mrs. Henry Wallson. It sounded familiar. 

He tucked it into his shirt pocket. The cameo cooled out of the glare of the sun. He ran his fingers over the ivory. It had a used yellow sheen. He had seen an elephant once, at a circus that came though. He couldn’t afford a ticket so he lurked behind the caravan and watched the shadows on the oiled canvas walls of the tent.

He heard that in the next town it had caught fire. The tent collapsed in the middle of the panicked rush for the exit. When the fire brigade arrived the zebras fled into the plains. One of the lions tore into a tamer before it was prodded with spears back into its cage. The elephant died. 

Below he could hear the noises from the tavern– the voices rising and falling like the tide, a lone player piano plucking the melancholy notes of Fortunate Son. There was a cheer. Dice or cards, and another round called. The sounds were muffled as if they came from a distance. The radio in the corner was on but the speakers had been torn out. He looked at the little window of light. The dial glowed like a burning eye.

""I want to talk to you."" I want to be talk to you. From there I have journeyed, to here, leading my 5 camels.

Sojourning over the hills and sands of sleep, I say, *Wake o' dreamer. Wake to the sound of my voice.*

Want nods his head in agreement. The other camels, with him and I, plod steadily on through the dust and starry night. Swirls of sand, swirls of dust. Twirling thoughts, sparked imagination. Sleepers rest in the Desert of Rest, filling it with all imaginations.

*I want to talk to you...* I do. I do so much want, that I have named my camels as such: I, is me, Want, To, Talk, To, You. We walk through the dreamscape waiting, watching hoping for you to awaken to our presence... For now we continue on, impressed by the length of your sleep. Awake o' sleeper. Awake for I have much to say.

**THIS IS BASED OFF OF THE JENKINSVERSE ON /R HFY, SORRY IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND IT.**

The door finally budged, showing that it wasn’t truly invincible after all. I rammed into at full speed, busting through the frame and falling down on top of the now broken metal door. What do they make these doors out of? Aluminum?

I picked the door back up and placed it back where it would have been just a second ago. I viewed my handiwork with disappointment; the door had a massive dent in it, letting light into and out of the rooms freely on the left side, there was no way to disguise this I decided.

I turned around and started down the steel hallways, all poorly lighted. The little light it did have was a white glow, making it feel even blander than it already was. It *was* a change in scenery, which was appreciated. I had been held up in that room voluntarily, so maybe I shouldn’t complain.

I began to turn around a corner when I came face to neck with the captain. My eyes went wide at the thought of what I did to his ship, and what his response could be. Could he throw me out now? Would the two crew members defend me this time? I didn’t have much time to think, as the captain was flailing his hand all over the place, stumbling back in what i could only guess as terror. I ran forward to stop him from hitting the ground, not wanting the crewmates to think I pushed him down.

""W-w-what are you doing out of your cell- I mean room!?"" The captain asked, astonished.

""Well,"" I began, putting him back on his legs. ""To be honest sir, I think I'm starving, or at least malnourished to a very poor point.""

“How much could you possibly need to eat? Even the hungriest of Vzk'tk can’t eat as much as you eat per meal in a day! You’re a monster! That’s what you are!”

“Sir, I can’t really help it. I’m only eating what I require, if I don’t keep up my energy intake, my muscles will be eaten away by my body to try and keep me alive!” I said, making it sound worse than it was.

The blue giraffe looked at me, fully aware that I couldn’t read his facial expressions. “I can’t feed you at the rate you need, I’m sorry. If you need food, I’ll drop you off at the next station and you can find yourself a job.”

I stood stunned. I didn’t have the slightest clue on how do jobs; I've never been employed in my entire living life!

“I've never worked in my entire life, uh, sir.” I replied, telling it to him straight up.

“What? You look to be quite tall for an average xeno, and we know you’re impossibly strong, what’s stopping you from getting a job then?”

“Well, where I come from, we can’t get a job until we’re are minimum 16 years old, sir. But I doubt that law would be enforced out here though,” I said, kind of answering my own question. “Unless there are child labor laws for a species that has never been heard of before out here.”

“Then you should have no trouble getting a job! You lift some thing for someone, and you get paid, you get paid, you buy food. It’s as simple as that!” The xeno replied, making it seem as easy as it sounds.

“Fine, drop me off at the next station, but I will only get off of your ship if you help me find a job.”

“It’s a Deal.”

We stood in silence as we waited for one of us to respond, but instead stood there looking like a bunch of fools.

Later that ‘day’ I remembered I had left my Ipod back at where I was stowing away on the ship. I hopped over, using the lower gravity to get there faster. I peered around the crates to find the Ipod still there.

Back when I was on earth, I had loaded the thing nearly to the maximum with just music. Music of all genres, even classical, making sure that I always had something to listen too for every mood.

I picked the Ipod up and looked at it. It was dead, sadly, but I’m sure that there is some way to charge the thing. I tucked the thing back into my jeans and walked around the ship looking for something to charge it with.

I didn’t know what I was looking for, but something that looked like it held electricity. Did they even use electricity? What if the voltage is hundreds of times higher than earth’s average? My worries were halted when I saw #1 carrying a heavy looking box around.

“Uhh, do you want some help with that?” I asked curiously.

He made a sound of what I took for what a Vzk'tk made for a painful groan, and decided to walk over and take the box from him. The box couldn’t have weighed more than 50 pounds, and yet this guy was struggling like it was going to kill him.

“Mind if I take this? Thanks.” I said trying to add some type of humor to it.

“Uhhh, just, uh, put it over there.” The Vzk'tk said, pointing to another stack of boxes of similar size.

I eventually got it to the other side of the room, propping it up on top of another box. I couldn’t tell what the boxes were made of, it wasn’t of any wood I knew, but it wasn’t exactly metal either. I had never heard of plastic feeling like that, so I decided it was just another magical thing in the realm of aliens.

I ended up carrying around another few boxes, and then a few more, and a few more after that, until I realized I had carried a whole section of the room over.

Out of breath, I tried to talk to him. “Why- why did you have me carry all that?”

“Oh, because this would have taken me about (3 weeks), but look at you, just (2 hours)!

Still out of breath, I manage an “Okay man.” and decide to sit down.

I decided to strike up a conversation with my self in my head, like I like to do when I need to solve a problem.

‘What type of being can’t lift something that light? Are these guy’s made of sticks? Or was he just not that strong?’

‘Well he did say it would have taken him 3 weeks.’

‘Yeah well, think about it, maybe they evolved differently from us.’

‘I never thought about that, are you saying that I evolved to be super strong?’

‘Not necessarily, perhaps they just evolved to be weak.’

My inner monologue was cut short when the captain came in. He seemed to be ready to scold #1, perhaps for being too slow, but instead his hand stayed in mid air in disbelief. His mouth was agape, presumably because he wasn’t sure how #1 did the job so fast.

“H-how?”

“Yo.” I said, waving my hand from below him, catching his attention.

“You did this? I knew you were strong, but you also have the endurance to do THIS?”

“You should see the mature humans.” I said with a snort.

The captain stared at #1, with #1 giving what I could only take as a shrug from his kind, and stormed out.

“Did I do something wrong?” I said, still staring at the door.

“Oh, no, no, no, no, nothing at all, he usually storms out of situations that he can’t grasp. That’s just his normal reaction to those types of situations.”

“As long as he’s okay, then I’m okay.” I replied, now focusing my attention on my hunger. “I take that back, I’m not okay, I’m starving!”

“We can’t feed you more than a small ration, and even that might be too much. It’s straining our sphere supply far too much.”

“Just a few will do for now, I just need something to eat, even if it’s the same 4 spheres you usually give me.”

“Fine, four, that’s it, I still want to be eating next (week).” #1 replied.

I ate the spheres and retreated back to my room. It appeared that the door hadn’t been touched, making me think that the captain, or the crew for that matter, had not found the dented door. I set down my white hoodie that I had taken off before getting too far into the lifting, in fear that I might never get to wash this thing ever again. I rested my head on the hoodie and fell into a deep sleep.

At the station the sheriff kept his feet on his desk and his hat on his head. The bottom of his boots were un-scuffed. He didn’t walk much. The man saw it in his waist as much as his footwear. 

He had a small bottle of eye drops and an envelope of powder. The sheriff grinned when he saw them. 

“Are you a hounder?”

The man shook his head. His hat slipped a bit. He’d need to get a new band for it. He took it off and hooked it on the arm of the chair. His clothes stuck to him uncomfortably as they dried. It took a moment for the sheriff to get upright. His eyes were manic bright. “I don’t suppose you’re looking for someone nearby. With your professionalism you would have ferreted them out by now.”

The man passed over his copy of the file. The sheriff’s face soured when he opened it. He sucked on his teeth as he read. The man watched them dry. There were still stains on the file from the rain. It had come down sudden and soft for the fifteen minute walk from the hotel to here. It had wiped the buildings clear of coal dust. The man could breathe easy for now. The light slanting across the floor showed that the sheriff was a slower reader than expected. There was a small chunk of ice in front of the desk fan. As the chilled air fluttered the papers the man followed the power cord to the wall. Against the wall the teletypes clattered the latest reports. The man watched the papers fold into baskets on the floor, a gentle chime sounding for each new news as it came down the wire. 

When the sheriff finally put the file down he did not speak. He tipped some powder into his coffee and swirled the cup. He took a hesitant sip then set it aside. When he looked at the man he cracked his neck.

“Lots of girls go missing. At that age, and this place there’s no telling where she’s from. If she’s connected to Mrs Willson, which I’m doubting, what of it?” The sheriff jerked on a drawer until it opened. “We sometimes get requests to keep an eye out, from the East especially, but people know what happens here. You do. I can tell just by looking at you. Let it go. Let the dead stay dead.”

The man tapped a finger on his knee. He hadn’t eat that morning. He could feel his stomach pulling in. If the girl had been dead longer than the pin had been missing, someone must have found her and left it on her. 

The sheriff sighed. “Best I can suggest is talk to the woman again. Or her maids.”  When he stood his back cracked loudly. “When are you going to wake up?”

A small collection of poetry. 

--




My heart did not grow lighter, as I then sat down beside her.    
The woman of my dreams and of my love,      
For her voice was like the dew, and it was then I truly knew,      
That to stay but silent would have been my rue.       



Oh maiden fair with the raven hair, with emerald eyes beyond compare,      
Just lean to me and whisper but your name.      
For your looks they do enchant me, and your words they do entrance me,      
And I fear I might have fallen for your snare.      


So have pity on the fool, who lets love and beauty rule,     
For lesser reasons, lesser men have abdicate.     
In that dress I see you bow, my true love I can avow,     
But content I’ll be to know your name for now.     

---

My love was like the snow, so fresh and crisp and new,    
My love was like the morn, so cool and slick with dew,    
I held her in my arms, and said to never leave,   
I held her in my arms, having nothing left to grieve.  

I rose up all alone, without her by my side,  
I rose to face the day, unable to stem the tide,   
Of pain and loss and fading dreams so quickly blown away,  
There's not one thing of hers I have, to make her echo stay.   

She's resting on the hillside, beneath the flowering plum,   
Where she can hear the children play, the songbirds gently hum,  
There is no joy in my life now, no songs of passion play,   
The lights of hope have all gone out, since she has passed away   

---

The wall, the wall, the writing on the wall,        
I cannot see the writing, and neither can the wall.        
Bird cannot see bat, and bat can see no bird,      
save for when they give their word,       
or at least that's what I've heard.       
Hope, oh hope, my kingdom for some hope,       
how hard it is to run a land at the very end of rope.      
Bread, oh bread, our children cry for bread,         
Or husk of grain, or grain of hope, or else they shall be dead.       
There is no bread, there is no hope but plenty lengths of rope,        
Hoping next for better luck, you maybe should've fled.        
Quiet, how quiet, how quiet are the streets,         
That you could shout your hidden name, and never shall it 'peat.      
A dying city, a perfect city, and city without life,      
Is one without vice or crime, nor any kind of strife.        
The wall, the wall, the writing on the wall,       
I can now see the writing, but cannot see the wall...

""Oh do you see that manor, with your two eyes keen?    
There she dwells the fairest girl, that you've ever seen.     
Sing fa-lala-low, A-biddy-de-bow, sing fa lala-la-ling.     

She can dance with all the grace, of the noble hind.     
Her darling feet in spiraling leaps, do they ever wind.     
Sing fa-lala-low, A-biddy-de-bow, sing fa lala-la-ling.     

Her lovely eyes, her darling eyes, of the darkest green,     
are greater than all emeralds, that you've ever seen.     
Sing fa-lala-low, A-biddy-de-bow, sing fa lala-la-ling.   

I would give her riches, and I would give my life.
To be with her forever more, and to call her wife.
Sing fa-lala-low, A-biddy-de-bow, sing fa lala-la-ling!""

"[OT] Sunday Free Write: Leave A Story, Leave A Comment - Illustrating Wonderland Edition",SurvivorType,"I wrote this five years ago, half-asleep on a Seattle/Boston red-eye.

Eleven months later, it inspired a much more awake me to build a world rich enough for a novel... or so says aspiring writer me.

""You know I don’t love you, don’t you?""

""What *this* is - you and me - is not about love. At least not in the singular way *you* think about love.""

""I know love. I’ve *always* known love. Young dreamy girl love. And raw, restless, loin burning woman love. I was born to love, soaked with it... or so I’ve been told.""

""You are a courageous woman, Elena.""

""Courage? Courage didn’t drag me out of that forsaken hospital bed, didn’t permit you to pull those curtains shut. I love Gabriel, you know... He’ll always be the one for me.""

""Then why are you here, with me, in this sterile room?"" *Smiles.*

""God only knows-""

""He doesn’t. Allow me to tell you.""

""...""

""You are here because he cannot give you what *you need.*""

""That is not fair.""

""You are here because he can’t give you what *you want.*""

""W-what I want?""

""And what *you* want, *I* need to give.""

""I’m confused... so confused.""

""But also curious.""

""I *am* curious, and eager. Eager to comprehend this, this allure. When I see you; when you touch me... w-when you hold me-""

""You mean like this?""

""*Oh...*""

""Describe it.""

""It’s something *new*. Not love - I know that, but not *unlove* either. My mind drifts to a place outside love, or in the fringes of love. I can’t tell. Then something in my chest wants to scream. My body surrenders. And I can’t explain this feeling of... *belonging.*""

""Try.""

""I exist only for you. My body breathes solely at the command of your touch. My whole life, the ghost of a prologue to that one chapter in your arms. The ghastly creature flees and my humanity takes over. Instinct overpowers me! And my heart wants to burst because I, want, you.""

""Close your eyes, Elena. Let me introduce you to Chapter 2.""

***


""*Wake up, Jacob.*""

Jacob woke, never knowing sleep, to the whisper of unfamiliar sounds inside himself. He didn’t know how he knew *sound*, but he knew sound he *heard*. A crash, a hiss, like waves. Waves of sound and curiosity, the only feeling possessed. He didn’t know much; didn’t feel much, but he knew curiosity he felt, like the forgotten famished or a tornado without relent. Curiosity gave life, moved him to create, and to discover what he himself *was*. Concepts... concepts began to gather forming thought.

And thought fluttered, and shimmered, offering a pleasant pitter patter with its invention. A string of ideas washed over him. More thought, cool and overwhelming, a memory similar to the slick blanket of sensation embracing his form.

The boy had the sense to call out, to imitate these intrinsic noises, but his self-awareness was mesmerized by - well, his self-awareness! Jacob realized *he* was, and with being came discomfort, and discomfort tickled the urge to move. But define movement. The opposite of what he was? How rather curious, he thought. He tried and failed, then failed and tried. Thrice he wriggled and strained. Movement was denied. The gelatinous jailer clutched him tighter and swayed.

Was it force? Yes, force. Having figured out he too could fabricate sound, he accepted force as curious too. The moment he did, and while concurrently realizing several moments stitched together time, a flare entered his mind. Anxiety, distress, the feelings merged with a thousand ideas, all rooted in a common thought: Survival. Jacob didn’t understand, but what he was, was drowning.

""*Come to me, child.*""

The liquid intoxicated his mouth and lungs. Jacob instinctively heaved. His new found brain and consciousness discovered the connection to his *arms*. The languid flesh rods responded to his thoughts the same way as his tongue. He lunged and thrashed, flailing his arms at the surrounding attacker. Water be gone, the boy thought. He kept pushing and pushing and then pushing some more. Nothing happened. A frown descended on his brow. The gigantic maw of the abyss parted, and swallowed.

Imagination sparked again, a thought and its acceptance: two other arms. Wait, not arms: legs. The boy smiled inside the sapphire colossus. He flexed a leg, his body inched up. He flapped an arm, and down he went. Leg, leg, arm, arm, Jacob began to move!

The aquatic boy swam towards the surface. His head now above water, he tasted the air and swallowed it. The chest puffed. He giggled and opened his eyes. The childish laughter evaporated. Powerful visions invaded his thoughts, a size and number too large for him to comprehend. Concepts like *light*, *color*, *reflection*, and *warmth* flooded his brain and fought for attention. He twitched, overwhelmed. He closed his portals to the world and submerged, retreating inside. It stung to see again, but he did it anyway. He waved at the dozens of sleeping children at the bottom of the ocean, but none said hello. He wondered why they stayed in the cold and dark pit. Jacob disliked the dark, and detested all cold. The surface and the light, particularly the light, what an amazing sight. Amazing and of course, rather curious.

Like an avid sea creature, the boy bolted upwards and poked out his head. The sun repelled him, and also beckoned. Jacob bit his lip, confused at the duality of the phenomenon. The sweet warm slap ignited in him two opposite emotions: curiosity and apprehension. No matter, he thought and ignored apprehension. He enjoyed the warmth and declared it good. Time to head in the direction of the light.

Jacob created a steady rhythm of arms and legs, followed by a gasp for air, then more arms and more legs. He travelled the angered ocean, using the light as his map and its heat as the compass. The boy gazed into the distance and beamed, delighted to discover his new *body*; the name he branded the collection of limbs, mouth and eyes composing his self. So much left to learn. His journey commenced in the middle of the sea. The eagerness of a student and the patience of a teacher, but always a smile and curiosity in hand. The force of the waves carried him inland to a place where light shone the brightest when new children arrived. A place Jacob will soon come to know as *Miracle Island*. There, at its shore, amongst tiny white crystals and hundreds of other sleeping bodies, the overwhelmed newcomer collapsed in exhaustion.

The sandman towered, compelling him to a deep, profound slumber. The drifting blue nursed his breathing, offering precious rest. This was important. The children of the island rarely knew the comfort. Jacob hadn’t experienced yet the truth about the secret location. Eventually he would. Behind the wall of sorrow and tribulation, they all would.

This little number was a series of shorts about a kid and his Sorceress Mentor that I originally posted to my Facebook wall. The *Inspiration* for it was imagining a conversation in which a magic user answered a question about why the lines in their cloak glowed when they cast a spell.

First Two Scenes copy/pasted here for those that don't want to click through, though there's a third scene at the link, I just don't have the characters to paste it here as well. ;P :

    ========== Scene 1 ==========

“I’ve got another question,” the apprentice began, only continuing after his teacher gave her assent, “Why do the lines in your cloak light up when you cast spells?”

Smiling she answered, “You know how Mana Stones glow with the energy held within them?” he nodded, “Well, within each of these lines is a fine Mana Stone dust, sewn into the threads by the Faye Tailors of Yelsm. And let me tell you, they don’t work cheap.”

His eyes lit up, “So then it enhances your magic!”

Chuckling, she shook her head as she responded, “There is nowhere near enough of them to lend anything more than a negligible bump to anything I attempted to cast through them.”

With a frown he asked, “Then… what’s the point?”

“Consider this among the many things you’ve yet to learn, not everything has to be so practical,” continuing, she couldn’t help but laugh as she added, “Besides, it looks bloody awesome doesn’t it?”

He smiled as he replied, “Yeah… I guess it does at that.”


          ========== Scene 2 ==========

A twisting pillar of fire erupted from the paved stones between the apprentice and the monstrosity that had begun advancing on him. The heat was enough to scorch him and drive it back, the roar of the flames drowned out every other noise, and the air became harder to breath as it appeared. Even in his fear he could not look away. Small strands of fire glowing hotter than the whirlwind pulled away from the tornado of flame and began pooling in the center of the vortex, growing in mass to take a distinctly human shape.

Words in the language of magic, words that had no representation in common tongue, erupted from the pillar as if amplified by the cone. Louder even than the raging of the vortex, these words reverberated in the stones and tore at the very substance of the beast ripping it from reality as if it were made of a thin paper and expelling it back, he assumed, to wherever it had come from.

As the creature dissipated, the pillar of flame grew even hotter as the figure within turned towards him, throwing it's hand up to point at him as his teachers voice came bellowing out, ""WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!?""

""I'm..."" shrinking back, he attempted to stammer out an explanation, ""I didn't...""

The flames erupted outwards caressing every surface of the stone cellar, scorching him further as they passed over his body, and causing him to shrink in on himself even moreso, but not doing any serious damage to either him or his clothing. Standing where the pillar had been was his teacher in her casting robes, the lines illuminated in an rapidly fading red. The fire in her eyes however burned hotter than even the pillar had, and in their intensity, filled the void left by the sudden silence.

""Think?"" she completed his statement, ""that much is obvious."" she appended, the lowered volume of her voice having absolutely no effect on the power it had on him. Each word broke across him as if she had whipped him with her voice.

""I'm sorry…"" he responded weakly.

""Explain yourself,"" she demanded.

""I…""

""Stop stammering,"" she ordered.

Taking a deep breath he composed himself before starting again, ""I was trying to summon an Imp to help me finish my chores like you've mentioned you used to do before taking me on.""

A flicker of something… amusement? was gone before he could confidently tell what he'd seen on her face as she replied, ""An IMP? Who taught you to spell, apprentice?""

""Nobody mam…"" he answered her, head down in embarrassment.

This time her frown was obviously strained as she walked over to the book open on his casting stand. Looking down at the page open to what he'd thought was the Imps summing ritual, she pointed out the title and asked him, ""What does this say?""

""Imps… Mam,"" he answered looking up at the title, ""I've seen it writ on your older chore lists.""

""Do you see this letter here?"" she pointed at the symbol before the last, ""What is this?""

""I don't know Mam,"" he figured that being respectful was the best way to avoid angering her further.

""This is a U. What you summoned was and ImpUS,"" she put special emphasis on the last part of the name, her voice taking on more of a lecturing tone, ""Bigger, Meaner, and far more Violent than their smaller Imp kindred. He would not have helped you with your chores, in fact, had I not felt you summoning him I would have had to find someone else to finish the chores.""

""I'm sorry mam,"" he answered, keeping his head down as he waited for her to continue, or to tell him what form of punishment would be required of him. After a few moments of silence, she did continue.

""It looks like teaching you to decipher runes before letters may have been a mistake,"" she said, her voice no longer as angry as it had been before, ""and I must apologize for somehow missing such an obvious gap in your instruction.""

Raising her hand the lines in her cloak grew black and he winced away, knowing as he did that some of the most dangerous spells came from Black Magic. Speaking the words of Magic once more, he could feel the power behind her voice as a small dark hole opened up in the floor beside them. Crawling out of the darkness came a small green hairless creature of short stature, with thin arms and large pointed ears.

""This,"" she informed him as the words faded from the air and the hole closed up behind the creature, ""is an Imp."" Speaking another tongue that he also did not recognize, she was answered in the same by the creature, who after a brief conversation saluted her and went scampering off.

""He will be your teacher in letters,"" she told him simply, and his eyes lit up, ""AFTER,"" she appended, a little of the earlier anger returned to her voice, ""you finish your chores. And you will not have dinner until they are completed in their entirety.""

Smiling from ear to ear, he attempted to ask, ""Couldn’t he…"" he trailed off, smile dropping as quick as it had come as her eyes hardened in response to his words, ""Yes, Mam!"" he answered instead, and imitating the salute the Imp had given her rushed upstairs to finish his work.

~~~~~

Watching the boy leave, a frown creased her brow as she considered what she was thinking bringing on another apprentice after all these years. A small smile of pride overtook the frown as she looked at the almost perfectly arranged summoning room. The kid certainly was a quick study. She decided to have him reset this room as well before dining, and left to inform him of his added task.",SpyderZT

I hope you enjoy it.

-

When people die, they usually get the whole 'life flashing before their eyes' thing. I didn't. I looked at the bus as it came charging towards me, and I had but one single thought. ""Oh, shit.""

I really don't know what I was expecting. Maybe some bright light, an angelic choir, or hell, even some fire and brimstone. What I got, was a guy named Greg. Now Greg wasn't any guy. Greg was a reaper. Yeah, that’s right, THE reaper. You know, the whole black cloak and scythe thing? But here's the thing. Greg wasn't the typical reaper.

He wore a plaid sweater and glasses. He looked in his 30s, yet still had acne. If anything, he was the stereotypical geek. He was the guy I'd turn to at work for computer problems, even if it wasn't his area of expertise. So when I saw the remains of my limp and disfigured body, I was hoping for something more....traditional. Instead, Greg walked right up to me, adjusted his glasses, and with a crooked smile said:

""You must be the deceased.""

""Uhh....yes?""

""You are asking if you are dead?""

""No.""

""Good, then lets get started.""

""Get started? Doing what?"" 

""Your new job of course.""

I didn't know why, but for some reason, I didn't feel that bad about dying. When people lose a loved one, they go through the Kubler-Ross model of grief, five stages from denial to acceptance, and who would you love more then yourself, right? Surely I would have bargained for my life, or at least had a cry about it, but the more I thought about it, the more I was okay with it. 

When I asked Greg about it, he gave me some complicated answer which I just decided to translate as 'magic', despite there probably being little to no magic involved. I tried to ask more questions, particularly about the afterlife, but it seemed Greg knew about as much as I did. It seemed that being a reaper was nothing more than being the person behind the ticket counter at a train station. He could show you the way to your destination, but he couldn't get on the train with you.

""Here we are."" Greg pulled his busted old Camry over to the side of the road and we got out. It was a quiet little house. Blue shutters, nice green grass, white picket fence. It was the kind of house you dream of living in as a child with the perfect family living inside. The evils of the world were meaningless when you were inside. But you grew up in an apartment in the city, letting the world corrupt you inside. Greg handed me a small black book. 

""This belongs to you. This is your diary, to look after till you leave for the afterlife. This is your job. Open it."". I flipped open the diary, to a random page, where, written on the very top line was a name in red ink. 'R. Lansbury'. beneath that sat the address where we stood and the third line held two simple words, 'Broken neck'. ""That name is very important to you.""

""It is?""

""Yes. It's important to you, because that is the name of the person you are going to reap.""

""I'm sorry, what?"" The last word that came out of his mouth seemed to bounce around in my head for a bit. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it.

""Reap. Collect, Harvest, Sow, crop, retrieve, whichever meaning you wish to use. You have to go in that house, find out who R. Lansbury is, and take their soul. I figure the best way to learn this job is to get you right into it. I'll be with you, but only as an observer.""

""You can't expect me to just walk in there and take someone's life!""

""Oh, no no no. You aren't taking their life. You're just taking their soul. You aren't killing anybody. You're more like an intermediary to guide them to their final destination.""

""What about me, huh? Shouldn't you be guiding me to my final destination?"" Greg looked at me and sighed.

""Sorry, but I don't pick who replaces me. I just follow the orders of the higher ups.""

""Higher ups? Like-wait, replace you? Where are you going?""

""I met my quota. Now, I'm being promoted. Better pay, good health benefits. This is why I'm training you. You will take my place. Now, shall we go? We are running out of time."" Greg then proceeded to walk through the gate to the door. I wished I had something else to say, but nothing came to mind. So I followed him to the house. He knocked, and a few seconds later, a young woman opened the door. ""I'm sorry, we seem to have broken down on your street, would you let me call my insurance company to send a tow to pick us up?""

""Oh my, of course, do come in."" she replied, indicating for us to enter. We walked inside and into her lounge room as she closed the door behind us. ""If one of you would like to sit down, I can bring you some tea or coffee while the other follows me to the phone in the kitchen.""

""Water please."" I said as I made my way onto the couch. She then led Greg through another door towards the kitchen. The house seemed cosy enough. I should have done some snooping, but I just felt bad about invading on this womans hospitality. She was kind enough to let us in, after all.

a few minutes later, she returned, with a tray in hand, complete with an ice cube filled glass of water and some biscuits.

""Your friend says it will be a couple hours till the tow truck arrives, so please, make yourself at home till then.""

""Thanks, uhh....""

""Regina. But most people call me Reg."" She smiled. Greg returned to the lounge room.

""Thanks for also letting me use your bathroom, Mrs. Lansbury."" Greg nodded to me. Somehow I was supposed to take that hint as a 'you know what to do', but I really didn't. Regina sat down on her own little armchair as Greg sat next to me, and whispered in my ear.

""R. Lansbury. So all you need to do is reach over, touch her shoulder and think about releasing her soul, and your powers will do the rest."" Greg then leaned back in the chair, as I looked over at Regina. She was looking out the window, as if expecting company. I reached over and touched her shoulder, yet nothing happened. She looked at me holding her shoulder, and I had to say something lest she gets the wrong idea.

""Thanks for all your help, Regina."" I removed my hand and she smiled. I can't take this womans life. We heard a buzzer go off in the kitchen, and Regina excused herself and walked away. I turned to Greg. ""I can't do this. I can't take her soul.""

""I know. I could feel your power, but nothing was happening. She isn't the one in the book.""

""That's not what I meant. I meant-wait, she's not? But she's R. Lansbury, right?""

""Yes, I noticed some mail in the hallway, this is the right family. However, I noticed a Robert Lansbury on one of them, so perhaps it's her husband instead?"" Greg looked at me expectantly.

""If it is, I'm just going to tag him and go. I don't think I could handle getting to know the people I reap."" Greg smiled.

""Of course not. Why do you think the diary only gives such minuscule details? If you get to know your target, you are less inclined to take them. You will learn to disassociate yourself from them."" Regina returned with a couple of plates of apple pie. They were nice and hot, seemingly just out of the oven. 

""Is your husband at work, Mrs Lansbury?"" Greg asked as she handed our plates to us.

""Yes, he is. He's overseas right now, and won't be back for a few days."" I stopped, fork in front of my mouth. People come back from business trips early sometimes, right? ""Oh, excuse me for a sec, I just need to answer the door."" She was looking out the window as she said it, before moving to the door. I turned, seeing a small girl, about seven or eight, running up the path to the front door, embracing her mother halfway, backpack falling from her shoulders.

If there was anything that made me feel sick to my stomach, it was this. Regina and the girl entered the house, walking up to us. I turned white as a sheet as Regina smiled and said, ""I'd like to introduce to you my daughter, Rachael.""

[\[wp\] a brush with fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/478hq0/wp_a_brush_with_fame/)

A few good responses and everything. My own response is too long to put here, but a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/478hq0/wp_a_brush_with_fame/d0b44f7) is easy to do when you're a copy+paste pro like I am. I thought it went alright.

Then I dragged something out of the ancient past to get out of my comfort zone. [A first entry \(maybe\) in what could be a longer series \(possibly\) of urban fantasy stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/47llwm/pi_the_undertakers_an_urbanfantasy_superhero_team/).

The guy who came up with the prompt seemed to like it, so that's something.

Finally, a more experimental prompt that went absolutely nowhere, but at least my entry is short enough to include here.

[\[WP\]\[CW\] Write a story based on a common aphorism or proverb, illustrating its meaning without explicitly stating it anywhere in the story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/47zr9a/wpcw_write_a_story_based_on_a_common_aphorism_or/)

Let's call it ""The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars."" Can you guess the aphorism it's based on? 

---


""Long ago, when the sun and the stars were still young, they lived together as a family. Day and night, they filled the sky like a field of glittering diamonds. The moon lived with them, too. She is older than any of the stars, and wiser--no, I don't care what your teachers told you. That's why the moon is bigger.

""But the sun resented the moon, and did all he could to become bigger and brighter. What? I don't know, he used supplements. That's not the point. The sun became stronger, so that his light began to eclipse the glow of the other stars. That means it blocked them. Yes, I know the moon eclipses the sun now. Again, that's not the point.

""The other stars started resenting the sun's arrogance. He talked down to them, making fun of them for not being as strong as he was. A few stars also tried supplements. Some exploded, some got so big they imploded under their own weight. It means they collapsed. Yes, black holes. Most of them just left, though, and stopped hanging with the sun altogether. They'd go out with the moon instead, because she was willing to share her light. The moon reflects the light from the sun? Then why is it white, when the sun is yellow? Yeah. Maybe think before you interrupt me with total nonsense.

""Anyway, pretty soon the sun is all alone. He spends his time being as big and loud as possible, because he thinks that will get him attention, and that attention is what he needs. But nobody likes him, you see, and he's exhausted from all the work. He tries to hang out with the moon and other stars, but they're all dodging him, keeping the planets between themselves and the sun. To this very day, the sun is still wandering around, lonely and alone, while the moon and stars spend all their time together, avoiding him.

""Do you understand, son? There's a reason you have no friends, so don't come crying to me all the time. Honestly, I don't know where that attitude of yours came from. Now how away, I want to watch my stories.""

"[OT] Sunday Free Write: Leave A Story, Leave A Comment - Illustrating Wonderland Edition",SurvivorType,"The next morning found him at the bar. He chewed on a dry cut of toast. The water was cold and had the metallic taste of a pump; he drank it and it was like sucking a coin. A women, dress too fine for the road, entered with little fanfare. She had a veil over her face and gloves over her hands. She did not speak but handed the bartender a card. 

“How many rooms?”

The woman held up two fingers. 

They discussed the price, the bartender always aiming too high and the woman shaking her head. He watched them argue. She had hunched shoulders and when she breathed he could see the veil pull tight over the edges of her face. The man left before they could agree on a price. He did not finish his toast.

***

It took two days to find Mrs Henry Willson. Her name was Camille and she let him in when he knocked. She offered him plain iced tea. There hadn’t been sugar here in awhile. When he handed her the cameo she sat down without smoothing her skirts. He heard the starched fabric get crushed between her knees and the horsehair couch. 

“I suppose you want to know who’s this was.” Her eyes searched his face. They were grey and looked like river stones. She didn’t wear gloves. Her nails were a bit too short. They were ragged where she chewed them. He could see the tremble in her hands as she ran her fingers over the shattered face. “I heard about the body.”

The body. He felt the weight of the words, the way it made a disconnect between who he found and what he found. The way the skull shone in the sun. How the powdery residue of bone clung to his hands for miles.  Her face was pinched in a way he couldn’t understand. Perhaps she was lying. The tea was over-seeped and bitter. 

“This was stolen from me when I was in Fort Means.” He watched as she placed it to the side. When she folded her hands on her lap she clenched them until her knuckles were white. “I bought it new from Cohen’s in New Amsterdam.” He had heard of it. They were opening a Western flagship in El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles. “Someone broke into my room. They took most of the money, some pearls, and…” she looked at the cameo and tapped it lightly. On the table it looked like a large beetle. “That was a month ago.”

He felt of cold flush of fear. The body – she – had been dead longer than that. Mrs Henry Willson stirred her iced tea. The spoon did not clink off the sides.

“When are you going to wake up?” It was asked in a flippant way. He squinted though the soft afternoon light. For a moment her lips did not match the words he heard. She seemed hazy to him. “Well?” She cocked her head, “are you finished? I have a function to attend.” 

He stood. She let a maid show him to the door. 

***

He had never liked the low city. The way it was nestled between the mountains made it to the catch basin – it was where everything lost drained to. He managed to leave the outskirts before the sun touched the bowl of the world. There was no rush so he let horse walk, reigns loose across its neck. As the night grew deeper the highway wound between the long hills. He couldn’t sleep. Not with the constant rocking. He pulled a blanket over his back. The horse was hot and he could feel it breathing, the great bellows of its lungs. 

They slowly passed a sea of cattle. At the far shore he could see the dim false star of a fire on the top of a hill. Between them hung a muggy fog of dust and animal sweat. The shuffling of hooves sounded like the thunder of the waves. He couldn’t remember if he had ever seen the ocean. As he rocked across the stretch he couldn’t remember what he hadn’t seen. Had there been a statue in the bay of New Amsterdam, or was that something he heard in a radio play? He never had an active imagination. When he read he could only see the words in front of him. He had never had a dream – or if he had, he never remembered it. He didn’t need to recall the place he was. It existed as much as he did. 

***

Just before the break of dawn the world was washed in the blue light. In the middle distance he thought he saw a man shift into a coyote. Or it a coyote into a man. The sky was massive here beyond the small hills. It went from one end of the endless to the other. For a few tense minutes the sun and the moon almost occupied the same sky. Because he lacked imagination he didn’t hold his breath. The sun rose as it always did, and he rode as he always did. His eyes itched in a dry way that made him blink too much. There was no wetness left. He tiled the canteen over his eyes and watched the world blur.

***

No one in the low city had known the body. It had been taken west to the middle fort. He looked at it on the metal table. It looked too wild, too strange to be surrounded by the bright glare of the modern age. A radio in the corner hummed the opening to the news. The president had left the White City and was coming south. The doctor held the folder in gloved hands. The rubber was black and left small ovals of matte blackness wherever they touched.

The man had wiped the residue on his pants. The body was nude. A white sheet covered it. It could have been sleeping except for the cold of the room. A block of ice melted in the far corner and dripped onto the pitted concrete floor. 

“I can tell you she was dead for more than seven months. She’s dry inside and out.” The doctor tapped his foot. The sound rang though the room. “I’d say exposure – almost certainly dehydration.” In almost an offhand manner he added, “She has nice teeth. Quality work. Nothing like you can get out here. Not even on the coast.” The way he looked at the body was pure disinterest. “I’d peg her a nineteen, not a day past twenty. I can tell by the cartilage.”

The man looked at the sheet. There were shadows and things deeper than shadows, the dark silhouette of the body underneath. Her clothes were in a brown bag clipped to the end of the brushed blued metal. The doctor closed the file and set it on the wood desk. It was a heavy reddish wood. It looked almost bloody in the sterile room. The man stared at the file. He read a copy of it last night on the train. The wheels had murmured to him, a thin wordless pleading though the long dawn. 

“I don’t suppose you know her?” The doctor asked. The man shook his head. He helped slide the body into the cooling unit. After the handle fell the doctor looked at the clock then turned off the radio. “I have a good malt I have to get home to.”

When they exited the room of the dead, the man saw the yellowing of the doctor’s skin. His teeth were stained. The hallway echoed with their footsteps. Tall shutters kept out the sun and the heat.

“When will you wake up?” the doctor asked as he held open the door to the hot outside. The man was close enough to see his lips, the shape of goodbye underneath the words before the door shut. He could imagine the doctor slinking back into the cold dead room and pulling a bottle from the desk.

***

The hotel room had a carpet. It was snug to the wall and stiff with starch. The greyness of the wool was clean. He had never seen one before. It muffled his steps more than grass or snow. He toed off his boots and stood on it in his socks. 

The bed took up most of the room. The basin and pitcher were next to the window. He was closer to the ocean than he had even been. The body was going to be held until someone claimed it or the month passed. Then it would be put in the ground for the first and final time. The thought nagged at him as he opened the window. 

Below people passed with heads down. Across the street a seamstress carried out small white boxes and a woman in a grey dress followed. He looked at her clothes, the way she carried herself, and wondered what she would look like in the desert. 

Would she dry too, in the heat? 

The air smelt like coal. To the north the roiling smoke smeared the sun red in a black sky. He felt the height. This was a mountain town where people came to feel closer to the stars. It was too bright from all the windows to see them though. The light smeared the night a muddy grey. He could taste the burning on his tongue.

"[WP] ""My name is Legion, for we are many.""",SurvivorType,"The voice was strange, gravely and distant. It was everywhere, all around me. I could feel the echo in my soul. This was something I needed to do. I needed it more than air or love or life. Raising the pistol to her sweet face she looked up at me with those blue eyes I had come to adore. She was pleading with me, begging without words. She thought this was some elaborate prank.

*Do it.* The voice whispered, insistent. No, I want to prolong this, draw it out for as long as possible. 

*Just do it!* The voice screamed and I clenched my eyes shut. I pulled the trigger.



The 'voice' as he had been known for centuries sighed contentedly, an early morning murder was always good for the soul. As he spun in his chair, looking over the world map. The next 'victim.' His eyes found the mother and child and a suspicious gleam lit his eye. ",FireWitch95
"[WP] ""My name is Legion, for we are many.""",SurvivorType,"The boy in front of me, no older than thirteen, looked as if he had a terrible accident with red paint. Both arms were covered up to the elbow, with dry flakes under his nails. His khaki pants and white shirt were both ruined. Even his face was covered in red splatter, harsh against his pale features and unblinking eyes. Crouching beside him, I knew this wasn't an accident. 

""Marcell?!"" Rebecca called out from the lower levels. ""Have you found anything?!"" 

""Yeah!"" I hollered back. The boy in front of me didn't move. He just kept staring towards the closed door on the other side of the room. Sometimes his eyes trailed lower, to the small red footprints that ended where he now sat. ""Come on up!"" 

I heard the wooden steps creak ad Rebecca made her way up to me. Glancing down at the pair of garden shears, also covered in red gore I sighed. This was no job for a rookie. I should have told her to stay outside. 

Ignoring the smell of copper that lingered in the room and stuck to the back of my throat I addressed the boy. ""Danny."" I said, using the name I had seen on the school photos downstairs. No reaction. ""I need you to speak to me."" Still nothing. 

""Jesus."" Rebecca whispered as she reached the top step. She was new but she wasn't an idiot. I knew her eyes were piecing together the scene before her. The oldest child covered in blood, shears beside him. The parents and the younger sister nowhere in sight. The closed door across the room, red slowly soaking the white carpet below it. And most of all, the smell of death. 

Danny's eyes tracked Rebecca as she moved towards the door and I let my hand drop to my waist and fall on the butt of my pistol. Glad for the light jacket that kept it concealed. Her feet squished as she stepped on the soiled carpet. 

""Don't."" I told her, knowing that I couldn't stop her. This was part of the job, either she could handle it or she couldn't. 

""What's behind this door Marcell?"" She asked, voice shaky. 

I still didn't take my eyes from Danny. As the door creaked open his mouth parted to form silent words. No, I frowned. One word, over and over again. A word I recognized. 

""Dear God."" Rebecca whispered. ""How could this happen?"" 

I heard the door close and swiveled my head to see Rebecca on the floor, hugging her knees to her chest. But she wasn't crying. I wasn't sure that was a good sign or not but she was keeping it together. 

""Legion."" Danny said, in a voice too clear for someone who had been in shock for the last dozen minutes. I popped the safety strap on my holster. 

I glanced back to the young boy. His eyes were wide but focused on my face. ""What happened here....it wasn't your fault."" I told him, hoping the confidence in my voice would keep what was left of his sanity together. 

""I know."" He whispered back to me and blinked for the first time. Except when his eyes opened they were totally black. 

""What the fuck."" Rebecca exclaimed, hopping back to her feet, thoughts of what was behind the door seemingly banished. In a moment she had her pistol drawn in a two handed grip, pointing towards the ground.

""How nice to see you again Marcell."" The thing that had taken over Danny said and the words carried the slightest of echoes. ""We were beginning to think you had given up. Ah, you've brought along a new friend. Does she know what happened to the last one?""

""Yes."" I said. ""She does."" 

Danny's face twisted into a cruel sneer. ""Lovely."" It said, and the words carried more weight than the voice should have been able to deliver. ""Why do you bother, just come back to us?"" It continued, slowly standing with shears in hand. ""We existed in the abyss before your conception. And we will exist long after your passing.""

I stepped back and brought my gun level with its face. Rebecca moved out from behind me and to the side, hands trembling but still aimed at what used to be Danny. For a moment his eyes returned to normal and we were given a peek at the scared little boy who was horrified at his own actions. 

Then he rushed forward with the shears and a single shot from my revolver broke the stillness of the suburban neighborhood. ""I was too late."" I said to no one in particular after several moments of staring at the body. 

""Marcell."" Rebecca started, her pistol already holstered. ""Was there any way he could have-""

""No."" I interrupted, and let her see the sincerity in my eyes. ""Legion gains a foothold through weakness. Once it can control you it's over. There's no coming back. They can take you whenever they want and when they get bored they leave you with the memories of what you've done.""

Rebecca met my stare, eyes steady but haunted. ""Except for you."" She said. ""You came back."" 

""Except for me."" I agreed. ""Which is how I know they can be beaten. Or at least locked far, far away."" Rebecca didn't respond. 

""Let's go."" I said, holstering my own weapon after a few tries. ""The police outside will have enough trouble spinning a story for this without us showing up on the evening news."" 

Without hesitation we fled the house. Eager to leave behind the things we had seen. But I knew I would see them again tonight. The gruesome tabloid behind that door would play itself back in full color in my dreams. ",JustLexx

The Edict has been broken.",SylvanAuctor,"Blood dripped from the usurper's marble blade, onto the floor of the throne room. The echo of each drop hung in the air for moments, unbroken except by the haggard breathing of Rukiel, the assassin, the usurper - and the new King.

Casually, Rukiel threw his hand to the side, and the marble blade eroded into dust. The blood that slicked its surface fell to the ground, and began soaking into the dust. Rukiel stepped over the remains of what had been his blade, then the body of the old King, and then the bodies of his guards. The crown had clattered on the marble floor, rolling away from the throne and settling in a distant corner, away from the light of the stained-glass windows.

The scent of blood and death was pungent in the air. As Rukiel crouched down to pick up the crown, he held his breath. His fingers grazed the cold metal of the crown, and then closed around it. Its sharp edges bit into his skin - ragged steel, uncomfortable on the brow - but it bothered Rukiel not. The pain meant it was *real.*

Rukiel inhaled once more as he stood up, breathing in like he was swallowing the world. The miasma of death didn't bother him now that he had the crown in his hands. Delicately, he placed it on his head, and surveyed his throneroom. Raniv littered the floor, and their tapestries fluttered on the walls, each portraying symbols of Air, of Fire, of Water, in alternating order. With annoyance, Rukiel placed his hand on the stone of the wall, and watched as spikes erupted from the stone, piercing the tapestries, tearing them into tatters.

Light filtered beautifully through the stained-glass, tinted by its colors and hues, in stark contrast to the gruesome massacre it revealed. Many of the bodies had marble spikes through them, which had grown straight from the floor. Others had been crushed by fallen stone ceilings, or had their bodies mangled, their bones shattered and flesh pulverized. 

The usurper Rukiel placed his palm against the marble floor. The ground shuddered, then pulled away, opening a chasm. The bodies of the guards and the corpse of the dead king fell into the opening. Then, pressing his palm into the floor, Rukiel watched with grim satisfaction as the chasm crushed the bodies, condemning them to a final grave. Fitting, he thought as he stood up, that the throneroom of the kingdom would have its foundations become a cemetery in stone. It was the fate they had chosen when they had cast out the Savagit dynasty - the blood of the Earth - so long ago, and thrown the Crown between themselves every twenty years, leaving the Savagit to watch from the desert. They had cast out the Earth, and now the new era would be built upon it.

Smiling - pleased that his plans had come to fruition - Rukiel stalked over to the throne, then sat on it, relaxing. He would wait here, to see if more guards made it past the other members of his once-fallen dynasty. And if they did, they could join their brethren below. ",TyrRev

I took off like the wind bolting out the door with vim and vigor. I barely caught the bus ontime. Most kids companions  fit on the bus and if they don't they usually ride them to the stables on campus.  I kept my eyes peeled for my companion, but I didn't see them on my way to school.""

""See your not good enough to get a companion. You're an alien who doesn't belong. ""Victor sneered as he passed by me to greet his griphon, Lucifer. 

I really thought he was right I curled up on the steps and cried.  I missed the bus home but what was the point I could never face my brother Xavier and his snarky monkey Philip.  My mother would be ashamed of me.  I had hardly eaten my lunch as I looked in to see what I had left when my chocolate bar moved of its own accord. Not even my chocolate wanted to be by me. ""Wait! Hey! That's mine! ""  I shouted as it scuttled down the steps.  
I may not have a companion but I'm not gonna let this chocolate excape me!  I jumped to pounce it and landed on a inky blackish blue purple green swirled scaled lizard thing with six legs. It's eyes were silver and slit.    

""Master forgive me I was just so hungry and shy.... please don't crush me. "" She begged quietly. 

""What... did you just say? "" 

""I'm sorry? Master?"" She repeated. 

""Your my companion?"" I couldn't hold myself back as I rolled off and pulled her into a bear holding hug. ""Thank goodness! What are you? Who are you?"" 

"" your not mad? I am a basilisk , and my name is Aryss.  Forgive my shyness, I wasn't sure if you would like me.""

""Like you? Your the coolest please never hide from me again aryss!""  ""

This dull knife sits, waiting patiently.

I will never sharpen it and yet it sits, expectant that one day I'll renew it to its former glory. Of course this knife has lost its innocence. Just like myself.

It once was an ordinary kitchen knife, a tomato knife. It was once used to slice tomatoes, long ago that was the only red that it saw.

These days though it longs for the simple times. Sometimes I do as well. Those days where it was rarely used but had a simple utilitarian purpose. I suppose it still does serve a sort of utilitarian function even now. But both the knife and I know that we were not originally designed for the things we now do. The crimes we commit.

In my basement is a man. I'm sure as I sleep he dreams of the days when he was whole and hopeful.

This man is waiting, patiently.

I will never release him and yet he sits, expectant that one day I'll release him to live his former life. Of course this man has long since lost his innocence, just like myself.

Once he was an ordinary man, a handsome man. He once laughed and loved, long ago those were the only things that he knew.

In my heart there is a secret. As I sleep I dream of the days when I was shiny and new.

I will never say it out loud but yet it sits, expectant that one day I'll release it to the world. Of course I have lost my innocence, and that is my secret.

I was once an ordinary girl, a cheerful girl. I once used to laugh and love, and long ago those were the only things that I knew.

These days though I long for the simple times. The times when we were happy together. The times when I had no purpose aside from being his punching bag. Those days I was rarely lost. I suppose I'm still not lost yet, I know who I am even now. But all three of us know that I was not originally designed for the purpose I serve now. The crimes I keep committing.

""I appreciate it, but this is my knife. I want to use my own knife.... thank you for the offer though."" 

""Well, whatever you want.""

This is my knife. Although easily dulled, it was my first knife ever. I wouldn't dare let it go, or ever forget it. I take to the floor and start working. The knife slowly dulls again, as it did yesterday. The head chef looks at me with curiosity and a condescending look, but I continue working with my dull knife. 

The day ends. I get home, undress from my work clothes and got ready for bed. I place the knife on my bedside table and fall asleep, anxious to prove my knife's worth the next day.

[WP] He yelled in rage and fear and horror.,Theminonking,"Spit came up as he sat up on his knees, the sky was dark and you could see the stars shining down like a jury witnessing his actions. He watched them twinkle in the air and cried from all sides of his eyes. It was dark, he could barely see his hand in front of his face, but he could see his breath as it escaped his body. When he finally gathered himself to his feet, he walked back over to the axe and restarted his labor. When finally seen the water seeping out, The Voice came back.

""Have you made up your mind, then?! This is it?"" He looked back and seen it again, the familiar face. 

""Do I have to repeat myself?"" He looked at it dully, the jug had been placed behind him to easily grab. He was more than three fourths of the way through. When he turned to finish opening up the rivers crevice, The voice spoke.

""Look someone is coming."" When he looked back, he was gone. Then he seen truck lights come over the bluff, and heard a familiar voice.

""Bobby!? Hey Bob! Are you there?! I could hear you from the barn. Come out."" It was his girlfriend's father. He picked up the axe by the neck and grabbed the jug of whiskey, and took one look around for that burden of his.

""Are you still coming?"" He said again.

When he got up the bluff, he seen her father's truck, and he was coming into the headlights. His large 6'9"" frame sauntered infront of the lights. His eyes weren't visible but clearly they were examining the person who just came from the river. 

""What?!"" Bobby said, ""What do you want?"" He was smaller than the large man of 6'9"" by four inches, and was physically less of a match to her father's strength. 

""Hey, I know your going through a tough time right now. I can't even imagine what must be happening inside your head, but I am here. I see you. I can see what is happening."" 

""NO YOU FUCKING DON'T!"" He cut him off, ""You don't see shit going on with me!? I don't need you to try and examine me or persuade me. Your not my parent, it's not your responsibility!"" 

""Hey look,"" He said and he was choking up at the sight of what Bobby was becoming. ""Don't do this, okay. I have never been in your shoes, and I can't even understand what is happening to you. No one should have to go through this and especially someone who is as strong as you. You don't have to get yourself back up now, but you have to keep trying."" 

He stopped at a familiar saying he once heard from a grandparent on her death bed, fighting for another day she spoke, ""No matter... how hard it gets... you have to keep... Trying."" The words echoed like song into his soul.

""I wouldn't wish what is happening to you to anyone on this earth, even if they were my enemy. I couldn't do this to them. If you pray, something might help you but you have to let it."" He spoke with a reverence.

Bobby stood there with his eyes glossed over and blank stare, ""Fuck god. Do you think he would do this to his people if he there was a god?! Do you fucking think that people would have to suffer this much just to bear witness to his omnipotence?! FUCK NO! IF I EVER MEET THAT SON OF A BITCH I'M COMING FOR HIM WITH EVERY OUNCE OF MY WILL AND I WILL SHOW HIM WHAT HE DONE TO ME! IF THAT MOTHER FUCKER IS REAL, I WILL SHOW HIM THIS ANGUISH AND PAIN! HE WILL REMEMBER WHAT HE DID TO ME, WHAT HE TOOK AWAY FROM ME! ALL OF WHAT I CARRIED AND WHAT I HAVE DONE, WAS FOR NOOOOTTTTTHHHHINNNNNNGGG!!!"" He yelled in rage, his fear, and horror. His legs could no longer hold him steady and he fell to his feet. Her father came over to assist him, and he took a swing at the large man but he took the blow without any emotion. 

""I'm so sorry son, I am really truly sorry."" His large arms grasped around him and lifted Bobby to his feet. ""Come on, lets go. You still have along way to go yet, you can't give up now."" 

Bobby, watched the ground float by like he was legless and he realized the voice was back. ",GallifreyKid

[WP] He yelled in rage and fear and horror.,Theminonking,"He yelled in rage and fear and horror, 

At the foot of the stairs, asunder, 

Lay the body of his love, no more--

Torn from chin to chest, was rendered

A ghost, red and bloody on the floor.



There above her figure was looming,

High with its horn stabbing the ceiling,

A scaled and violent creature--the horn,

Slippery with maroon cessation,

Dripped the fibrous water silver,

In the moonlight from open window,

As his screams of horror hit the door.



""Why god,"" he cried, ""there are no devils,

""Nor god if exists such pure evil,""

As his weakened limbs began quiver,

While her blood pooled metal on the floor.

""How can this be? And how are they getting away with it?!""

The haphazardly opened letter fell to the ground, in an almost angry manner. Floating like a feather, but smacking the floor like a ton of bricks. The numbers were slightly revealed, and more absurd than first read.

A dollar sign first. $6. Than, $65.

""How the Fuck?!""

The following numbers spilled out quickly, but like molasses.

[WP] He yelled in rage and fear and horror.,Theminonking,"(This is somewhat personal and fictional to add a barrier)

He walked out of the elevator, and the weight on his shoulders slumped him like a new passenger he incurred from upstairs. He watched his hands, as if they were able to resurrect the dead, but he felt a life slip not only from a child but also himself. With each step he felt the weight of his decisions. People passed by, without a second glance and to them he was just another person in the crowd. When the automatic doors opened to the outside, the sun was going down on him as if he felt it for the first time and his new fear smiled inside.

It was still cold in the Montana air, the drifts heaved up along side the road and the cows in the pastures breathe could be seen from the truck. He looked over at his passenger seat and seen the fresh blood from his girlfriend still thick and musky. He changed gears and kept between the lines, his face with a blank stair, the smell of hay was still fresh on his coat from when she called him home from feeding the cows. The whole situation played back in his mind like a purgatorious loop. He could just stop and walk from here to clear his head, but he decided to drive back to the house. When he got to the fence, he opened it autonomously and closed it as such. The truck squealed its way back up the road into its familiar parking space. When he got out, he looked at the passenger seat again, ""So you going to come with me?"" 

His feet felt stiff and stifling, so he grabbed her fathers gallon of whiskey and began his trek into the mountains. His culmination of his failures were following him towards his decided end; His schooling of premedical school and its bills that followed, his parent's home life was torn apart and he was welcomed by neither, the jobs he had and left without a notice, the apartment lease he left and owed to, and finally his expectations of being a parent were all shattered. Those responsibilities he had left for this moment, and he was drowning in its tar of failure. Along the way into the mountains, he grabbed the wood axe and drug it with him up the incline, he knew where he would go next. He remembered it was peaceful the first time he experienced it.

The drink was stiff and sweet, he coughed a few times and his breathe was coming out like a fiery fury. Then he heard him, it wasn't a person but that ghost that followed him everywhere he went and the beliefs that people had placed on him.

""Hey you, boy! Where you off to?"" He didn't hear his foot steps, but at this point his mind was freshly snapped, ""That drink looks good, but you should put it down. It ain't going to do you no good way out here, and you know what happens to people who tried to drown their sorrows. You have to get back up.""

He looked back for the speaker, but he couldn't see him yet. ""So, what?,"" He snapped, the axe was creating a line right behind him. He could see the next bluff and after that it was just another quarter mile to where he needed to go. He was just going to let the voice talk until it grew tired, he didn't have much to say and even if he tried tears would only follow. 

""Lets turn back, we can eat that Thanksgiving dinner from two days ago! I know there is a nice plate of potatoes waiting and we can get one of those smoked legs."" The thought of food was behind him, but the voice was desperate, ""We could go back and have a soda with that whiskey, and maybe talk to her again? Come on, lets go back."" 

It wasn't his rationale that was in control, it was the primal instinct of emotion that had his thoughts. He wasn't going to veer off this destination he already set, but the voice could bear witness to his last and final action. If not, he would make him. 

When they got to the riverbank, the cows had already left their drinking holes. He would have to try to break open the ice before it started to re-harded completely. He put the jug down, and lifted the axe high and swang down towards the river's bed, hoping to reach it in one full swing. When it collided, only chips had flung off the surface. He looked over at the jug and then seen him, the voice gained a face. He was familiar like a child hood friend or mentor with a smile that was welcoming, but to him it was smirking. 

""Fuck you, you mother fucker! What are you doing here?!"" He said with a hoarse voice, ""Your the one following me!? Your here now!? Right now!? Where were you when I need you!?"" 

""You need me now don't you!?,"" The voice responded back, ""I'm here now, right when you needed me.""

""YOUR TOO FUCKING LATE!"" He picked up the axe and took another swing, ""Do you know what I just lost!?""

The voice watched him chip at the ice, ""You lost a child,"" he spoke with a soft tone, ""You lost a family. You were willing to give everything up for that person you failed, but you didn't fail."" The voice began to come close, and he could hear the feet glide across the ice.

""DON'T YOU FUCKING MOVE!"" He stopped and turned towards The Voice, he started gliding towards that jug again sitting on the bank.

""Stop! You should stop drinking right now!"" The Voice watched him glup down the whiskey like it was water, ""You have another life to live for, and right now you are trying to avoid that responsibility."" 

""NO I'M FUCKING NOT!"" Some of the liquid bursted forth from his mouth like mad froth, ""What do you know about responsibility, or trust, or love!? Your a fucking ghost from my past trying to live again! I can see through you like a ziplock bag, you fucking floating rag!"" 

""You might see me as I am now, but I am still apart of you. I am all of who you are and your just trying to separate us, you are quitting! Giving into the fears of your mind. Don't do it! It's a quick path but it ends that way too! Don't do it!""

""Fuck you!"" He dropped the jug and ran towards the ghost, when he slipped on the ice he quickly scrambled to his feet and made a B line for him. He tackled the air, his body slid on the ice, and when he hit the bank, he pounded his fist like he was beating someone's chest. ""You fucking piece of shit! You don't know anything, you never where here to help me when I needed you, I'm alone! There is no one here to save me! Do you think someone is coming?! Fuck no!"" He began to sob into the snow, ""This fucking place is like a ugly game that we all have to just experience. No one has no real control, and everything is predetermined! Fuck this shit! I don't want to play anymore! Do you hear me?! I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS FUCKING SICK ASS GAME ANYMORE! I WANT OUT OF THIS FUCKING PLACE!""

However, instead of attacking humanity, they their seek protection.",TigerBroseff,"We've always had tales of the dead coming back. Izanagi tried to bring his wife back, and found her changed beyond recognition. Sisyphus thought to cheat Hades, and was damned for his efforts. Frankenstein, Jesus, Manzazuu, The Walking Dead… Death is a human obsession, and Undeath naturally follows.

Despite all the focus upon it, humanity was still unprepared. Most screamed and fled. Some gleefully applied arms to the situation. Others broke down in the streets, unable to reconcile reality with their beliefs in science or religion.

None expected the dead to be fearful, to be needy.

These weren't the bloodthirsty zombies of legend, or the plodding skeletons of myth. They were humans trapped in rotten flesh and bone. They cried out for mercy, for painkillers, for death itself.

But death did not come.

All across the Earth, newly dead became newly undead. The cancerous could not pass. The maimed were trapped. No soul could go into that soft great night.

An Ausshwitz survivor once remarked that both perfect happiness and perfect unhappiness were impossible. Human nature is naturally opposed to the infinite. When a thing became to terrible to bear, death naturally followed, the first anasthetic. What is left when even the sweet release of death is barred to a sufferer?

Madness.

The undead hordes could not bear this waking nightmare. Those with enough of a mind left sought obliteration, often through flames. Those without became worse than ever the tales could've imagined. A supernatural monster is one thing, but a human mind twisted by pain is far worse.

"[WP] Two possibilities exist- either we are alone in the universe, or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.",Toastasaurus,"The United Earth Research Vessel *Arthur C. Clark*, named for that famous author from so long ago, entered orbit around the large gas giant.  This was the fourth planet out from the system's star,  what was known to the humans as G7-4M1 in the charts.

Captain Gresha sat in her quarters, making an entry in the ancient maritime way, writing in an actual log book.  She preferred the writing, archaic as it was to do, because the nostalgia of it was soothing.  She was also one of the few humans who even bothered to learn the art, so practice is important.  She would transcribe into the computerized log later.

&gt;March 6, 2831, 6AM ship's time.  We arrived at our next target, G7-4M1, and First Officer Henderson has informed me we have achieved orbit of the fourth planet, per regulations.  This is our 256th system to visit, and our 17th galaxy overall, in this 5 year run... and our last, depending on what happens here.  If what the other 255 systems have taught us, we should be home in a week or so.  Thank goodness for the A-Drive, right?  3 billion or so light years isn't so far these days.  Still, fuel is fuel, and we need to get back to base after this visit.

&gt;I must admit, what with the reports over the Quantsponder from the other vessels, it looks a whole lot like Clark, our ship's namesake, was probably right.

&gt;We are so very alone in the universe.  A quirk in the system, if you will, an anomaly.  

&gt;Our sister ships, *Drake*, *Sagan*, *Azimov*, *Roddenberry*... and so many others that the UEC commissioned and flung out into the universe have all reported the same things:  Barren rocks.  Inhospitable systems for life, for one reason or another.  Hostile atmospheres, intense radiation, gravitational issues, etc, ad nauseum.

&gt;And not one, NOT ONE, can support us.  Not without terraforming of extreme measures.  It would take centuries, millennia, before we could inhabit any of the worlds our ships have discovered... and been disappointed in.  And even if we did the terraforming, of the 250 thousand planets that have been examined, only 40 or so would be even close enough to try.

&gt;I still expect the Council to pick a few of those and start the projects anyway... we need to get out here, and away from the Earth, after all.  We can't stay there forever.

&gt;The depression in all this time spent, even though it's only been close to 5 years, is becoming prevalent among the crew.  The elation that we should be feeling on going home is tempered by the fact of what we're going home *to*.  Earth is less crowded than it was a few hundred years ago, thanks to the people coming to their senses, and uniting in control of their progeny, and stopping the fighting.  That helped, but climate is still climate... and food is still food.  Or lack of it.  Energy we solved, and faster than light travels (a trick on the Universe, hooray for human cleverness) but the Earth was still damaged beyond what we could repair, quickly anyway.  

&gt;We'd have to terraform the Earth... and we have to live there at the same time?  Impossible.

&gt;Hence these... doomed, it seems... projects.  Hence these ships.  Not just to find life, but to find it where we can *move*, maybe.  Or at least, share any technology at all that might help our situation back home... should we find anyone (any being?) else...

Henderson's voice came over the paging system of the ship.  ***Captain.  Wherever you are, you need to come up here.***

Gresha moved to her terminal, punched the intercom button, and replied, ""On my way, XO.""  She returned to her journal to finish the entry.

&gt;Hm.  It seems there might be something afoot in this system.  I can't be excited though, it's not the first time I've been called up after orbit was achieved in a system.  End entry.

She turned back to her computer and as hurriedly as possible transcribed her log.  *There.  Wouldn't do to have it lost.* she thought as she finished.  The entry would be sent back via the Quantsponder to HQ for archive.

---

""Captain on deck!""

""As you were,"" said Captain Gresha automatically as she strode into the bridge.  She said with some annoyance to Henderson, ""You know I hate that.""

Henderson smiled.  ""Well, Captain, this is a somewhat different occasion, so I felt jaunty and naval.  Sue me.""

""I'll call my lawyer.  So, tell me... what do we have that's so important?"" she asked as she looked about the bridge.  ""Did we find life?""

""Aw, you guessed it in one, Betsy.""

She blinked, and looked at him askance.  ""You're pulling my leg, Jack.  Our last system before we head home and you're playing a joke on me, right?""

""See for yourself, Cap,"" Henderson said, grinning, as he gestured to the port side of the bridge.

Gresha moved to the science displays, and examined them intently.  ""Penny, is this for real?""

Life Sciences Officer Penny DuPre was hardly containing her excitement.  ""Captain, as real as it gets.  Second planet is teeming.  We don't know much, but we know it's there.""

Gresha blew out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding in.  She asked, ""Transmissions?""

""We don't see anything yet,"" replied Henderson, ""But we just got here.  Have to wait for the A-Drive to shut up before we can listen to anything, y'know.""

""Right,"" said the captain, ""damn thing is so 'noisy'.  So in three hours we can start listening, then we'll know more.  Still, let's report our initial finding to HQ.  Until then... well, we wait, I guess.  I'll be in my quarters.  Carry on.""

""Yes ma'am.""

*This should blow their minds.* thought Gresha as she floated to her quarters.  *Wonder what they'll do with this one?  It's kinda far, but it's the only one at the moment...*

---

What the *Clark* couldn't have known was that the Inhabitants of Vreshkar (the second planet of what the humans would call ""G7-4M1""... disgusting to be categorized in this way...) were well aware of the *Clark*'s presence.

And We are offended in the extreme.

Their obnoxious, fabric-of-the-universe twisting drive system for that hideous, inelegant thing they called a *ship* was an affront to the Aesthetics desired of the Prena.  But what was worse... 

What We see of *humans* is maddening.  They destroyed their planet, in effect.  They destroyed themselves, until most recently.  They multiply and take and do not care the consequences until it is much, much too late.

Savages.  The lot.

We Prena had learned to live *with* our world, our home.  To the extent that We moved and stayed underground, rather than have Our facilities, Our homes, maim the world's ecosystem by strip mining, land clearing...  

Which is why the *Clark*, nor any of those other *ships* never saw Us.  Never knew We were here.  

Never knew We are Everywhere.

Not in the obvious places, true.  But the humans weren't interested in just any rocks about the stars.  They wanted specific ones. Which is also why they never 'saw' the Prena.  They simply weren't looking very well.  We had become adept at inhabiting other worlds without disturbing their ecosystem, no matter their makeup or design.  This is, of course, Our very Way of Life.  Harmonious.

We move betwixt planets as easily as We move within the corridors of Our worlds, as if We were opening doors to another room of Our underground cities.

We watched as the *humans* explored the various places, in the various corners of the universe, with their multitude of *ships*.  Quietly observing, and growing more and more disgusted and offended that the Universe would not allow Us to be the Sole Occupants as we had Believed for so long.

But now they've found Our very Home.  Our Prime World.  And would take it for themselves.

This will not happen.  We are Prena.  We will end the virus called *human*.  

---

Back in orbit about the fourth planet, the gas giant, The *Clark* began to disperse.

*What's happening?!* thought Captain Gresha for the briefest of instances as she watched the bulkheads start to disincorporate, then her flesh... and ultimately, her mind.

The remaining cloud of material, the various molecules and atoms that made up the ship and crew of the *Arthur C. Clark*, lost their ability to stay in the gas giant's gravity well so very close, and spiraled in to the upper atmosphere.

The Prena would continue this march of what the Humans would call 'destruction', while the Prena saw it as 'cleansing'.  The Humans were powerless to stop this, so much more advanced was the technology, and so little time to study and understand, much less develop countermeasures, that it was the Humans' fate to come to an End.

For it was that the Prena were the superior beings in the Universe. Their desire to eradicate the Humans was insatiable until at last, verily, Humanity was no more.  The Prena were once again the Sole Occupants of the Universe as was their Right.

""Ah alas, the wings of an eagle are as light as those of a dragon."" The weirdo in the wig sounded like he was high out of his mind.

""That doesn't even make any sense."" The co-pilot had his head in his hands now.

""Uh, Jim...I don't think we should let this guy fly."" I whispered to the first officer in despair.

""Yeah, I don't think so either, but the captain said do what ever it takes to get to China by tonight. I think he's already in hot water for being late consistently. Either way, this isn't going to end well for him. Besides, if need be, we can declare emergency and I can turn the plane around and land.""

""I hope you're right."" I replied, but to my dismay...

""Ah, what is right? Everything is out of vain, or revenge, or to achieve a greater accomplishment or object. The only right thing to do, is live as a man.""

""Will you SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" Jim yelled this time.

A muffled, clearly annoyed voice echoed from inside the lavatory. 

""There's more shit spewing out of John Locke over there than my ass in here! Just fly the damn plane if you know how to fly.""

The impromptu pilot was now listening to classical music in cheap airline headphones and waving his hands around like a conductor, flipping switches by mistake and humming off key.

""Hey, watch it!"" Jim yelled once again.

""Ah, a watch. A miniature clock to carry time around with-""

""Be quiet!"" I chimed in this time.

""Silence, a mans best friend."" 

""For the love of God, quit!"" Jim, once again angry

""God, the only one who can judge me.""

""For fucks sake!"" Jim yelled.

Chaos was ensuing in the flight deck. The ass-blasted captain yelling from the toilet, Jim getting ready to burst, me trying to calm them down, Mr. 1600's giving crappy analogies for life, and even the ATC chimed in with, ""Are you all ok?"". Everyone was talking over each other trying to calm the situation. Jim eventually had had enough of the white wigged prick.

""That's it!"" He yelled as he hooked the temporary captain in the jaw, knocking him out cold. ""Just-Just squawk 7500, blame it on him.""

The captain had now exited the bathroom with his pants around his ankles while he was in between phases of liquid fire.

""Dammit, Jim. This is the third one this month. Can you get your license already so I can take a BREAK!?"" The captain yelled aggravated.

""I think I am a good pilot, therefore, I am."" Jim said before realizing his irony. ""Son of a bitch...""",BITCRUSHERRRR

[WP] Take a children's story/movie/book and give me the gritty reboot of it.,Yulgalminakf,"“A reporter, huh?”  He exhaled the blue-white smoke of a cigarette, the second in his current chain.  His voice was throaty and gruff, a gift given from a lifetime of smoking.  “And you want to hear *my* story?” He asked with indifference and hint of disbelief as he lit his next cigarette off the first.  Creaking, leathery hands snubbed the old butt out in the rapidly filling ashtray.  “Well in that case,” his eyes leveled with mine, “we’re going to need more cigarettes.”

“I can’t quite remember when it started,” He told me in that slow, gravelly, tone, “I just knew I was hungry.  What started at the most basic level of Maslow slowly grew into something else.  Something that terrified and consumed me.  Something some might call *insanity*.  After all, how do they define insanity – repeating the same thing over and over expecting a different outcome?  Well, maybe they’re right.  Do you have any idea what is like to slowly creep down that path?  To know that something is wrong, that there is an addiction, an overall consummation of character and will and *life*, and all the while be able to do nothing about it?  No, of course you don’t.  I can’t imagine many do save for myself.”  He paused in thought, “Myself and maybe that hunter a few states over.”  He drew in another breath of cigarette, a long slow drawl.
  
“There was never a conscious decision to go down this path, there never is with this sort of obsession.  Like I said I was hungry!  Hate to sound cliché but ‘back in my day,’” He made half-hearted air quotes with his fingers as he said this, some ash spilling on the table from the tip of his smoke. “Back in my day food, like a number of things, wasn’t as readily available as it is now.”  The words rolled from his mouth like cold molasses, I was going to be here a while.  He continued, “This modern age and the wonders of technology has ushered in a complacency among the youth.  Nobody has to *work* for anything anymore.  Though, I suppose that’s something all old timers say.  I digress.”
  
He pulled another cigarette from his pack and picked up his lighter.  “I never got to start a family.  Sad to say but I think I would have been a good father.”  He brought the cigarette to his lips and flicked the lighter.  A small flame appeared.  “I never got to do a lot of things.  I was never able to finish school.  Never able to travel the world.  All because of a hunger.  A hunger that ended up eating me alive.”   He lit his cigarette and closed the lighter, placing it next to the pack on the table.  I couldn’t help but notice they were the same brand.  Odd, I thought.  In large capital letters both read *ACME* across the front.
  
“Son-of-a-bitch.”  I heard him say.  I looked up from the strange branding to see narrowed eyes looking passed me.  I followed his gaze to a stranger at the door, dressed all in blue with yellow shoes.  It was plain to see that this was what the hunger sought, this was the life-taker.  The stranger in blue held an odd smile on his cocked head.  He winked at me before looking through the smoke to the man across the table.  “Meep Meep Mother-fucker.”  he said, and disappeared.  

I stared in disbelief at the space the blue stranger had occupied until a low, soft noise came from across the table.  I turned my head back to see tears lining the crevices of the face across from me, a broken sob escaping old lips.  “There’ll be no story tonight.” he says, and slowly lit another cigarette.

1.       And so man grew, and woman grew, and begat more of man and woman, and so the branch of man grew out, further from the branches it had once come from.  
2.       Of the branch that was man was born a man named Adam.  
3.       And in the way of man he learned, and learned of others.  
4.       But he did not do as the others, he did not find a woman meet for him.  
5.       And so his parents conceived again, and hence was Eve born.  
6.       And Eve was born of the same blood as he; and so bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh.  
7.       And they gave Eve to Adam, for him to tend to and guard.  
8.       And Adam cared for Eve, for he was by far the elder; and taught her, and led her; and she looked up to him, and did as he asked.  
9.       And Adam found that Eve was a woman meet for him, and knew his want for her.  
10.   And when Eve had yet to see ten summers, and not half his age, Adam took her aside and had her lay down for him, and she did as he asked.  
11.   And Adam went into her, as he had waited so long to do, and cared not for her thoughts.  
12.   And Eve knew not what to do, so terrific yet terrible was the consummation, and screamed in surprise.  
13.   And Adam hushed her, and told her not to worry, that all would be fine.  
14.   And Eve trusted him, and so lay there for him to finish.  
15.   Then when they returned the others asked, Where were thou?  
16.   And Eve told them of all that had happened.  
17.   And the others cared not, for they were disciples of Might, and they quoth, ‘thou shalt seek thy wants’, and said no more.  
 
Right  
1.       Now the world of the tree of life is dark as starless night, for it is the garden of Might, and world of ideals, and not the world of light and things that was, is, and will be.  
2.       And so man knew not of many things, he could only think on them, and wonder.  
3.       Then Thought lit up the garden of Might with light, that Adam and Eve may see of the tree.  
4.       Adam saw the tree of life, the tree of Might, so vibrant yet distinct against the bright sky.  
5.       And he saw the vines mating with themselves among all the branches of the tree of life.  
6.       And he said, Behold, all the vines of the tree of life do every day what I have waited to do this day, now I have finally given bud to the next generation of our branch.  
7.       Eve looked away from the light above, and saw that the light had lit up a reflection upon the waters that covered the ground, a reflection of the tree of life, that wavered upon the rippling waters.  
8.       For she saw the tree of knowledge of good and evil, a tree not of things that was, is, or will be, nor a tree of life; not the substance or strength of life, but the reflection of it.  
9.       And the tree of knowledge of good and evil bore its fruit not at the ends of the branches, but at the splits in the branches.  
10.   And Eve reached down to taste of the fruit of it that grew nearest her.  
11.   And her eyes were opened, and she knew of the good and evil of what Adam had done with her, and knew that Adam had done wrong.  
12.   For she had eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which was the body and domain of Right, and not of Might.  
13.   And she confronted Adam, and told him that he had done great wrong:  
14.   That he was wrong for taking advantage of her innocence.  
15.   That he was wrong for not asking for her approval.  
16.   That he was wrong for mating incestuously.  
17.   And Adam had not a clue what Eve meant with this talk of Right and wrong.  
 
Might  
1.       And Eve offered the fruit to Adam, and he tasted of it, and so also knew of his wrong.  
2.       But upon learning this he saw that this would stop him from doing as he pleased with her, and was contrary to all the mating he saw in the tree of life.  
3.       And so displeased, he spit out the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, even though he had already tasted of it.  
4.       And he commanded Eve, Thou shalt not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for it is not of Might, Might which made us who and what we are and Might which allows us to live.  
5.       It is the opposite of the tree of life, the opposite of the tree of Might.  
6.       It is the tree of weakness, for it limits what we can do.  
7.       It would have us not mate, yet if we did not mate, how would we have children, how will the branch of man extend, will not all man die?  
8.       And when Eve protested, Adam brought her before the others, and gave his reasons, and she gave hers.  
9.       But the others had not tasted of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, only tasted of the fruit of the tree of life, and saw not what Eve saw.  
10.   And when Eve said they had to first taste the fruit she tasted to understand, Adam warned them that on the day that man eatest of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that day the branch of man will surely die.  
11.   And so the others refused to taste of the fruit, for they feared for their kind.  
12.   And they expelled Adam and Eve from their band, lest they make them taste of the fruit too, as Eve did unto Adam.  
13.   As the two left, Adam said to Eve, Behold the weakness of your Right, that it can do you little good; even now it has delivered you into my keeping, that I and my Might may do to you as I wish, and you and your Right shall suffer.  
 
Misogyny  
1.       And so in their exile Adam and Eve left the land of their forefathers.  
2.       And as Eve was yet young and helpless, Adam cared for her, and taught her, and led her.  
3.       And as she had no choice, Eve did as she was told.  
4.       Many times Adam had her lay down for him, and she did so, for fear that Adam would abandon her to fend for her self.  
5.       And within her Right cried out against the injustice, but could do nothing, for Right was not of Might, and had no power.  
6.       And so she conceived, and bore the brothers Cain and Abel.  
7.       And Eve made sure to feed her children the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that they would not go on to abuse their women as had Adam to Eve.  
8.       When Adam saw this, he commanded Eve to never speak of this again, on pain of punishment, for he had the Might to punish her, and so she obeyed.  
9.       And Adam taught his children that women were innocent and childish, as Eve was, so that they would not take her at her word.  
10.   And Adam taught them also of the rule of Might, and commanded they disregard the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, lest they perish, so that they would fear it.  
11.   And Adam called Eve’s sharing of the fruit, Sin, and equated it with evil and death and wrong, so that they would not be interested in Eve’s teachings, and would do the opposite.  
12.   And Adam taught them that they could sell women to suitors, and do whatever they wanted with their women, so that they would never even consider that women could refuse them.  
13.   And Adam told them that they could punish their women for displeasing them, because they can, so that they would not ever see woman as the equal of man.  
14.   When Cain and Abel came of age, they went to the other tribes and found wives among them.  
15.   And as Adam had taught them, they subjugated their women, and proclaimed that Might was Right, and that those who claimed otherwise Sinned in the saying of it.  
16.   And when Eve saw what had come of Adam’s teachings, and how they abused their wives, she shared the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil with the women also, but their husbands had taught them that this was Sin, and thus was of evil and death and wrong, and so they spit out the fruit that Eve fed them, and heard not of Right, and submitted to their husbands and never questioned them.  
17.   And when Eve saw this and saw it as injustice, she cried and cried and cried, but she could do no other thing, for she still had no Might, and Adam made sure it was so, and the men of the line of Adam made sure it was so for their women also.  
18.   And so it was that man reigned over woman, husband over wife, and would do so for as long as man had Might and woman did not.  ",luminarium

""I *am* steady! This thing isn't exactly easy to control! You want a shot?""

I could tell by his voice that he was looking at me with a quirked brow and a look of dissatisfaction plastered over his face. ""I just fix what's broken. You're the one getting us home.""

""Our trajectory's a little off, but gravity's on our side. If everything goes smoothly, we'll land just off the shore of San Fran."" The radio crackle never bothered me, yet somehow the optimism of just gliding into the lap of luxury and beachfront property was grating. Did they think this was easy?

There, across a lifetime of darkness and uncertainty, an orb of blue and green beckoned for their approach. It looked no bigger than a marble; no more out of reach than a baseball on the shelf. Earth looked... like it had a sense of perspective. It felt unreal in the grandest sense- like everything was far too blown out of proportion to be considered feasible. 

""Goddammit, you hunk'a junk"" I heard him say.

""What the fuck was that?!"" came the radio crackling.

""Nothing if I don't fix it soon."" he shouted into the nearby intercom.

""Soon ain't soon enough! We need this--""

""I get it, I get it!""

I didn't look back, but I wish I did. Transfixed upon my baseball, mitt swallowing my hand, I was lined up for the catch. It grew larger; like a bowling ball, then a basketball, and larger still.

""Goddammit, we don't have time!""

""WELL, MAKE TIME!"" 

My trajectory was perfect, and the atmosphere greeted us with the ""warmest"" welcome anyone will ever get. I sat back in my chair as my engineer and comm operator screamed at one another, breathing heavy sighs of relief until I heard something. It crawled through my skull like a whisper; like some juicy piece of gossip being spread about my in some high school homeroom while classmates snickered and glanced over; ""Parachutes""

That was a problem. That was a big fucking problem. We were on a collision course with the ground an approximate speed of 227mph, aimed right at the water that we're gonna hit like a brick wall.

[WP] It's you versus the world... literally...,barelyonhere,"Falling. John Hallows was falling. His renewed consciousness registered this fact. He had been on a plane earlier, and then... he recalled a loud explosion. Before John could realized it, he had been sucked out of his private jet and was now free-falling to the ground below. He came to his senses, suddenly aware of the situation. Wind was rushing past his ears and the force of it tugged at his suit. *I'm falling*, John thought, feeling the terror of it jolt his mind awake. 

His body was spinning and it was making him nauseous. He flailed his arms and legs, desperately trying to steady himself. Finally able to do so, he whipped his head around, praying that he could find a parachute bag, or something like it. There was nothing of the sort. Such a thing only ever happened in movies. *Oh god... Am I going to die?* John already knew the answer to that question, but a part of him didn't want to accept it.  

*Shit... Shit. Shit! SHIT!*, John cursed inwardly. He saw the ground below him. He could literally see his death coming at him from a mile away. *NO! Please! I don't want to die!* His mind was racing now. If he could sprout wings, he would do just that. He couldn't, though, and so his descent continued.

His life flashed before his eyes. As a successful businessman, John had lead a simple, boring life. He did not mind. Boring was fine with him, and there were plenty of happy times in his life that he did not regret it. Those memories occupied his thoughts as he plunged further and further toward death. He did not want it to end. John remembered his family, and tears welled up in his eyes. He would no longer get to see them again. It was unfair. Even more so, since he would never know what exactly went wrong.

*This was a miserable way to die*, He thought. John had been falling for about 5 minutes, but it seemed more like half-an-hour to him. He grappled with the prospect of death with every second. Would it hurt? What happened afterword? Would they find his body? There was no definitive answer to any of these questions. 

The ground was accelerating faster toward him now. He could see more details of the earth below him the closer he got. He took in the individual outline of trees, the various roads cutting through farmland, and the individual buildings that dotted the landscape. *Not long now*. The world was racing to meet him. He continued to flail his arms, still hoping they would make him fly somehow. There was no point. In the end, it was John verses the cold, hard earth. Predictably, it was no contest.

Choice was something I was never taught as a child.  *True* choice, not the off brand varietal we're forced to use.  Where we are given the opportunity to ""choose"" between the right thing or the right thing.  Options that are created in order to save feelings, save face, save lives  or save relationships.  A compass is given to us as children, like Moses to his 10 commandments, we adhere to its will.

I am content, but I don't feel fulfilled.  Is there more to life than the right choices?

""I hate it."" He said, his face was contorted in a grimace we had become accustomed to.   My grandfather sat in his wheelchair, posture obliterated by years of hard labor, arms sag heavily across the sides of the chair, and hands the medical exemplar of advanced arthritis.  His brow was knitted in a permanent furrow so impressive, the two eyebrows seemed to touch.  So much so, our family had started call it Pap's unibrow.

My father, also advancing in age, sighed heavily and rubbed a worried had across his forehead.  He reached into his jacket pocket, that's where he always kept it, and pulled out the small circular object.  He held it before him, closed his eyes and began to think.

Before he could, Pap swatted the thing out of my father's hand. The compass fell to the ground.  It rattled and slid to the other side of the room. He was an old coot, but like an aging alley cat, his scorn made him quick.  ""Put that damn thing away!"" He yelled.  

""Listen, Dad."" My father said he walked towards where his moral compass lay.  ""I'm not telling you to use it to decide whether a Cheeseburger or Salad is more morally acceptable.""  He picked up the compass and polished its face.  ""Just take a look at it when you feel the need to say something to the orderlies, OK?""

""Ahhh, tits on a bull."" Pap said, moving his toothless, underbite jaw from side to side.  Had he been a woman, he would be the very image of a witch in a child's fairy tale.  ""Back in my day, we weren't attached at the hip.  We actually *interacted* with one another.""  

""We still interact, Dad.  I was--""

""Hogwash.""  Pap interrupted.  ""You can't go a day without consulting that stupid compass of yours.  When I was a kid--""

""When you were a kid, you never had a father.  Because he *died* fighting in the Amer-Ruso war.  Back when you were a kid, corporation bought elections, people went hungry and children died for nothing.  Parents avoided vaccinating their children and the police force was more of a brute force."" 

My father ran his hand through his hair and sighed heavily before continuing.  ""*I'm tired of having this discussion, Dad.*  The compass has made things safer, not even you can disagree with that.""

""Aye, safer.  Bah!"" he threw a dismissive hand our direction,  ""And more *boring.*""

""That's your opinion.""

""And what of you?""  Pap hardly addressed me during these visits, even when I grew older, I would find my place for dinner set at the kid's table.

""What of me?"" I said.

""Are you happy?""

""Yes,"" I said curtly.

""And how do you know?""

""I don't know.  I made head of international accounts this year.  I got a great deal on the interest of my house. The--""

""Save the resume for the job interviews, Kid.  How do you know *you're happy?*""

It was my father's turn to chime in ""This is ridic--""

""Shut it, Robert.  I'm speaking to your boy.""  He turned his crooked face towards me, skin sagging, lips thinning, hair missing, but his eyes were more alive than ever.  A fire resided behind them that I knew would stay burning long after the rest of his features failed.  He repeated himself, slowly,  ""How do you know you are happy?""

""I...""

""Are you here to see me because  I'm your grandfather?""  

I didn't answer.

""Or are you here because your *compass* told you to come.""

""That's unfair,"" My father said.  ""If you're going to be a fucking jackass, spit it at me, not your grandson.""

Pap laughed heavy and full.  A shrill thing made more odd by his missing teeth and poor posture.  He clutched at his stomach with his arthritic hands and threw his head back.  I had seldom seen him smile or laugh in my life, and here he was giddy as a school child.

He ran a crooked finger beneath his eye to wipe a tear and looked to his son.  ""Didn't consult the compass for that comment, did you, Robert?""  My father's face turned red, he turned towards the window and said nothing.

""Aww..."" Pap said, sighing contentedly and looked to me.  ""Here's the truth, kiddo.  You can have your compass, you can make all the *right* decisions but that doesn't mean fulfillment.  Life is about *choosing.*  Life is selfish.  Life is unfair.  Life hurts.  But removing those things from the equation makes life mean nothing.  Life isn't supposed to be about the 'right' decision.""

""Says the crazy old man, whose only companions are in this room."" I snapped.  Pap paused for a moment, giving me a calculating look.   

""Aye, I may be alone.  When your grandmother, God bless that wonderful woman, died so did my love for this world and its fascination with removing *choice.*  Did you know  Your Grandmother was married before she married me?""

I didn't, but I said nothing.

""She was married to a young lad, successful business owner--I can't remember what--for two years when she met me.  Long story short, she left that fella for this fella."" He placed a deformed finger on his chest.  ""And you all are products of that 'immoral decision.'  A decision I would make 100 more times and I know she would do the same.""

My father kept his gaze out beyond the window.

""So say what you want.  Take the moral high ground, but know you're not livin' your life to the fullest.  Know that you've taken the *easy* way out.  You're all moral robots.  You've lost beauty of life because and you don't even know it.  I tell you, your grandmother is rolling in her grave because you lot have decided not to live.  My father died for my choice to live, same as your grandmother's.  Aye, she'd be aghast by the lives you've chosen to give up, God bless her."" His voice cracked on the last sentence.

Neither me nor my father said anything.

""Now get out of here,"" Pap said suddenly, his unibrow back with all its curmudgeon glory.  ""I'm tired of talking philosophy with braindead idiots.""  He gripped the wheels of the chair and made his way towards the living quarter.

My father turned from the window and looked at me, exhausted.  He pulled out his compass, as if to consult it, then shoved it hard back into his jacket pocket.  On his way out of the room, he placed a hand on my shoulder.

I reached into my own pocket and regarded my compass.  I closed my eyes, thought for a moment and opened them.  The compass gave its verdict.  When I looked up, Pap was starting at me.  His toothless jaw worked at his gums, posture destroyed, arms resting lazily on the arms of the chair, and fingers hanging limply in a zigzaging pattern.  But his eyes, his eyes were blue and bright.  Eyes of a young man, a *fierce* man who wouldn't die without a fight, looked back at me.

Choice had never been an option for me.  *True choice.*  For the first time in my life, I chose the wrong option.  Ignoring the direction of my compass's needle, I dropped it in the trash next to me.  

""See you next week, Pap.""

He said nothing, but nodded back.  ",Kaycin

Today, though, you walk in the opposite direction of the compass' needle.",blakester731,"It was like the universe knew what would occur next. The needle nearly flew off and abandoned the compass it lived inside as I walked into class. 

""I'm George."" I said, hoping somebody would acknowledge my existence in a positive manner. But, I got much worse than a negative response. I recieved none. Only one kid made eye contact with me, and even that barely lived longer than my excitement of this new school. Although, in fairness their were only five students per class, thirty in the school overall.

The first few days were similar to any other school, excelt far more unpredictable. This may be due to the fact it was for the mentally ill. I had made no friends, until day six. James had attempted to release every particle of oxygen that had occupied his lungs with a fierce scream. I watched from the dinner hall through a large, but mucky, window. 

With blurred and partial vision, I saw James attempt to take his own life with a scapel from the art class' clay kit. I know what you're thinking, 

'God, why kill a random character off and expect us to care!' 

Well, the reason is this, he was just the first block to be plucked out of the tower of sanity until it inevitably collapsed. One by one, I witnessed more pain, death, and plain chaos. A moral compass would work strangely. If it turned right it meant I was morally right, simple to understand, but if it turned left it meant I was delving into the darker side of myself. Only a year later did I discover why it had swung to the left everytime I stepped into the school.

A horrific, dehumanising, psychologically destructive, year was spent making friends with people who had been hurt in ways no human could imagine. And, because I was their friend, I listened to their terriblu true stories. My shoulder was their to cry on. 

I had felt quite normal on the day I discovered what my compass was trying to tell me. Perhaps that was just the calm before the storm. James had returned, and he'd been there for three weeks already. He smiled, laughed, and cared how neat his blonde comb over was. 

While modelling a clay figure in art with a scapel, James pushed me. He called me names which I cannot recall because my mind had became a hurricane of violent possibilites. Without hesitation I sliced open his neck with the scapel. A few people screamed, but what did it matter. I had become nothing. Not a single expression of emotion was left in my body. Nothing more than a bag of chemicals, is what I had become. Live too long in wonderland and you begin to wander the crazy land yourself.

You see, as the handcuffs clipped round me, I began to think. From the moment of birth, life is like being stuck in a room with a bouncy ball that will never stop bouncing. At first we can't move and stop the ball from hitting us, but after a few years, and after the ball has multiplied into thousands, we can. Eventually, we are adults, and we delude ourselves into thinking we have a choice. When really, all we do is stand in the centre of the room of life, and move left or right by one step, whilst hoping we get hit by the best ball. The best possible outcome. We can only try our best, and if someone gets hurt along the way, we apologise. It's all we can do. 

I managed to break the moral compass before the police arrested me. The needle assisted me in slipping out of the handcuffs, and taking a random, deluded, left step into whatever outcome came next.",Spiderrman

Today, though, you walk in the opposite direction of the compass' needle.",blakester731,"Charlie is a good boy. That is what his parents used to say and as he lay sleeping gently in his bed, sunlight fluttering on his smooth dark skin, he certainly looked angelic. 

“C’mon Charlie, it’s time for work” a synthetic voice beeped.

“Ughhhh” Charlie groaned in response. “Not today compass, I’m too tired” he said as he rolled back into bed. Charlie had been up late last night with his coworker Laura finishing up designs for a new homeless shelter for the community.  

“Charlie,” The compass said sternly, “You haven’t missed a day of work in your life. And you know you can’t do any good laying in bed all day.”

“I worked late last night, so I should be able to sleep in this morning. That’s fair, right. That’s moral.”

“Sleep, is what the selfish do when everyone else is busy working to change the world.”


“Hmph, Work. I know I do good with my work, but how can work be good when it makes me feel so bad to do it everyday? Is working really what makes me a good person, Compass?”

“It is.”

Charlie simply accepted the machine’s reasoning. What is the point in arguing with his Compass? In all the years he had had his compass, it never once led him astray. Really, it was amazing that technology existed that allowed him to be a good person everyday, to never make a regretful decision. With his compass to guide him, there was never any question that he was on the right path. 

Charlie got dressed, brushed his teeth, and began his walk to work following the same routine as he had for his entire adult life. As he walked, he liked to daydream about the other pedestrians he noticed. What were they like, what did they do for a living? Were they following their compasses like he does? 

But today Charlie noticed something new down an alley just outside his office building. Two people up against a wall, doing something. Maybe kissing? Charlie moved closer to get a better look and noticed one of the people was Laura. What was she doing? Oh no. She was crying. She did not look okay. Charlie looked to his Compass.

“This is not right Charlie. You must stop this. Quickly.”

Charlie instinctively broke into a sprint toward the scene, anger driving him forward. How could somebody hurt Laura? Only somebody evil could do such a thing. Somebody like that would need to pay. 

As Charlie got close he started screaming for the man to stop. The man turned around and pointed a gun at Charlie which gave Laura the opportunity to punch the man in the gut and send him to the ground. 

Charlie ran over and picked up the weapon. 

“What were you doing to her!” Charlie demanded with a voice trembling with anger. 

The man was silent. Laura, however, responded “He is one of the homeless…” she said with a soft voice. 

“How could you be so cruel” Charlie asked the man. “Do you have any idea the work she does to help you? Where is your compass? No way it told you to do this!” 

“You don't understand"" the man said. ""Men like me can’t survive following a  stupid compass. I'd starve, I'd be weak, I'd die."" 

Charlie pointed the gun at the man and wanted with all his being to shoot. 

""Thats wrong. If you had followed your compass you wouldn't be dying right now!""

“Don’t do it Charlie” Compass said. “It is over.”

“I don’t care.” Charlie said

He pulled the trigger. 

“That was not right, Charlie.” Compass said.

[WP] There is no God. There is a sysadmin.,newbiedoodle,"On November 23, year 2105, most people in New York were going about their usual business, when suddenly the entire city ground to a grinding halt. An enormous face of some ponytailed guy appeared in the sky, and hung there in silence for a good fifteen seconds.

Cars crashed, people tripped, and women screamed as everybody was caught off-guard by this event. A priest tightly clutched his Bible, while another closed his eyes, fell to his knees, and started praying. The face in the sky seemed slightly embarrassed by what was happening, which only added to the confusion.

The apparition finally decided what it wanted to say, and cleared its throat. This caused yet further mayhem as the sound resonated through the entire city. After giving people a few moments to collect their bearings, it spoke:

""People of Earth!"". Then it turned away somewhere to the side and muttered ""Heh, never thought I'd say that"".

""I have an unfortunate announcement to make. You are in a simulation. This world started as an ambitious university project of mine, and I am very proud of it. Unfortunately it requires an enormous amount of hardware and power, which I can't afford any longer. I am very sad to say that I will have to shut it down by next year. I've decided to give you some time to wrap up your affairs before this world ends forever"".

""To prove that I am not lying, and to save some power, I've stopped the weather. You should be able to see how now snowflakes no longer fall, and just hang unmoving in the sky. I realize this might cause some people some difficulty, and I apologize for that.

Also, there is no god in your world. Unfortunately there is only me. To prove that, I will make every church in the world disintegrate into dust. Praying is useless, make the best use of your time you can. Sorry it had to come to this, and goodbye.""

People stared dumbfounded at the sky for a few moments, and then the panic began. They ran to their homes, and hugged their loved ones. TV indeed confirmed that world-wide the weather was frozen. Water seemed to no longer evaporate, clouds, rain and snow hung unmoving in the sky, churches world-wide had been disintegrated into dust.


John looked at his monitors and saw a society self-destructing. People ran around in panic, crime exploded, and wars between landlocked and coastal countries began. Soon, the world was burning.

He turned to Steve. ""Well, that was quite predictable. See, told you that it would take less than a couple weeks before the nukes start flying. You owe me 20 dollars"".

Steve sighed and got out his wallet. ""All right, all right, you made your point. I guess I was over-optimistic. Now it's my turn to play. First I'll rollback to the year 1 BC savepoint. Then I will let it run, periodically search for religious movements, rewind backwards until finding their origin, and eliminate it. I want to see if after 2000 years of no successful religion, one can arise in the 20th century""

John chuckled. ""Well, that's quite the elaborate idea you have there. You will need to work quite a lot for that experiment, but it sure sounds interesting. I bet you $20 that by 2050 there will be a religion again. Deal?""

""Deal.""

[WP] There is no God. There is a sysadmin.,newbiedoodle,"On August 21 of last year I was diagnosed.  

“Six months,” my doctor said, “With treatment maybe we can stretch it out one, maybe two more, but at this stage it’s a matter of when, not if.”

Isn’t it always?  We’re always counting down toward this inevitability.  It’s just that most of us can’t see our timers as they tick away.  

I didn’t take the treatments.  Instead I gave away most of my possessions, emptied my bank account, and set off into the wilderness in my Volvo station wagon with a tent, a camera and my hiking boots.  No point in lying in a bed under fluorescent lights and the watchful eyes of doctors.  Better to feel the sun on my face under the eye of God.  If there is a God, of course.  I’m by no means religious, but “six months” at least gets you thinking of the possibilities.

The first week was bad.  I was numb, looking at the world through a lens.  Everything seemed unreal.  Every time I stood near a cliff or saw a semi truck coming the other way on the road, I thought about just letting go.  But I couldn’t bring myself to do it.  So I gripped the wheel tighter and held on for dear life, what little I had left.

I finally came to terms with my newly recognised mortality in Joshua Tree campground.  I had picked up almost six grams of mushrooms from a friend ate them all with yogurt and honey right there in the middle of the desert.  If I was going to question the value of my life, I might as well get some chemical help.  

The trip was unlike any I’d had before.  Usually the drugs make me feel small and insignificant, like I’m just a tiny part of a big world, and I can see that time stretches out to infinity before my birth and will continue to go on forever after I was gone.  Perhaps that’s what I wanted, to reassure myself that my death didn’t matter, that everything in the universe would continue on the morning after.  What I got was the exact opposite.  Everyone seemed aware of my existence.  The tourists in their rental cars, the climbers braving the late summer heat on the rock formations, and my fellow psychedelic journeymen gathered around their bonfires.  They all saw me.  They all knew what was happening to me, and they all mourned for me.  My life suddenly felt not only significant, but absolutely essential to this universe.  I couldn’t waste it.  I had to live every moment I had left.  And so I did.

Over the next three months I cultivated a greater happiness than I had ever experienced before.  I felt free.  Free from worry about my future.  Free from anxiety about my job.  I felt like everything in this world was made for me, and I was going to enjoy all of it as I explored the country, drifting through the national parks, shooting photographs of sunsets in remote locations, and meeting friendly faces in small towns.  My perspective had shifted.  My priorities had changed.  Nothing was more important than enjoying this moment, every moment. 

But every now and then I would snap out of my newfound bliss, if only for a minute, and I’d wonder when the disease would set upon me.  When would this all come crashing down?  Then I’d fall back into my previous inner peace, reassuring myself I felt fine.  No weakness, no fatigue, nothing like what I was expecting.  

As winter descended did I start to notice changes, but they weren’t in me.  At first I chalked it up to the shorter days and bare trees that made the world around me seem dreary and less vibrant.  By December I was starting to realize that other things had changed too.  In the fall the national parks I traveled through were teeming with college students and young families.  Now they were filled with older people.  Everyone hobbled along with a limp and a cane.  They coughed and wheezed, short of breath.  Short of life.  The towns I drove through were becoming more and more desolate.  Windows were boarded up.  Tarnished signs with missing letters marked the place a restaurant or hotel now ceased to be.  Every day there were fewer cars driving around and several more were broken down and abandoned on the side of the highway.  I never saw animals anymore.  No dogs or cats or cows or horses, not even birds.  All the riverbeds I passed by were dried up.  The world was dying around me, but I lived on.  

On the first day of February I stocked up on dented cans of food from a supermarket with a “going out of business” sign hung up in a cracked window.  Cans and moldy bread was all that was on the shelves.  I hadn’t seen fresh produce or meat for weeks.  The clerk looked like he was about to keel over the second he finished ringing me up.  The credit card reader, like everything else, was out of order.  So I paid with a handful of faded and torn ones and fives, and hurried away before he could get the broken register open to give me my change.  I had to get out of there.  I couldn’t stand the sight of this crumbling civilization anymore.  I packed up my car and started driving.  I drove west through Austin, now a ghost town, and on past the burned out shell of Albuquerque.  Finally, I settled in the mountains just outside the ruins of Flagstaff as my rusted car sputtered to a stop.  

So here I am, six months to the day after my diagnosis.  The last of the pine trees turned brown and shriveled up last night.  The ground below my feet erodes into sand with each step I take, and the wind is getting so strong now that the dust is blocking out the morning sun.  The ground struggles to hold my weight.  I feel the tremors as the cracks and fissures close in on me.  I can’t feel the ground below my feet, the dust snuffs out the last rays of light, and I’m falling into the abyss where the world used to be.

Six months exactly, one way or another. 

“Dave.  Hey, Dave.”

My head whips around instinctively looking for the source of the voice.  It’s been weeks since I heard another person talk, months since I heard my name.

“Dave.  Hey, can you hear me?”  

The voice is all around me.  “What the hell is going on?”  My brain sticked on the word “hell” as it leaves my lips.  I should be more careful with what I say.  “Um… God?” Better, I suppose.

“What?  No.  It’s Roger, Dave.  Roger Park, the sysadmin.  Come on man, aren't you used to this by now?”  

“Sys… admin?”  I trail off, trying to grasp what is going on.  System… administrator… This is a system?  Someone is administrating the system?  This isn’t real?  This life is… system... something else… I’m almost there.  I’ve almost got it, but my thoughts keep swirling around me and I’m grasping at them a moment after they disappear.  

“Look, Dave, there was some kind of an error, but we’re on it.  OK?  I think we got some pretty good data on that last one though, before it went down.”  

The memories are starting to fall into place in my head.  The picture is clearing up again.  We’re in the latest round testing for the new reality simulator project.  A whole lifetime compressed down into an hour.  My third life of the day.

“Hey Roger, I only got about thirty years in that one.  The last two I lived into my eighties.”  I say in a much softer voice.  No need to yell, he can hear me no matter the volume.  Really, he could hear me even if I only think it.  It’s all just electrical impulses anyway.

“Yup, 31.3 to be more precise.  Like I said, we were able to get all the data off of that test, and the life expectancy randomizer seemed to work fine.  The issue was the cancer that was supposed to manifest in your avatar manifested in the world instead.  Thing got pretty weird there, but we got it figured out.  We’re going to reboot the system and put you back in if you think you’re up for another one today.”

"[WP] You're a barista at Starbucks. You can tell a person's age just by reading his name on the cup/slip. Incidentally, a green tea is ordered by a 350 year-old Mr ""Charles""...",yazid_ghanem,"For a while I thought people were hitting on me, in a weird way. Like it was suddenly trendy to tell people your age and let them decide if they wanted to make a move. I was enjoying my newfound attention and popularity. Seriously, it seemed like everyone who walked in was into me! Maybe dating minimum wage baristas was hot right now. That is, until the ancient married couples starting writing their ages on the cups. And the local pastor. Then I knew something was funny. I mean, I'm pretty sure the pastor was married and straight, and even if he wasn't I was way too old for him. Eventually, after asking several thoroughly weirded out customers and one restraining order later, I came to a conclusion. 

I had the lamest superpower ever. 

For some reason, whenever I write someone's name on a cup, I saw their age too. I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary, and I couldn't stop it either. In my handwriting the age of the customer popped up under the name. 

At first I was kinda freaked out, but eventually I got used to it. All that's really changed is that I learned this place has some *talented* plastic surgeons. And that was the end of that. 

Until this one customer came in. 

It was an old, shriveled looking guy. Like a dried prune given life in some bizarre accident. His wispy beard seemed like it was prone to fall off as he wheeled towards the counter. ""Tea. Green. For Charles.""

*Rude* I thought. Nevertheless, I got to work making his tea. I wrote *Charles* on the cup. And then I dropped it. 

My coworkers rushed towards me, asking if I was okay. Some of the tea had spilled and was soaking through my shirt and pants. But I was rooted in shock. 

*350*

It had to be a mistake or something. I snatched the cup off the ground. Nope. 350, clear as day. I did a double take and looked at Charles. He was staring at me intently. 

I walked over to him, ignoring the searing pain on my arms. ""How are you even alive?""

""I'm going to kick the bucket one of these days,"" Charles chuckled in response. 

""But- but - no one lives this long! You've been alive for *three centuries*!"" I was beginning to think I was going a little bit insane. Either I was seeing numbers that weren't there or I was standing in front of a man who had been alive to see the birth of the country. I wasn't sure which option freaked me out more. 

Charles nodded in response. ""I've been doing this a long time. And you will too. Come with me.""

""Come with you? What are you talking about? The only thing I know about you is you're super fucking old and your name is Charles.""

Charles shook his head. ""That's Mr. Xavier to you."" ",gazeintotheiris

“Tall caramel Frappucino for Laney!” 

*Age sixteen.*

“And a grande, nonfat latte for Harold”

*Age sixty-four. Obviously.*

“Aaaand I have an iced grande vanilla chai for Dan!”

*Age twenty-seven.* Amy looked up as he grabbed his drink. *And a very finely aged twenty-seven,* she thought. 

He smiled at her. 

She smiled at him.

*OK, Dan, here’s your window. Girl smiles back at you, you start talking to her. Okay, well, could have done without the elevator eyes, but glad you like what you see. Sooooooo…talk, while I put up this next drink…*

“Venti chocolate chip brownie Frappucino for Dolores!”

*Age nine. What? Who the fuck was naming their kids Dolores in 2007? I guess the same parents who bought their child that tub of diabetes I just made. And fucking seriously, Dan, talk to me or go home.*

A little girl scampered up and, standing on her tiptoes, grabbed the enormous dessert disguised as a drink. Dan smiled at Amy again, saying nothing, as he turned and walked out of the store. She saw him look at her again as he opened the door to leave. 

*Ah, okay. Gonna be one of those, are you? Amy turned back to the bar and shook her head. Swing and a miss, Dan. At twenty-seven, I’d hope you’d have a little more courage…*

“A funny thing, isn’t it? What you can know about a person, just from the first thing they tell you.”

These were the conversations she loved to eavesdrop on. Nobody seems to realize the barista can hear you. She glanced up to find the source of the conversation, and found herself looking into a pair of piercing blue eyes. The face around them was middle aged, with light brown skin and a bristly white beard. But his eyes…there was something clear, wise, and sad about them. They seemed…older than the rest of his face.

“I mean, people will tell you real quick who they are, right? You just gotta listen for it.” 

She looked around. *Is he just philosophizing at a Starbucks barista?*

“I mean, that Dan fellow who was just in here?” he clicked his tongue and shook his head. “No good for the likes of you, my dear. Like a painting, that one. Pretty, but not very deep. He told you that right away now, didn’t he?”

She smiled at him as she put the next drink up. “You know, you might be right. Tall latte for Ravinder!”

*Age forty-three.*

“Now this man…” she looked up to see him pointing to a picture of a handsome man on the front page of the New York Times. The headline above it read

    PHILANTHROPIST GORDON DURANT KILLED BY DRUNK DRIVER

“This man, you know, he told you in seconds that he was a good man. Shame…” he shook his head.

“Was he a friend of yours?”

“No, no. But I talked to him once. Very good man. He was a lot like you. Special, but he didn’t know it. You’ve got a lot of years left, though. You’ll learn it.” 

She smiled at him as she put the next drink up. “How do you know I’m so special? I have a grande green tea for Charles— “

*Age three hundred fifty. That can’t be right…* She felt light headed, and steadied herself on the counter. She read the cup again. Charles, *age three hundred fifty.* 

“Thank you, Amy,” the blue-eyed man said. “It was real nice meeting you.”

“Wait, that can’t be right… You’re not…”

“Oh, not for a long time, child. But if it makes you feel any better, it wasn’t my real name, either.” He dropped a dollar bill into the tip jar. A 50. “You be good, miss Amy. Big things are coming your way. Big things.” 

She felt her phone buzz once in her pocket.

“There’s one now. You might wanna take it.” He smiled, and walked out of the store.

She hurried into the back room and pulled out her phone.  One new email.

"[WP] You're a barista at Starbucks. You can tell a person's age just by reading his name on the cup/slip. Incidentally, a green tea is ordered by a 350 year-old Mr ""Charles""...",yazid_ghanem,"I hadn't first noticed my ability until I was seven. At the time, I thought nothing of it. 

My mother threw a birthday party for me. Childhood friends were gathered around the bleach white picnic table in our back yard. Mother was pulling styrofoam cups off a tall stack. She jotted everyone's name on them with a red permanent marker and carefully placed the cups on the table. She unscrewed the four liter soda bottles and started taking request from the children. Tipping the bottles, fizzing soda filled each white soft cups. I reached for mine and laughed. 

""James and '7'."" I giggled. ""I'm seven!""

Mother looked oddly at me. Most likely chalked it up to child muttering nonsense. But when I started pointing to the other children's cups and proclaiming their numbers. She brought me inside, out of the sun and handed me a glass of water. I watched my guests play tag through the glass sliding door for fifteen minutes.

I'm no longer seven, but nineteen years old. I will be returning to college for my second year in the coming months, but for now, I work in a coffee shop. Unloading crates full of milk, reheating once frozen pastries, brewing blends of overpriced beans and jotting names onto cups. I wonder if this ability is tethered to something grander, something cosmic. Researching this ability, I found stories about men who could write names on parchment to detect evil or monsters in their midst. Yet, all I can do is find the true age of a ""Cougar"" by scribbling her name on the side of the ""Double Shot No Foam White Chocolate Café Latté"" she ordered. ""Heather, '48'""

Grande Dark Roast for Brad, '25'. Grande Chai Tea Latte for Katrina, '23'. Venti Roast for Aron, '37'. Tall Hot Chocolate for Shay, '12'.

The irony of my ability never loses its absurdity. One day, however, the absurdity turned to horror.

""Tall Green Tea for Charles, '350'.""

I had never seen a number grace seventy. My first thought was I was wrong. My ability was wrong. The doubt turned to comfort but gave way to a darker fear. I was never wrong.

The birthday party. All my friends were seven or eight years old. I see regulars who pay with their card, their drivers license pokes out. I've verified my ability over and over again to assure myself I wasn't delusional or suffering from an illness.

""350"" that number rings like a broken bell clanging and smashing my every thought. Rattling my core to pieces. The worst part was this, Mr. ""Charles"" looked no older than thirty-five.

The cup was still clutched in my shaking hands. I was frozen. I looked up at him. Dark swept back hair, pale complexion, rugged handsome qualities. His accent even sounded otherworldly. I quickly poured the boiling water into the cup, dropping the tea bag in and handing it to him. 

""Thanks."" He said.

He walked out the door. He was leaving. Gone into the world. I would never see him again. Never answer this self-inflicted mystery. My coworker jostled my arm. Impatient customers lined up at the register. Overcome with a million shocks, pumping blood faster through my body then ever before. I leaped over the counter in pursuit of Mr. Charles.

Crashing through the doors of the shop, the sun glazed my eyes. People moved along the sidewalks, shimmering metal cars lined the streets. I'd never forget his face. I ran in one direction and turned a corner. A few people, none were him. I went back, running in the other direction. Then I spotted his slick combed back hair across the street. The once red light was changing to green. The intersection had flared up. I sprinted off the curb. Honking and shouting pierced my ears. I felt a drive like I had never felt before. Answers were silently moving away from me in the shadows cast by the buildings overhead. I felt strength coursing through me, the very essence of life fueling me. Then I felt nothing.

I lie in the street. The sound of tires screeching, replaying in my mind. The hot pavement underneath my cold skin. My hand was reaching out. Strangers stood around me, one was Mr. Charles. He and a few others gathered to my aid. Sirens rang in the distant. A man was apologizing and weeping not two feet away. Mr. Charles stared at me intently, recognizing me. I tried to speak but my throat wouldn't serve me. I coughed. Sharp pains like knives entered my chest. Mr. Charles kneeled down by my side. 

""There, there. Don't speak."" Mr. Charles's voice washed over me. ""You've still got some life left in you.""

Mr. Charles's face cracked a most sinister grin. His eyes glowed a blood red. Fangs hung like stalactites in his mouth. He leaned in closer to my ear.

""I wouldn't want it to go to waste.""

 I set the smoothie on the granite counter. The smoothie for Kevin, age 43 years, 4 months and 6 days. Kevin who's been divorced for the last 7 years, owns three N64s and lost his entire retirement fund back in 2008.

 I don't bother to wait for Kevin to come up to the counter before I turn my back and start making the next drink. God knows I know enough about him without having to look him in the face, or even worse, talk to him. 

 How do I know all these things about Kevin? It's because I'm special. I have powers. Unfortunately, these aren't kind of powers that get you a couple movies and maybe even a shitty reboot. No, my powers are pretty useless, in the grand scheme of things. In a nutshell, I can tell exactly how old someone is, down to the day. Sometimes, like with Kevin, I get a bit more, a burst of information like an unwelcome phone number from a drunk guy on a night out with the girls. 
 
To make things even better, I didn't get my powers in some laboratory accident. As far as I know, my parents aren't aliens. My powers are only activated when the person's name is written on a Starbucks cup. My shitty, minimum wage job gave me the stupidest, most distracting superpower ever (There was a brief, blissful period during the holidays when my powers stopped working...I think for some reason those red Holiday cups blocked my power. But that was short lived).

I top off the vanilla frappe I'm making with whip cream, and glance at the name. 

Charles.

Suddenly my nose is filled with the smell of horses...I hear someone screaming in French off in the distance...I see a guillotine and hear the roar of an ecstatic crowd...

One of my coworkers bumps past me, and I come to myself. This is new. This is very new.

This guy is 350 years old.

I walk to the counter.

""Ch-Charles!""

A short, slender guy who doesn't look a day over 23 walks up and takes his drink off the counter. Charles looked me right in the face. His curly brown hair and smiling, unwrinkled face look young, but those eyes. Grey. Panicked. Tired. Alert. I have no idea how to describe it.

Charles leans over the counter, closer to my face. We are almost kissing, oblivious to the busy coffee shop around us. 

With just the faintest trace of a French accent, Charles whispers:

""For every year you see...another is added to your span.""

He winks with those tired, alert eyes and turns toward the door.

At the door he stops, turns back to me. I'm shaking.

""Good luck!"" He calls. ""And get a better job! Life is too short!""

I squinted at the ethereal number hovering above his name. Perhaps a trick of the light was adding a '0' after 35? But this man, Charles, he can't be thirty five. He's too wrinkled, his eyes too tired under his sunglasses, and his dry coughing permeated his weak voice as he ordered. Thirty five is impossible. Or maybe...? Maybe he's on meth? Not even once.

I put the cup aside to avoid arousing suspicion and complaints of holding up the line. ""That'll be out shortly, Mr. Charles,"" I said with the same practiced, hackneyed smile I was told to give to every customer. But then I added, ""Just take a seat and we'll bring it out to you."" He tipped his hat (one of those old bowlers that I don't think they make anymore) and started hobbling on his cane to the nearest chair open, which unfortunately appeared to be at the other side of the shop.

""Jim, take the line for a bit. I gotta make a call,"" I lied. He manned the cash register. Walking through the shop to the back entrance, I surreptitiously brought the cup with me outside into the cold winter air.

*350.* 

My intuition hasn't led me astray before. When I was a bartender at Joe's, I've made plenty of money betting on being able to pick out people's ages before they got in. People were amazed. The college students loved me, because I never carded. I never needed to, anyway, and if they ordered beer I'd just replace it with the non-alcoholic stuff. Great cash for the bar, and tips for me. I mean no harm, right? All they wanted to do was make asses of themselves so it's not like they could tell, they just acted drunk. Boss found out what I was doing and he fired me. Blacklisted from the rest of the campus watering holes, too, so I guess this job's fine for now. It's not like I needed a reference. I'm a twenty year old communications major who needs a part time job, who are they to say no?

And yet... 350. This is the mark of a man who has seen his friends and family all die one after another. He must be heartbroken. I leaned against the red brick of the building, lost in thought. Until a bony finger poked me in the shoulder.

""Huh? Oh, sorry sir, we'll get your tea soon, just go inside. It's cold,"" I mumbled.

""Don't mind the tea, son,"" he said, the dry air making his voice even more raspy. I noticed a glow in his eyes that I hadn't noticed before under his glasses, a glint that reminded me of the numbers. ""We share the same gift,"" he muttered.

""I dunno what you're talking about,"" I said dismissively. ""I'm on break.""

""I can see the glow. I've been looking for another person like you,"" he replied with a smile.

I sighed and turned over to look at him. ""Alright, alright. What do you want?"" I asked, arms crossed.

""I have been alive for many years. You must have seen it when you wrote my name,"" he said.

""Yeah. I don't know how you did it, but congrats,"" I muttered, feigning disinterest.

""I know how people are,"" he continued. ""They go through their day, looking out only for themselves. They work and they scheme to get ahead. They lie and they cheat to keep up the masquerade of their lives. For money. For power. For prestige. But they don't realize how fragile it all is. How it could easily crash down at any moment. Those people...who care only about themselves. They don't understand what life really is. They don't deserve it,"" he muttered. I backed away from him, but I figured, what could a three hundred fifty year old man do to me?

""So I spent my three hundred fifty judging people. Day in, day out. People who were evil, people who were cold-hearted, I crossed them out of my life. And for a time, I was happy. I had everything I wanted. But I didn't realize that doing that, I was becoming what I hated. I didn't realize how I was weighing myself down. It has made me tired and weak, this dark side of the glow.""

I said nothing.

""You, there's still a chance in you. You may have your flaws, but I know you can change. I can give back, give you the chance that I no longer have. You can live a life that's full enough for us both, unburdened by sin.""

""Look, man. I know three hundred fifty years, you probably don't think straight. I just met you. I don't know you. I don't want to live a life for you, you've had plenty of time to do that yourself. Just go back in the building and wait for your tea. I'll be in there in a minute,"" I said.

""Alright,"" he said, a melancholy look on his face. ""But before I do, do you mind if I have my cup back for a moment?""

He took out a marker from his coat pocket and weakly took the cup from me. He traced his own name softly, and then wrote something underneath. Then, he harshly drew the black tip across his name, crossing it out twice. He looked up, smiled, and the glow faded from his eyes as he fell over on the ground, dead.

Stunned, I picked up the cup and aimlessly turned it over in my hands. Then as the shock wore off and the commotion started picking up, I did the only thing I thought I could do. I walked away, and kept walking. And I never went back. It was only until I reached the edge of town that I looked at what he had written.

*I don't know your name, but thank you for letting me rest.*

Crazy bastard... Just the rantings of an old, old man. But he's right, I guess I never told him my name. I sighed and picked up my pen, and wrote it on the cup, like it would reach him somehow. 

As that familiar glow rose from the cup, it all clicked.

It was here that humanity died.

The man peered at the structure with a sense of mute reverence, his horse shivering beneath him in the midnight air. The shuttle stood alone among the debris of a time long forgotten, victim to a loneliness only borne by the things that last. Everything that mankind stood for lay before the man, the history of humanity preserved within the metal carcass of a dying dream. Strength, valor, courage. Love, hope, life. The future, rooted to the dying Earth, slowly drowning in the dust. It was like standing in the presence of a God. 

The years were weighing down on the machine like time itself. An hourglass of metal slowly filling up at the bottom, preserved behind the careful eye of history. 

The man often wondered why it still stood while the rest had fallen. A sick reminder of what was, of what could have been, he imagined.

A dying dream on a dying planet.

The man turned his horse and strode away.",Danc777

[IP] On the shoulders of the Fallen.,APPLE_NUGGETS,"The Nomad looked up at the bloated, rotting carcass of the Past’s failings. Damp and creaking, the darkness of what was left of the interior structure burst outwards past the girders and rusted steel plating. It was the kind of place where monsters and ghosts and all manner of ills await their victims.	

It was perfect.

The Nomad was nameless. You see, names exist for the sole purpose of giving others something to call you by. There were no others. None who would call him anything other than ‘Stranger’ or ‘Thief’ or ‘Murderer’, often in that order. It was always of interest to him that this would always happen, even if he hadn’t done anything.

The horse did in fact have a name. The Nomad called him Itch, because he did.

The Nomad dismounted Itch and began to look at the resources at hand. Metal, mostly. Metal half-imbedded in the dirt and the hills and the mountains. He had been told stories of the cataclysm, but he knew little of the facts. All that he was sure of was what was obvious; the worlds of Man and Nature had, at some point in the past, been separate and distinct entities. Then they were not.

Itch scratched against a rock. The Nomad stared at the monstrosity; a ship, so he had been told, and the building it had been standing upon. All had been merged into a small island, held in place and half-encased by rock. That was why it had not yet fallen prey to gravity. It was possible that the structure would never truly collapse.

It was perfect.

Surrounded by water and perilously angled rocks, it was possibly the most defensible location within a hundred miles. Itch clanged against a large square of metal – there was enough material in the lands surrounding the island to build a small city, provided you were prepared to have corrugated iron walls. The Nomad was.

There was time, still, so he sat down. Unpacking a bundle, he ate a surprisingly lavish lunch of bread and what was arguably cheese. He gave Itch some, so as to remain on good terms.

People were coming to kill him. He rather hoped he would be able to kill them first. He had one advantage from the start; his pursuers did not know the lands they travelled. They would track him down, yes, but for a while they would not know where he had gone. He was going to take this opportunity with gusto.

Firstly, how to get to the island? There were the remnants of an ancient path on the right side, but the journey was perilous from all but a few angles. He would have to construct a boat, as he knew not how to swim. If that was the only place to safely dock, he would need only defend that one stretch from his attackers. There was, of course, the entrance to the metal structure which extended out in steps to the water – but he had a plan for that place.

But what after? He had, at most, three months before the enemy arrived. He would need food and water, of which he had enough for a week’s stay. There were… others in the area, with whom he was on friendlier terms. They may prove yet to be cooperative. He had vague recollections of performing some kind of service for them – if it had been remembered, he may even have allies with which to help defend. The Nomad smiled at the novelty of the thought.

But first, a boat. He knew how to build, a small mercy. A small raft is not the most difficult thing to build, especially since he had the rope to do it. The real difficulty would be getting the horse on there.

Later that night, after much gentle persuasion, Itch and the Nomad made their way to the island. The sun set, and the world turned. From the failings of the Past grew some small hope for the Future, or at least the Future of a man and his horse.",Wickory

[IP] On the shoulders of the Fallen.,APPLE_NUGGETS,"We thought we were hurting the earth. We thought all the pollution and deforestation was destroying it. The constant destruction of our natural landscape was only briefly slowed when we found out the earth was actually a living thing. 

A mining operation trying to drain the last remaining oil out of the planet hit a hollow chamber. It was about the size of a house, and had a lot of different cave entrances, leading into a large complex network. What was surprising is what happened the miners and explorers who stayed there. They could sense something... As if it were empathy, a strange sense of dread and fear.

Obviously, the more cynical people blamed it on gasses or something, but those that were there knew almost intrinsically that it was the earth's feelings. With all the tourists visiting the caves, it was soon common knowledge.

Fast forward a few years. After depleting the last of the resources on the planet, we decided to leave. The farms on Mars were progressing quite well. Anyway, even if we wanted to stay on earth, the earth's feelings had gotten so strong that those living on the surface could feel it very strongly. Most had left due to guilt, not due to wanting a happier life.

As more humans left and left, the feelings grew stronger and stronger. Until finally, there were huge earthquakes across the globe. And a huge burst of anger in our minds. Huge piles of rock burst out of the ground, destroying buildings, roads. Interestingly, a lot of attention was devoted to the various space ports around the world, covering them in hills.

After the tantrum, there was a strange contentedness. People finally understood what the earth wanted. It enjoyed humanity. It had given them gifts in order to see what they could do with them. How they could take what she produced with little effort into huge buildings and complicated architecture. Just... Try not to be as rough in future, okay.

As we slowly rebuild our planet, I look at one of the many spaceports. I don't know if we'll get to exactly the same stage of development as before. But with the earth producing a wider variety of things based on our feedback, it'll certainly be interesting.",SavageWolf

Sarah started to grin as she could feel the cold metal of the barrel pressed against the back of her head start to tremble. The crack had appeared.

""I swear if you don't do this, I WILL BLOW YOUR FUCKING BRAINS OUT!"".

She calmly turned, her head first to meet the reddening eyes of her attacker and took a step closer to him before placing both hands on the barrel of the gun. She pushed it towards her forehead where it was now pointing and payed close attention to the change of his expression. She spoke clearly and calmly.

""Some people can do this kind of work, if work is what you can call it...but I don't think you are one of those people. You see, in order to, you know, kill someone like me...you need to think like I do.""

His forced expression of evil evaporated before her eyes as disbelief took its place. 

""I knew from the moment you opened your mouth that you didn't have it in you and quite frankly i'm a little disappointed they let you even try. A challenge is what I wanted today, and you certainly didn't make the grade, but I would like to do something for you.""

She ripped the gun out of his now limp, sweating hand, grabbing his arm and slamming him to the ground in one swift motion. He watched with his head now over the edge of the roof as the gun dropped into the darkness below landing with a quiet splash at the bottom. He started to sob and gasp for air as he pleaded with her to let him go.

""We haven't got time for this. Like i said, I would like to do something for you.""

Lucy's head swam as she looked down into the cavern below. She couldn't even remember how she'd gotten there. She knew that the demon egging her over the edge belonged solely to her, but she had no idea how she's acquired him, or how she'd arrived on this ledge.

""Who are you, anyway?"" she asked. ""And where are we?""

""Couldn't you tell?"" responded the demon. ""I'm your Fear. Well, all of your fears bundled together, so I give myself a capital F.""

""My dear girl, I'm always with you. Even when you think you're safe, I lurk at the back of your mind. Where the shadows seem just a bit too dark, and where the silence feels a bit too heavy.""

I sit down because I am a man, I am secure in my masculinity, I'm tired, and fuck you I piss how I please in my house.

I wash my hands, because I'm a responsible type, and head back to bed (cussing, of course).

"[WP] You wake up at night to go to the bathroom. You get back to your bed, only to find yourself asleep.",KulaanDoDinok,"“I can hold it.” I thought to myself.  It's the middle of the night and I just want to sleep. My bladder disagreed.   I swear I have the bladder of a three-year-old on 5 cups of grape juice.  I laid there willing my eyes shut.  I'm not getting up… I'm not getting up…  If I don't get up… I'm going to piss myself!  The now overwhelming urgency of the situation has all but taken over my brain. “Damn it!”  
I threw off my covers, I had hoped for the dramatic sounds of a cape fluttering in the wind but no such luck, just silence greeted me. It was dark, like “couldn't see the walls” dark.  I fumbled around for a light switch and turned up nothing.   “To hell with it!” I knew what direction to go. 5 or so steps to the tv stand 1 step to the left and door.  I counted our 4 and waited for my shin to contact the corner of the torture machine that I referred to as entertainment center.  This wooden box and taken 8 ounces of flesh and wanted to complete it’s biblical reference.  I closed my eyes and stepped. 
My foot landed and no pain. “Not today Beelzebub” a small victory but one I will savor. One step to the left.  I reached for the door and felt nothing. I opened my eyes and I was in the hall. Score one for the home team. Light streaked down the hall from the blue Canary night light in the outlet by the light switch. 
“You’re my bee” I said to the little glass faced bird as I entered lavatory. The pressure on my abdomen had reached its final stages. It was time. I took my manhood from its cotton lined den that is my sleep shorts and aimed it at the commode.  
The stream of golden liquid spewed forth from its engorged reservoir.  The relief I felt could only have been beaten by OJ’s back in ’95.  
The stream was magnificent, powerful, yet controllable. And as I waited for the glorious sounds of water on water contact I was instead delivered the matted sounds of urine hitting a large mound of toilet paper. I swear that hadn’t been there a moment ago.  But as fractured thoughts of supernatural toilet paper flicker threw my mind, the stream ran out. the flow subsided. Flick, flick and I was done.  
I holstered my weapon. Time to return to bed. I made my way down the hallway still illuminated by my little blue Guardian angel.  But as I arrived at my door I found it shut.  I swear I came from here earlier and I don't remember hearing it close., but whatever I'll figure it out in the morning. I reached out to grab the door handle, my hand passed right through it. I would’ve pissed myself right then and there had it not been for my previous mission’s successful completion. 
‘This isn’t right” my brain spit into my consciousness. “ This isn’t how this works”
I reached out for the door handle and for second time my hand past straight through the material. My brain search for sanity and could only come up with “where’s Patrick Swayze when you need him” 
I needed to get in the room and now there is only one way. I reached out my hand and plunged it into the door.  The surface offered no resistance.  My hand past straight in to the wood. My hand, my arm, my shoulder, my body, my head and I was through and stepping into the inky blackness. 
I reached out for something, anything.  I didn't expect to feel anything but it was worth a try. I shuffled the direction I knew my bed to be.  As I got closer I could hear breathing. Great raspy, rumbling breathing. All I could think was “what kind of idiot monster was lying in wait for me ahead.”  A calmer part of my brain was able to raise it’s voice above the cacophony of noise every other part was making to inform me that that was not a monster, but merely somebody snoring”. Snoring?… Snoring in my bed?  What the hell? Who was in my bed?! 
I began to panic, and that woke my sleeping cat. She jumped up on to the windowsill knocking open the room darkening shades that I had drawn. Moonlight cast down onto the bed and my eyes beheld the most horrible site I had ever seen. My own face staring back up at me. That was unnerving. But now had a better appreciation for why my friends called my ears presidential. 
I thought to myself “wha..but…I…it.. Ahh..wha????” 
And then it dawned on me with vivid clarity. 
I was never awake at all, I never had been.  I never left the bed!
With that my eyes popped open and the scene had changed.  The inky black had faded away leaving the room just dim. A dream. It was all a dream… No… Not all. I had woken up in a giant puddle of my own urine.

"[EU] On December 31st, 1995, Calvin and Hobbes went exploring. Where did they go? Where are they now?",MaineSoxGuy93,"Behind the dusty scarf covering his face, the lonely cyclist gritted his teeth and powered on up the slope.

*If this was one of those goddamn adventure films*, he thought, *they'd set up a fixed camera just below the pass and speed this whole thing up. Tiny dot in the distance, jump cut, big enough to make out the shape, jump cut, now he's only a few feet away, jump cut again, the victorious cyclist rides past the camera.  But because this is real, I've got to gain every foot myself, one crank at a time.*

And so, one crank at a time, he gained every foot himself. Head down, lungs screaming with the effort and the altitude, legs feeling like wet noodles, he ground out the hill until finally, miraculously, he was there.

The Khunjerab Pass! Only a hundred metres below the summit of Mont Blanc; the highest point on the Karakoram Highway and the highest paved border crossing in the world. The cyclist leaned back against his laden touring bike and took in the literally breathtaking view for a few minutes, then reached into his handlebar bag and took out the small can of tuna he'd been saving for this moment. Looking up from inside the bag was his companion of the last twenty years' adventures. They'd climbed mountains in the Yukon together, kayaked rivers in Patagonia, and been together for every single weary mile since he'd cycled away from his childhood home in the suburbs over a year ago.

He'd pared his kit down again and again, obsessively shaving every gram and throwing out everything that he could possibly do without, but the 207g of stuffed tiger was going nowhere. They'd been through far too much together. Finishing his tuna, he picked up his companion and showed him the view.

""Downhill all the way from here to Islamabad - well, most of the way. If we start now we can be in Sost by nightfall. I hear they have tigers in Pakistan, maybe we can find you a sexy tiger babe there.""

He loaded his old friend back into the bag, wheeled the bike back onto the road (left-hand lane now, because he was in a former British colony). Then he re-fastened his face scarf, mounted the bike, and prepared himself for the bone-jarring descent to the customs post at Sost.

"[WP] For every life you save, you are legally allowed to take another.",Oligatormusic,"When the movies show an unconscious person coming to, if it's shown from the person's perspective, they usually show them hearing uncoordinated noise followed by seeing light that gradually comes into focus, showing their surroundings. That's rarely how it works. Usually, the first thing that happens is you gain a vague sense of feeling. Something like *I'm cold, and a bit damp*. 

Then, everything comes back, almost all at once. Sure, things seem out of focus, because the brain has to compensate for suddenly needing to process so many stimuli. Or, none at all. Then, after a few moments, details start to come into focus. *My back is against something hard. Something is wrapped around my wrists. It's dark, and dank, and quiet.*

Spatial awareness is one of the last things to return. Not just where you are, but the position of your body and its parts. *My hands are behind my back. I'm sitting up.*

Now, regaining consciousness can be a bit jarring, especially when one finds oneself unexpectedly in an unfamiliar setting, especially against one's own will. Especially when you come to realize that you're not alone. Someone has seriously violated your personal space, and that person is quite possibly the person next to you. That person also has some rancid breath.

""Well, now. Seems we got ourselves a quandry here, don't it?"" The voice belonged to a Southerner for sure. Deep South, probably Alabama or Arkansas. The Southerner stood in front of me, his face uncomfortably close to mine. Jesus H. Christ, his breath stunk. Smelled like he'd been eating roadkill right off the bumper of his truck.

""See, now, it took me a while to find you."" Thankfully, he did the pacing monologue. At least I didn't have to smell his breath, just listen to that godawful accent. I struggled a bit. Didn't do any good. I don't know what I was bound with, but it was strong. I tried to speak, but something was in my mouth, and it was taped shut. I didn't know what it was. I just hoped it wasn't one of his socks or something.

""Matter of fact, before I found out it was you, I saved your life. Had to have at least one saved up, anyhow."" Saved my life, he said. Funny, I don't remember anyone ever saving my life. Hell, I'd have thanked him. Bought him a toothbrush, and a house to put it in. No, something wasn't right.

Then he pulled out a picture, stuck it in front of my face. And, damn it all, I could smell that funk from his mouth again. I wondered if this guy had ever seen a dentist. ""See this girl, here?"" I did. She was young, probably late teens. ""That's my baby girl. She'd have been 18, couple months ago."" I finally had some clue as to why I was here.

He walked away, although his absence didn't bring with it the same comfort it did before. I knew why he had me here, and it really didn't look like I was going to make it out of this. Worse, he seemed to think me responsible for something I didn't do.

""See, 'bout a year and a half ago, she's drivin' home from her friend's house. Just got her license."" He produced another picture, held it up. Recognition sank in, and I tried frantically to speak, but the shit in my mouth kept me from moving my tongue, and the tape held my lips shut. The picture showed me driving a car, a bottle of beer in my hand. There's just one problem: I hadn't touched a drop since my liver transplant three years ago. Couldn't. Too risky.

""She never made it home that night. Drunk driver, that'd be you, t-boned her doing 30 miles over the limit."" I shook my head, trying to speak, but he ignored me. He pulled a gun out of a bag and held it between his knees as he squatted to be at my level again.

""Now, I'm gonna kill ya, one way or the other. That just leaves one question, though. See, I saved you. But now, I'm gonna kill ya. Question then becomes, does that count as a save and a kill, or does killin' you mean I never saved you in the first place, just delayed your murder? Hell, it don't matter. I got a couple extra lives under my belt, just in case."" He stood, pointing the gun at my forehead. ""Now, it's tempting to ask if you got anything to say for yourself-"" Before he continued, I nodded, vigorously. Hell yes, I had something to say for myself. He narrowed his eyes in thought before reaching down and ripping off the tape.

As soon as my mouth was free, I spat out the offending material that had been trapped inside. It was a fucking sock after all. Before I could say anything about it, though, I heard a hammer cocking. ""You got two seconds to start talkin', boy.""

A piercing cry ran through our panic as a horrid smell came from the things bottom. ""Help! Zokwe!"" I shouted. He ran out and puked. I held the thing up, not knowing what to do. We had him in a thing for our own young, but apparently his feces disintegrated our metal. Finally, after hours of searching, I found another one. Zokwe was at home. I changed him and put him on the chair, hoping he would sleep. He didn't. I didn't know what to do and everything was so frustrating. I fell asleep after the long day. He woke me up by him crying in the middle of the night. Finally, I got so frustrated I just ended up crying on the bed with him. Then, the smell approached.",writing_trash
[WP] Make me feel uncomfortable.,SethrySethMcD,"Nikki let her legs hang over the edge of the rock, the tips of her sneakers dragging through the top of the water. The book she had for summer reading was dirt-smudged and ignored in the grass. 

In the water she could see the fish move. She liked the way their shadows flickered over the rocks. As one neared the surface she dropped a pebble and watched it dart away. 

Nick had promised that he would bring a net to help her catch one. They had planned to eat it over a fire like Indians but he didn't show up. The sun was hot though her shirt. She could feel the sting of a sunburn on the bottom of her neck. Mom would be angry but Nikki was too bored to care. They had been in Texas for weeks now. Dad's new job brought them here, was it lonely and sullen. Nikki knew no one liked her. They had moved a month before summer. Her class had thrown her a goodbye party. Hannah Witticker had promised to write her lots of letters. Maybe even call long distance. Hannah was the most popular girl in school, and because she promised everyone else did too. 

The only one who did call as Jason. Nikki didn't like Jason. She was ugly and unlikable (Nora kept telling her) but Jason was worse. He made snuffling noises. He talked like he always had food in his mouth and he didn't know anything about anything. 

Mom would always say, ""Nikki! Nikki, get the phone in the den. It's your boyfriend.""

""He's not my boyfriend."" 

Nora would cackle from the couch and turn the television down. 

He would always suck on his teeth and Nikki could hear it like he was inside her head. 

Nora would watch her on the phone. Her older sister had beady eyes and a fat mouth. She would always eat while laying on the couch. There was a permanent grove were her body rested. 

Mom would yell at her from the kitchen. ""Stop eating Nora Lee! You'll kill your appetite.""

Nora would sequel in amusement. ""Not as much as the people on this show!"" She loved *Mindhunters*, especially Agent Henry Hildenbrand. Nikki read in a tabloid that Frank Woods, the actor, was really gay. Nora had thrown a shoe at her when Nikki showed her the article. 

""It's not true."" She would gasp for breath as she yelled. Sometimes it even made her sweaty. Nora ate so much she smelled like food. If Frank Woods liked girls he wouldn't like one that looked like Nora. ""It's not true. You're ugly and mean, Nikki. You're... you're damn unlikeable and everybody knows it. That's why we had to move.""

Nikki pulled the last piece of bread from her pocket. She toasted it until it was brown and crumbly. She thought that ducks liked stale bread. They did appear last week, when she brought a heel of rye. Maybe they would come if she made toast. She had never seen any ducks on the lake. Noah still wasn't here. Nikki sighed. Behind the edge of the lake, at her back, was a corpse of trees. She threw a pebble into the woods. Nothing happened. When she got the school she would change her name. Everyone knew she was ""part of the 'N'-gang'"" in Vermont, but if she changed her name at the start of eighth grade then no one would know that her siblings were Noah and Nora. She would called herself Leah. Her sixth grade teacher's name was Leah Rae Harper and she had moved from Georgia. She talked like that people in *Gone With the Wind*. Nikki didn't like that movie, but she liked the way they talked. 

She threw another rock into the woods. The shadows looked long and cool. The top of her head hurt, and her scalp felt tight and hot. It would be nice to lie hidden from the sun. She got to her feet and walked into the cool shade. 

It was dim and her eyes no loner hurt. There was no path o follow so Nikki walked vaguely forward. A few bushes snagged at her skin. Bugs hummed through the quiet.

There was a low place just ahead. It looked like a giant had scooped out a handful of earth a million years ago. In the center was a series of low concrete walls. A chimney collapsed into the side of the dip. Nikki looked into it. It was dark. Despite seeing the end of the chimney only yards away Nikki had the feeling that if she threw a rock down there it would fall forever. As she walked past it, deep into the low place, the animals quieted. High above the wind stirred the trees but the sound did not reach her.


Nikki climbed over one of the low walls. It was only as high as her knee. She remembered that some of old buildings had numbers carved into a stone. She kicked at the leaf-litter, but couldn't find it. The dimness grew as she wandered around the foundation. There was a flicker of movement that made her freeze. She felt hot sweat coat her skin. The snake flickered in and out of sight as it moved. ",Pau_Zotoh_Zhaan

[WP] Describe the great hero of your story only through posthumous anecdotes of friends and family.,SpaghettiHell,"It was a sunny day. The air was cool and flowers bobbed their heads in the breeze, bees buzzing the dance of spring. The Hero's grave stood alone on the hill, white stone and freshly turned earth making a contrast against the natural scene.

There had been a public service thronged by thousands, but today we were only one hundred, from peasants to the king, those who had known her not just as the Hero but as a woman, a person, a friend. It had been agreed that each who wished to would say a few words, in reverse order of when they met her.

First, the King stood up. His hair had gone to gray in the past few weeks but his stride and bearing carried of power. The fresh lines on his face showed dignity and exhaustion in equal parts. He professed his gratitude to our Hero, spoke of her noble bearing and prowess in battle, lauded her as Dragonslayer, Foesmasher, the Shield of the Realm. He spoke of the honor in her sacrifice, how she destroyed the demon known only as the Enemy, even at the cost of her life.

Next came the General, whose army the Hero had saved from destruction by the Dark Night Embrach. He described her battle with the knight, how they fought unhorsed until he fell to her blade. He told of what he had seen, her slim figure swaying slightly as she stood over the corpse of the evil knight. How she had immediately begun to tend to the wounded, heedless of her own hurts.

Then came Sir Gawain, knight of the realm. He spoke of their quest to slay the great wyrm Grazh, terror of the east. How beautiful and deadly she was in that cavern bathed in fire, how her blade pierced its immaculately scaled hide. He spoke of camaraderie on the road, of her easy laugh and brilliant smile.

The sorceress Anima stood before us, and spoke of her battles against the Witch King of the North, how the Hero stood before his fell magic of rot and decay and was unharmed. How together, they turned away his armies and shielded the free folk of the realm from the frostmen. How the Hero had saved her life, and they forged an eternal bond of friendship. Anima shed bitter tears, that she had not been able to repay her.

An array of folk passed before the stone, dropping flowers and gifts. Folk small and large, peasants whose village had been saved from marauders, lords whose domains had been freed of banditry or protected from monsters.

Then came those who knew the Hero in her earlier days. The Blade Monk Daven, the wizard Edmon, the great healer Elena, all who had met the Hero in the early years of her journey and walked beside her for years, through adventures great and small. These could barely speak, weeping and clutching the gravestone, Daven swearing through gritted teeth that he would uphold her legacy, that he would protect the weak. Elena could only cry, clutching Edmon's robes as he gazed at the gravestone with hollow eyes.

And thus it went, as we came to the end. Finally, an old man trudged his way up to the gravestone, leaning heavily on a cane. Some gasps went up in the audience as he was recognized as Ormun Evilsbane, the great paladin of the Southern Wars fifty years prior. It was then that I finally began to weep, as old Ormun choked up, standing there, speaking of how she had come to him as an eager girl of thirteen years, determined to forge herself into a hero and adventurer. How she had trained night and day, pushed herself beyond human limits in a way he had never seen before or since. How she had carried the mantle of a Hero as he himself never could, how she gave an old man the chance to redeem himself, to believe that he had something left to give to the world. As the old man shuffled away, it was my turn.

Walking up to the gravestone, her gravestone, I felt my throat constrict, and my vision tunneled in. They tell me that I was weeping, tears spilling out of my eyes and onto the Earth, a keening whine coming from my throat. Then, I fell silent, to my knees, in the dirt.

""My hero, Alma,"" I said, my hand running over the letters in the white stone. ""I met her, what, fifteen years ago now. I was ten years old, ran away from an abusive home. I got lost in the woods, and ended up cornered by a hungry direwolf. I thought that was the end for me, you know. A quick, sad end to a quick, sad life. But then she appeared. Alma. She had a glow to her even then, even though she was a blond haired, blue eyed waif, more skin and bones than anything else. She had a knife, and she fought. It wasn't anything grand. No, it was brutal, hulking wolf against a small girl. She was a hellion, and her knife did its work. A few moments later, and the wolf lay dead, Alma's left arm mangled and broken from its teeth. I helped her bind it, and we travelled together from then on. Laughter, love, countless teenaged arguments. We've saved each other's lives so many times that we stopped keeping score. We met all of you, friends, family, fellow folk of the kingdom. And together, we accomplished her dream, to be strong, to be amazing, to have adventures beyond dream or belief, to help and protect people. I only---"" I drew a shuddering, choking breath. ""I only wish I had been able to save you one last time. That I had been able to trade my self for you."" And then I, Bran Blackblade, Left Arm of the Hero, strongest man in the Kingdom, rose to my feet. As I walked away, through the crowd, hearing from somewhere far away their condolences, I knew.

I knew that I would make her proud, that I would keep this place safe. Now and forever.

I love you, Alma.

"[WP] You haven't spoken a word since the accident, but now you can hear others' thoughts.",TallAmericano," Many years ago I was just like any other young adult who was raised in a suburban family. My parent's raised me right, fed me right and taught me right. My education was promising, I graduated high school with a 3.9 GPA and was on the dean's list for my freshman and sophomore years of college. That what I could get from what I read. My mind is foggy now, my childhood is just a fuzz in my brain. What I can remember however, was when I woke up in the hospital after waking up from a car wreck that killed the three people who I was with. Sean, Tallie, Mark... I remember the names, but not who they are. Apparently they were my friends.

   When I woke up that day, I could not speak, I could feel my mouth, but it was like it was stuck shut. I was instructed by the doctors and the nurse about the condition that I was in that the things they had to do to me to save my life after the accident. I was alarmed at what I could hear, I heard their voices, but I heard something more.. their thoughts. I could hear what they were thinking and saying. The nurse wanted to go home, as it was seven o'five and all she thought about was going home and watching the latest episode of her favorite sitcom. The doctor's thoughts was more grave. He had been through a situation where a patient was in cardiac arrest and he could not save him. His mind was suppressing the memory, but I can see it like it was written on a whiteboard.

  They told me that the accident had effected certain parts of my brain functions. My mouth was mostly affected. My arms and legs had fractures, but nothing too severe. But I was stuck there. Not able to speak, not able to voice out in pain. Not able to have silence. Nothing was worse than to live through a month's worth of sitting in one spot and hearing other patient's and staff's thoughts. Hearing families grieve that their loved ones are transitioning to hospice care is terrible to hear, but now I am forced to hear this on a almost daily basis. I remember how happy I was when I got out of the hospital, but that was short lived.

   When I stepped out of that hospital it was breath of fresh air, literally. But nothing was better than getting out of that doomy place. My family was very supportive me even after the accident and when they picked me up they were happy to see me. Their thoughts were not though. They may say it but, there were many things wrong with them. My parents were going through financial trouble due to my hospital stay. Their relationship was crumbling as they were thinking about the huge argument they had in the car prior to picking me up. They still smiled at me though and said that they were glad that I am alive and back.

  The next few months I met with the doctors and physical therapists to make sure everything was in proper order. They told me everything was fine, except your motor skills in your Jaw.  Luckily for me I can open and close my mouth, but I could not make a sound, l could move my lips and have a great smile. But no sound. Of course this led to me becoming great at typing and writing. I learned sign language as well and other things to help with my disability. I used a text to speech converter that was incredibly efficient at communicating. I kept my ability to hear thoughts a secret, never to be spoken or written.

  The following weeks and months after the accident was interesting. I learned about what I could do and what I could not do with my new found mind skill. I prepared myself to accept this new life, and well make most of new ability. I was originally going to be a chemical engineer when I graduated college, but now that has all changed. College post accident comprised of mostly online classes, and very few interactions with the teacher and classmates. School was agonizing due to the fact that I was sitting by thirty other people with their own issues in life. It drove me insane. But I persevered. The major I went with was Journalism, and since I could read minds, I thought I could be clever at my investigative skills.

  My post college life was full of exploits, I opened up my own website, where I started off rather slow with traffic, but when I managed to secure some high profile interviews and take some rather hidden secrets from them, I quickly made huge success in my website. A lot of Job offers and sponsors came to me, they wanted to know my secret. My mouth was shut tight. Like I could say a word.

  Eventually I gained enough infamy through my methods and some people tried to investigate my computer, even provoking lawyers and law officials to look at my computer. I was very transparent to them, and like I would say to them, they will find nothing. Due to my infamy and well, say success, I secured a nice interview with some celebrities. The things I learned, I knew I should have taken that job at TMZ. Alas, I did not, I had a high standard to my journalistic integrity.


  Twelve years has passed since the accident, and well I was in a all time high. I lived in a isolated house in Colorado surrounded by mountains and snow. I kept myself in as much isolation as possible due to my condition, and fame. I wanted quiet, and that's what I got. I received a call from my father saying that my mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, and the news of that broke me. The mental condition was affecting her rapidly as the months went by, it seemed like every time I listened in her mind, less and less was said. She was losing all cognitive function. The last few days of her life was empty, I could hear nothing. She did not recall anything. It was tragic.

  After the funeral, I allowed my father to move in with me. I felt like it was the right thing to do after my mother had passed. Life with my father was quiet, he did not think as much since she passed, and with my abilities I made sure he had the best life he could imagine. Realizing that I could use my abilities for good, I wanted to do something productive for others. I wanted to change lives for the better.

  And that day forward I tried my best to use my abilities to change the world, expose the corrupt people, government workers, politicians. I reformed my site to reflect that. After several years of exposing the country's corrupt secrets I was quickly hailed as hero to many, despite my inability to speak. The government hated me and accused me for various espionage crimes. I proved innocent in all cases. I needed leave the United States due to risks I was taking in involving myself with government secrets.

  When I arrived in Moscow, I was greeted by Vladimir Putin himself, who was waiting for me. He said he would personally ensure my safety for me and my father if we would ""Collaborate"". I knew what I was getting into, and the risks, but I knew what I was going to do to him once my work was done. He told me that I was a great person for exposing the president's plans on the middle east. I had other plans to expose him to the United Nations.

  The next few days I spent with the Russian government, I interviewed Putin himself with the help of a Russian interpreter. I knew everything about him. I was ready to upload the entire life's story of Putin without him telling me personally. Once I got a write up I made one last arrangement, my faked death. The world will never be the same after I leak this information out. I needed to disappear from society all together. My father knew what I was about to do and complied with me.

  I made Putin and the Russian government think that I was killed by a US spy, with the help of a hired hand, I made sure it was believable until they found out the truth, by then I was long gone. Looking at the headlines of that day still gives me chills. I really did changed the world, for better or worse.

  Me and my father assumed new names, new identities. We went into hiding and thanks to me, I was always a step ahead of anyone who was trying to get me. I finally got a chance to settle down, in the most isolated place in the world, Alaska. I convinced an elderly couple to let me and my father move in and help with them with their lives. They had no idea who we were and what the outside world was like. It was perfect.

That is where I spend my days, chopping wood, trapping, and sitting by the fire. This is where my story comes to an end, where I finally finish writing this sentence, and close this chapter in my life. Who knows what is going to happen next, if it involves people, I do.

Thanks for reading this, as this is my first writing prompt. I apologize for any grammatical mistakes and errors. Thanks for reading!

I know it sounds easy and cheap, but ever since I can remember, even as a small kid, I've wanted to be filthy rich.  
I've tried to avoid working as much as I could. It's not that I'm lazy or anything, I just felt sick to my stomach simply thinking about work. As a kid, I didn't want to play with blocks because I knew I had to put them back in the box after I finished playing with them. The fun of playing with blocks just didn't seem good enough compared to the dread of having to tidy up after.  
I went through life doing as little as I could.  
Dreaming of a future filled with money. The money would act as my safety net, guaranteeing I would never have to do anything ever again. No job, no cleaning the apartment, no washing the dishes, doing laundry, taking out the trash, nothing.  
You see, a lot of people are willing to work hard, and I mean *hard*, to get to such a point in life. But let's face it,  
most people will need their whole life to get close to having enough money, and many more will never even come close.  
Not wanting to stick out a finger at all will make becoming a millionaire pretty much impossible.  
Except if you win the lottery.  
I *won* the lottery.  
The winning ticket, which I bought, is right there in front of me. It's not in my hand. It's slowly twirling down, and I'm right behind it.

[WP] The Forgotten Soldier,cloud_tsukamo,Thanks. I don't write often so I was worried I didn't convey the story well.,Doom1473
[WP] The Forgotten Soldier,cloud_tsukamo,"  Since it's birth, humanity has been fascinated by two things, technology, and legends. These two things usually stay far apart from each other but sometimes rarely become one. Both have changed in appearance over time but have stayed the same at their core. The most recent time these two have become one was the battle of Shadow Hill, on the planet Durrian. 

  The first galactic war was fought between the Gomoran Empire and the Sol Confederacy.  Both sides had been searching for a way to wage war with minimal civilian casualties. It was in this search that the Confederacy discovered the shadow realm. A plane of existence just outside of our own. The Confederacy soon shared this discovery with the Empire, hoping that they would agree to have all warfare in this realm to save the majority of the populace form the horrors of war. After both sides agreed to these conditions, relays were being constructed on every planet to allow their forces to easily resupply when needed. 

  The Empire was quick to develop a new weapon for this frontier, weaponized nanites. Nanites had only been used for medical purposes due to their unstable nature when attempting to perform tasks more complex than repairing tissue, but with the shadow realm, they could be released without fear of the human race being decimated by a rogue swarm. The Empire developed advanced A.I.s to control these swarms. The first and only kind to be used in the shadow realm was designed to I've injected into soldiers allowing for orders to be uploaded directly to the brain. But these nanites also had a more sinister and in humane purpose. If a soldier of either side were to fall in battle they would be reanimated to fight for the Empire. 

  These weapons were deployed in battle throughout the shadow realm within days and decimated any opposition. As soon as reports of this weapon came to light to the public, the Empire received heavy criticism from its allies. To keep its political favor, the Empire soon shut down the project and ordered for the A.I.s to be shut down. But the Empire did not account for one thing, a rogue A.I.. This A.I. was being housed inside the shadow realm and soon took control of the other A.I.s' forces. The AI was corrupted by damage it took in a previous battle and was incapable of properly think anything through. It soon set its sights on the Durrian relay and attacked with the nearby forces, but not sending any of its other forces.

  If a relay was destroyed reality itself could collapse, so they could only be shut down with the use of a key unique to every relay. The key for the relay on Durrian was destroyed by the explosion of the ammo supply at the military base at Durrian. 

  As every other relay was turned of and disposed of to avoid the AI entering our plane of existence. Because of the current situation, an elite squad was sent in through the last relay to destroy the AI in hopes of halting the dead of this war in their attempts of converting all of humanity to a forgotten cause. 

  As soon as the squad entered the relay all but one soldier were killed by the undead surrounding the only exit. This last soldier destroyed every corpse within sight to give himself time to fortify area. Since there was no request for reinforcements or corpses came through the relay command believed that both forces were killed off in mutual destruction. To ensure that humanity would not face the same fate as those who died in the shadow realm, the relay was bombed from orbit in hopes of destroying it without the universe collapsing. 

  The relay was destroyed, or so they hoped. After over a hundred years the radiation had cleared out and Durrian was repopulated, a town built near where the relay used to stand. Little did they know that the relay was only damaged and was more than capable of having forces come through and attack them. 

  Stories of the battle near the relay persisted through the ages, the shadow realm an the AI being forgotten. On some nights one can see the soldier defending the hill still to this day, becoming a tale to tell around campfires. Soon the soldier was believed to be an angel in disguise, saving the worthy from their enemies. Many would make the pilgrimage to the hill to pray for the protection of the angel. Little did they know that the soldier was still alive, still fighting to protect a world that ha forgotten him. Very few now know of the shadow realm, and even dower know of his sacrifice. All we can do now is hope, hope that he makes one final charge and destroy our enemy once and for all.",Doom1473

*Knock.*

""Open up!"" I yell. ""It's me. Marv. Open up.""

No answer.

Of fucking course.

I stare at the door, focusing on a small dent near the upper left corner, from when I brought in a tree for Christmas. 

Things got worse from there.

I press the doorbell once more. The door creaks loudly. As it always did.

Vince is there to greet me. ""What the fuck are you doin' here?"" He's happy to see me. Trust me.

""I wanna talk to Simon. C'mon. Just five minutes with him. Where's is he? Simon? Buddy?"" I take one step forward, but Vince pushes me back. 

*Fucker.*

""Marvin, this is a weekday. You can't be here. If Carla finds out you came here without her knowing-""

I shove him against the wall. The mailbox rattles in response. ""I want to see my *son.* You're not stopping me.""

""Hey, hey, what the fuck do you think you're doing-""

I breeze past him, shouting for my son.

Vince is becoming noticeably more agitated. You can tell by the pulsing vein near his big-ass forehead. Fucker. ""Marv, I'm gonna call the cops if you don't leave right now.""

""Look, just give me a sec, okay-""

""Marv, I swear to god. Get out. Now.""

""You can't do this. The boy needs to see his own damn father...""

Vince pins me to the ground, attempting to subdue me. My face smacks into a recliner.

*Sniff.* 

Smells like Ikea.

...

""Jesus, you look like shit."" comments May, my partner. ""What happened?""

""Fell down some stairs."" I respond, placing an ice pack to my jaw. My arm screams at me as I close the passenger door.

""Did those stairs punch back?"" she asks.

""Let's drop it, all right?""

""Gee, not even a 'thank you' for bailing you out of the county jail. Here, I'll do it for you. *'Hey May, thank you so much for being a good friend and for calling in a few favors from the higher ups.'*""

""I do *not* sound like that."" I protest.

May rolls her eyes. ""Forget it. Just go ice your jaw.""

""Where are we headed?""

""Didn't you go to the briefing?""

""I-I did. I just...""

""...didn't pay attention? Right. We're going to Oregon. Whatever it is, we're redircting all of our resources toward it. Hope you've already taken a shit. It's going to be a long drive.""

""Fantastic.""

...

By the time we got there, the sun has already disappeared behind the horizon.

Recon teams counted 172,158 of them, which is roughly the population of this town. Preliminary scans confirmed that they were all deceased. Which would've been fine, except for the fact that every single corpse was suspended fifty four and a half feet in the air, exactly three feet apart.

In front of the yellow caution tape, a man clad in hardened black armor gestures for us to stop. Around us, several tents were being set up while different types of scanners and computers were being rolled out. Squads of highly trained marksmen jumped out of their transports, though I'm not even sure if this phenomena calls for such tactics. In past experience, bullets don't do shit against the paranormal, but its nice to have. Comforts your mind, I suppose.

""James. What's the situation?"" I ask.

""Good news? Or bad news?""

""Y'know me, always the good shit first.""

""Good news, since the whole town is fucked, we don't have to worry about any witnesses.""

""And...the bad news?""

""Everything else.""

""What?""

He shrugs. ""We don't know what this is. It's not demonic. Or extra-dimensional. We think it's another ritual, like the one in Madrid a couple years back. But on a much larger scale. No mimetic properties, either. Hazard suits are only a precaution if you want to enter the zone. We've blocked every major road leading into here. Containment is the only thing we can do right now. Donovan's setting up an FOB as we speak.""

""Maybe it's a reality warper?"" I suggest. ""Explains the formation of the bodies. Though he or she would have to be older. The young ones constantly change things.""

May scrawls a few scribbles in her notepad. ""Have we sent in the drones?""

""Anything electronic that gets within thirty feet of the corpses become disabled. Almost like an EMP, which is why I'm not ready to send my men into there. Radio's gonna have to be silent. They're gonna be fumbling in the dark. The Council is considering upgrading this to a Code Red.""

""What about Project Revenant? Is she clear for duty?"" I ask.

""Psionic testing is still inconclusive. She's not ready yet. She can operate a handgun, but other than that...it's too risky. Either way, she's still at HQ. It'll take at least two hours to fly here.""

""Well, all we have are some scanners and Hellfire grenades. You think that'll be enough in case it goes hostile?""

""No. No, I do not."" answers James.

*Well, at least he's honest.*

""All right. Suit us up. We're going in. Tell everyone else to stand by."" replies May.

""Are you sure?"" asks James. ""Didn't you hear about the no radio thing?""

""That's an order, Captain. We have no information unless we investigate-""

Behind him, the corpses have begun to move in a spiral fashion, forming a sort of tornado. Researchers and engineers duck beneath the tables in fear. I don't really blame them.

James brings up his assault rifle. ""Marv! May! Get back! Get back! Bravo and Alpha, do not engage. Repeat, do not engage-""

The radio on his shoulder barks into his ear. *""Contact, contact, second floor of apartment complex. Northeast corridor, attempting to flank...""*

*""Jesus christ! Jesus-""*


Above us, the bodies have arranged themselves into a primitive shape of a face, with two indentations for eyes and a curved mouth. 

Like bees surrounding a hive.

A face...comprised of *death.*

Thousands of limbs vibrated together, allowing it to speak in a tongue none of us could even begin to decipher. It was a deep guttural howl that seemed to want to grind your rib cage into powder. Terror floods my bloodstream.

I was reduced to my knees, a crimson river flowing freely out of my nostrils. Across from me, May is lying on the ground, blood pouring out of her ears. 

James is seen convulsing into a maniacal paroxysm, chunky vomit spilling out of his mouth like a fountain. I yell for his name but all I can do is gargle. 

Before I fall into the black void, I see the face, high up in the sky.

A smiling face.

Yes sir, your house is a mess. However, there is a logical explanation for all of it, I assure you. 

The blood on the walls? Um, well, It could be spray paint, sir. The teenagers living around here are one wild bunch.

Hm?

It's still dripping?

Oh. Well, maybe they spilled some thicker paint, um, into the wall upstairs? And it's found a crack in the molding. That's it.

Your plates?

What about them, sir?

They're all broken in half but stacked perfectly on top of one another?

You do live in California, sir. An earthquake is obviously to blame.

What did you say?

Your dog?

Oh my. Well. He tripped down the stairs, maybe. Poor creature snapped his neck on the way down, and it got twisted around. Poor pup.

What do you mean, he's still walking around?

You probably want to get him to a vet, sir.

The pentagram in your basement? Well-

Yes, I saw it.

And the horse head too.

I rather hoped that you had put it there.

I'm not sure why you would keep a rotting horse head in your basement, sir, but some of my clients have very strange hobbies.

Why did I leave before morning?

I, well, um, had a serious meeting with my superiors this morning. Yes. I think you should come down and speak with them, sir.

Sir? Hello?

*I thought that was all between us.*

Oh, it's you.

*Yes. I just wanted to have a little fun.*

Well, you broke the agreement we had.

*But our governments said nothing about horse heads!*

If your kind wants to live in peace, you have to work with me here. Otherwise there will be panic everywhere, and I'm sure you can imagine how many exorcisms there will be.

*Ew.*

Exactly.

*Fine. I'm leaving. Thanks for ruining my fun.*

I'm sure we'll meet again.

Hello? Mr. Reynolds?

Yes, I'm still here.

Everything's back to normal?

Really?

     Ryan looked up from his file and said “I don’t think that ‘I-oh-ten’ covers what we’ve got here, I don’t think we have a code for this.”  
     “Do we know who is responsible?”
     “It is hard to tell, nobody has taken responsibility. This territory doesn’t belong to any of the major factions.  We haven’t heard of any of the minor factions working out of this area either.  There isn’t any of the usual signs.  We’re at a loss here.”
     “Shit” I muttered as he handed me the file and we turned to the building.  It is always helpful to know which faction is responsible when reprograming civilians.
A small group of people started to gather out near the street, as they tend do when there is a lot of police activity at night.  We tried to keep the on-lookers as far back from the scene as we could, but I already knew that every single person in that building at the time of the awakening had heard it happen.  I knew this from the file because someone, Eric Nussbaum on the fifth floor, had been shooting a cellphone video of his dog doing a trick and was unlucky enough to capture the sound on camera.  He uploaded the video to YouTube and then posted it to his facebook account.  Luckily he only has a handful of followers and it was night so most of them were not up.  We needed to wake up a judge to get the warrant to make facebook and youtube take the video down and delete it for good, but they were generally pretty cooperative if we could get a higher up on the phone.  The hope is that nobody copies it from them before it is removed.  
     I watched our clean up crew as we walked through the small lobby.  “How many people live here” I asked Ryan.
     “Thirty two units.  Most are two bedrooms.  The building manager said he would guess close to fifty five.  We have one of the boys with him now getting a list from his files.”
     I dug my fingertips into my temple and tried to massage the young headache away.  “Fifty five” I said, “How do we handle this?  Does anyone have any ideas yet?”
     “We are the first civilian handlers here so we have to start with our new friend Eric Nussbaum.  The office is doing what they can to get everyone here, can but we don’t have enough men to cover the building so they are bringing in guys from all the surrounding forces to help.”
     Ryan and walked up the stairs to Eric’s room, the electricity had been blown out so the elevator was not an option.  There were a few other men in similar electricians uniforms in the stairwell below us, making their way to their targets.  We need more men I thought, especially if cities are now in play.  We made our way to Eric’s apartment and knocked.  He had two roommates, one of them opened the door and looked at us, we could see all three of them in the living room.  They all had a look of panic in their eyes, hoping that we’d be holding large guns to protect them from what they all heard.  
     Instead, Ryan and I walked in with a clipboard and a smile, “Hi guys, your landlord called us over, he said that there was an issue with the electricity tonight.  Do you have power?”
     “A problem with the electricity?  That is what they called it?  No way, something was happening down there.”
     “Excuse me?” Ryan was alway better at looking confused than me.  My acting range was pretty good, I actually enjoyed the classes, but I was never able to convey a believable confused. 
     “Hey, something happened in the lobby, we think it was in the lobby.  I got the sound on video, come here, let me show you,” said Eric.  He pulled out his phone and we walked over to the table where he sat.  He played the video for us, we thought we knew what was coming but even we were not prepared for what came out of the phone’s little speaker.  We didn’t have to act surprised.  It must have been a much different experience for them to hear it live.",Prompts_account

“Three-hundred witnesses? How was this not nipped in the bud earlier?!”

Kyle Wiggins, the resident analyst, quaked in response to this. He had always been a nervous man, but in the aftermath of something this big, he was especially sensitive to being yelled at. 

“M-mister Pavini, sir... We thought it was natural, at first. Just someone imitating--” Wiggins cut himself off, steeling his nerves and ceasing his nervous shivers. “Just read the file.”

Robert sighed angrily and sat, opening the manila envelope in front of him. 

“Shit.” Was his immediate reaction. “Another method actor? Who is it this time?”

Wiggins swallowed anxiously. “W-well, we’re not sure, yet, since we have yet to put agents on the scene, but we have some theories--”

“Oh, please. You always know with these types. They’re always giving it away with their dramatic renditions of their old films. C’mon. Did Marilyn escape again? Is Dustin Hoffman dead yet?”

“N-no, I’m pretty sure the Munroe vault is completely secure after last time. And Dustin Hoffman is alive.” Wiggins pauses, before reaching for his pocket and pulling out his smartphone. “I think.”

“Don’t bother looking it up,” Robert intoned, his playfulness gone, “I’ll just make my own guesses based on the file.”

Robert turned back to the file, and began scanning the incident report. His mouth moved with the words on the page, silently repeating stats, witness testimony, and hypotheses on the perpetrator. He flipped the page, and his eyebrows went up.

“That’s a lot of hostages...” He whispered, mostly to himself. He continued reading for a while, his eyebrows continuing to climb up his face with every word, like caterpillars making for higher ground during a storm. Finally, he turned to the last page, and his face contorted with anguish and surprise.

“Motherfucker.” he stated dully. “TWO ferries?!”

[WP] Jesus and Satan both appear on Earth. Instead of fighting for world domination they decide to hold formal elections and every person on the planet is able to cast to their vote.,generalnotsew,"It was July first, in the year 2031, when Jesus and Satan came to Earth. They came at once, together.

In the times of the Bible, that old book we all stopped truly believing in, they would have had a massive, world-shaking battle. But, much like the world they returned to, they had grown more civilized. They appeared before the United Nations.

In the spirit of Democracy, they proclaimed, there would be an election. Every man, woman, and child, every living human, young or old, would have the right to vote and decide which would rule over us for the next two thousand years. They had come to this agreement after much deliberation, or so they said, and the election would be held one year from then.

The votes would be cast by the voter's preference: There was a website, for the technologically inclined, paper ballots, for the technologically fearful, and divine inspection would reveal the favor of even the youngest infant. And no one, not Jesus, Satan, or any human being, would know the running tally until every vote was in and the poll closed.

The year passed: The media coverage was massive, both candidates running smear campaigns, everyone wondering who would come out on top. No one was more certain than the candidates, each sure that he would be the next Leader.

And we were all surprised, when the votes came out: 

*****

Jesus, about one billion (1,032,046,254). 

Satan, just over one point two billion (1,248,654,879). 

None of These Candidates, the winner, with everyone else (6,169,679,482).",za419

 We stood no chance.


We threw down our weapons and turned to the hills. Few of us made it out of the Valley. 


I can’t explain what we faced. The pillar of flame had sparked to life three days before they came. Of course, none of us knew what to do. Our orders were the same as they had been for centuries. None were to enter the Valley. Our people had long since given up on learning what truly lay at its center. None were to enter the Valley, and so we stood watch. 

We sent a messenger away when the flame was lit, and expected a response within a week. But on the third morning, the earth shook. Wavering in the distance, the flame vanished immediately. Strange sounds rumbled from the center of the Valley. The trees before us shook, but we stood our ground. In minutes, we saw them. A colossal iron hand brushed aside foliage as the first of them stepped into view. They had the forms of men, but they towered over us. Twenty feet, or thirty, what does it matter? Uncaring metal faces stared at us for a moment.

A spearman charged, hurling curses. His weapon clanged uselessly against the thing’s hide. There was a sound, a subtle click. And then an eruption of noise. 

The spearman fell, bleeding. None of the creatures had moved an inch. Chaos exploded in the ranks. Some, the foolhardy among us, raised their weapons and hurtled forward. The rest of us ran. 

What hope was there?

I made it farther than any of the others. Well out of the Valley. Fleeing to the only city nearby. The creatures kept a slow, ceaseless pace. I slept in a tree that night, and was awoken by the same rumbling that heralded their arrival before. Clinging to a branch, I remained unseen as they approached. Dozens passed below me. Hundreds. I watched as they continued their relentless march towards the city. 
There was nothing we could do. There was nothing I could do. 

Two weeks. I made it back to the Valley and gathered two weeks of rations from the corpses of my companions, my friends. What else is there? No force in the world will hold against them. As I stared into the Valley, I watched the flame alight once more. This time, I walked to it.

Today, a single red flame flickers up from the valley and briefly lights up the mountains.",localtoast127,"Dag had heard every theory that the Pillars of Knowing had churned out to explain the mystery of the Forbidden Valley. Nearly every day for the last forty years she had at least one member of the Pillars sitting in her inn, drawing sketches or pointing funny metal objects at the surrounding mountains. Dag didn't mind. Every stupid rumor brought more people with fat wallets to her town.

Some said the valley contained the ruins of an ancient civilization with riches beyond belief, while others whispered that it was the home of a mighty dragon, which led many of the greatest hunters to make futile attempts to enter in search of the ultimate trophy, never to return. One crazy old man decided he would construct a flying machine and get into the valley from the above. He, of course, died after running his machine off of the church roof.

Obviously, there were many who tried their hardest to keep others away. The Sanctum of Eternity warned that the Forbidden Valley was the home of the gods, and that anyone who dared the defile its sacred earth would be forever damned. The popular theory amongst the younger scholars of the Pillars of Knowing was that the valley contained a deadly natural gas and would never be worth approaching.

On October 17th, 1621, Dag was taking advantage of the emptiness of her inn to do some cleaning. It was 5:30 and nearly dark, but most of the town was still in church celebrating the birth of Nazareth, apart from the Pillars, who were almost all atheists, and the Sanctum, who seemed to despise Nazareth far more than other competing deities.

Dag would have retched had she not become completely numb to the filth she was mopping up. Vomit caked the floor in most corners, as well as some more questionable fluids. The Nazarines had an odd custom of starting off Nazzy's birthday with wanton debauchery until noon and then ending the day with a vigil. Dag couldn't stand the Nazarine's exhausting list of traditions. She preferred her own gods from the south, who only asked for the occasional rodent sacrifice.

Sighing, she stepped outside to throw another bucket of slop onto the road. Before heading back in she took a moment to admire the sunset, before she remembered the sun had already set. In the west. She was looking east, at the valley.

""What in...""

The fire must have been a mile above the highest mountain, burning red and as bright as a full moon. Dag realized she wasn't the only one staring. Burnham, one of the members of the Pillars who had become a permanent resident, was sitting on his doorstep, one hand clutching a bronze contraption to his eye while the other blindly scribbled notes onto the paper on his knee. He seemed to be almost in a trance.

Then, in an instant, her vision was plunged into darkness. Only the slightest sliver of a moon illuminated the night.

--------

On December 23rd, they got to her. In a move not unlike a 8 year old bully, the Sanctum of Eternity's Prophet had ordered all who claimed to see the fire to be burned in the flames they seem to love so much. War had once again broken out over the Forbidden Valley. The Nazarine church had been demolished and the Pillars of Knowing driven out.

Dag was dragged by her hair by a hulking man. Robed figures slung profanities and dirt at her. The cold gritty mud rubbed into the stinging wounds on her back. They had tortured her so long she could keep consciousness.

In the town square, a priest she didn't recognize stood next to a massive pyre. To her right, she could see scaffolding over the ruins of the church.

""My children!"" bellowed the priest. ""On this blessed day we commence the construction of this new place of worship at the foot of the home of the gods! But, we must first sanctify this place with a cleansing! Bring forth the heathen!""

Dag was carried up to the top of the pyre and slammed against the post. She was confused for a moment that they weren't tying her hands. Had they cut them off? She was too delirious to remember.

The priest began shouting again.

""This woman was the first to bear false witness! She was the first to spread these vile rumors of red lights in the sky! RED! This is impossible! Our gods are the true gods! And they are BLUE gods!""

He went on for several minutes before ordering the fire to be lit. The flames somewhat roused Dag from her haze. The last thing she saw before the flames took her was a giant grey bird with no face rising from the valley.

The moon poured borrowed light between the trees and over the side of the mountain. No clouds were in the sky, and the air moved not. Except for the sound of rampant footfall winding down an obscure mountain trail.

The two figures moved along the dirt road not with confidence, but fear. They pounded their feet and pumped their arms, trying to put distance between them and something behind them as fast as possible. When the pair finally slowed, the tall one leaned against a tree near the base of the mountain, the shorter one put hands to knees, trying to remember the correct way to breathe.

""You. Fucking. Idiot."" The tall one stood up from the tree. ""You did not. You did not do what I think you did.""

""Yeah, James, you got the bottle,"" The taller man rolled his eyes, ""But you also set fire to what was possibly the most beautiful and peaceful hidden village anywhere in the world. You single-handedly ruined generations of tradition and isolationism, for what? A bottle?"" The man coughed, leaning back up against the tree in defeat and fumbling his front pocket, lighting a filterless cigarette.

""Not just any bottle,Marty."" James took a seat against a nearby tree, holding the priceless antique to the moonlight to inspect it. ""This was on my dad's list. 'The Bottle from Hidden Valley.' With this, that six shooter, those stockings, and that crown, I'm only two artifacts away from joining the Consortium. Just like my dad.""

Marty's eyes were hard, but quickly softened as the boy spoke. He exhaled smoke towards the moon, a caring, albeit hidden smile dashed onto his face for a brief moment. ""Yeah kid, just like your dad.""

""Do you think there's any ranch in here?""

""Shut the fuck up, James.""

Today, a single red flame flickers up from the valley and briefly lights up the mountains.",localtoast127,"A cold wind whipped around Captain Hux as the red streak rose higher and higher into the crisp night sky. No fog today, no clouds. Nothing to hide what the flame had to show when it burned even brighter at the arc of its flight. 

A wave of whispers skittered throughout his scouting party. They had been following the Legions of the Gurshal Armies who had descended into the Valley just the night before. The Valley floor was littered with generations, upon generations of defeated armies. Relics of his own country, flags not flown in centuries, whipped in the cold wind, ripped and worn by age, lay scattered among the brown rocks and jagged shrubbery. Decayed wood of battering rams, rusted shields, bones bleached white and pulverized by the armies who had climbed past it. 

Across the valley there was a cleared path through the wreckage, and at its base fresh corpses, polished, new metal, and splintered siege weapons. A brand new pile at the walls of the mysterious Fortress. 

""By all the gods."" He heard his Lieutenant say, ""The armies of King Vinder, Emperor Shalath, the Forgotten Kingdom of-"" 

""And the Gurshal, added to them."" 

""They had one hundred thousand men."" He whispered in disbelief. 

""Enough to sack our Capital, no doubt. More than enough."" Hux said. ""And now they're gone, erased."" He sniffed, ""Another kingdom falls, chasing what lies beyond the Forbidden Walls."" An old song. The red light began to dim, and with it the mysterious valley was once again cloaked by shadow. *Better that way.* Hux thought. 

""I wonder what's inside...who they are..."" The Lieutenant mused. The stories told of priceless treasures, limitless powers, if only you could breach the gates. That perhaps the gates had been breached time, and time again, but those who conquer the keep never leave because of the treasures within. Tantalizing. 

""I want this place struck from the maps."" Hux said. 

""Sir?""

""It's a myth, Lieutenant. The place doesn't exist."" He shrugged his shoulders, ""The Gurthal drowned at sea. Terrible storm. Quite unfortunate."" 

The Lieutenant frowned, but nodded. 

""Any man who says otherwise."" Hux warned, ""I'll execute them myself."" *Better that way.* He thought. ",micmea1

Var pulled his coat in around himself closer, trying desperately to ward off the piercing cold. The fire behind him burned low as the last bits of the log he threw on an hour ago was exhausted.

""Sir, that light is back.""

Var turned around and walked to the ladder on the other side of the room. He pulled himself up the wood rungs onto the platform on top of the cabin. Up there stood one of his men, motioning east. Sure enough there it was again, that red light. It had been showing up for the past several hours, ever since the Southerners had entered the Valley.

""Bloody fools they are. Don't they know better?"" asked the bowman to his right.

""Come on Farhz, most folk don't even know the Valley actually exists,"" responded Var. ""Most likely some General thought he could save a week's travel through a short cut.""

""Still...you think the Rusts would warn them off.""

He wasn't wrong thought Var. Rusted out hulks of ancient machines from ages past. Large machines of war with gaping holes, as if some great beast had pulverized their outer shells. Myths of that time spoke of great battles fought for the Valley. The details varied as much as the people who told them except for one part: no one who entered ever made it out alive.

Suddenly there was a brief, brighter flash, and the quiet night suddenly got quieter.

""Farhz, you ready with the log book?"" asked Lt. Var.

""Yes sir, though I had to switch to a pencil since the ink froze.""

""We'll do it again in the morning, just get it down,"" said Var.

Every time that light appeared there was a lull, and then a faint voice could be heard over the wind. Var waited and sure enough a moment later there it was:

You stared directly at me -- *through* me. Your eyes... oh god your eyes. The fear in them was palpable. Andrew, I wish I could have told you how much you meant to me before you died. I wish I could have stopped the fire that trapped you in that locked room. The screaming -- the primal, uninhibited screaming -- the sharp coughing and gagging -- and then the silence.

After the fire, your mother and I planned to sell the home, at least until the first night that I saw you in the hallway, walking from the bathroom to the bedroom -- just like any other evening. I cried out to you to no avail. I walked to your room, and you were staring through the window. Then you saw me. I briefly saw so many emotions superimposed on your face, but they quickly evanesced leaving only fear. I saw your silent scream. And then you were gone.

I don't know what to do at this point. I don't want to leave you alone here. But you're so afraid. I feel like our presence here is a torment for you. I don't understand your fear, but I wish you could step beyond it for just one second and we could say goodbye.

I'm sitting in the hallway again tonight. You're not here. I walk downstairs and somehow, impossibly find you sitting at the dinner table, a plate of food in front of you. I slowly approach the kitchen table, trembling. Your mother sits opposite you, a glass of wine sitting next to her. I watch you silently mouth the words, ""I saw him again last night."" and see your mother's concerned eyes meet yours.

I take in the stacks of plates neatly placed in boxes on the dining room table that I'd somehow not seen before. I notice the empty shelves that once held books. I -- I remember the fire. It wasn't here. It was at the warehouse. It was at my job. I remember the screaming, my screaming as... as I...

Apart from the control of the team, the camera swiveled to center in on the feline. The team began searching for malfunctions when the rover began creeping closer and closer to the mission director's prized cat. The team, frustrated and confused, could not regain control of the rover, and Curiosity inched closer to the tabby, who refused to move (in a typical domestic feline manner). Having no other choices, they finally cut all power.

""Think think think... oh come on... oh! if she's my soulmate, that means that she likes the same things I do!"" The coffee shop near by looked promising; the indoor was lit by a fireplace and candles, and jazz played in the background. I threw open the door, only to find my pendant still.

[WP] At birth everybody receives a necklace that will glow when they get near their soulmate/perfect partner. You're a college student studying abroad when suddenly yours starts to shine for the first time.,DwightAllRight,"I have watched over the years as one by one my friends necklaces began to glow. We would then make a game out of if. Racing about town, or wherever we were  watching the necklace glow brighter the closer we got to their true love. I used to happily watch, joining in the excitement, watching love blossom when we found who made the necklace glow. I watched one by one find love over the years as my necklace never even twinkled. Graduation day came around and I was the only one left with a necklace around my neck. I felt the weight of it as I walked across the stage to grab my diploma, felt everyone's eyes on it, heard the whispers. Everywhere I went it seemed I couldn't escape the stares. I would watch the lips of old women mouth the words ""poor thing"". I had to get away from it all. I went to the first college that would accept me that was as far away from my small town as possible, and here I am. Sitting on a bridge in Germany. I tucked away the lifeless necklace into my shirt, and looked down past my shoes at the water below. I looked it up you know, the longest someone has lived before their necklace glowed. The longest someone had went without finding their soul mate was a guy by the name of Mike Muller. He was 19 before his necklace glowed. Sitting here now I'm 23 and only one possible reason my necklace has never glowed, and that has to be because my soul mate doesn't exist. I don't know if I just never had one or if maybe she died. All I know is I cant live my life alone anymore. I looked down at the water. Watched it swirl over the rocks, and under the bridge. I watched the water for some time, getting up the courage to jump. Standing up on the ledge I felt the wind sweep in from behind me bringing a muffled sound with it. Turning to see what the noise was I saw a woman leaning on the railing of the bridge weeping. She was clutching a necklace in her right hand. a necklace just like mine. Slowly stepping down, I walked over to this woman never taking my eyes off her necklace. I stood behind her not knowing what to say for the longest time. 

""hello"" I mustered causing her to jump. She whipped around quickly whipping her tears away. 

""I was just leaving"" she said as she tried to squeeze past me.

""wait, your necklace it doesn't glow"" her eyes started to water again as she looked away off to the river. I held pulled my necklace from my shirt holding the pendent between my fingers. ""neither does mine"" I say holding it up for her to see. She looked at my necklace with a puzzled look on her face before looking up into my eyes. ""my names jack"" I say meeting her eyes ""and you are""

""my names molly""

[WP] At birth everybody receives a necklace that will glow when they get near their soulmate/perfect partner. You're a college student studying abroad when suddenly yours starts to shine for the first time.,DwightAllRight,"Kacy discovered her soul mate, a fellow named Brent Swire, on the steps of the county courthouse.  She did not recall meeting him at his house, which she was busy robbing at the time, due to a traumatic experience that left her hospitalized and near death.

Naturally, she was excited beyond belief that her stones had illuminated; everyone everywhere knew the significance of that.  What gave her pause though was his age.  As she stood at the stair top looking at this man, she worried that there had been a mistake.  *He’s almost as old as my dad*, she thought.

In her eyes, this man was handsome and had a confident look, something like a mix between a professor and a construction worker.  He was fit, had crow’s feet around his eyes and probably more grey in his sideburns than he cared to admit.  The crooked smile he flashed to her was cute, she admitted to herself, and he was tall.  Gosh, was he tall.  The red tufts of hair sticking out from under the cap he was wearing complimented his sparkling green eyes.  Still, he was way too old.  

“I’m him.”

She replied softly, “Yes, I’m Kacy Carter.”  

He approached her, hand extended, and introduced himself.  “I’m Brent.  Brent Swire.  I’m so pleased to meet you.”  She felt her hand get swallowed by his massive paw and returned a firm shake.

“How do you…  How do you know who I am?  I’ve never met you before.”  They released their grip and her hand floated up to her stones, fingers dancing over the bean shaped jewels with nervous energy.

“But you have.  We’ve met once before.  Look, I know you’re nervous and scared, what, with some strange guy coming up to you and all, stones glowing.  I’m just as excited and nervous and as scared as you.  I don’t know what this means,” he gestured to his necklace, “but I think we owe it to each other to find out.”

“What do you want?”  She found herself talking to his necklace, drawn by its unusual shade of blue.  *It’s the color of my eyes.  What does that mean?*

“How about lunch for starters?  My treat.  Ms. Carter, I think we both know the significance of what the stones mean.  Just a quick lunch and some conversation, that’s all.”

Kacy did have her reservations, but ultimately the power of the stones decided for her.  She followed him to his truck and hoped he wouldn’t press her for anything.  He didn’t.  They made the drive in relative silence, both of their minds flooded with thoughts and worries.

Upon parking and turning off his truck, Brent looked to his young passenger and noticed that she was frightened.  He unlocked the doors.  “Kacy, take it easy.  You can leave any time you want.  These stones just show us who our matches are, but they aren’t a sentence.  I can’t make you accept what this means.  Come on, let’s go inside.”  Brent exited the truck, walked around and opened the door for her.  “Let’s talk about this, please.”

She got out, quickly made a beeline to the restaurant and went straight to the ladies room.  With tears streaming down her face she looked at herself in the mirror.  *What’s he going to think of me when I tell him I can’t do this?  He’s too old to be my forever partner.  Can’t he see that?  What could we possibly have in common?  This can’t be real.*

She dabbed her eyes, straightened up and managed to calm down after a few minutes.  She’d hear what he had to say, thank him for lunch, then leave him forever.

She returned to the diner and easily found him sitting in a booth by the window.  As she sat she couldn’t help but notice that his moonstones gave a brighter glow when she got near.  Dismissing the thought her attention turned to a menu.  They sat in silence until the waitress showed up.

“Oh my lord!  Sherry, we have some new-founders here!” she hollered to someone near the register.  “When did you two find out?  How did you meet?  I’m still waiting on my forever, dagnabit, but you two look so special together.  Listen to me gush… Miss, what could I get you?  Other than that nice hunk of man you already have.  Hee-hee.”

Kacy felt the weight of her stones and all they represented bearing down.  “Can I just have a salad, no dressing?”  Her appetite vanished.

“And you mister?  What’ll it be?”

Brent saw the panic setting in on Kacy.  “I’ll just have some coffee please.”

The waitress scribbled the order and shot off, hollering over to Sherry about their necklaces.

Brent fiddled with a napkin before sighing heavily.  “Kacy, I know who you are.  I know how you wound up in the hospital.  That was my house you were in when the… the accident happened.”  He clutched the napkin tightly in his hand as he spoke, sure she would run out on him.

She started at him, stunned.  “This can’t be happening.  This isn’t real.  I died in the hospital and you’re a figment of my imagination.  A prank.”  She felt herself spiraling into an unknown place.

“I’m afraid it’s no prank Kacy.  You were in the right place at the wrong time.”

“Why are you even talking to me?  I don’t understand.  I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.  I shouldn’t be here.  Not here… with you, or anyone.  I can’t deal with this, it’s too much.”  Standing to leave she gave Brent one last look.  “Why would the stones align us?”

“I don’t know Kacy, but we both know that they don’t lie.  We lie to ourselves all the time, so maybe these things are here to put some truth back in our lives.  I won’t try to keep you from leaving.  Please, take this.”  He extended a hand with a business card in it.  “You can call me anytime.  Any time.”

She took the card and left.

A week later a text popped up on his cell.  **Can we talk??  Zilker Park 3PM @ gardens**

Moonstones.  We all know what they mean and the hope attached to them.  Their light doesn’t die in times of separation, it only dims.  The stones themselves cannot control the people who wear them, they cannot make someone love their equal and opposite.  They are there to merely open our eyes to people we may not have ever given a fair chance to.  An indicator that a glowing partner could be a stone’s throw away…

[WP] At birth everybody receives a necklace that will glow when they get near their soulmate/perfect partner. You're a college student studying abroad when suddenly yours starts to shine for the first time.,DwightAllRight,"I didn't think it would ever happen.

The jewel on my necklace, which for my whole life had remained dormant, suddenly illuminated.

I had gone out for a stroll down some back road in Paris when it happened.  When I saw it light up, I clutched it with eager hands and started pacing around.  I walked Northward, and it dimmed down.  Backtracking, I headed Southeast, and it slowly grew with intensity.

*Finally,* I thought.  *I finally found her!*  The necklace's light indicated that I had neared my soulmate.  Perhaps, right now, she was experiencing the same excitement I was; soon, we would meet, our fears of dying alone finally being squashed.

As the light in my necklace reached its zenith, I heard footsteps approach from an alleyway.  *My lover?* I thought, eager to meet my new companion.

A girl in a stained hoodie rounded the corner.  She held a knife in one hand.  Her eyes lit up when she saw my necklace.  ""Give it to me,"" she said, hungrily.

I backed up.  ""What?  I--I don't understand.""  I held the necklace cautiously.  ""Don't you know what this means?  We're soulmates. . . ""

She started to laugh.  With her right hand she held up a small remote control.  ""This magical device triggers illuminations,"" she started.  She stepped forward and aimed the knife at my face.  ""No more playing games.  Give me the necklace.""

I backed away.  ""You. . . you can't do this to me!""  I turned around and started to run.  

Suddenly, I felt something sharp protrude into my back.  *The knife.  That bitch threw the knife!*  I fell down on the ground in agony.

""Please,"" I moaned.  ""Don't take it.  It's the only way I can find my soulmate. . . ""

The girl cackled as she reached down and grabbed the necklace.  ""Love's overrated, kid.""  She threw into a bag and walked back toward the alley.",mjkguy

You're a college student studying abroad when suddenly yours starts to shine for the first time.,DwightAllRight,"My father kept my stones from me till I turned 18. That birthday was the day my first love and I ended our relationship. He handed them to me and told me that it was time to face things as an adult, and I did. I went to her house to visit later that night. Her face lit up when she saw me, but my stones stayed dull. She brought out hers, and they were the same. We ended things that night, but being a dumb kid still in love, I swore they were broken, or wrong, and I put them away. 

I've had many loves over the years, and though they sometimes last years, and some only weeks, they were  great loves, and I learned so much from every single one of them. My stones stayed in their box for most of that period of my life. 

I married a girl about a decade back, and it was joy at first, and after that, a comfortable familiarity for a while. It eventually crumbled away. A love at first sight that ended in two people having a contest to see who could be more horrible to each other. The day I told her goodbye, I took out the necklace, and it helped me make that decision. Cold and gray, they looked darker than I had ever seen them.

I carry them with me now. I'm getting older, a bit more afraid of not ever meeting my partner, worried that I may miss her because I wasn't looking. 

Last summer, I was up north visiting friends from my school days for our annual Forth of July party when she showed up. I knew she lived in the area, but we've been friends from a distance for the last two decades, and I didn't expect to see her there. My first love...

About half an hour after she showed up, she found me, and over the next two days, we were inseparable. Two old friends, grown up, wiser, and both carrying the weight of the Forty years we'd both experienced. 

The last night of my trip, we ended up staying the night together. Laying in bed, we told each other the small  stories that we'd neglected to share over the years, secrets we'd kept to ourselves, and spoke about how the world was changing. As we faded to sleep, I reached up to shut off the lights, and noticed that my suitcase was lit up from the inside. 

""Stupid stones!"" I thought to myself as I fell asleep, but it nagged me enough the next day, that while we were all saying our goodbyes, I pulled her aside from the group and told her what I had seen. She pulled hers from her pocket and they shone so bright that I couldn't look at them directly. 

Being a bit bewildered still, all I could do was ask her what this all meant. 

She took a step closer, kissed me on the cheek, and said ""I guess this means that you'll be back next year, doesn't it?"".

You're a college student studying abroad when suddenly yours starts to shine for the first time.,DwightAllRight,"Our necklaces were glowing brightly, a beautiful deep amethyst color. There was no denying it; the woman sitting across from me was the one. It was almost eerie how much we had in common too. She was an avid reader, a writer, and incredibly articulate--there were no pauses, no *buts* or  *ummmms* within her speech. We had been sitting in the booth for three hours already, and it was one of the most enjoyable conversations I had ever had; her wit was sharper than a broadsword and her sense of humor complemented mine perfectly…  


Her phone buzzed, interrupting my thoughts. 


""Ah! One second!"" She quickly checked the message, and frowned. ""Awww. I'm really sorry, but it's my younger brother. He needs me to pick him up from chess club now. Truth be told, I should have left an hour ago. But I'm ecstatic that I finally met you! He'll understand once I tell him that I finally found my soulmate!"" Her smile returned. ""We should go out for dinner on Friday. My treat!"" 


I smiled back weakly. *Was it really that simple for her?* 


She noticed my silence. ""…Is….something wrong?"" She looked worried. 


""Look, I… I don't know. This, this isn't exactly the way I thought things would go, you know? It's nothing personal, really, and I love talking to you, but… I… I was kind of expecting my soul mate to be a man. I just… I think we're better off just being friends, you know? I don't know if I could ever really have a relationship beyond that with a woman. It's not something I've ever really considered or been interested in."" 


Her face fell. She was trying hard to keep her composure, but it was clear she wanted to cry. I couldn't blame her. I wanted to cry too. *The necklace had finally glowed…*

You're a college student studying abroad when suddenly yours starts to shine for the first time.,DwightAllRight,"“Is it off?” Amal asked, stopping in front of the door.  I nodded.  “Good,” she said, “trust me, this is gonna be great.”

She opened the door and we both stepped into the large classroom and, as soon as the sounds of talking, laughing, and flirting hit me, I felt my heart pump faster.  Being stupidly nervous, the first thing I did was screech in the default girliest way my voice could, “Heyyy!” to Hannah and Janelle, who were both seated in the very back right of the room and the only girls I recognized in the group of twenty or so people.  The entire room went silent for the briefest, most terrifying moment before returning to its normal volume of socializing.  

“Hey girls!” Janelle said, trying to match my enthusiasm.  She patted the desk behind her, inviting us to sit and we scurried over to them.  

“So you’re finally here,” Hannah said expectantly.  “Okay, so what did Amal tell you about this speed-dating event?”

“Well,” I said, trying to bottle the giddiness masking my nervousness.  “*Well*.”

The three of them stared at me for a second and it seemed they were each holding her breath.

“It’s so fascinating!” I blurted out.  “And *scary*, you know?  Like why would you try to date someone you’re not Aligned with?”

“But that’s the great part,” Amal said, “No Pendants, no Detection, and god, no *Alignment*.  It’s freeing and non-committal and casual, and there’s none of the ‘but I’m not ready yet’ stress because you *don’t* have to do anything.”

“I don’t even bring my Pendant with me,” Janelle boasted.  “I leave it my room.  You gotta get in the zone, you know what I mean?”

“Wow,” I said with admiration.  I absentmindedly felt the lump of polished stone and electronics underneath my sweater, remembering the scolding Mom gave me when I told her with tears in my eyes that I’d lost my Pendant (it was in my gym bag).  “Aren’t you afraid you’ll lose it?”

Janelle laughed before admitting she had it locked in a personal safe under her dorm bed.  

“*But*,” she reiterated, “the point is--”

“Girl, you’re such a fraud,” Amal poked,

“*The point is*,” Janelle said, stifling her laughter, “I’m symbolically taking control of my love life.  I’m not gonna let my fate be decided by some rock given by the government.”

“What a revolutionary,” Hannah quipped.

“*But*,” Janelle emphasized again, “just in case, you know, things don’t work out--” her voice lowered in volume, “Under my bed I got a little back-up plan, ya dig?”

“A real Susan B. Anthony,” Hannah said.

“Bitch, I’m Cleopatra,” Janelle shot back.

“I think you mean Lady Macbeth,” Hannah replied cooly.

“Lady Macbeth didn’t even *exist*,” Janelle corrected.

“Girls shut up,” Amal piped.  “We need to tell Clara what to expect.”

“Oh man,” I heard myself say.

“*Don’t*,” Janelle said, putting her hand on mine, “be nervous.  Just be yourself, but don’t be telling each guy your deepest, darkest secrets and your most personal dreams and all that stuff you’d normally tell someone you’re Aligned with.  Remember, this is a place with *zero* expectation and *minimal* commitment.”

“Okay,” I breathed.  “Okay.”

“You’ll be fine,” Amal said.  “Basically,  in a few minutes the club president’s gonna tell everyone to quiet down, welcome some newcomers (that’s you), and go through the speed-dating process--”

“We rearrange the desks in two vertical lines,” Janelle interrupted, “boys one side, girls on another, then Alex--”

“The president,” Hannah inserted.

“*Then Alex*,” Janelle reiterated, “is going to ring a bell to signal your first five minutes with your first guy.  After five minutes she’ll ring it again and the next guy will move over and you’ll go another five minutes, and so on and so on.”

“It’ll be fun,” Amal said.

“It’ll be fun!” Janelle repeated.

“There’s literally *no* reason to be nervous,” Hannah.

“Guys, I’m nervous,” I said with a puny smile which evaporated as soon as a short brunette stood up and shouted, “HEY EVERYONE, CAN WE START TO MOVE THE CHAIRS PLEASE?  WE’LL BE STARTING SOON.”

And with that the room erupted in the noise of scuffling clothes and screeching chairs.  My heart started to beat again and I must have had such a frown on my face because Amal put her hand on my shoulder said, “Clara, really, it’ll be okay.”  

“Thanks,” I said, feeling a little better.

Then all of a sudden Amal’s face turned serious and she pulled in closer to me so that none of the others could hear.

“*Don’t turn it on*.”

[WP] At birth everybody receives a necklace that will glow when they get near their soulmate/perfect partner. You're a college student studying abroad when suddenly yours starts to shine for the first time.,DwightAllRight,"Ad from 1967:  Keep your family safe with Moonstones!  These beautifully polished stones glow in radiation, letting you know that Russia has attacked.  Don't send your kids to school, or let your husband leave home, without one!  Even Scruffy deserves an Moonstone collar.  

Excerpt from Wikipedia:  *Atom Stones (later named Moonstones for civilian sales), first manufactured by General Electric, were designed to illuminate when minute traces of radiation were detected, however, the stones did not work as expected.  The scientific community and, in particular, the nuclear industry discontinued using moonstones for radiological detection after the Chernobyl disaster.*

By 1986 Moonstones had gained a popularity unmatched in the consumer world.  They weren't expensive, were surprisingly light, and, for a stone, they could be formed into almost any shape.  Interestingly enough, the natural kidney bean form it was normally found in was most popular.  Their off-white color seemed perfect for jewelry of all types.

A tradition which began in Arizona turned into a global one; upon birth, each infant was fit with a moonstone necklace.  It wasn't learned until after this tradition began that the true nature of the stones wasn't radiation detection, it was soul mate detection.

By 2003 it was common knowledge around the world that the stones were a visual cue that you have met your perfect match.  Many older couples were happy that their stones glowed softly when their long-time partner came near.  Other couples, whose stones stayed dim, divorced to find their true mate.

Younger generations, particularly those who have worn their moonstone necklaces since birth, had a revolution with matchmaking.  By 2016 SMatching (stone matching) became a common term; huge events for singles were held worldwide, each attendee excited for the chance to meet ""the one"" for them.  Cell phones had a stone sensor and with an app one could swipe through potential mates, all the while hoping their necklace would emit a soft glow.

Brent Swire's moonstone necklace has never glowed.  At 44 years old he's too late for the younger generation's revolution.  No apps for him.  No massive get-togethers in Madison Square Garden.  Not even a blink of light.  In his early thirties, when the secret of the stones broke out, Brent was tied up building a career.  He'd served in the Army and after discharge he hit the ground running.  Dating, vacations, hobbies; those all took a backseat to establishing himself as a graphics artist.  The stones held no interest for him.

Today, Brent is an established graphics designer.  His primary focus is corporate branding and logo design.  He works by himself in a small studio in Austin and has enough of a backlog of work to keep his social calendar mostly blank.  Tonight, though, he is going to a small meet-up downtown.  The evite was clear that this would be an older crowd and a bit more formal than the younger folk's events.

Brent walked into The Ginger Man and contemplated turning right around.  The crowd here was older, aligning with his age, but that isn't what gave him pause.  While the inside of the bar was normal, folks were chatting and getting drinks, it was outside the bar, in back, that gave him an uncomfortable feeling.  Chairs were set up across from each other.  The women stayed seated and men were just sitting down across from them, checking their stones, and leaving if nothing happened.  In most cases the couples did not even speak to each other.  There was an air of desperation that he did not like.

He ducked back inside, went to the bar and ordered a beer, thinking this had been a mistake.  While taking a pull on his beer he felt a tap on his shoulder.  He turned to find an attractive brunette standing there and smiled.  

""Are you going to keep hogging up the bar?  I want some drinks.""  She didn't seem nice at all.  Brent moved aside, chugged the rest of his beer and decided to leave.

He walked down Lavaca Street to the river, stopping to lean on a rail.  *What am I doing?*  he asked himself.  It was 8:45 PM and here he was, yet again, not out meeting anyone.  Why try?  He let his mind wander while staring down at the Colorado River.  The uselessness of the stones, at least for him, weighed heavily on him.  Here he was again, counting himself out before the game had started.

Tired of beating himself up and ashamed of inability to “woo the ladies,” he went home.

Brent reached back to turn off the garage light when he felt a presence in his house.  *Shit, someone is in here*.  He slipped off his shoes and made his way into the kitchen where he quietly pulled a knife from its block.  He didn’t have a home phone and he realized too late that his cell phone was in his bedroom.

Quietly, he made his way through the downstairs of his house.  Clutter was everywhere and several paintings had been removed from the wall.  Stiffening his resolve, he crept up the stairs with the knife held in front of him.  He heard some shuffling and small thunks coming from his office.  He kept on the move quietly, skirting the wall and peering into the empty guest room before continuing on.

*I should just go back downstairs and leave.  They didn’t hear me pull in, they won’t hear me leave.*  A bead of sweat trickled down his temple and he felt a knot of fear blossom in his belly.  With his knife held firmly in front of him waist high he barged in…

And immediately ran into someone.  Someone short and dark.  He heard a gasp and then a scream, unsure if it was the burglar or himself who caused it.  A short moment later he felt the knife move, something sliding off of it followed by a thump on the floor.  Brent reached out with the knife, feeling with it and there was nothing but air.

A low moan escaped from whoever lay on the floor.  Brent quickly flipped on the lights and to his surprise there was a woman laid out bleeding heavily, a wound visible below her ribcage.  “Holy shit, what are you doing in my house?  You’re robbing me?  Who else…”

At that moment he noticed something.  The thief, bleeding to death on his floor, was emitting a soft green glow through her shirt.  The diffuse luminous band began to gain intensity.  He looked down at his own moonstone necklace and was stunned.  

His moonstone was a brilliant blue.

[WP] At birth everybody receives a necklace that will glow when they get near their soulmate/perfect partner. You're a college student studying abroad when suddenly yours starts to shine for the first time.,DwightAllRight,"Kacy Carter woke to find herself in the hospital.  Tubes and hoses seemingly ran into every orifice of her body and she could feel them all, along with a dull ache centered in her chest.  Each newly discovered life support apparatus pushed her further into panic and despair; she’d failed.  One lousy robbery and she’d failed.  She closed her eyes, took a rattling breath and cried.  *My best years are behind me and I still have a life to live.*

Kacy grew up in West Lake Hills just outside of Austin.  Some would say her family was rich, but that simply wasn’t true.  Both of her parents and her older brother all worked long hours to afford their lifestyles.  The youngest child, she was a former high school track star and a current collegiate has-been.  Her dominance in varsity athletics translated poorly to higher competitive tiers.  She saw herself losing her drive, had tasted defeat, repeatedly, and grew jealous of the girls who transitioned so easily to the UT women’s track team.  Everything had just gone so wrong for her that she could not find a way to change.  She felt like she was against the ropes and life just kept landing body blow after body blow.  Her real-life education was a harsh lesson that sports did not make everyone a standout.

Poor decisions and quick fixes led to long term problems for Kacy.  She relied heavily on payday loans to eke through her existence as a waitress at Jim’s Restaurant in Sunset Valley.  Rent was beyond past due and she was too proud to ask family for help.  Working out was no longer fun and she’d let herself go, something she would have never thought possible.  Her friends stopped calling or coming around because she always needed something; a ride, money, food, booze.  Worst of all, though, Kacy had given up on herself and wallowed in self-pity.  She turned to a life of petty crime that equaled petty payouts.

“Oh good, you’re awake.  I’ll get the doctor.”  The nurse had barely looked up from her clipboard before she disappeared.  Kacy opened her eyes and tried not to panic.  A few moments later a middle aged doctor stepped in along with a policeman.

“I’m Doctor Norman.  I’d like to take an opportunity to tell you that you are a very lucky young lady.  Let’s have a look at you.”  Without waiting for acknowledgement he began checking her over, commenting that her heart rate and blood pressure appeared fine, the contusion she suffered in her wrist looked OK, and then he reached for her gown to check her stab wound.  “Just relax, I only need to look at it for a moment and check the stitches.”

“What happened to me?” Kacy inquired, keeping her voice soft and not lifting her eyes.

Dr. Norman glanced at the officer and responded, “We won’t get in to that right now.  Your priority is to get healed so you can get out of here.”  Norman looked over her wound, making sure to use her smock as a block so Kacy couldn’t see just how injured she was.  “No signs of infection and you’ve started scabbing.  That’s a good.  Stitches look good.  You’re lucky, Dr. Monroe closed you up and I think there will be minimal scarring as long as you take precautions.  How do you feel?  Any difficulties breathing, coughing or fluid discharge?  Tightness in your chest?”

“No, just a deep ache.”

“You’ll have that a while.  Alright then, Ms. Carter, the nurse will be back to check on you later.  If you feel faint or have difficulties breathing press the button on this,” he indicated the call dongle with his finger, “and a nurse will be with you shortly.  Good day.”

Officer Doucet remained in the room.  “I have some questions for you, if you feel up to answering them.”  The expressionless look on his face led Kacy to believe that he was going to get answers whether she felt like talking or not.

Thirty minutes later Doucet left and the room went back to near silence.  Kacy felt trapped, exposed, weak and helpless to do anything for herself.  *Is this it?  Is this my life?  Jail, a record, nothing?*  She wept into her hand until she fell asleep.

Nurse Williams came to check up on the patient in Room 433.  She was excited and had a hard time hiding it.  She knew the patient in there was in some sort of trouble with the law, but she did carry with her a sliver of good news.  Entering the room, she paused to admire the beautiful sleeping young woman, a hand on the door jam and a sympathetic smile spreading on her face.

 “Wake up honey, time for me to get some of these devices unhooked from you.”  Kacy roused, yawned and became nervous.  Nurse Williams went about removing an IV, pulled a few sticky pads off of her patient’s chest and generally straightened up the remaining sensors.  “You’re a lucky lady,” she stated.

Very meekly, Kacy responded “I don’t feel so lucky.  I feel cursed, or worse, condemned.”  On the verge of crying again, she quieted.

“I’ve seen lots of people come through here, some lucky, some not.  This is the first time I’ve ever had this happen though.”  Williams reached into her pocket and pulled out a moonstone necklace.  A glowing green necklace.  With a barely contained smile she told Kacy, “This is yours.  Do you see it?  It’s so beautiful.”

Kacy’s eyes fixed on the stones.  Her stones.  The prettiest green luminous glow she’d ever witnessed spread out and seemed to warm her, calm her, because she knew what it meant.  Tearing her eyes away from the necklace she looked to Nurse Williams, not really believing that her soul mate was a woman.  “You?  It’s you?”  She felt fresh tears leak from her pretty blue eyes.

“No honey, it isn’t me.”  To prove her point, the nurse pulled her smock aside at the neck, revealing her dim moonstones.  Kindly, she informed Kacy that she didn’t know who her mate was and offered consoling words that she’d find that person soon enough.  She very gently placed the necklace on Kacy and quietly departed.

Kacy slept again with both hands clutching her stones, remembering all the times she’d gone searching for her other.  Her and her friends bouncing around 6th Street at all hours, hitting the dance halls most weekends, floating the river; all in hope that she’d find her equal.

Few visitors came and went, no flowers were sent, family stopped by and left, seemingly disappointed.  She felt all of it.  She knew she’d let down the most important people in her life.  She asked the nurses to restrict all future visitors.  She couldn’t look them in the eye anymore.

A month later, healed and discharged from the hospital, Kacy stood for arraignment.  Her public defender was there for her, but no one else was.  *This is hopeless.*

The district attorney had a few token lawyers present and the courtroom was mostly empty.  When the proceedings started she felt a sense of abandonment, despair and worthlessness.  She wasn’t listening and did not notice when there was an interruption at the DA’s table.  The only thing on her mind was how much of a failure she turned out to be.

“Your honor, it has come to the DA’s attention that a motion has been filed to drop charges.  The victim has stated that he never requested charges to be filed and that the purported crime occurred on private property, his property, and he does not want to proceed with a trail.”  The DA was already carrying a backload of cases and if the victim was alright with this, then so were they.  Kacy was free.

As she left the courthouse she heard, “Excuse me, are you Ms. Carter?” An older man, someone she’d never met before, stood at the top of the steps with a lopsided grin on his face.  She saw something she’d never experienced before, his necklace was glowing a bright blue, the shade of her eyes.

“Are you him?” she asked, reaching for her stones.

"[WP]""I was wrong. Today, everything lives.""",GV_Solid_Snake,"After five days in line I finally made it to the antechamber of the Godhead. The vestibule was sparsely decorated: on the walls, a couple forgettable paintings; in the corner, a potted plant in a tall floor vase; in the center of the room, a buffet table picked down to scraps. It was not the ornate chamber I'd envisioned for a figure of such resounding and terrible authority. 

Many chairs skirted the room, all of them filled with petitioners. Sorry faces looked back at me wherever I glanced. They too were here to plead humanity's case. I could not glean a hint of optimism in the bunch. I left my information with a chamber host and found an empty seat. I had no watch with me, so I wasn't sure how long I'd sat before my name was called, but it was enough time to observe two dozen people enter and leave the Godhead's chamber—maybe two hours. I did not observe a single look of hope on any of them.

The host called my name twice before I worked up the nerve to stand. A tall man draped in simple brown linens walked me to the chamber doors. ""Good luck,"" the man whispered in my ear before he pushed the double doors open enough for me to squeeze in.

I walked into a room of stone as the doors closed behind me. The room was even less ornate than the antechamber. A lonely throne stared at me from the end of a well-worn rug. The throne was empty.

""Hello?"" I asked the room, a tremor in my voice.

There came a sudden vibration to the air. A speck appeared before me on the throne. It grew into a quivering sphere of liquid, suspended in the air above the seat. The hideous ball continued to increase its mass, growing and morphing into a blob the size of my head, the size of my torso, now the size of me. The gelatinous grey mass distorted into something resembling a humanoid face. Leathery flaps like window shutters lifted to reveal slitted, bright yellow orbs: the eyeballs of some unholy thing. A line formed which opened up to become a giant, sticky maw. When it spoke the words boomed in my head like fireworks.

""And this is humanity's next savior?"" the Godhead roared.

""Actually, I am not,"" I said, awestruck at this otherworldly thing.

The thing laughed, sending splinters of pain down my body. ""Tell me then, non-Savior, why should I spare your world?""

I cleared my throat. ""Well... You shouldn't.""

The great eyes narrowed. There was a short pause before it roared, ""Did I hear you right, mortal human?""

""You did,"" I said. ""You should not spare this world.""

""Where are your primitive displays?""

""I'm sure you've seen all the art, heard all the music, listened to all the tales you can handle. I'm also sure you've been shot at, blown up, frozen, weathered any number of attempts to assassinate you...""

The huge, deformed face laughed mockingly. ""The crude work of pests.""

""Right. And our science is—""

""Your science is laughable! You are like ants trying to divine the face of God.""

""Our religions—""

""Embarrassing fables. *I* am your God now!""

""So, we agree that humanity has nothing to offer."" I placed a hand on my hip. ""Tell me, how does this end?""

""I have but to think the word, and your world will be gone.""

""Hmm. You've been here for a while now, have you not?""

The blob of a face raised high into the air. ""My time is infinite!""

""Two of our years, correct?"" I put in quickly. ""And you have yet to destroy our world.""

The Godhead simply hovered, saying nothing.

""You have yet to do anything but eat us.""

""I have revealed my power!""

""I mean, you ate a couple of our leaders... here, in this room...""

The Godhead's mass rumbled with a low bass-note *mmmmmmmmmm.*

""So, go ahead. Destroy our world. Reveal to us your true power.""

""I will!"" Voice filling my head like echoing explosions. ""So help me I will!""

""Great. Go ahead.""

A long pause. ""I will destroy all of you! Your entire world is doomed!""

""We're doomed. Make it happen.""

""I'll simply think the word!""

""I'm not stopping you."" If I wasn't completely sure before, I was sure now: this being was dangerous; it was hungry and horrifying; frighteningly alien. But it was not God. It was powerless to end our world.

""If I do not destroy your world, it is only at my whim.""

""Really, I'm scared for our species.""

""I could eat you!""

I took a shy step backward. I'd almost forgotten that the Godhead certainly could. ""You have not eaten anybody since the first day."" 

""You humans are not all that palatable. But I'll do it!""

""Look, I'd rather you destroy the Earth. Get it over with. End it right now.""

""I... have made my decision.""

""Have you? Are you going to *think the word?*""

""I have *decided*... to spare your world. This Earth is but a feeble mote. It is not worthy of my awesome power.""

""No, please. Don't leave. Destroy us!"" I thought maybe I was overdoing it. But I was wrong.

""No, hapless mortal. I will not do as you wish. I will do as I please. Today, everything lives.""

With that, the amorphous globule of a face shrank into nothingness, leaving me alone in the cold, empty room.

I made my way out of the chamber, giant smile etched into my face. Dozens of faces looked back at me. ""I have vanquished the Godhead,"" I told the room. ""Humanity is safe.""

It took some time before I was believed.

From there, you can see the whole glen - the dry river bed winding down to the valley mouth, the barefoot children playing with bales of barbed wire, the scree-covered hills bearing the withered corpses of the heather that once grew there with a kind of long-suffering acceptance.

It's there too you'll find Mirne MacInnes, sitting in her usual chair with her usual pint of piss poor beer. She'll grin at you, toothless, and motion for you to sit at her feet. You'll be nervous, anxious. You'll want to speak, to make your purpose known.

But old Mirne knows why you're here. They always find their way to her eventually, you see. Day after day recruits and children too small for their workboots and the sick with hours to live make the climb through the glen to her perch like clockwork.

It's not your fault, kid. You've not been with us long. But interrupting Mirne MacInnes will get you more than a skelp on the ear, I can tell you that.

Best to haud your wheest and wait for her to begin. She tells everyone the story their heart needs. Your story's going to be different than the story she tells to a dying man. You're not dying, are you?

You see, old Mirne is the oldest woman in Scotland. Hell, there's scouts who'll tell you she's the oldest human left on the whole island, maybe even the oldest past New Hadrian's and the Big Wall. You're younger than me, and you probably think I'm pretty old, but with as much experience as I have I still can't remember much from before the war.

Mirne can.

So, back to your walk up through the glen. You're sitting quietly at her feet, fidgeting and moving your hands through the dust. Maybe you're wondering about the feel of grass, or what a river sounds like. She can't tell you that. It's a subjective thing, she says. You'll see for yourself when you get to heaven, she says. She still believes, you see. She's lived long enough that it's the only thing she *can* do.

But she'll tell you of the day the war started, which is what you want to know.

Back in those days, she'll start, nobody really believed fighting would break out. Nobody had the energy, everyone was glued to screens and connected to each other without ever having to speak face to face. Well, I say everyone.

The old biddy's face is going to grow grave, here. She'll look older than her already expansive years. She'll take a deep breath and a swig of her pint, and continue.

There were some in their shiny towers down south who thought we'd rise up if given half the chance. They were clever, sure, and resourceful. And they had so much more than you'll ever know. Just houses and rooms piled with gadgets and tech that'd wipe this valley out in an instant if they were here today.

They had this plan, see. They were going to stop us before we'd even begun. Back then there were country borders, like an invisible line where the Big Wall is, and more lines besides. The clever ones wanted all of us beyond the line gone, neutralised they'd say. And more than us, there were others. A big island across the sea, flat and green, that had given them trouble for a while. And a little place to their west - it had its own language you see, and that made them nervous.

These clever clogs down there weren't soldiers or generals or bandits. They weren't even teachers. Their brains were going to waste and so they warped their knowledge into something that would get rid of all their problems.

You might have to wait a while here, as the old lady will get visibly upset. You know something bad happened, and you know she was there, so for God's sake be civil and wait until she speaks again. I didn't train you to be rude. When Mirne continues, she'll tell you what they did.

These men, they had access to all sorts of stuff. Chemicals and flying machines and sicknesses. There were rumours about what they were doing, stories about their research, but nobody believed them. There wasn't going to be a war, what cause would they have to hurt us?

And then the rain fell.

You know about rain, right? Before all this, it was just water. Precipitation that made it fall from the sky. That day, we went about our lives as usual. Rain had never hurt us before, and nobody worried. That evening, though, things started to happen.

People got sick, plants and animals burned away like someone had set them on fire. Buildings that had stood for centuries crumbled. Those who had been out in it the longest grew strange and aggressive, and eventually began to attack those who were still sane. There's some karma in it - the rain spread south and hurt those who brought it upon us. But human suffering was never any sort of consolation.

And now you know, boy. How they took our land and in one day brought it to its knees. Your training's done.

You'll go back down through the rows of tents, past the dry river, right by the fires and the recruits and the barricades, to the commander who sent you here. You'll look into your eyes and there she will see the burden or knowledge, and she will hand you a weapon.

I'm not going to say you'll be fine, because most likely you'll die on a battlefield somewhere. But when you go, keep in your heart the story of when the rain fell.",kiradax

Mrs. Stanley, an elderly woman nodded. ""Call him on the PA. He left his cell phone charging behind his desk.""  Her shoulders, covered in a deep maroon shawl couldn't conceal her shaking. Looking into the distance, I could tell what was going through her mind.


I handed the last candy to a sweetheart of a boy named Mitchell. His face soured. ""I don't like lemons Ms. Small.""


I smiled, replying quietly. ""When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Now sit tight while we get everyone umbrellas!""  He squealed at the mention of going outside.  Little did he know the dangers of rain.


Leaving the classroom, the halls echoed my footsteps. Rapid *clicks* and *clacks* as the heels sang their song.  *I knew I should have worn Wellingtons.*


Passing the other classrooms, the older children were busy being bored, staring into the depths of their phones, listening to music, the sort.  The younger ones were singing, playing instruments or running around.  I hurried, picking my steps up more quickly.


Reaching the principal's office, I knocked gently and opened the door.  Mr. Xi, was sitting behind the receptionists desk filling out forms diligently.  Even as I closed the door, his hand did not fail.  If nothing else about the man failed, his comb over certainly did.  A stoic man, but a man out of his time.


""Sir?""  I opened.  ""Martin hasn't come back yet, Mrs. Stanley wishes to use the PA to call him.""


The pen kept on writing. ""Mmmmhmmm."" He sounded out.  ""And what good will that do?""  


Finally, putting the pen down, he looked up.  For a balding Chinese man, he certainly looked odd with rose colored spectacles.  ""If he is still out, all we can do is wait. Calling him will only serve to distract him.""  


""I understand Sir, but we're concerned.  We don't know what to tell the kids anymore.  Some of them want to go home, some of them want to go outside. They don't understand what's going on.""


Sighing, Mr. Xi took off his glasses, laying them in front of him. ""We're caught in a disaster. The superintendent has assured me that the storm will pass.""


I nodded, noting the glint in his eyes. For all the strength and calm that he portray, the glance to his right gave him away.  His tell, when he was unsure of a situation.


""It can't be much longer now."" I turned and left him with that.


I had visited Kansas before, during a tornado warning. But I had never experienced a typhoon. It was bright this morning. I was hoping to go shopping after with a few colleagues, try on another pair of shoes and ask Martin to the movies.


But then the reports came in. And then the rain fell.",imakhink

""You should do it more often.""

""I'd like too, it just doesn't feel right.""

""You have been telling me that I've been awful lazy, maybe my smile is an extension of my laziness.""

""No, I think you're happy.""

And then the rain fell. Softly at first, only a drop at a time, one at a time from each ocean blue eye.

"[WP]""And then the rain fell""",GV_Solid_Snake,"The cars below me are just blurs, like a painter was rushed by life to finish his last piece before his final breathe. I've been on the edge of this bridge many times, and this time ain't any different. 

Nobody has stopped. Not one person has given me more than a glance. What happened? Did the human race evolve into emotionless goal achievers and nothing more, or has fear of failure and shame become so apparent in our age that an average man cannot comfort a stranger. I blame the internet. Everything's a which hunt.

The odd car horn is irritating my delicate ears. They must assume I'm going to jump. I just want to feel in control for once, but I'm on edge, more than literally. It's strange, I always thought depression was some guy screaming at God's awful judgement on his life in the rain while a speeding car granted him peace. But, right here, now, it just feels like i've completed my game and all that are left a dull side quests. Nothing left is interesting or emotionally appealling. 

It's a brilliant feeling knowing you have the choice to just end it or carry on. Oh, rain. I always loved to write, but one teacher always thought I spoke to common with my words. I attempted to change, and I kinda believe I have. If he had written this it would read,

'And then the rain fell.'

He hated present tense. Always complained, drilling into our heads that it was a cheap way to create a sense of danger that anything could happen at any moment. I am very stubborn though. I'd rather die with my belief. At the end of this note I'm going to be nothing more than a moment of news, a selfish man taking the sanity of whoever's car I land on, oh and Jack. That's my name, Jack. 

The rain, my note, the sense of numbness. I won't die with a bang, but with a whimper. My teacher hated me plagarising.

"[WP]""And then the rain fell""",GV_Solid_Snake,"Jenkins sat in the hospital bed and watched the world outside heal. The doctors came and muttered things, the nurses came and gave him things, but all the time he couldn't take his eyes from the window. 

His scalp itched from where the stubble was growing back, the tips of the metal electrodes dotted across the scarred flesh. He scratched at it absently with his remaining hand.

""Good morning Captain Jenkins.""

""Nurse Elizabeth.""

""How are we feeling this morning? The matron said you were shouting again.""

""If a mouse farts she'd hear it.""

""She's just looking out for you, like we all are. I can up your medication if you feel you need it.""

""No.""

""You should know the tribunal panel was back yesterday. Doctor Omateo refused to let them see you but if you keep on delaying your recovery they're going to force him to start dialling in your neural interface.""

Elizabeth busied herself about him and Jenkins had lost his gaze to the horizon when he realised she had sat beside him in the chair reserved for friends and family. It had sat empty since his arrival.

""Don't you have rounds to do Nurse Elizabeth?""

""The war is over,"" she said, matter-of-factly.

""Your war.""

""Everyone's war. There are no more front lines, no more skittle shells or dog packs.""

Jenkins smiled and she poked him in his ribs beneath the off-green bed sheets.

""What's so funny?""

""It's skitter shells.""

""I think that's the first time I've seen you smile.""

As quickly as it had arrived, it vanished. Jenkins clamped back down and looked out the window again. In the distance a convoy of VTOLs were banking towards the airbase. He felt the rush of the air through the fans, the heat as he leant out and jumped, attached only by the spiderline that arrested his fall to the ground below. He hit the ground, hard, pulled out his rifle and sighted and pulled the trigger and...

His heart was beating and he could feel Nurse Elizabeths' fingers on his wrist.

""Christ,"" he muttered.

""It was my mistake. I shouldn't have mentioned the war.""

""No. No,"" he said. He took a deep breath and felt the sweat cool against the metal in his skin. ""Thank you.""

""I'm just doing my job Captain.""

""You listen.""

""Pardon?""

""Everyone else, they want to talk. How am I feeling? Is the interface causing me trouble? But you Nurse, you actually listen.""

""There are support groups. Others who know what you're feeling.""

""Pointless. They're hollow men.""

""Then tell me.""

He balled his hand into a fist and watched the skin pull tight over the ceramic plates. A hundred drops behind enemy lines and not once had he felt this nervous. The interface in his skull minimised some of the fear, but now he was alone. Just him and her.

He spoke. And spoke. She never interrupted him or looked like she was bored or agitated. When he paused she passed him water and when he wept openly she took his hand in her own and let him feel the touch of another human being.

The Sun had risen and passed overhead and still she sat with him. He looked at the grass.

""In '41 they started falling back. First time we won something more than a few klicks. Then Jing Pao ordered them to scorch the ground. We'd move into farm land and it would be black and burnt for as far as you could see.

""Ash. Whole crops lost, family homes burnt down and left abandoned and the further we pushed the more they tore it all to the ground. When we reached the borders we hadn't seen a living thing for four hundred kilometres. That's what I see when I close my eyes. Just fields of black. The bodies you can get used to, even when the corpses are wearing your friends faces. But seeing it, seeing what we were capable of on such a grand scale.""

He felt her fingers beneath his own and let go to wipe at his eyes. Sometimes he'd lean over to pick up his cup and realise he was a few fingers short of a high five but the queasiness passed quickly.

""And then we pulled into the outskirts of the last city and we watched as they dropped a few neutron bombs on it. It's always quiet after. All the buildings, the cars and flyers, they're all still there but the people in them are just... still. We sat in the ash waiting for the rads to drop and that was when it happened.

""The rain began to fall. It was warm, the kind of big fat drops we'd get back home in the swamps, and we all just sat there in our armour, feeling it pool around us. And then we took off the plates, and we stripped off the biweave and we just let it wash over us.

""And now I look out the window and all I see is green and I think back to that day. When they all went still and then the rain fell.""

She looked quite lovely today, a dazzling red dress with ruby red earrings, and her blonde hair in waves streaking down her shoulders. Suddenly, without warning and before even sitting down she burst into anger and asked, ""Are you dumping me?"". I was quite frustrated, seeing as I had planned this all for her. She was probably in shock. But she deserved all this. The sunset glimmering in the sky outside our window. The restaurant was empty, I had requested it for her because I knew she got anxious in large crowds. ""I was just taking you out to eat!"" I replied, hoping to let her know that this was because I loved her.   Then she popped the question. ""What about we name her Mary?"" I didn't understand. She was getting a bit of a belly, but I didn't want to tell her because she's beautiful to me anyways. ""You're pregnant?"" I asked, half hoping she would respond with yes and half no. She then snapped into reality and pretended that she had never asked. ""I'm pregnant? Who's the daddy?"" She asked, thinking I would forget. ""Me! I hope..."" I replied, not falling for her ploy. She knew that wouldn't work, so she directed it in a different direction and carried on a different conversation we were having earlier. ""What time do people chat least?"" She asked. I was still shocked. Yes, I loved her, but she should know that she doesn't have to hide it. I was very frustrated at this point, but still remained quite calm because loud noises made her feel nervous. ""What! I thought you were pregnant!"" I exclaimed. I kept trying to keep her on that path, because I wanted to know if she really meant it. ""I thought you were a robot."" She replied, trying to confuse me. She had done it many times before to get out of an uncomfortable situation. All the waiters stayed back and let us do our thing. Some were giggling at us, and some shaking their heads solemnly and whispering to each other. My voice got a little louder as I shouted, ""But I had sex with you! How am I a robot?"" Her next words stopped my voice and made me infinitely quiet. ""I was ingratiating you for amusement."" She wanted an advantage. Just so she could have a little entertainment. The waiters stopped snickering and whispering. My words came out as barely over a whisper. ""So did you ever really love me?"" I asked. I needed to know. My heart was aching. I though we were going to have a child together, I thought this was real. But then she said, ""No, I never loved you."" She had no emotion, but the corners of her lips pulled up in a slight almost unnoticeable smile. I was breaking while she was having a blast watching me die inside. My mouth trembled as I spoke quietly, ""So is this it for us?"" She nodded her head slowly. She pulled up her hand and counted on her fingers to six. ""I don't have a best friend, I have 6 best friends."" She said. That made me feel worse. Why would she bring that up now. Maybe to say a huge 'Fuck you and all your emotions' but subtly. I asked her more, dreading the answers. ""So you don't need me?"" The words flowed out of my mouth, like the tears in my eyes were about to do. But according to society, I was a man and I couldn't cry in public. She broke my heart even more as she spoke, her beautiful voice still music to my ears as she hurt me so. ""You need me, I don't need you."" She said, standing up. Her heels were red, also matching her dress, I had realized. I didn't know what I did wrong. Maybe she loved another. Maybe she's pregnant with his child. Maybe she just didn't like my face, or my hair anymore. I apologised for anything I had ever done. Tears streamed down my cheeks, ignoring the unwritten gender 'laws'. ""I'm sorry."" I tried one last time. I pulled out her favorite band CD, the thing that had gotten us together. Apparently she forgot it was our one year anniversary, and pushed my hand away. She looked me in the eyes, heart like a dagger and a voice like a gun. ""I am breaking up with you."" And we were over. She didn't look down, but she didn't look at me neither. It was digging into my throat, twisting my gut and piercing my voice into oblivion. My breathing went shaky as I told her, ""I love you, still."" Apparently she didn't find it romantic, but she replied with a sharp sarcastic remark, proving to me that she had never really loved me. ""If you love me, speak in spanish."" She stated. Spanish was something she was trying to teach me. I went to her lessons every day, and I learned the days of the week, months of the year, fruits and vegetables for her. Was I just not good enough? I tried my best because I loved her. But, she didn't care. She didn't care at all for me anymore, like she had never cared at all. My reply broke my own heart, words jumbled in my head and my vision became cloudy with tears. ""I'm sorry, I don't know spanish."" I stated. She picked up her white purse that I got her for her birthday, and walked out, those heels clicking on the tile floor. I was left in an empty room as waiters started clearing out. They told me that they were closing. Lights turned off and waiters looked at me sadly as I walked out into the pouring rain of life that awaited outside.

     ""What...? Please! You don't understand... There's been a terrible accident.- I can't remember what happened."", I explained.

     ""I don't have a favourite animal. My favourite colour is yellow."", he chuckled. As he did this, the wind picked up. All I can remember is the humming of the computer in the hospital room, next to the bed. A nurse came in and told me that I was dead.",Green_Ninjaxxx

""No, it's my first time,"" he replied, detached. 

""Oh, well, we've all had our first time around. I've been coming here for some ten years."" I offered him a good-natured smile to ease his tenseness.

""I like giraffes. Do you have a favorite?""

""I'm quite fond of one over there,"" I said and pointed to a large giraffe who was in the process of nibbling off some leaves from a tree across the exhibit. ""I believe the zookeepers named her Rhonda. It's quite hard to tell them apart, though.""

""House music is electronic music, and is very similar to dance or trance music,"" he swapped the topic.

I paused, unsure how to respond. His eyes finally met mine; they held a stony glare that I couldn't shake. 

""You do know that this is the Baltimore Zoo, right? I don't think any rave would be happening at ten in the morning."" 

""No, really low light levels stimulate sleep hormones,"" he droned.

""Well, it's good that we have some sun for once today. I've been getting tired of all this incessant rain,"" I guided the conversation back to something natural. 

""Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away."" His eyes wandered off back to the giraffe exhibit and his body turned defensively away from me. He seemed lost in reverie.

""Oh, are you working through something traumatic?"" I probed awkwardly.

""Not really. Matt and Mello haven't died yet, so I'm not grieving as of right now."" He fished out a worn leather wallet from his denim pocket and opened a flap to reveal a picture of two cats.

""I see... I hope they continue to have good health?"" I peered at the picture in confusion.

""How do you define health, personally?"" He stuffed the unfolded wallet back into his pocket.

""A quality mental and physical state of mind,"" I quipped.

""That's a great self-image. You'll get great things out of life with an outlook like that,"" the mysterious man smiled. He had a piece of kale wedged between his canine. 

I cringed subtly and deflected my gaze away from his offending mouth. I spotted my wife and kids not too far away, feeding the giraffe I fancied from a small platform. 

""I, mean, I don't like to brag, but I have a pretty good life going for me right now,"" I remarked as I watched my wife lift my youngest son near the animal.

""By saying that, you're just making people know you do.""

I grit my teeth from his smug tone and whirled around to give him my best look of irritation. He was wholly unphased by it.

""Oh, well. Thank you for your optimism before shooting me down?"" I asked rhetorically. 

""What do you think you would do if I pulled you out of virtual reality, and you were able to do anything in the physical world,"" his eyes wandered off once again.

""We're in the physical world as we speak,"" I tested, nearing the breaking point with this man.

""Is there a physical world? Perhaps it is all a simulation within a simulation?"" He began to wave his arms around mystically.

I concluded this man was under the effect of some psychedelic drug and answered: ""I think I'm going to go look at the lions now. Goodbye.""

He ceased his action and went back to a rigid statue that enjoyed the view of the giraffes. I wasn't even sure if he was breathing as I turned to walk away and regale my wife with the weirdest experience I've ever had in Baltimore.

It all started this morning when Daniel assaulted a pedestrian upon them uttering his famous internet catchphrase ""DAMNNNNN DANIEL"" which we believe caused Mr. Lara to snap and beging violently attacking the individual. 
From there Daniel proceeded to hold up the surrounding convience stores with a firearm hidden inside his shoes. His technique consisting of him self waiting for the cashier to say ""DAMNNNNN DANIEL"" in which he would respond by pulling the gun out of his shoes to say ""BACK AT IT AGAIN WITH THE WHITE VANS"".

After robbing several stores in this manner, police arrived at the scene and when Daniel refused to cooperate with the officers they were forced to arrest him. He is currently being held until trial. Here with us today is the police chief whose unit was responsible for arresting Daniel. ""Officer, do you think this behavior is excusable? Is it possible that Daniel will be released anytime soon?

Troubled as he was with his new job, relationship, and life in general, he just wanted to relax. His past, so vivid like it was yesterday, brings up the old ""Damn Daniel"" joke. He decides that he wants nothing to do with it anymore. Inspired by his fervor, he decided to make a short video and placed it on his page. 

""I have had enough of these jokes. These..."" he seems visibly disturbed ""Damn Daniel jokes. I've had enough! This is the last time I want to hear it or see it, out of my own god damn mouth! I've had enough! This has gone on for THREE years now! Three! Memes don't last this long! It dies out after two weeks at most! Please, for the love of god stop. I'm at my wits end here.""

Tired after his small short rant, he takes a nap on his single mattress. ""Damn Daniel."" He wakes up in a cold sweat. ""Jesus Christ! Gah!"" he reaches out for the vodka bottle on his side table. His phone buzzes. It's a notification on his video.

""Damn Daniellll!"" it read. He dropped his phone on the ground. Visibly shaking, he attempts to pick it up. There was no notification on the phone. The phone buzzes again.

""BACK AGAIN WITH THE WHITE VANS"" Daniel stares blankly at the phone. He wants out, to escape from this hell he made for internet popularity. The phone rang. He threw it on the ground, cracking the screen in half, still ringing and crawling on the floor. 

Backing up against his bedroom door, he walks into the living room. The TV still runs. He decides to watch some TV to distract himself. The talk show host on the badly lit fluorescent TV screen was introducing a new guest. ""Now, introducing our guest of honor! The one who in the matter of three days, yes, three, became an internet sensation! Please welcome, Damn Daniel!"" 

""Oh my god - What the hell? W-what? No, no this isn't...""

""Daniel, are you alright bud?"" The host asks while the crowd laughs.

""Who are - where am I?"" 

""Back at it again, Daniel?"" The crowd bursts in laughter.

""This isn't funny. Where am I?""

""Damn Daniel! Don't you remember anything?"" The crowd engulfs with laughter. ""You're on the Tonight's Show!""

Daniel stares blankly at the monitor. The monitor, badly lit, shows him on the stage along with some guy. He remembers that he is on set, talking about his success as the creator of the Damn Daniel video. 

""So Daniel, after all your success so far, how do you feel?""

""I want to die.""

[WP]A Bounty Hunter who's good at doing disguises gets a bounty to hunt one of his disguises.,Pancakeman2331,"This needs a lot of edit, but I'm in a hurry. So here goes:

----------------------------------------------

She's beautiful. The most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life. This may sounds so cliche, but it's true. And now she must die, and it's all my fault....

I saw her for the first time on the riverbank of the Rhine, through the lenses of my binocular, as I perched atop the Marksburg Castle. I nearly lost my target because of this vision of beauty, who strolled into my line of sight as I sighted the motor cavalcade of the fugitive warlord Michel Lefevre. I barely caught the car switch because I stayed too long on that oval face. Imagine what disaster would've followed my failure. But I did get him, and the Interpol task force got an empty limousine. So all is well.

But she haunted me so... She lurks at the corner of my dreams, always presence but never reveal herself, taunting me. It took a while before I finally got over her. Or so I thought.

The second time I saw her, all two years later, she was sipping coffee on a corner cafe in downtown Manhattan. I nearly sideswiped a bike courier that time. Would've ruin my day if I had to clean up the paper trail of an accident, even with my solid alias. I did have to entertain a police officer, nodding through his lecture about safety riding. And I lost her, she was gone by the time the officer was done. I nearly kill for free that day.

They say third time's the charm, and so it was. Her name was Siobhan O'Faoláin. I finally figured that out after I saw her again a year later, just two streets away from the last time. She had an apartment in Lower Manhattan, which she shared with a cat named Tabby... and a lover....

The thought of killing that man had crossed my mind, but I figured: then what? Relocate myself to Lower Manhattan, get a new identity, and arranged to somehow get into her life? Technically, I have all the skill to make it happen, it comes with my skill set as a hunter of men. But, again, then what? I decided it was more than this little cat can chew. So I left.

But the longing remained....

And so began my 75th disguise. Mary MacCauliffe, or as I called her, Mad Cat Mary. A brown-eyed ginger-haired femme fatale. And it was a fatal mistake. Well, that and a lot of things I did afterward.

Mad Cat Mary killed 5 targets, high-profile high-society men and women. Apparently, fantasizing her as my partners in crime instead of merely another disguise made me sloppy. To make long story short: one of Mad Cat Mary's target's people managed to get a picture of her and (should totally be unrelated but unfortunately not) they somehow tracked one of my visit to Manhattan, one of the visits where I would admire her from the distance. They thought she (I) was Siobhan, and they hired me to kill her (me). As my mentor used to say: it's a cluster fuck.

And so here I am, in an abandoned plant outside of Manhattan, where the final showdown between Mad Cat Mary and Silver Shadow (that's my primary identity, have I mention that?) will take place. One final cast of fate, but the die is already fixed. Tonight, Siobhan O'Faoláin aka Mad Cat Mary must die.

She's lying on the floor, bound, gagged, and blinded. I grab her collar and take off the black bag that cover her head. I must see her for one  last time. And she must see me. Perhaps she will understand. So we look into each other's eyes.

One minute passes. Two. Nothing but an uncomprehending look from her red shot eyes. Perhaps it's just me trying to grasp at straw. And so the black bag goes back.

All that is left is to finish my note, before we wrap this up. And so it goes:

""Now you see, Siobhan, why this is is the only way. I wish there is another, but there is none. The people I work with will not forgive failure. So Siobhan O'Faoláin/Mad Cat Mary must die. And yet, Silver Shadow must continue her life and misdeeds, otherwise somebody may figure something is amiss. That's where you come in. As I will be buried as Siobhan O'Faoláin, you must live as Silver Shadow. I know leaving your old life must feel like a death sentence, but at least you can live a new one, or at least as new as my hand me down can be. I hope you can forgive me, forgive my longing for you. Forgive my love for you. Yours truly, Lily Oswald, otherwise known as Silver Shadow.""

I sign the letter, seal it, and hand it to my mentor, who accept it with a disapproving look on his face. But he knows me better than to argue my decision. Not that he hasn't try, but he know better than to try to change my mind in the last minutes.

""Take care of her like you took care of me,"" I say. He says nothing. He only pockets the letter and draw his knife, the twin of the knife I have in my hand.

""One last dance, Master,"" I say, shedding a tear I never shed before. ""Make it convincing, yeah?""",AjiMundi
[WP]A Bounty Hunter who's good at doing disguises gets a bounty to hunt one of his disguises.,Pancakeman2331,"""If I ever see another snot-nose kid stick his gum down here, I'm gonna smack its face so hard you'd think he'd been cryin'.""  Shoe in hand, En scraped at the stubborn, gelatinous sugar rock clinging to the Formica underside of the table. 
 
The smell of pizza grease and candy, tinged with a hint of stale vomit, wafted into En's tiny, shadowy workspace.  His sockless right foot jutted into patrons' paths, who each gingerly stepped around it much in the same way you'd walk past day-old roadkill.  ""Hah, gotcha, you little bastard!""  The grayish pebble fell noiselessly into En's waiting palm.  

A nasally, high-pitched voice interrupted the din.  ""Hey Jimmy, you done down there?""

""Yes, Francis, I'm just takin' a nap down here on this sticky-ass tile.  Wanna join me?  We could cuddle.""  En tapped his shoe-tool on the floor invitingly.

""Yeah, good joke there, Jimmy.  You wanna get outta there, someone's here to see you.""  Francis smacked the table with the heel of his hand.

En slid the shoe back on his foot, banging his knee, seething and cursing under his breath.  He slid himself out as if he were a mechanic sliding out from beneath a car.  An ugly mechanic.  

En's face was square, wrinkled, and tired.  His mouth had purchased real estate in his cheeks years ago, and his brow was distinct and hairy, like a lazy homeowner's property line.  His eyes, deep-set and blue, caught everything that passed in front of them.  His body was broad to match his head, and his hair was the color of a dirty pair of khakis.  

""C'mon, big guy; this guy must have your number, he called you 'James' and everything.  He's sitting at the Grown-Up Gallywaggle,"" Francis said as they walked.  En more of hobbled.

En rolled his eyes.  ""Just call it a 'bar,' Francis.""

Francis ignored him.  ""He's at the end over there.""  As a party of two parents and three young kids passed, Francis broke away from En, resuming his duties.  ""Thanks so much for visiting Fun and Family Fiesta!""  

The Grown-Up Gallywaggle served ""fun-time"" beverages to the parents of kids who, if left to their own devices, would literally have chosen anywhere else to go on a Saturday than Fun and Family Fiesta. The arcade games' repetitive dirges echoed around the Gallywaggle, whose sole occupant was hunched over a plate.

En cracked a smile. ""What's good, Ess.""

Ess didn't look up.  ""The pizza's not bad, En.  You ever had some?""

""I've had shits prettier than this pizza.""  En grabbed the squeaky bar stool beside him.  

""Don't oversell it, En.  A good cover that also involves pizza?  That's the dream, isn't it?""  Ess, a man perhaps fifty but with the spry bearing of someone half his age grabbed a handful of thin napkins from a dispenser on the bar.  Ess's mouth had a last, big bite of pizza in it.  He reached in his jacket as he chewed, removed a plain white #10 envelope, and plopped it down in front of him.  ""Got a job for you.  Paying top dollar for this schmuck.""  Ess picked at his fingertips with a wad of napkins.  ""This is the big one, En.  Guy's got a rap sheet as long as the Gallywaggle.  Priors in aggravated assault, possession of heroin with intention, and, you're not gonna believe this, but he held up an antique shop in Ann Arbor while trying to steal a Buffalo nickel.  Turns out the old broad kept a .22 beneath the cash register and put a pellet in his knee, and that's how they caught him.  Skipped bail three weeks ago.""  

En's knee ached.

""Bet it was a fake.""

""What?""

En grabbed the forgotten crust on Ess's plate and took a dry, flavorless bite.  ""Most Buffalo nickels out there these days are tin and nickel, you know, like the actual metal.""

Ess took a beat.  ""No, I...I didn't know that.  Not sure I'd want to cross the guy who held up a 73-year-old for a bottle cap.""

""Works out for you, then.  What's it pay?""

Ess gestured towards the envelope.  En reached in and felt several crisp paper bills.  He peeked in the envelope, and even in the dim neon lights of the bar, he was able to count dozens of $100 bills.

""Twenty-five?""

Ess stood.  ""And another twenty-five once you book him.""  He patted En on the shoulder.  ""You got a week, or we'll expect the advance back.""  He walked past En, making for the brightly-lit emergency exit door on the far end of the bar.  ""Should be easy to find.  Bounty says he's a big guy, six feet, two-eighty.""

""Like me?""

""Yes, James.  Just like you.""  He pushed on the door, but no alarm sounded, and he was gone.

The Gallywaggle was deserted.  En sighed.  He reached into his pocket and gripped a small, thick coin.  He pulled it out.  It was as heavy as a quarter but half the size.  He put the coin to his teeth and bit it.  It didn't bend.

""Hey Jimmy, some kid just yakked up in the Ball Bounce Bonanza.  You got this one?""

En slid the nickel back in his pocket.  ""Sure, Francis.  I got it.""

[WP]A Bounty Hunter who's good at doing disguises gets a bounty to hunt one of his disguises.,Pancakeman2331,"A strange feeling washed over me as I stared in the mirror of my hotel bathroom. The face looking back through the cracked glass had become so familiar, so comfortable. 

I suppose that was the problem.

Eyes closed, I felt the ripple of change across my features, and when I opened them the face in the mirror was someone new, some surly stranger. A salt and pepper beard could only do so much to hide the scars and wrinkles lining this new, old face. The brow had a hateful cast to it, had spent too long furrowed over the dark and sunken eyes below. 

I wondered if the face had always been there, underneath.

There was a knock at the door and I opened to let the doctor inside. He was struggling with a large and heavy suitcase. 

""I trust it meets my specifications?""

The doctor glanced at me strangely as he placed the suitcase on the floor by the bed, carefully and with some effort, then turned to me.

""I'll never get used to it,"" he said. ""I don't know who you get to do your face but they're a genius. I'd have sworn you'd hired someone else this time."" The doctor adjusted his glasses. ""I'm almost insulted you get me in for the cold meat. Yes, it matches the photographs and dental records.""

All it takes is a careless pronoun. This is how I get myself into these situations.

""You should already have received your payment."" 

His phone was in his hand as I was speaking.

""And in only three different currencies this time."" He looked up with a smile. ""Much obliged.""

""You know my assets are, uh, diversified. Safer that way.""

""Trust me, I understand your need for discretion. Do I ever.""

""Then you understand that our business is concluded?""

""Sure, sure."" He gave a wave of his hand as he walked to the door. ""I'll never see you again, just like last time.""

As the door closed, I wondered whether it might really be true. There were few enough people I trusted, and the doctor was too clever to be one. This had happened too many times and he was putting too much together.

I crouched by the suitcase and opened the zip just enough for a head to flop out onto the carpet. The resemblance really was uncanny. His combination of skill and discretion would be difficult to replace. I wondered what face the man had worn before his discarded body wound up under the doctor's knife, whether this face had been hiding in him too. 

My face.

They say the reason people often don't like photos of themselves is because it's the reverse of the face they're used to seeing in the mirror, that we don't really like the look of ourselves from an outside perspective. 

To me, it just looked like money.",divusdavus
"[WP] When the emperor dies, his children fight to the death until only one is left remaining as the heir. Unfortunately, the late emperor had 57 children.",Poogmaster1999,"I knew something was wrong before the carriage had even stopped. It had been far too quiet outside for far too long. Looking up at my little brother, I noticed the color had drained from his face. Without warning, the carriage door was thrown open. A barrage of arms reached in, grabbed my brother and me, and pulled us out into the rain.

I was thrown face first into the mud and a noise to my right told me my brother was given the same treatment. Wiping the muck from my eyes, I slowly heaved myself into a sitting position and took in my surroundings. Five figures surrounded us, each wearing the same black armor complete with a mask that hid their face. The carriage driver lay facedown several feet away. He wasn't moving. 

Squinting through the rain, I called out ""Show your face, coward!"" My courage failed me and the plea sounded feeble and weak. The masked figures laughed, but one of them reached up and slowly pulled the mask off. I immediately recognized the handsome man that looked back at me. He had the same jawline, the same pointed nose. But his eyes were different. I had inherited my mother's blue opals while he had been blessed with the cold, gray vision of our father. 

""Coward?"" He jeered. ""Need I remind you that I am not the one running away my sister?""

""We don't want any part of this!"" I begged ""We never did. The throne is yours! I promise we will run away and hide and you'll never hear from us again!""

The hunger in his eyes didn't waiver, even for a second. 

""I've waited a long time for this"" He hissed. ""7 months I've spent hunting down the others. You're the last ones you know. You two were very hard to find, I'll give you credit for that.""

He pulled a knife from his boot and walked over to where my younger brother, my actual brother, was crouched and grabbed him by his hair. 

""No... please..."" My younger brother moaned. He was too petrified by fright to even beg for his life. 

I knew what was going to happen a split second before it did. I shut my eyes, but that couldn't block out the sharp cry of pain, nor the hot liquid that sprayed my face. 

Then my head was snapped backwards as someone pulled on my hair. My chin was thrust upwards, exposing my throat. Despite myself, I opened my eyelids. I looked into the eyes which reflected the steel of the knife and I knew that this man wasn't my brother. No, he wasn't even a man. 

He was a monster. A monster that had slaughtered 55 of his siblings without the faintest trace of remorse. Almost as if he could tell what I was thinking, his mouth split into a grin. 

""Don't act so surprised. Father had to go through this exact thing with his brothers and sisters, and he was only 15 when he survived. Some day, my own children will have the same privilege. It's how we ensure that the strong succeed. That our dynasty has the leader it needs to survive.""

He held the blade up against my throat. The other four masked bodyguards stood motionless in the rain this entire time, observing the scene in silence. The only noise was from the rain, which had increased to a torrential downpour. The warm sensation on my cheeks told me I was crying. It was hard to tell in the rain. 

My final brother jerked his arm and I felt something warm seep down the my neck into the front of my robes. With a slight trace of surprise, I realized it hadn't hurt at all. The hand gripping my hair released its hold and for the second time, I found myself lying in the mud. 

All hail the new emperor. ",pointyteeth
"[WP] When the emperor dies, his children fight to the death until only one is left remaining as the heir. Unfortunately, the late emperor had 57 children.",Poogmaster1999,"I could hear cries from the court yard, and rose slightly from my bed. The red rays of dawn seeped through the large glass door to my balcony...it was too early for this sort of nonsense.

I rose, stretched, and dawned a silk robe before finally mustering the will to walk into the brisk morning air to observe the commotion. I saw a group of soldiers emblazoned with the white rose of the *Le Aurelia* family had broken down the gate and set up camp in my courtyard. Several of my servants had surrendered, and, luckily, no one had been killed. 

I walked down the stairs steadily, as my captain of the guard, Kit, caught me on the way out. She nodded to me in full armor, her famous javelin in hand. I waved her away. It was still too early for bloodshed.

I exited my manor and stood on the cold cobble stone path. I raised my hand, and spoke sternly. ""As a member of the Emperor's line, I demand audience with my brother to discuss the meaning of this hostility.""

I looked on as my brother rode into my house. My brother, Lancet La Aurelia...really we were just acquaintances. He and I were a decade apart in age alone, and we had only interacted at a few occasions that the children of the emperor were expected to attend. As far as I could tell, he was a selfish, self-righteous prick at the best of the times. 

I brushed the dust off my shoulder as he dismounted next to me. He looked me in the eyes, then smiled. Poor insincere bastard, trying to play the hero. ""Dear Brother, Marcus La Omelie, third brother and sixth child in the Omelie line,"" He cried, arms up in the air. I crossed my arms, and gently tapped my foot. I didn't have time his melodrama, and it was still just too early.

I stared at him, waiting for him to get to the point, as he put his hands on my shoulders. He looked me in the eyes, and said, ""I bear horrible news. Our dear Father, David first and greatest ruler of our Empire, Sandeir, has finally passed on.""

I noticed as, in spite of himself, Lancet smiled. However, he quickly resumed his facade as the mournful son, and turned to my servants as I looked up to my room to see Kit staring down at us. I shook my head again, it was still too early.

I turned back to Marcus as he announced, ""Despite our father's death, as Princes of the realm, we have a duty to Sandeir. We must maintain order, so I have come to ensure that you are aware of your duty as my brother.""

I broadened my stance, and finally uncrossed my arms. I finally decided to speak, ""and what, dear brother, is this duty you speak of? Especially given that you have clearly been riding all night to arrive at my home so early with a platoon of guards?""

My brother smiled, ""As you clearly know there are 26 male and 31 female heirs to our Father's line. Well, I do not wish for infighting to destabilize the empire, and allow the pathetic rebels to divide our great nation, so--""

""So you came to my home to end the fighting before it even began? Or was it to merely force my oath of fealty to you at the edge of a knife?""

Marcus raised his eyebrow at me. He did always hate to be interrupted, but I was quickly growing tired of his inane rambling. He glared, saying, ""I would prefer peace brother. I have given all siblings in my family the same choice, and I only raised my hand when necessary.""

""Necessary?"" I glared at him. He had seven sisters and three brothers, all raised together as the *La Aurelia* branch family. We may only be blood, but they were his kin, his allies, and he threw them away like trash.

I had had enough. ""Marcus, you would do well to remember why our Father was able to unify this pathetic facsimile of a country. Through the Gifts, he forced this country's rightful rulers to bow down. It was a disgrace that as Prince I bore out of love for our father.""

Marcus drew his sword, ""Another word, and it's treason. We are a UNIFIED EMPIRE, talk of separate nations is rebel propagan--""

""But if you think, I will allow a pathetic shadow of our Father's legacy like you repeat his mistakes and forge a nation out of blood shed, then you are sadly mistaken.""

Marcus' men drew their weapons, and prepared to slaughter my household staff. Before their swords hit their mark, I pulled on the little source of power I had nurtured since a young boy, and spoke with voice much older than I, ""**You will drop your weapons, and leave this place.**""

In an instant every soldier placed their weapons down and mounted their horses to leave. Marcus looked around furious, ""You...you had a Gift this whole time...""

I laughed a little, nodding. I felt dead, I could hear my heartbeat in my ears, and felt nauseous. I may have been in pain, but having taken away his men, I had humiliated him. Worth every moment of nauseating agony.  I began to laugh.

However, Marcus was not enjoying his defeat nearly as much as I was. He charged at me with abandon, when I felt a sudden gust of wind pass over head, and saw Marcus fall back impaled by Kit's javelin. I looked to the east to see the Sun had finally made its way a decent height. Not too early anymore.

***

Kit met me as I sat in my garden still recovering. She nodded to me, and signed me a message: ""You look like shit.""

I smiled, and signed back: ""Yes, but you better get used to it. If my family is at war, we will have confront more people like Marcus, and they will have Gifts as well next time.""

Kit smiled, unafraid. It was her courage that always impressed me. She was well aware of the Gifts my family possessed. Supernatural abilities passed from my father to each of his branch families. Each family possessing an ability they used to conquer one of seven neighboring nations in my Father's name. She signed again: ""Your gifts will not kill me.""

It was true, Kit was immune to my command; one cannot obey a command they cannot hear. That was why I loved her so much. She didn't have to tolerate me; with her skills she could have done anything. But, regardless of her skill, there the Gifts were not a joke: *La Aurlie* blessed by fire, *La Omelie* blessed by voice, *La Romania* blessed by curse, *La Liu* blessed with life, *La Oman* blessed with sight, *La Katiz* blessed by touch, and the Line of David, the central family, blessed with all. Even the voice, had I nurtured it more, could wreak damage of terrifying levels. My older brother had once shouted forest down. Whatever happened, this conflict would be a messy one.

Without a doubt, if my father had died last night, other families were already making moves. War was coming, and this was a war no one was going to win. Ignoring the abilities of my family, we did have to consider the unstable political landscape. There was no guarantee that the commanders of the military police would even recognize an heir, let alone the rebels who want us all dead anyways.

I looked at Kit again, and signed to her: ""we could run away together"". It was a stupid idea, and I knew that. Even a third son would be noticed, especially now that people had witnessed me use my Gift.

Kit just shook her head. She had killed Lancet, and i had exposed my Gift. We were a part of this war now, and there was no getting out of it. ",Wearethestory

Cheers and applause echoed through the hall for me as Horatio, my loyal advisor, finished praising my accomplishments to the other guests. It was a banquet, and my father, King Nee of Pontus, was hosting his 57 children. One of my brothers, though, was missing. ""Thank you! Thank you! I have repelled our invaders, reduced the taxes on our people, and still expanded the royal treasury!"" I exclaimed, surveying the faces of my siblings once more, looking for a response. Hmmmmmm. Christine and Megan look a little bored. Maybe I'm bragging too much, I think.

 ""But I couldn't have done it without you. You all inspire me to do my best job. I'm happy to have brothers and sisters like you.""

*clap clap clap clap clap* ""You rock, Liam!"" I heard my older brother Robb shout. Laughter swept across the room, with his twin sister Katrina facepalming in embarrassment. Robb always did drink a little too much too soon.....

""And so,"" I softly say, drawing the attention of the assembly to me, and quieting my siblings as they strained to hear, ""I hope for peace and harmony between us all for-""

*Slam* The double doors slammed open as a dark figure entered the chamber. He swept back his hood, revealing dark eyes ablaze with wrath and long, dark hair. Phineas. My eldest brother. That was who was missing. An accusatory finger was lifted towards me. ""But you DIDN'T want peace and harmony between us, brother. You never gave it a chance!"" he roared. Suddenly, the room turned dark, and the faces of my siblings all changed. No longer were they bright and smiling. The food turned cold and rotten, and the banners around the hall became faded and tattered. The faces of my brothers and sisters frowned as they slowly changed into corpses, bearing wounds and tears. Leah cried out in anguish. ""Why, Liam? Did you not love us and cherish us as family?"" Robb jumped up in anger, his torso full of arrows. ""You ambushed us in this hall and murdered us in cold blood!"" 56 voices shouted in agreement. I could hear their voices accusing me, berating me, sounds of wrath and violence echoing the chamber, and then a hush. Phineas, the only one besides Horatio and me who still looked like one among the living, stepped forward. ""Even if it was the law that when our father died, we were all meant to fight until only one is left for the inheritance, you did not need to take such a vile action. We all wanted to defy the law, except for you. And now, I, the sole survivor of your treachery and evil deeds, will avenge all here. Bear witness, my brothers and sisters. Tonight, it all ends.""

Then, the crowd began to scream. ""Liam, we're under attack! Liam, We're under attack!"" and I awoke.

""Liam, get up! We're under attack!""

Horatio was shaking me. ""Phineas has led his troops out of his fortress in one last, desperate assault. We must meet him in battle before all is lost.""

I was fully awake now, fumbling with my armor and weapons.

""Did you have a good dream, sire?""

""No. I dreamt of my siblings. I pray it is not an ill omen,"" I replied.

""Take heart, your majesty. The moment of victory is finally at hand,"" Horatio said with a smile.

""Aye,"" was all that I could muster. My nightmare had rattled me so. But still, I couldn't let that dull my wits. I would need all my skill to face Phineas.

We left my tent and I mounted Bucephalus, my noble steed. My companion cavalry, the best riders of my army, stood at the ready. ""We ride. Break the enemy!"" I cried, as we surged towards the battlefield.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We charged straight towards the center, where I knew I would find Phineas. Tonight, I will finally end his life and rightfully ascend to the throne as the last son of Nee. All the plotting. All the gathering of forces as my brothers and sisters were unaware. All the bloodshed of those I once loved. All would be worth it. A slightly smaller enemy troop of cavalry appeared at an angle, sweeping across the terrain to intercept us. At the head was the cloaked man in silver armor that I was looking for. It's him, I thought. Phineas.

The next few moments were a swift blur. The impact of the two masses rocked the battlefield. I heard the clash of steel and the cries of men. I swung my sword and I spurred Bucephalus onwards. Then, I felt arms pull me backwards as I fell onto my back. This is it. The end, I thought, as I opened my eyes and slowly came to my feet. The fighting had abruptly ceased. I glanced about my surroundings, to the left and right, and I saw that both cavalry troops had gathered around me. In front of me stood the man who had pulled me down. Phineas.

""One shall stand. One shall fall. Let us fight to the finish today, my brother,"" I heard as I gathered my sword in my hands. I did not respond. I flourished my sword and dashed towards him.

*Whunt. Swing. Clash.* The sounds of two swords filled the silence. Suddenly, I remembered a trick I had learned when I was young. I slashed downward, and he lifted his sword to block mine. We engaged swords for a second, and I pushed down, all the while staring at the whites of his eyes. I took a moment to stare at his face. This would be the last time I would look at him alive. And I stared for what seemed like an eternity, though it was but a passing tick in time. Finally, I disengaged swords and dropped my shoulder, slamming into him and knocking off balance. As he fell back. I thrust my sword into his chest, with as much force as I could. It was over. I pulled out my sword, wiped it on the grass, and walked away. The cavalry parted in awe and silence. Sweeping apart and clearing a path for me like the seas.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A banquet again. Laughter and celebration filled the air as my coronation ceremony began. Horatio brought forth the gold crown of my father towards me, and he kneeled. ""Come forward,"" I called out, and he did. Coming to my throne, he reached up and placed my crown on my head, then leaned towards me to whisper something. Suddenly, a sharp pain pierced my stomach. It was the sharpest and coldest I had ever felt in my life.

""Thanks for making everything easy for me, Brother,"" he whispered as he let go of his knife and stepped back. I was paralyzed with confusion and despair.

The whole room gazed on us, unsure of what had just happened. It all felt too surreal, I thought, as my vision faded.

""I am the bastard son of King Nee,"" Horatio boomed across the room, ""and I claim my inheritance.""

No..... no...... it can't be. I fought to stay awake, as my vision faded. 

No way..................... and then the room turned dark.",throwawayiquit

In the centre of the room, the Imperial Prince Khaymar practised press-ups, his sister Lady Aůne watching him intently.

""...and...taking into account...the 13 Bastards of the Tsung Khanate..."" said the Prince between breaths, ""that accounts...for 55...""

He quickly stood up and reached out a hand. Aůne handed him a rough cloth, with which he proceeded to scrub at his thick, brown hair and beard.

""Save yourselves, aye. Your lord father had some great...fecundity, to him."" Mused Thorne, poring over the final cluster of parchments sent to him from foreign kingdoms, boasting claims to the late Emperor's blood. ""A shame he has not the foresight to deal with this before it got out of hand.""

Aůne sighed, as a mother might - though Thorne was far older than her, she having only seen some 27 summers.

""I fear my father planned the whole thing."" She began. ""By spilling his seed among the girls of mountain clans, potentates, traders, soldiers and bureaucrats, he ensured there would be a bloodier fight than even seen before to claim the throne. With his cock, he has forced us to declare war against a host of tribunes.""

""Not all bad."" Replied the broad, sinewy prince as he dabbed the sweat from his earth-hued neck. ""It gives us a chance to show our strength. To bloody these petty princedoms and client city-states so they might learn, once more, what it means to live beneath imperial rule. Strength, and strength alone, will reinforce that.""

""I prithee your pardon, my leige,"" began Thorne, ""but that may be difficult to prove when all six of your sworn blood-kin have declared themselves against you. Your second and third sisters bring their husbands' strength with them - the armies of both Aarjahn and Korapoor. As for your brothers...""

""Oathbreakers and traitors, all of them."" Spat Khaymar, now winding bandages around his hands and eyeing up the block of ice in the cooler, shaded half of the room, flexing his fingers in anger and anticipation. ""I shall see each one of them dead. Their stolen finery will run no less red than that of the foreign horde that come to us.""

Thorne regarded Aůne. The poor girl was known to have a disease of the blood. Though finer than any spring flower, she was in the deep winter of her life, and she knew it. 

""Your own loyalty to your brother's cause will be the spring of songs and poets for aeons, fair princess."" Said Thorne, giving a slight bow.

""Better to have a quick death at my lord brother's hand,"" she said, as though describing some paltry thing, ""than be torn to pieces in the coming melee, or linger until my sickness takes me to the Far Land.""

""Even so, you have your father's nobility. A shame you could not...""

Thorne was silenced by Khaymar's glance. While benevolent, the chancellor knew the young, hot-blooded prince would not appreciate the sentiment of such a remark. He was determined to take the throne for himself. 

He *could* do it, though. Thorne knew that. Zhaymar's proclamations were not the idle boast of youth. His hands had seen to the death of enemies within and without the empire. He was feared and beloved in the same breath. Yes - even with the myriad contenders coming to them, Zhaymar could survive this.

But Thorne had rather wished Aůne might have done so instead. While her brother had trained, roared at his commanders, brought close his allies and drilled the armies, Aůne still saw to it that bread reached hungry mouths; that coin was minted; that diplomats were received and grain was harvested. A shame the gods saw fit to give her such talents, yet so short a life in which to use them.

Thorne ran a hand through his grey hair and pulled up the hood of his habit.

""If I might have my prince's permission...""

The prince nodded, but did not turn to look, instead furiously bloodying his knuckles against the ice with strike after strike, like a tiger in the snow.

""Aye."" He replied. ""You have my leave. And be reassured, Lord Thorne, that loyalty has its rewards. You came to me when my false siblings proclaimed their intentions. You could have scurried away and fattened your purse, as so many advisors did. You did not forget me. I will not forget you.""

""My lord is kind.""

Thorne bowed once more and left the room. Leaving the more traditional concourse down the staircase from the Ullandine Tower, he returned through the Scriptorium and visited his rooms - a modest, sparsely decorated solar with a single window looking out on to vista of the capital. 

Settling down at his desk, Thorne admired a coin, which bore the face of the late emperor, Fhazool the Unbroken. The face etched in the gold was a close match for its subject; sharp, crop-of-wheat beard; a prominent, ever-threatening brow and a proudly born scar on his cheek, won in his own War of Succession. The chancellor flipped the coin and gave a slight smile.

""I think this will all go very well,"" he chuckled, ""dear brother.""",IwanJBerry

""*Is that so? Well then, tell us; How is the son of a traveling merchant going to kill the three of us?*""

Good evening, everyone, I'm Chen Ross, and with me as always is Wang ""The Sovereign"" Lawler, and this...is THE ROYAL RUMBLE! Sovereign, we've got a real barn burner tonight, don't we?""

""You know it, Chen. Emperor McMahon was virile and bore many children, as we can see in the ring right now. I'm being told that 57 Royal Rumble contestants is officially the record, easily beating the previous record of 12.""

""Sovereign, the action is about to start, so we don't have time to go over all 57 entrants. Can you tell us, though, do you have a favorite?""

""Well, Chen, I'm really going to be keeping my eye on Yang Austin. He is the eldest son, and while he might not be as nimble or quick as some of his younger brothers and sisters, he's got experience on his side. I also got a tip from one of Emperor McMahon's former concubines backstage to keep an eye on Triple 艾尺. He's apparently let it be known that he will not be above some shady dealings in the ring.""

""Great insider info there, Sovereign, looks like the referee is ready to start the match, and...BAH GOD, SOVEREIGN, right away, the swords have come out!""

""Where did they hide those, Chen?""

""I have no idea, Sovereign, but it looks like we're already down to...OOOOHHH, that's a Flying Guillotine off the top rope...literally! He just took out his sword and launched himself at his brother!""

""Ha! Took his head clean off!""

""Back to action in the corner now, it looks like several McMahon daughters are trying to gang up on one of their brothers, and they are whipping him like a government ox. I'll tell you what, Sovereign, I'm not sure how much one man can take!""

""Wait a minute, Chen, here comes Hulk Huang!""

""OOOOHHHH, a spear to the midsection...followed up by a dagger to the face! That will take that Jezebel out of the match for sure!""

""I don't think her name is Jezebel, Chen, I think that was Wei.""

""Back to the action as I stand corrected, and...GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY, it looks like a carriage wreck out there. We appear to be down to less than a dozen fighters now, thanks to a devastating Exploding Palm Technique by Yao The Giant. What do you think, Sovereign, was it worth destroying his own hands to take down that many fighters?""

""There's some kind of commotion going on at the entrance to the...wait a minute...GOOD GOD THAT'S EMPEROR MCMAHON'S MUSIC!""

""What's he doing here? He's supposed to be dead!""

""None of his children really know what's happening right now, they're all just standing around and...OH NO! Triple 艾尺 is backstabbing all his remaining siblings! SOMEBODY STOP THIS!""

""It's been a double cross all along, Chen!""

""Triple 艾尺, making a deal with Emperor McMahon himself, the Emperor faking his own death, forcing the Royal Rumble, and now this! No! It's a travesty! THE END OF ROYAL RUMBLE!""

""Well you're right there, Chen, because Triple 艾尺 is the only one left alive now, he'll be the next Emperor!""

""Good God Almighty, this is disgusting! How can the referee allow this?""

""Well, the Emperor might have him killed otherwise, Chen. And, uh...you might want to tone it down a little yourself, buddy.""

But I forgot for a minute, and now I'm done writing and stuff.

I smirked as I watched my troops lead the so-called heroes away in chains. Magic chains, of course. Their attempts had been thwarted, and without them to fight, the world was in my hands.

""You are all so predictable,"" I mocked, laughing.

""You won't get away with this,"" one man assured me. I assumed he was the leader, as he had the biggest hair.

I pretended to inspect my fingernails, as if through my gauntlets. ""Oh, you're right. I'm sure the police will be here any moment.""

""You think we fight alone?"" he asked knowingly.

""No,"" I replied, sitting in my throne. I had made sure to get a throne. Good for intimidation. ""But if you're talking about this backup,"" I stalled, gesturing to a large blast door to my left. It opened, revealing a line of six other heroes, likewise captured. ""...then I'm guessing you don't know about *that*.""

""You fiend!"" someone in the original group shouted.

""Just lock them up,"" I said, waving a hand in dismissal. ""And make sure they don't keep their utility belts. Or magic gauntlets, or echo earrings...""

""Not so fast, evildoer!"" I heard from a nearby exit. Wait...that was the hall that led to my car. Whoever that was had better not scratched it.

""Ha!"" a hero below laughed, ""you didn't plan for everything!""

I watched the opening closely, but couldn't see anything. Was it an invisible fighter? That would be new, but not surprising. I reached with my mind to activate a trap, filling the air around the opening with a special mist; it would slow anything caught in it while revealing its presence.

But a series of quiet grunts from the opening caught my ear. ""What...?"" I said under my breath.

I rested a hand on my head when I saw who had spoken. A withered man in a tattered cape hobbled into the cavernous room, clutching a walker. Behind him, three more senior heroes. I had no ideas what there powers may have been once, but they likely hadn't used them since battling my predecessor's predecessor. The captured heroes let out sighs of disappointment.

""Who dares?"" I asked incredulously.

""What did he say?!"" a balding man asked.

""My God, Niles, turn on yer hearing aid!"" the old lady beside him shouted at him.

""What?!"" he shouted back.

I sighed. This was a strange inconvenience.

""Release them now,"" the first tried shouting at me. The word ""now"" dissolved into a coughing fit, though.

""Chaaaarge!"" the shortest man shouted, hobbling in the wrong direction straight off a ledge. The magic mist caught him, moving him gently toward the ground and carving a small hole in it.

""Be careful, Ken!"" their seeming leader said, finally done coughing.

""I'll be careful when I'm dead,"" he replied flippantly, coasting ever downward.

""Watch out!"" Niles shouted, apparently having turned on his hearing aid. He leveled a pointer finger at me, and I put up a telekinetic wall, just to be safe. After watching him spend far too long trying to steady his hand, I felt a surge of power, and the wall I'd put up buckled from an explosion. I shot to my feet, and searched for him, clearly the truly dangerous one. He seemed to have been knocked back into the tunnel, as the woman was hobbling in that direction with her arms stretched toward something.

I realized something, then; they must have been a distraction. I scanned with my mind, but sensed nothing out of the ordinary. The heroes below were still detained successfully. All the alarms throughout my keep were silent. The number of patrolling troops was...well, it was probably right. I didn't spend that long searching.

The leader must have thought that to be his opportunity. He'd made his way almost halfway down the ramp leading from the tunnel, triggering every trap I'd set up along the way. I took a deep breath; none of them were working. Many of them relied on the hero either recognizing that they'd tripped something and standing still in surprise, or continuing at a running pace. I slapped my head. Next time, I'd have to set up a big boulder at the top of the ramp.

I reached with my mind to lift him off the ground, but as soon as my presence approached him, his struck back. Quite suddenly, my mind felt lethargic and aimless. I cancelled the contact, mostly out of having forgotten what I was doing, before I realized he had impressed his mind upon my own. So, telekinesis was out. But that was fine. I had more than enough tools at my disposal.

""Chaaaaarge!"" I heard again. I looked to my left again, and spotted Ken, finally having gotten back on his feet. He was rushing my way with a fierce waddle, shaking his fists angrily. I flicked a wrist and opened up a pit in front of him; ankle-deep quicksand. Just another trap for throwing an attacker off-guard, really. He wandered right into the middle of it, and somehow kept his balance, though it slowed him considerably.

""Come down and face me!"" the first shouted, standing at the foot of the stairs leading to my throne. I tilted a head at him, and unfastened my cape. As I made my way down, a sword appeared in my hand, and I laughed.

""I normally try to keep my victims alive, old man. But I'm afraid you'll just fall over dead if I try that with you,"" I mocked.

""Stanley!"" the woman shouted, apparently having returned with Niles. I grimaced. Niles was a problem. He seemed disoriented for now, but I decided to put up another wall anyway. I didn't need my full concentration against this...Stanley. ""Use my power!"" she finished, raising an arm about up to shoulder-level.

I glanced back at him, and he suddenly shone with the barest glow. He stood up straight, now, and brandished his walker as a weapon.

""You must be joking,"" I said, swishing my blade through the air. ""You think you can bring me down with a walker?""

""I could bring you down with my bare hands!"" Ken shouted, still stomping through the mud. I ignored him.

""Whatever it takes,"" Stanley said, steeling himself. I reached the ground level, and stood ready with my blade. He lifted the walker over his head, and swung downwards. I held up my weapon to block, but the sheer force of his swing almost made my arm give out, and I was forced to retreat a step.

""Why, you -"" I said, before he swung again. And again. I didn't continue to buckle, but his strength was far beyond what I had suspected, and I was actually forced to be careful about how I guarded.

We weren't fighting long, before I heard a ""Yaaah!"" beside me, and a stunning electric baton hit my shoulder. I was able to regain control of my limbs almost immediately, but I took a direct hit on my sword arm from Stanley before I could get out of range, and that had me pushed against a wall.

""Hello, Ken,"" I said with a grimace. He continued walking steadily toward me, baton held high above his head, while Stanley still stood ready to defend a step behind. I brought another sword to my off-hand, and knocked Ken's baton away, stepping between them and to their opposite side.

The pair attacked in tandem; mostly because Stanley timed his swings to counter Ken's random (and seemingly tireless) attacks, but they still could no longer push me back. A pair of old men didn't stand a chance against me, even if I did hold back and spare them. I eventually stepped in toward Ken immediately after one of his swings, and swept a leg out from under him.

The move put me in a bad position against Stanley, who now leaned heavily on his walker. I actually needed to use both arms to hold him back, and I let one blade fade to make that easier.

""Why couldn't you just stay in your room and eat prunes, old man?"" I asked. ""You're finished. You've got nothing left in you. Just give it up.""

""And let people like you tell me how I'm gonna live?"" he asked. ""Never.""

""Yaah!"" Ken shouted suddenly, yanking on my ankle. He moved it just enough to knock me off-balance, and I had to drop one hand to the ground to stay on my feet. I gritted my teeth, and mustered strength, pushing Stanley away, and stepping back to give a true swing. I was done playing around.

And then I saw it. Niles, at the base of the ramp, under where I'd made the wall, which may have fallen by now anyway. With one pointer extended right at me.

They were all clamouring around him and yelling. Mezmaro's patience was wearing thin. He'd finished off all the young superheroes and dealt with any slightly older comeback cooks, he figured as a sign of respect he'd put all the old and retired heroes to rest peacefully...
Now standing amongst them, he wanted to open his Blaster Glove and finish them all off! But he couldn't. Part of his new branding since gaining control of the world was to be tolerant. He'd gotten his *way* in a sense. They were just so old!

The man with the gigantic shoulders that used to throw boulders was pointing at him again. Neville was the name Mezmaro believed he'd heard.

'An' another thing! Back in my dad we wore our tights tight dammit! We had bulges to show off! I didn't, but I know for a fact the Chunkers *did* stuff his crotch!' Neville said.

Mezmaro faded out again and kept thinking how long until this would all be over. His cronies were just bringing the vans round front, much easier to load them all in that way. Keys started jingling behind him.

'Dearest?' an old lady said. 'May I be a pain and ask you to acquire some tags for me? Tags for keys, that is. See I still have my house keys, I may not have the house, but I got the keys. And see, I like to tag things you know, it's my way. Back when I was Taggerella, I would shut the mouths of my enemies with a ""Shoosh!"" sticker. Oh it was so much fun! And—'

Suddenly Mezmaro was picked up from behind and was being given the bear hug to end all bear hugs!
He squirmed in his captors arms but to no avail. He felt the air literally being crushed out of him. His mind immediately went back to all those summers of him burning ants on the sidewalk, melting army men in the microwave. All culminating in stealing the neighbours cat and using hypnosis, convincing it to commit a bank robbery! He knew how they felt now!

'Y'see! Told ya I could pick him up! Used to pick up boulders y'know?! Back in my day—' 

Mezmaro's sight was going blurry. His ribs were definitely breaking. His heart felt like it was being squeezed in a juice press. All the blood was rushing out trying to pump into another part of his body and hide until it was all over.

'Oh nope. This is not a good time for my arthritis to act up. Can you hear me, sonny? Petunia? Look at his face would you? He's not really doing *anything* any more.' said Neville.

Mezmaro's tongue hung out of the hole in his blue face. He was dead.

'You know what would probably fix him? A mint tea! Let me just go boil that kettle,' said the old lady as she humped away back to her room.

No one thought the battle would last long, none ever had before.  Unfortunately they were right. Sharkman was the first to go, followed by The Barracuda.

The kelp fields were destroyed, followed by the coral reef protecting the city.  Our heros gone, we were defenseless against the attack.  The city was now captive by the madman. A few people tried to escape. Most didn't make it, but I was one of the lucky ones.

""Understood."" He sagenods. My only good eye closes. Almost by itself. And a sigh escapes me. Only after the fighter is far enough away to not hear it. I had no confidence they'd make the night. Rarely anyone ever does. But soon, that'll change. 

The wet ground splashes under my steps as I make my way through the mud and dirt, to a small boat to traverse the lake. Just on the other side a tall, almost carved-like entity stood there. Looking at me. A-Force. His tattered, dirty cape flowing around him. His body hard and strong. As if a being out of this world. But when I look at his face, all I see is a man. A broken, old piece of meat just like everybody else ""I see you're still as optimistic as ever."" He jokes, a half-smile curving on his old, wrinkle cheeks

""Is everything ready to go?""

""Yes."" He responds as I hop on the boat ""All heads are secured. Intel is confirmed. All we need is to green their position.""

""Make sure to double check it."" I toss my cigar in the water, then head inside ""You know how these guys are.""

""Trust me. I got my best guys out there. This one won't slip between our fingers.""

""Whatever you say, slick. All I care is to take this city back right now. Get ready to move us out.""

""Sam?"" He looks at me, asking my name. With the slightest of hesitation, I look over my shoulder, deep into his blue, steel-like eyes. My best friend. Whatever that is. The closest, oldest ally I ever had. He scared me. Every Super did. And he could see it

""What?"" It wasn't something I could control anymore. The fear. The paranoia. The thought that I was standing two feet away from someone who could demolish everything around me in a flash. 

""Be careful."" My gut clenched for a moment, then I nodded, watching him fly off through the clouds. If I didn't know him, I'd say I would be inspired. But right now, I still feel like another dumb yankee having to swim through shit. Should've stolen that jetpack when I had the chance. The boat roars with a dry, sickly hum, and I start off towards the city.

It was a long, dull trip. After the city fell, the rivers started claiming the smaller areas. Neighborhoods as a whole. The suburbs became deep, polutated graveyards filled with water and waste. The smell was the worst part. ""Alpha Four-Three, approaching checkpoint. Can anyone read me?"" 

""Roger, we copy."" The comm buzzes back.

""Any word on location?""

""Negative. Blue-Eagle is still looking.""

That's fantastic. If they didn't find anyone by now, they likely never will. We're gonna have to go in blind. That happens so often I'm more surprised I don't expect it. After docking, the silent walk to the camp built inside a deserted McDonald's leaves me with just the right time to arrange my thoughts. The entire squad was inside, staring at me as I walked through the door. I already knew it ""How many?"" Were the first words out of my mouth

""54. Give or take. 20 minutes ago."" The commander responds

""...Fuck."" 

""Something activated a sleeping Automaton. We couldn't h---""

""Yeah, spare me. I know the drill. Shit."" 

""A-Force is looking for any survivors right now. Some channels are still active.""

""And Blue-Eagle?""

The Commander gives me a straight look, then just shrugs, bowing his head down with a quiet, inner-sigh.

""If Blue ate it... this entire op is off."" Somebody in the room speaks. Rocky Johnson. A former boxer who cheated his way into fame. Yeah. Super-Powers weren't allowed in sports. I miss those days ""There ain't no way in hell we go in there not knowing jack shit!""

My eyes move between him and The Commander ""Right now the benefits far out-weigh the risks of abandoning everybody.""

Rocky snorts ""Yeah, right. Like that fuckin' Automaton? How did that risk pay off? We were told we got this one by the balls, man.""

""We've been getting crushed for months now."" Somebody else speaks up. And then someone else does the same. Angry voices scrambling for meaning and some basic encouragement. We had none. All we could do is wait for A-Force to swipe the place.  

So much for being super-heroes.

"[WP] Every time a person has a negative thought, a bee starts following them around. When their friend develops depression, someone must figure out how to make the bees leave.",aeriespirallee,"We call them ""regretful bees"".

Every time you regret something, one appears. It pops out of the air near you, and buzzes mournfully around your head. That time you didn't make a move, that time you forgot to study. Every time you regret, another one arrives.

Most people swat them. They're slow and loud - they aren't hard to kill. It stops them piling up.

Some people don't. They tend to be older, or to have made a lot of mistakes. In any life, there are things you regret. With more time and more decisions, there are more regrets, and more bees. It stops feeling worth it after a while - more will arrive at some point. No one can fully stop thinking about their regrets.

So the bees keep appearing. More and more of them, as the sight of the bees makes you think of your regrets more and more. 

People who don't kill the bees end up with hundreds of them, thousands of them. A living cloud that reminds you of all the worst parts of your life. People fill up with bitterness and shame, and their world fills up with black-and-yellow insects, constantly circling.  

Eventually, the person just stops. Too many bees, weighing them down. Too many dreary thoughts to keep going.

Then the bees goes to work. Around that stationary form, a thousand little insects work busily. Slowly, a hive forms - a wax shell around the head and torso. The legs remain uncovered, supporting the nest above the ground. 

The regretful bees pollinate no flowers. They do not look for bright colours, and will ignore sugar water if you put it out. All the sustenance they require is at the centre of their hive.

Slowly, over several months, the bees feed on the regrets, sipping a sour nectar from the human inside their hive. The body is slowly dismantled, consumed, and turned into more fuel for the workers, more substance for the thickening hive. Eventually, there is nothing left but the hive, standing on dessicated legs. 

The hives produce the sweetest honey.",Peritract
"[WP] In a world where eye color changes based on mood, tell me the story of someone with a mental disorder.",dragondraems42,"February 28th, 2016. OK. Today's the day.

As the day begins, everything seems to go well. *""That's a good sign,""* I told myself. My milk wasn't sour and I didn't spill any as I poured it into my cereal (even though my hands were still shaking...), I still had plenty of toothpaste left, and then, as the time came and I sat down at my computer, it was still free of viruses.

*""You can do it, Felix,""* I told myself, determined to see this through.

I booted up the computer, loaded up the internet (shout-out to FiOS for that speed though!), navigated to twitch.tv, and began my everyday-but-not-so-everyday livestream:

*""Good morning, Twitch. My name is Felix (as you all know), and today marks the beginning of my new webseries. I've held out on announcing its name until now, because, well... I've held out on it because I want this to have maximum effect. This new webseries, beginning today, is called, ""The Chronicles of A Disturbed.""*

As I said that, I reached up, and carefully removed the purple-colored contacts in my eyes, uncovering what lay beneath. My lenses dropped into the trash beside me. I watched on the screen as my eyes flashed the darkest of blacks, before, like food coloring dropping in water, they metamorphose into a deep, blood red.

I continued (my knees shaking, and sweat starting to pool at my forehead pores), *""I am A Disturbed in our society, and from this day forth, I am no longer ashamed to admit it. I must fight for our freedom. I feel compelled to advocate for the overturning of the laws that bar our country from importing or producing the drugs that assist people like me in our quest for life. I find myself feeling a sense of duty to this cause that has yet to develop a leader. I feel a sense of duty to be that leader.""*

As I spoke, I continued to observe my eyes. I watched as they gradually advanced from their blood red, to a dark, bold blue. In truth, the process was fascinating to me -- Having almost always worn my contact lenses, even I had rarely witnessed how my eyes ""did their thing."" Unlike the ink-blotch-like metamorphosis of their first development, the change from red to blue mirrored the slow progression of fear and anxiety into confidence. I first noticed a tiny spot of blue in my left eye, and then a slightly larger spot in my right. 

Then, as I continued to speak to my steadily growing audience, the spots grew larger. Unlike the first ink-blotch-like change, however, both eyes changed differently. My left eye evolved a blue outer ring that eventually enclosed the red, then slowly snuffed it out, growing inwards. My right eye, however, seemed to ""push"" the red out, by expanding its deep blue spot. Both were equally enchanting to witness.

The most beautiful part, however, was when I *realized* that I was delighting in my eyes. For the first time in my life, I was defying society and what everyone told me I had to be like. I saw the beauty in my condition. It was an innocent feeling -- I felt like a child again -- and I loved it. As I continued to speak to my listeners, both the regulars and the new, I appreciated my eyes more and more. *""I am unique, I am special,""* I asserted to myself.

As that appreciation grew, I was overjoyed to view as my eye color danced into a royal purple. There was no discernible rhyme nor reason to this change, however. It was a sporadic, unpredictable, yet innocent mutation.

At this point, I could almost feel my eyes' color changing with my emotion. My smile grew, and my posture straightened in my chair, and I continued preaching.

Although... The happiness didn't last long. I was far from even halfway through my planned speech that day, when my door was broken down and policemen stormed my house. The last I saw of my eyes on my computer screen, one flashed into the same blood red from before, and the other into a light blue -- then I was pulled away from my computer, pulled out of my house, and crammed into the back of a police car.

I had imagined that there would be a rather dramatic reaction to my broadcast, but I hadn't predicted or anticipated this. When they told me I had been arrested for ""threatening to disrupt the peace""... that was when the hopelessness set in, and, in the window reflection, I saw as my second eye changed from its blood red into the light blue of the first eye. The worst part was when a young girl, no older than 5, walked by with her mother, and, already subscribed to the fashion of our society, shot me as nasty a look as she could muster. She had seen my eyes change. She saw who I was. She was **not** happy.

As I was chauffeured away from my home to the police station though, a glimmer of hope slithered its way into my heart. Meanwhile, in my eyes' performance, the royal purple from before snaked its way from the outside of my eyes, to the pupil, and then around and around until it had completely re-conquered one of my eyes again. This was going to be harder than I thought, but the ball had begun to roll, and finally, people were going to start becoming aware of the struggles of The Disturbed. After all, we were people like no other.

That was when, finally, I could find it in myself, to, for the first time, thank my parents for the person they molded me into. I had cowered for too long in the face of their abuse, and I had spent too long living in the shadow of the condition they forced on me. It was time to take what I was given, and do something with it. I had cast aside my black market contact lenses, I had revealed my true colors to the world, and now, the world would commence showing me its true colors. I couldn't wait to see what the world had in store for me next.

"[WP] In a world where eye color changes based on mood, tell me the story of someone with a mental disorder.",dragondraems42,"I wake up, groggy, mouth dry I stumble into the washroom wondering how I even got home. slowly washing my face I look into the mirror peeling my hands slowly off my face down over my nose and mouth. I notice my left eye is blue and my right eye is red. Feeling my mouth frown and seeing my reflection in the mirror smile I wonder what happened last night. whatever it was it wasn't a good thing.

I struggle as I put my pants on one leg at a time just like everyone else. oh how I wished I was like everyone else. Wishing and praying that today was the day the ban on sunglasses was lifted I pull the cowl of my jacket low over my eyes and head out. Back into the fray. Looking into the mirror one last time to calm myself, both eyes blue.

as I walked outside on this unnaturally warm and bright day out even the fact that my cowl was pulled low is drawing attention. Every window I walked past is see my reflection, I'm wearing shorts and no jacket, almost gallant in my stride eyes red as the devil inside me. Reflection, proud of what it's done.

Looking at a news paper stand, front page, My face, black eyes. hands sweating as I put the money in for the paper. Reading in shock I put the paper down, reflection on the news paper stand I can see both my eyes at different intervals flashing. Blue, black, green, purple, white and red. Acting like a duck. calm on the outside but my feet every churning on the inside I knew what had to be done.

My father always said that the second you blame someone else you are admitting that you have lost control of the situation. I am in control, I did this. Even if it was the devil inside me. It's still me. Blue, Green, purple, white, even black can typically agree, but not red. always not red.

Pulling my cowl low I trudged over to the police station. Everyone looking at me as I entered with my face covered. Slowly I reveal my face. Four Police officers eyes turning the hard green of the law, Two more turning vengeful red. All six of their chairs tipping over.

Handcuffed and questioned. They show me the pictures of the bodies. allowing me to turn my head just enough to see a mirror. Left eye Red, Right eye Black. I feel no remorse, I see my mouth laugh manically as I admit, proudly of what I had done.

Waking in my cell. months later, Red and black no where to be found as I have no freedom to play. Using the reflection of the water in my sink, both eyes blue.

""Margaret was teasing me...she said she knew everything about it and I would never get to find out...""


""Well that isn't a very nice thing to say. I bet she doesn't know anyway.""



I shifted my stance, drawing my sword as quietly as I could from it's padded scabbard. 



""I am ten years old Dad. That makes me almost a man! I need to know!""



""Ten years old huh..."" I smiled. It seemed like only yesterday that I had first found him, bundled on my steps like a loaf of bread. 


""...Yes. I suppose that ten *is* about the right age, isn't it.""


A large, dark shape shifted in the clearing before us, snow falling off of it's back to reveal gleaming scales. 



""So you'll teach me?!"" My son's eyes gleamed with barely suppressed eagerness.



""Of course! But listen closely. Once I start, I won't stop or repeat myself.""



I tensed my legs, ready to spring. ""You ready?"" 


He nodded in affirmation. 


""Then...let's GO!"" 



Together we leapt from our hiding place and into the bright December sunlight, roaring as we ran toward our prey. The dragon woke, twisting its head toward the sound. It opened its maw and unleashed a terrifying ululation to match our own. 



""TO BEGIN"" I roared, sword flashing white in the sunlight. ""A MAN MUST LOVE A WOMAN VERY MUCH."" 


I ducked under the beast's tail, air singing from its passing over my head. 


""THEY MUST BE TOGETHER FOR MANY YEARS FOR EVERYTHING TO WORK OUT ALRIGHT. SO IF THEY DON'T LOVE EACH OTHER, THERE IS NO WAY THEY CAN STAND EACH OTHER FOR LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE A CHILD!"" 



The beast clawed at my face. I parried the blow, sending a talon off into the woods. It roared in pain and frustration, it's wildly flailing tail felling a snow-covered sapling. 


""TO MAKE A CHILD, THEY MUST FIRST LAY DOWN TOGETHER IN BED, HOLDING HANDS.""


It opened it's mouth again, sending a torrent of flame towards me. I rolled out of the way to dodge the blast. 


""AFTER HOLDING THEIR HANDS TOGETHER FOR SIX HOURS-NOW SON!"" I lunged forward with my blade, causing the dragon to snap it's head back. A small, round object flew from my son's hand toward it's face. I ducked and fell backwards, shielding my eyes. 


With a clap like thunder, the ball exploded into brilliant white light right before the dragon's eyes. It roared, blinded. 



""GOOD SHOT SON!"" I ducked beneath the dragon's wing, sinking my blade into it's chest to the hilt. The beast screamed in pain as I dragged my cold steel through its flesh, spilling its guts and sending a steaming waterfall of crimson blood into the snow. 



""ONCE THEY HOLD HANDS, THEY MUST KISS DEEPLY AND PASSIONATELY."" I twisted the blade one last time, and the dragon collapsed in a barely breathing heap, to weak to even roar. 



""Ewwwwwww."" 


I wiped my brow, smearing blood onto my forehead. 



""Nine months later, a heron flies in from the sky and drops the child on the father's doorstep."" 



""That's not how it works...that's not how it works at all"" Croaked the dragon. ""You are a...terrible...parent...""



""Quiet you!"" I swung my blade in a mighty arc, decapitating the beast with one blow. 



""And that, my son...is where babies come from.""

[CW] Make a bittersweet story out of a joke.,temporary-spot,"I knew her only as Mary Ann, though I suspect that was not her real name. She was all at once playful and somber; upbeat yet lonely. She was a whirlwind that blew me away. And she left my life as quickly as she'd entered it. 

I remember her with both fondness and frustration. Have you ever known someone who is such an impetus in your life that you feel you will forever be in debt? What if that person was every bit as aggravating as they were sage?

Me, I'm glad I met her. I'm proud to say I knew her and loved her, in my special way—Mary Ann was something you *experienced*. I will forever miss her.

She was taken too soon. God, fate, karma—whatever you want to call that infinite beyond, that unstoppable force—does not take fairly. It is not something we can ever reconcile as human beings. All we can do is ask questions, the answers to which are complete nonsense in the grand scheme of things. How many nights have I startled myself awake thinking, *Why?* Why, Mary Ann?

The words of the man were melancholy, but had an air of understanding that these were his final moments. However they did nothing to ease the mood of the lone visitor to the man's dismally empty hospital room. The sounds of the gaunt man's shallow breathing matched the electronic beeping of the impassive medical equipment. It was night, car lights flashed through the thinly curtained window, its visage gazing out into the bustling city life below. Rain lightly pattered against the glass frame, adding to the drone of the machines, the breathing, and the hoarse laughter of the room's dying occupant. 

""Listen, boy, you gotta believe this is for the best, OK? Whatever happens after I pass on, I'll be in a better place. Hell, if I can, I'll be sure to haunt you, heh heh."" 

The man's attempt at lightening the mood did nothing to soften the boy's resigned expression. His thin shoulders trembled, as if preparing for the tears that might follow- No, no. He promised he wouldn't cry. 

""I should probably stop with the jokes.. they're going to be the death of me..."" 

The boy couldn't believe the man was making jokes at a time like this. Always the comedian, he was.. The boy didn't feel like laughing either. Tears and joy were not going to be present when the man passed. 

""Could you at least _try_ to find some humor in this? It's like you're dead inside. Heh.."" Horse laughter followed, descending into a coughing fit. The boy reached out to help, but what could he do? Besides, The man quickly recovered and resumed his shallow breathing, although it was much slower than before. 

The rain kept falling, its steady pace droning on and on. 

""I know its raining, I know everything seems bleak, but you can't be under the weather at a time like this. It'll be fine.""

The boy looked up, eyes suddenly glistening. The mechanical beeping increased, and the rain became a steady roar. 

""Do you know why I keep cracking terrible jokes? It's because I want you to be happy. even at a time like this. You know that."" His breathing worsened. 

A stray car light passed the window, illuminating the man's face for a brief moment. His eyes sparkled with a reassuring gaze. The boy couldn't find the words to say anything. He just wanted to tell the man how much he meant to him, but the words simply vanished. 

The beeping of the monitors became frantic.

""Listen. I'll be in a better place, wherever or whatever it is. You'll be fine, OK..! You''ll be fine. But one last thing.. What did the buffalo say to his son when he left?""

The boy couldn't believe that the man's last words were going to be a shitty joke-

""Bye-son. I love you.""

The beeping flatlined, and the boy lost control of his tears.

Walking by grandma's room, this was the first time I've ever heard her mutter anything remotely malicious. I worried briefly about dementia or some late onset psychosis, before knocking.

I heard a the unmistakable and delicate slam of a laptop being frantically closed (the unique sound of being caught looking at something you shouldn't be), a drawer opening and closing, before she opened her bedroom door.

""Mmm? You alright Jay-jay? Want a snack?""

She hastily dug into the pocket of her dark green bathrobe, fishing out a Reese's and a few of those strawberry hard candies with the soft center. I lifted my hand to gesture ""no thanks I'm fine"", but she took that as an opportunity to shove the candy into my hand.

""Ooh, your hands are cold! Your blanket is almost done, look!""

She excitedly hobbled to her desk chair, grabbing a cozy, mostly finished knit blanket.

""Thanks grandma, but I just wanted to see if you were-""

""Oh I'm fine boy, I'm fine. Lil tired actually, might be due for a nap!""

Something clicked.

""Grandma... You were knitting with the lights off and the curtains closed?""

She paused, looked back into her room, looked at me, then let out a rasping hard chuckle.

""Ha! Senior moment! Here I was wondering why I kept dropping these damned stitches... Sorry honey, I think I need that nap. Here, more candy.""

A fistful of mini snickers and I was out, the door closed.

""Sorry, my piece of shit grandson. So dick faces, we've got dirt on Trump, how the fuck do we blackmail him with it? ...nigga I don't see you coming up with a plan. Alright, I got knitting and old people shit to do. Anon is legion, peace out assholes.""

[WP] You have Sherlock and Archer as your two shoulder angels.,280394433708491,"I finished the bow on my left shoe, only to stand and realize that it was noticeably tighter than the right shoe, and therefore like Chinese torture. I stood still for a moment.

*pat pat* *pat pat*

I performed the ol' ""Man's checklist"" feeling for my wallet, phone, and FUCK...my keys are gone. I whipped my head back and forth scanning at a pointlessly hastened speed as I looked for the pathetic two-key key chain, complete with the Menchie's membership club card...you know the *essentials.*

No dice.

""You've made a proper mess of some improper misappropriations appropriately"" said Sherlock fighting a grin. 

""What the fuck are you even saying?!"" bellowed Archer from the other side. ""I can't stand when he does this, these damn scone-munchers and their kryptic word-weaves""

""Who knows?"" I answered quietly and directly to Archer. I lifted up my slightly-less-comfortable jeans and felt around the pockets hoping to blindly strike gold. 

Nothing. 

I looked up at the tiny corner of my laptop to see that I had 5 minute to get to work. 

""You left your pornography tabs open on your browser you bell-end. It takes a toddler's deduction to discover the perverted truth behind the first couple of words reading 'Stepsister Blo...' or 'POV Ana...'. I don't think anyone's assuming that you are reading your stepsister's blog or an anaconda's go pro video""

""Shit!"" I said frantically closing out the browser. Pinwheel...the fucking pinwheel, spinning, mocking me as I expect immediate gratification. 

""This pinwheel is lasting longer than you did watching the porno"" interjected Archer. ""Good shit though, she was really into it, I got some good vinegar strokes in on that one""

""Honestly, you both are degenerates."" chimed in Sherlock. ""Why bother even going out into public? You may as well hermit yourselves in here with your streaming smut""

""SHUT UP!"" I shouted flipping my office chair over finally coming across my keys. 

""BOOM!"" said Archer. ""Under the old strokin' chair, probably fell out from all the motion. Wait, are those cookie crumbs? Do you want ants? Because that's how you get ants!""

""I'll take care of it later"" I said dashing for the door.

""Your definition of 'later' is as loose as the labia on the starlet portraying your stepsister"" said Sherlock.

I had developed a thick skin, but today they were really pouring it on. I stumbled into work, only to pull up and tiptoe to my cubicle, hoping to slip in unnoticed.

""What's the reason today McKinney?"" the raspy New Orleans hooker voice penetrated my personal space like a 20 foot pike. The voice of one Darlene Finklemeyer, my supervisor. 

I fabricated a silky lie that surely with a little charm would get me off the hook, but only the embarrassing truth sputtered out. 
""My keys fell out of my pocket while I was watching my stepsister, and I couldn't find them.""

Collectively I heard both Archer's and Sherlock's palms hit their foreheads. 

""Isn't your stepsister 20?"" asked Darlene. I was both shocked and semi-flattered that she had noticed such an obscure detail of my life, but then remembered that she sees every detail error in my reports. 

""Yea, I was watching her perform"" I uttered nervously.

""Perform? Perform what?"" she asked.

""A...a dance."" I said with a forced smile.

""A dance? A dance in your house I'm guessing...you didn't go to a dance studio to find your keys...right Mckinney?""

""Uhh no of course not, I meant watching her dance on my computer...at home"".

She silently raised an eyebrow. ""Well I'm going to have to write you up for this...you know that right? One more and you get a paycut, and then you're not far from being terminated.""

""Yes, I understand Darlene."" I answered. Every muscle in my body tensed up in the anticipation of her leaving. She clicked her pen and set off for her office. 

""Boy, Darlene could really use some of my Liquid Drain-o if you know what I mean. She's kind of hot, in a Golden Girls kind of way"" said Archer.

""You are truly more and more impressively depraved everyday...both of you"" said Sherlock now thinking hard about our next move.

Everything had gone to shit. The goddamn Quebecers had actually seceded. And violently at that. 

I tightened my grip on my new C8 carbine, the rifle having been introduced just last year, as the convoy slowly moved down the Montreal street. There were dozens of people lining the sidewalks and looking out windows as we passed. My Sergeant, Sergeant Fung turned to me. 

""Ease up Butler. Your gonna spook 'em."" He stated, though he to held his C7 in a death grip. 

""Sarge. Movement, twelve'o'clock high, third story, far left window."" The gunner on our truck, Lance Corporal Amoroso said. ""They've got small arms."" 

""Don't fire unless fired upon Lance Corporal."" Fung replied, fixing his helmet. 

As he was about to reply they shot at us. I ducked down but Amoroso started firing, the heavy beat of the C9 Machine gun making me go deaf momentarily. 

""Fuck me! Open fire Butler! Fire!"" Fung yelled as we all poured fire onto the Quebecers. They all died quickly and no casualties were sustained, thankfully.

""Brown let's get moving. We need to reach city hall and link up with the rest of the unit, then we push on to Quebec City."" Fung stated to our driver. 

He nodded and we started off again, I added one more notch to the side of the truck, adding to the two dozen already there. Each signifying the amount of times we had been shot at.

It happened so quickly. The last thing I saw before the shell hit our convoy was the New York flag flying proudly from the top of an M1 Abrams tank. 

Our APC took the brunt of the blow and we all piled out, our country flag of Pennsylvania stubbornly displayed on our right arm, above our ranks. 

Private Ritche was the first to go, an energized shell the combined government had made before the collapse, landing close enough to her that it incinerated her entire body, armour, helmet.....skin. All of it turned to dust and flew away. 

Maybe that's what I should have done, before the collapse. Gotten across the Canadian border or flown to Europe or something. I could do neither now though. The Europeans were denying any 'American Radicals' from entering their borders and th of Canadians were shooting anyone who dared try and cross the border. 

I didn't blame them. 

As the remains of our unit regrouped near the entrance to some shopping centre I noted we had lost more people than just Private Ritche. 

I saw Corporal Muller laying face down in the street. Specialists Cutter and Morgan were both dead inside the APC, their bodies filled with shrapnel. Around our APC dozens more continued to advance often they were being destroyed before they magnet to unload their Nationsl Guard complement, turning them into giant coffins. 

It was just three others and me left from my unit now. 

""Alright people. Here's the plan. Stark and Ritche-""

""She's dead Sarge."" I said quietly.

""-Stevens then, will flank through this mall and hit them from behind. Jones and myself will cover.""

""Sarge. We've got no AT weapons. How are we supposed to kill that tank?"" I asked. 

""Your only distracting them Stevens. Our own tanks will deal with it.""

It was then that the gunfire stopped. Not slowly died out but stopped entirely. I could see APCs and tanks just sitting there. I saw New Yorkertqnks doing likewise. As I tried to determine why everything had just stopped Jones grabbed our attention. 

""Sarge new orders."" Jones stated, the large, bulky radio on his back denoting him as our radio operator. Damnit. We really should have reserved a Walkie-talkie or something. ""We've just made a truce with the New Yorkers sir. Our orders are to assist them in repelling the Coastal State Federation, sir.""

""Sir? Sir? Major Wilcox, sir?"" I asked as I looked upon the ranking officer for this expedition. 

He was a portly man, with a rather grandiose uniform befitting a Major of the Line Infanty. Around us his men had formed two lines, as was standard with them and their bright yellow coats stuck out like a sore thumb. 

My men, however, were much more hidden. Unlike the Major or his infantry who were standing out in the open, just waiting for a musket ball or cannon shot to ruin their day my Rifle Skirmishers were crouched at the side of the road, their Julius Rifles ready to fire at a moments notice and their brown jackets blending in perfectly with the dirt and mud. 

""What is it Leftenant?"" Major Wilcox asked finally, his voice barely a whisper as he looked on the scene before him. 

""We should report this to Lord Billings sir. He will want to know about the loss of the fifth company."" 

""Yes. I-I agree."" The Major said, his face one of fear. 

There was a reason this was called 'The Abandoned Brigade'. I now know why. 

In front of us, where there should have been a crack company of Grenadiers there were only corpses. 

I knelt down and closed the eyes of one such corpse. The company drummer boy. 

""They never even got a shot off. Every musket's loaded Sirs."" One of the line infantrymen stated. I nodded. 

""Sir allow me to post my men and, if you'll allow it, members of your company to guard the bridge while a runner is sent to the Lord."" 

""Granted, Leftenant. Granted. Heavens I can't look at such vile images any longer."" Major Wilcox, the pompous bugger that he was, excused himself.

After a few minutes of getting my Rifles up to speed a sergeant along with two dozen line infantry came over. 

""Sir we have been placed under your command for the duration of the picket, sir."" He stated in q voice far cheerier than was normal. 

I nodded, fixing my cap and adjusting my rifle, which was on my back. ""Have your men set up in those trenches the grenadiers dug. Fix them up, make them reliable for combat."" 

The sergeant saluted and his men quickly got to work. 

A few hours later, at which time it was nightfall and we had settled into comfortable positions they came at us. 

I heard the sound of hoofs on dirt and many men marching our way. I was standing in the middle of the road, facing the bridge, facing the enemy. I drew my rifle and aimed at the first officer. 

""Rifles! Form Skirmish line! Light company form ranks!"" I yelled as my men formed a staggered line around me. Behind me the line Infanty were far more organized, forming two tight, crisp lines, their musket's ready to fire. 

""Fire!""

"[WP] Everyone gets let off their first crime. Most blow it on speeding violations or petty offenses, but you've saved yours for this moment...",Gamesfreak13563,"Like all perks, the free pass on your first crime comes with some terms and conditions. Firstly, you have to be over 18, big surprise. Anyone below that age would just waste it on shoplifting or vandalism. Secondly, you have to use it before you're 21. That one, to me, is a complete cop-out. The idea is that 21 is when you reach maturity, therefore you should be unwilling to commit any crime at all. So basically, in the three years between adolescence and adulthood, we are more likely to commit a crime, and now you can get away with it.

I'm 20 now, with just three weeks to my 21st birthday. My friends don't know that I haven't used my free pass yet. I just pretend that I used it on a speeding offence, and I got the usual 'that's lame'. You see, everyone tries to outdo each other on what crime they got away with. The ""winner"" in our group committed armed robbery at the local Bank of Ireland. Does no one realise that while he got away with the crime, he got fuck all money?

You may think that I'm planning to waste mine, like the do-gooders who openly throw theirs away, refusing to conform. But no, I have a plan and I've had it since the day I learned of the free pass, and yes, I was pretty young then. Too young to come up with something like this.

I was bullied in primary school...and again in secondary school. The friends I have now I didn't make until college, when I was finally accepted for who I was. So many people chose me as their targets for no good reason. Perhaps because I wasn't the most attractive; I have rosy red cheeks and buck teeth. Or was it due to the fact that I kept myself to myself? I don't know how many times I heard 'it's the quiet ones you have to look out for'. Pity they didn't take their own advice.

The invitations went out two weeks ago. My 21st birthday party. It was my unofficial party, of course. This party promised everything: alcohol, food, live music, even a magician! I threw in that last one for no real reason, to be honest, it just seemed funny. And they all RSVP'd, every...last...one. The people who had wronged me. Not just the ones who had openly picked on me, but the people who stood by and did nothing. My so-called best friend Alice, who was so desperate to fit in that I once caught her laughing as I was beaten. My year head Mr. O'Hanlon. No matter how many times I went to him about the bullying, I was simply told to suck it up.

They were all going to pay.

The party is in full swing. No one knows where the birthday girl is because I'm hiding in the shadows. You see, to get everyone to come, I wrote the name of someone close to them on the invitations. C'mon, they wouldn't have come to my actual birthday party if I paid them to. Believe me, I tried.

Food is served and everyone is seated. As they tuck into their starters, I switch on the microphone and step out into the function room.

'Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,' I announce, a false smile plastered to my face. 'I hope you are all enjoying yourselves.'

Everyone cheers in response.

'Good, I'm glad. You may be wondering where the star of the party is. Well I'm right here.'

Cue the frowns and exchanged looks of confusion.

'You may not remember me...but I remember you. You see, everyone in this room has played a role in the misery that was my childhood and adolescence. The bullies, the useless authority figures, those who pretended to be my friends. I've brought you all here to make my peace with you. The truth is...I forgive you. I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling bitter, that won't do me any favours. I wish you all only the best and I hope that you've learned from how you treated me.'

The frowns are replaced with slight relief, but I can still see some suspicion in their eyes.

'It's actually my birthday, you see. Well...in two weeks time. I couldn't have it then or my free pass would be expired.'

Panic! Some people rise to their feet, preparing to escape. I can almost hear their thoughts. Do I have the place rigged with bombs? Are their snipers hiding in the shadows ready to pick them off one by one? I'm impressed with their assumptions that I want them dead.

'No need to run. I'm not going to hit a detonate button, or anything.'

Another calm ensues.

'What's done is done. When I say I wish you all the best, I mean that...in the next life. I hope you enjoyed the delicious vegetable soup laced with cyanide I prepared for you this evening.'

Screams and cries.

'May you go in peace.'",whatsername25

Most of my friends already used theirs to get out of hit and runs or drunk driving. One used his to murder his ex and her family, but he's an exception to how this rules normally used. Im one of the few people at the age of 25 that still has that magic get out of jail free card left, and i'm going to put it to good use. Last month my boss or I suppose I should say ex boss fired me. Why you may wonder? Because I accidentally parked in his spot. I've been working for the bastard for 7 years now and got fired for that shit. Little does he know though that now his utter despair is my goal. See just to clear things up about this get out of jail free thing, you only need to use it if you're caught. So when I went and stole 8000 tons of uranium from a nuclear facility and got away with it last year that was sweet, I wasn't caught so I didn't need to waste my freebee. Now that i'm unemployed i'm able to use that uranium for my real crime the crime i'm sure to get caught from. Blowing up my boss's home in China, also the surrounding area of his home within 200 miles. Yea i'll probably kill a few million people, but hey he fired me so it's his fault they are gonna die. Since this is my written confession I suppose ill just skip to the good stuff, after bout six months of making the world's biggest most badass nuclear missile(and getting cancer) my one crime was ready. So I hired some Russian Mafia guys to ship my giant crime toy to a small island off Japan and after paying them with 300 pounds of leftover uranium worth roughly 5-10 billion dollars they left me be. Now here is where my fast track college nuclear engineering and aerospace engineering paid off, well and my dabbling in sophisticated coding and encryption. I hacked into Japan's national security database to find their nuclear launch codes, copied one of those suckers onto my missiles motherboard and launched the fucker under Japan's guidance system right onto Beijing. China couldn't retaliate fast enough, and my plan went off without a hitch. By the time I arrived back in America China had retaliated against Japan(thinking that the nuke was theirs since I used Japan's launch codes and targeting system) and decimated the small island country. In Japans defence though they did fire off several nukes of their own targeting major cities in China before basically the entire island was blown to bits. I didn't even reach my house before I was arrested by multiple SWAT teams and brought to a special session in front of the Supreme Court. Where I have been forced to write this confession to my crime of destroying 2 major countries and killing 2 Billion people. Though my missile only killed 50000000 directly.




Update for anyone wondering what happened to me my get out of jail free card worked like a charm, also it was the last one to be allowed and that world law has now been wiped out everywhere. Looks like everything worked out perfectly for everyone.(added bonus, my boss was in China visiting family during all this.)",blackf1r3

Me and Rebecca talk about Mr. Lucas for a while, and about the time he had to have a substitute come in because he passed out while vomiting on the toilet and got a concussion. The kind of shared memory that really bonds two individuals, even after fifteen years.

I'm pleasantly surprised by the condition of her face--she's aged remarkably well. I won't tell her that, it's not appropriate. But I do feel compelled to bring up the overwhelming cross that she's wearing around her neck, since I don't recall her as being religious.

""Rebecca,"" I say, ""what is this monstrosity around your neck?"" It looks like a piece of driftwood, nailed to a fragment of a railroad tie. The chain is, by necessity, thicker than my index finger (admittedly, I have small hands). I don't mean to be rude, but it does seem rather much for good taste.

She says, ""Oh, this. I have to wear this. God told me to.""

I breath in and breath out. I don't mean to be an overbearing atheist, but often I am. If we lived in a world without etiquette, I would have gladly walked away at that moment. But out of obligation, and perhaps out of a small curiosity, I tried to make conversation out of it instead.

""God told you to? He talks to you a lot?""

""Only recently,"" she says.

We're getting to the core, already. She's had some sort of traumatic episode within the past few months, it's messed up her mind, and that's why she's on the same pathetic trajectory as I am, of surveying forgotten acquaintances. I say, ""Well how did that start?""

She says, ""Well, I never used to be religious at all, but I spent a lot of time at the hospital. I was very sick, but God helped me.""

""If it's not too much to ask, what were you sick with?""

""Appendicitis,"" she says. ""I'd been in pain for so very long. I lost a lot of weight (I'd noticed), I felt nauseous all the time. But I didn't think anything was really wrong until it ruptured. I almost died, but they were able to remove it all.

""God appeared to me that night. He was holding my appendix in his right hand and he said, 'Daughter of Eve, you've been cleansed of your sins. You must make a cross, and wear it. And thou shall live a holy life.' I've been wearing this ever since. And I've been so much happier, I really have."" She takes a sip of her coffee, as if to emphasize the point.

I am reaching my limits. I say, ""What kind of God would soil his hands with an infected appendix? Do you know what causes appendicitis? Fecal blockage. It's a strange kind of god that wouldn't at least put a sterile glove on before picking that thing up. Was he wearing a glove? Do you remember?""

She's taken aback. She says, ""No, I uh... No. No glove.""

""Well see, that's why I don't believe you."" I stand up, very much wanting to be done with the whole ordeal. ""It's been a pleasure, Rebecca. And be careful around wood chippers. If that thing gets sucked in, it will take you with it.""

I am surprised to see, as I begin to turn away, not a look of disdain, or hurt--but compassion.

Vertigo is a constant thing that bothers me here in this existence. Out of a seemingly fit of rage mother nature walked in to the see the movie 2012, and walked out with a brilliant idea. If man did not admire the beauty that existed already, they would never now. 

The year was 2018 and we have been rolling for 6 years now, but it feels like 60. Matter seems to accommodate well with the rolling. Even skyscrapers.... (*vomits*)...  

Even skyscrapers just easily sway in the waves. The suicide rate is astronomical what with 90% of people killing themselves. Imagine self inflicted extinction. I suppose thats the only thing 2012 brought with it. 

But of course there are the 1%. It was after 3 months of discomfort that the 1% simply built giant zeppelins and never landed again. They employed smaller zeppelins to supply the giant ones, and soon everyone wanted a zeppelin. Suddenly the hindenburg was a better alternative to death than ..... (*vomits*)...

Im currently working my shift so that I one day can get on a zeppelin but I know the game. They want us to keep working on the ground so that we can resupply their zeppelins with food, and water. Im the leader of the MARXERS which stands for Many Aristocrats Rely on X-rays, and Energy for Reliable Sustenance. It didn't make much sense but neither did this fucking planet. 

My work is ok. Im in construction where it turns out you can build a building that absorbs the vibration, a super earthquake absorption building and this is where most people eat, sleep and shit. Its too bad for miners and petroleum engineers their lives are misery. 

I have a MARXERS meeting right about now, so I can't keep blogging to much but let me tell you this. I fucking hate mother nature. I appreciated its beauty unlike that stupid film director and the petrochemical industry. Perhaps before the vibrating began there were faults in it, and perhaps humans will have to love the vibrating before it goes back to normal. Regardless, fuck mother natur.........(*vomits*)

Jumping jumping jumping about. 

We simply went in

Then we went out.


About the outside tis a strange occurrence

Bouncing of the leaves, and of the trees

Bouncing of the walls and of the halls

Bouncing of the buildings and of the kids 

Bouncing of the air, which caused more bouncing

Everyone was bouncing, even Mr T. 



Where had Mr T come from you say? 

He bounced from Happy Japan

And what does one do when the bouncy bouncy goes on? 

How does one deflate the universal bounce? 


We bounce and bump people every day now 

I suppose we used to bounce with them regardless 

""Lets bounce"" takes a whole new meaning

Despite its obvious literal meaning


Shel Silverstein bounced beside me

Then came Bob Dylan

My friends Matt, Shirlina, and Bobby 

They bounced close and bounced away and I knew what was happening.


Everyone bounces and hits you once in life

And they may bounce away from you 

But you've been bounced in a different direction

Whether or not you wanted to.

Those were his first words on this particularly long, arduous journey.    
""I am Marvin, pleased to make your acquaintance.""    
""Hello Marv, please call me Jango. Show me the ticket."" the grimly-suited man said with a contrasting pleasant smile on his face.    
""I'm sorry, I don't have a ticket. There were some extenuating circumstances. Long story.""    
""That's rather peculiar."" then, after a pause to adjust his tie and tap the pad a couple of times, he said, ""All the others have been checked. Why don't we have some drinks and you tell me your story.""    
    
As they chatted facing the bar counter, Marvin almost shied away, lied. Then, like a dam breaking, it came out in a flood...    
""Well, it says a lot when someone spectacularly fails even at suicide. I still see it clear as day, walking to the ledge while clips from my miserable life played out with all the satirical commentary in my head. Just like the namesake, my life has been a depressing one. Alas! I am not even smart, or good with computers. However, I was determined to get done with it once and for all, unlike the time when rope snapped during hanging, or when my cat ate the rat poison, or the day I set myself afire but it burned through the hydrant control overhead and doused me, ughhh....""    
""However, this was perfect. The ledge was 50 meters high. It overlooked a narrow gauge rail track, the jagged gully barely wide enough. A fall certainly meant landing on the rails. At the bottom, the cliff wall had a tunnel mouth that swallowed the tracks. He had already been inside the tunnel, the walls so badly riddled with scratches and crushed debris along the sidelines indicated that there was little chance anything on top of a train would make it out.""    
""The mechanical rhythm broke my stupor, well into my third day of camping. As I watched the light shrouded in the night, a glowing and growing beacon of hope, I realized something. 'Very fast.' Without a thought I jumped. My angled leap bashed me into the left wall rather than a graceful parabolic fall. I bounced like a ragged doll and lost consciousness, still falling. When I came to, my forehead was swollen and i was squeezed in the flubbery joint between coaches, the lower height regions that heroes use to escape certain death. Goddamnit!""    
""'Jump down?' a still hopeful part of my brain nudged me, only to be silenced by the gravely disappointed majority, 'Just give up. Go in and find some food. Who knows, you may fail and die in the process.' Unfortunately, here I am."" He finished with a sigh.    
    
The train official still sat turned on the stool, facing him with equal part rapt attention and fascination. Finally, he took a long sip from his honey-mead and spoke. ""I see. Do not worry about the ticket. Been a while since anyone summoned the Hell Express without channels. But how can I forget, the last one burned through the main engine to enter, you know. It took me 400 years to heal that. Barbarians all..""    
Marvin silently choked on his wine. After a pat or two, he gathered himself, ""Did you say 400 years?""    
""Yes. Crazy isn't it? A century is plenty, but all this bureaucratic jackassery fills my time. Oh, how our little Helly suffered.""    
Marvin felt more befuddled and alarmed with each passing minute. ""Umm. Excuse me. Can we start from the introductions. I am 24 years old. How old are you? What is this Hell Express? etc""    
""Oh... Ohh!"" Jango's eyebrows pricked, as he talked excitedly ""So your suicide failures weren't intentional... Of course not. I see. Quite young to be here, frankly. I should have noticed, your fashion doesn't match other newbies."" then calming a little, and making an all encompassing wave of hands, Jango continued ""This is Hell express, I prefer 'Helly'. A train filled with the undying, from all times and places. The train never stops. To get in, you need summoning, through some magical channel usually, which leaves a discernible mark on the arm of the user. That is what I wanted from you, the Ticket. As for my age, I lost interest after the thousandth.""    
""By undying, you mean immortal? Everyone?"" Marvin asked.    
 ""We have reasons to believe so. And by the way, this train may have a will of its own. I think it does."" Jango nodded with a knowing look in his grey eyes.    
    
Marvin suddenly burst out laughing. ""Man, I've got to give it to you. Quite a story. Thanks for cheering me up. There is a flaw though, you didn't check my arm for the Ticket.""    
""I did."" Jango pointed until the fabric of the shirt shimmered and Marvin's arm shone through the orange transparent haze. In a second, it was solid again. ""Undying doesn't mean cannot be killed. Whether you wish to live here or leave, both will require considerable skill in the Craft. You'd do well if you come to grips with it soon.""    
Gulping down the last of his drink, Jango picked his pad from the table and got up. A sudden thought brought him around just as he turned, ""Want to watch a film? We just beamed in Titanic. Your clothes seem to be from the new era, but I bet you haven't seen a color picture yet.""    
They travelled together through Jango's gate. Jango was contemplating the possibility of an underling, an apprentice even. Confounded Marvin trudging along, having found a new stage for his grand failures.

"[WP]In many survival games, all items are spread out. You meet the man that does it all, and he's insane.",MonsieurLicorne,"I rummaged through the crate, finding a handful of shotgun shells and an oddly well-kept medkit. The shells went right into my shotgun; I didn't have enough to spare as it was. And the medkit, used immediately to bandage a cut on my arm. I said a silent prayer that I'd find another soon; it wasn't safe to be without medical equipment for long.

I heard shuffling nearby, and instinctively crouched. More zombies, probably. I drew my M9 and checked the magazine. Fortunately, I'd found enough 9mm rounds lately. I tiptoed to the corner, weapon ready, and tried to look past it as stealthily as possible.

What I saw actually made my heart leap. Another survivor, digging through a crate just like I had been. He muttered to himself, but that wasn't surprising; fighting for your own survival can do things to a man.

""Hello?"" I asked, trying not to startle him. I knew that, to survive this long, he must've had weapons to spare.

He didn't look up, and I sighed. Maybe he was a threat. But, I couldn't just put a bullet in him that easily, so I crept forward more, careful to find cover.

""You okay?"" I asked, a little louder.

""That oughta' do it,"" he said contentedly, closing the crate.

I swallowed a lump in my throat. ""Find anything good?"" I asked.

""Find?"" he asked himself. ""No, not find. We don't find. We hide. We hide for the seekers. The seekers get hunted, but not the hiders, not we. We don't seek.""

I let my eyes widen. He walked away from both me and the crate, so I crept toward it, looking inside. Ten 9mm rounds, and 2 .50 caliber pistol rounds.

""What?"" I asked myself. The .50 cal rounds I could see him leaving behind; maybe he didn't pack that kind of heat. But the 9mm?

""You sure you don't want these?"" I asked. He continued hobbling away, unconcerned with me.

I sighed. He *was* a survivor, and there was no way he'd last through a zombie attack. Even if he was completely mad, I decided to at least follow him for a bit; two are always better than one, after all.

""What are you doing out here?"" I asked, jogging to catch up. I still kept a reasonable distance from him, but he hadn't attacked yet, so he wasn't *that* kind of insane.

""Doing? What doing? How do we do? You can't, any more, what with the bodies not being bodies. I've never heard such a stupid suggestion.""

I raised an eyebrow. ""Stupid?"" I asked.

""We've seen stupid, we have. Seekers, them's what's stupid. Know they can't make enough bodies be bodies, but they still seek, and find, and die. And don't stay dead, and make our job harder.""

""What are you talking about?"" I tried again. He at least had a train of thought. But who were seekers?

""Our job!"" he suddenly shouted, raising a pistol and firing it into the air. I cringed, and drew my weapon; either he was about to attack me, or we'd have to defend against the things that he was drawing toward us.

""There's no job anymore, seeker,"" he continued. ""Now we just hide. And we hide. We hide for us, and we hide for you. You find, but you can't find, and that's why we hide, because you can't hide.""

""What?"" I asked, before shaking my head. He wasn't about to start making more sense. But curiously, I didn't hear anything approaching.

""Open up yer ears, I haven't got the time to explain everything to you!"" he shouted. ""We hide, and you seek. And you find, and you fight. And then you need more, so we hide more. See?""

I stopped walking. ""Wait. You mean you're the one who's distributing all that ammo I've been finding?""

""Not ammo, no,"" he said, continuing at his hobbling pace. ""Bullets. And weapons. Supplies. We hide. Because we found it first, but we're not the ones who need it. We are the smart one, and the seekers just need to survive.""

""The 'smart one'?"" I asked. This was already strange, but I didn't need to get wrapped up in some kind of hive-mind or demonic stuff.

""Here, have some food,"" he said, reaching a hand out without looking back. I swallowed again, and hurried forward; it had been months since I'd had a real meal, and almost a full day since I'd had anything to eat. But when I saw his outstretched hand, I abruptly stopped, and backed away.

""That's a grenade,"" I said slowly.

""No, no, see, that's why you're a seeker,"" he chided, bringing it back in front of him. ""Not smart enough to know food when you see it, strange seeker."" He tried to take a bite of it, but somehow managed to pull the pin, and then spat it out. ""Oh, I see. This one's gone stale. Good eye, seeker, we were wrong about you.""

Abruptly, he casted the grenade out a window we were just happening to pass, and I ducked to avoid any shrapnel.

""What is wrong with you?"" I asked, only keeping my voice down by force of habit.

""A great many things,"" he replied. ""But at least we're as sharp as ever, we are.""

I opened my mouth to reply, when he suddenly kicked a door open. The shuffling sound on the other side of the door told me he'd found multiple undead, so I drew my weapon. With nothing more than an ""Oh, bother,"" he drew a revolver and let loose a trio of shots before I could reach him, and then walked into the room without hesitation.

""See, seeker, what'd I tell you? Bodies don't know they're bodies anymore, what's the world coming to? Won't even let us hide any more, I tell you what.""

I glanced into the room, and saw him make for a footlocker, before I turned away and continued down the hallway. He was bonkers, that was for sure, but at least he could handle himself. But outside, I heard the angry-sounding retching of the zombies, probably attracted by his grenade. Sounded like there were a lot outside, and at least a few were bound to make their way in here. And that would probably attract more.

I hesitantly turned back, and made my way to the madman. As I'd said, two *were* better than one. But he wasn't in the room. I entered all the way, and spun, nearly tripping over a zombie arm.

""Silly seeker can't even seek,"" he said, from somewhere. ""Why would we hide when he can't even find?""

""Where are you?"" I whispered frantically. ""They're here, and I can't fight them alone.""

""There you go, seeker!"" he shouted. I cringed; something must have heard that one. ""Now you finally see!"" he continued.

""See what?"" I asked, hurrying to shut the door.

""You can't fight them; we can't fight them. So we hide, and they leave. And we can go and hide more! And then seekers come and find, and they do the heavy lifting! It's a good system, it is.""

""Okay,"" I said, nodding to myself. If the hide-not-fight strategy had let him survive for so long, it was my best shot at doing the same. ""So where do we hide?""",Tallbrain123
[CW]You have been chosen to be a replacement of one of the seven deadly sins.,RenzoRenzoRenzo,"The news was abuzz, tens of thousands of crosses around the globe had popped out of the ground and crucified seemingly random people.  
What kind of insanity is this?  I thought as I stood in place.  This news broadcast had frozen me, it was possibly the worst thing I'd seen in the news since 9/11 all those years ago.  So many crosses, in some cities, the roads ran crimson with the blood of the crucified.  What kind of monster could do something so grotesque?

I heard a knock at my door.  Bang...bang...bang.  Who would be knocking at this time?  I ignored it, people confuse my apartment with my neighbor's all the time.  

One of the news stations had caught something interesting by now.  It was a Middle Eastern city, one that Daesh had recently been fighting for and making immense strides in capturing.  I looked, at the vehicles, tanks, SUVs, trucks, armored personnel carriers, that they had clipped from vacating forces, all with a few crosses piercing them.  There's no way wood could go through steel like that.  More interesting still, the women and children, and the resistance fighters had not a one crucified body within their ranks.  

Those cursed flags of Daesh had been splattered with blood, but there was no movement.  Had they all been wiped out?  

Bang...bang...bang.  That knock again.  They had time to figure out their mistake.  I open the door to see a creature with horns kneeling before me.  As I watch, the creature, rather human like except for horns, and what I now recognized as wings, stands to tower two feet over me.  

""Lord Wrath,"" the creature booms, ""Congratulations on the first use of your new powers.""

Lord Wrath?  New powers?  What is this thing on about?

""You are now one of the seven deadly sins of legend.  You have powers over death and destruction unlike any world power or being within this world.""

I look back at the TV.  Still more crosses in more areas are being shown.

""Oh, my lord, are you admiring your handiwork?""

""Handiwork?""  I asked.  

""Yes, my lord,"" the creature said.  ""As the sin over death and destruction, you have the ability to eradicate everything, should you so choose.""  

It was starting to dawn on me, I had wished for a scenario very similar to this a few days ago.  Those who willingly followed Daesh would be erased from existence, their blight on humanity brought to an end.  But to have killed so many people...

""Can you tell me what I wanted that made this happen?""  I asked the creature.

""My lord,"" the creature said, somewhat exasperated, ""you wished for the death of all those that willingly followed Daesh.""

""Then their conscripts, slaves, and hostages?""  

""All are alive.  Why are you wondering about such trivial matters?""

""Trivial!  TRIVIAL!  I just killed tens of thousands of people and you call that trivial?""

The ground was beginning to shake, I could feel the world itself beginning to respond to my aggression.  I took a deep breath.  

The creature, who had been blown back by some invisible force, recovered his composure.

""My lord, that is your job now.""

""Why me?""

""God decried it.  Once the former sin of Wrath abdicated his throne, you were chosen because of how calm your temperament is.  To bring you to the level of anger you felt toward Daesh is difficult.  How many people did they slaughter before you had a chance to intervene?  And look at your response when you found out it was you that had killed them.  You felt immense anger toward yourself, and that radiated outward.""

""God picked me?  Shouldn't Satan have done that?""  I asked.

""God and Satan are two mindsets of the same being.""

""Interesting, they really were all wrong,"" I thought.

I began to pack clothes and necessities.

""My lord, what are you doing?"" the creature asked.

""Packing, I don't need to be around humanity with this kind of power, one bad day and I could kill hundreds.  Daesh was marked for death by many countries, but there are plenty of people who could annoy me enough for me to kill them, and I need to be far away from them.""

This might not be all bad, I had always wanted to rid the world of evil, but I would have to be incredibly careful of how I did it.  This power had no negatives other than my own conscience.

The creature followed, adjusting shape to a mere six foot tall and jovial looking middle aged man.  ""Then, my lord, I shall be your accomplice.""",KP_Wrath

""Hello Jason,I'm Satan."" 

""Hmph"" I grunted in response,craning my neck to see the screen.

Satan shifted uncomfortably. ""Well you see Jason,I've come to give you some very important news,you've been chosen -"" Whatever else he said was drowned out by some or other commercial.I had found the remote and if I couldn't see what was going on at least I could hear it.

[CW]You have been chosen to be a replacement of one of the seven deadly sins.,RenzoRenzoRenzo,"I had a dream one time. It was the only dream that was worth having. I was sitting, watching a stage and everyone in the spotlight was someone that deserved hell. They walked from the silken curtains onto the center of the stage. The crowd applauded them and cheered at their empty performances. I saw monsters for the trash they were.

It didn't stop when I woke up. I looked out on the street and saw the sins that these filthy bastards were dirty of. The woman at the store drowned her child. The old man in the park killed twenty men and a dozen whores during the war. The children running around the schoolyard threw bricks at the new kid's house. Their sins weighed on each one of them in ways invisible to everyone else.

Seeing them day after day, week after week turned my stomach. My heart thumped every time I spotted sin. It was never my place to deliver retribution so I stewed. The only that numbed the pain was whiskey. It calmed my head and hid their crimes.

My christening was the day the store ran out of whiskey. It was sunny and cold. The delivery truck crashed on a flash freeze and there wasn't a drop in town. It was too long between my medications and their rot became audible. There was nothing to silence the archangel yelling in my head. 

The old woman that manned the shop that day. She offered vodka in place of my whiskey. The angel yelled that she slept with her husband's brother last week. She was caring his bastard. Her union and child were an abomination. ""Cleanse this blemish from the face of the earth,"" the angel crowed into my ear.

I smashed the woman's head into the cash register until the filth washed away.

The angel was quiet but I felt no relief. I was alone and the pressure was still there, building. I took whatever alcohol I could find in the store. Nothing worked quiet like whiskey, but I wanted to be lucky. I ran off before the cops showed up, the laws of man and god rarely align.

My apartment had a man in it when I got home. He was a slim man with a greasy tie. He was clean, like me. The sin and slime of the work seemed slide around him. He smiled at me and offered me a deal. I accepted his contract and became the Wrath of the one true god.",CopperToad
[CW]You have been chosen to be a replacement of one of the seven deadly sins.,RenzoRenzoRenzo,"The letter came in the mail. I didn't open it. 

Mom did, when she came by at the weekend to tidy up. She read it to me while I tried to watch wrestling. She got really freaked out by the letter - kept talking about a joke or something. I don't remember. She asked me a lot who wrote it. 

Eventually, she went away. She said she'd be back the next day for the trash. The wrestling kept going for a few more hours, then switched to some program about cars. I watched it. I've seen it before. 

She did come back, but she didn't take the trash out. The bags have been stacked in the kitchen for a week now. It smells a bit.

She sat down next to me. We watched TV some more. Re-runs of *The Office*. I only really like the ones with Stanley in, but he wasn't in any of these.

Mom tried to go, but didn't. She asked me lots of questions, but Seinfeld was on, so I didn't say much. She cried a bit. After that I fell asleep. 

When I woke up, she was on the phone. Talking to Dad, I guess. The TV was playing wrestling again. It's all fake. If you watch it enough, you can see that. 

Dad turned up a bit later. He tried to shake Mom, wake her up. It didn't work. After a bit, he sat down too. He kept trying to stand back up. Eventually, he just sat there, head in hands, while the blonde lady talked about buying artificial diamonds and timeshares. Dad used to get really angry about that, called it a scam. He didn't this time. He just sat there, next to Mom. 

Yesterday, the power went out. Guess I forgot to pay the bill. Mom and Dad don't seem to mind. They haven't said anything in a while. 

I guess someone else will come at some point. Maybe they'll take the trash out, check on Mom and Dad. Hopefully they'll pay the electricity bill. I'm kind of bored. ",Peritract
[CW]You have been chosen to be a replacement of one of the seven deadly sins.,RenzoRenzoRenzo,"Like damn. God knows his shit. 

Back in high school, when we had to write personal essays each month, I wrote one about playing God. I did lights for our plays, and I was pretty good at it. All my friends did the behind the scenes stuff but I had been there the longest, so I oversaw it. When the sounds kid got sick, I took over for 2 nights and I rocked it. Two huge boards, hundreds of buttons and dials, holed up in the upstairs booth over everyone and I killed it. Ashton, the leading man, got his last solo cut short by a shitty microphone. His girlfriend knew I did it but it’s not like she could do anything but pout. I was God that night. 

Anyway, here I am, staring out the window at the day. Light grey clouds diffuse the sunlight, which has just enough blue in it to pick out grey rocks, make them wow. It’s early spring, almost Easter, but everything is still dead and so the only things worth highlighting are the grey rock borders. If I had to do it, I’d add just a little more of a cool tone to the light, try and make the grass look a little greener. You can only use what you got, and sometimes people give you shit and expect miracles. 

There’s a guy walking up my front walk. More cool tones would look better on him too. He looks like your stock “good cop” character in FBI form. Close cut hair, no beard, and impeccable shoes. I could tap that. 

I meet him at the door. “Hello officer”

I don’t think he likes that. His eyes are a little too squinted, the light isn’t harsh at all. He holds out his briefcase, well cleaned with bright brass letters near the handle. 

I try again as I start to take his briefcase. “Come inside, what can I do for you?” 

“I don’t think so. You see, I don't think you want the mess.”

What is he saying? Never mind, I don’t stick my dick in crazy. But I’m still reaching for his briefcase, I have it in my hand when he suddenly drops into a pile of ash. I’m frozen, he’s a pile of ash on my front porch, and I’ve stolen his briefcase. I look down at it, and I see the bright brass letters “P R I D E”

There’s a small tag, pulled to the back that I didn’t see before. It reads “Property of Pride, servant of Satan. Treat with care. To be handed off in another 1000 years.”

I get it. I do. There’s a moment of understanding, my soul knew this was happening before my mind did. Out of 7 billion people, I get to be Pride. And for a damn good reason.

"[WP] Depression is monster that follows you and the closer it gets, the worse you get. Finally, you've decided you've had enough and need to destroy it, but you have to be face to face with it.",Smokinganteater,"Every time i look over my shoulder it's there.  At first i only see its pointed claw, scraping away the tile on the subway platform.  I turn away.  I know it isn't real, it can't be real, no one else looks frightened.  I manage to elude it on the train, getting off a stop early and picking up another.  My day continues as it would any other, trudging through the sea of people. Along the sidewalks until I am a block from work.  

That is where is see it again, across the street just the flick of a tail as it slips through a door. Sinuous and rough, it snaps a dent in the metal frame.  How does no one notice.  i managed to get to work again today without encountering it, though i think it is growing more bold.  I can hear it in the night now, prowling near my balcony.  I pop out of bed and check windows, hoping ill catch a real glimpse of the creature hunting me.  

A sharp beep startles me, ive aimlessly had my hands on the keyboard at my desk this whole time.  Shift key warnings from windows pull me out of my swirling psyche, keeping me busy at work.  It doesn't seem brave enough to follow me into the building yet, though i see more of it each day.  

Lunch.  Do i brave the streets for something tasty, or hide in my box with my sandwich and sprite?  Others are going out, and it wouldn't show  itself in front of others so boldly, would it?  Numbers will keep me safe for today, i can feel the beasts frustration when i exit accompanied by chatting and laughs.

On the way back into the glass towers where we work, i catch its back feet clawing their way into the single tree planted in the mess of steel, glass, and concrete.  It appears to be losing the battle to smog, much like us.  Somehow the foot looks smaller than the last time i saw it, another illusion im sure.  

Work day over, Im packing my backpack when i hear it's wail from 22 floors up.  It always knows when its prey will be out in the open, it sounds excited.  As we get swept along the grey tiles, the crowd like an ocean's current pushing me home.  The beast avoids the crowded subway platform, and so my ride on the 23 train is uneventful.  As i move to catch my transfer to the 8, i am caught in my stare by the beautiful green eyes now meeting mine.  Startled, I try to smile, hurrying off the train to the other platforms.   

the 8 is slow.  It's in an older area of the city, transit is not a proirity.  It seems like nothing is in this neighborhood anymore.  There are only a handful of people on this platform, if the train comes soon i might get home without any more encounters.  There it is in the distance again, the creature is catching up on foot.  From the elevated train platform I catch a glimpse of its bottom half.  It shimmers with blackness as if it were painted in the vacuum of space.  It has grown again.  does it feed on others as well?  I have been eluding it for some time, though i have a feeling that the monster is getting more bold as a result.  

How many more days can i really run from it?  the weekend is nearly here, i can just stay home and make sure it can't get in the house.  Where is the train..  the wait is agonizing, I am beginning to hear the footfalls thudding closer and closer.  A sharp metal clang snaps me to moving, turning slowly to face the demon that terrorizes me.  It abhors light, sucking it into its slender yet powerful body.  

A woman screams.  Thank god, other people can see it.  I know it wants my life for its own.  I feel the beast grab me so hard im weightless for a few moments.  Then the piercing yellow of its eyes are upon me, and for a fleeting moment i am free from its torture, finally taking back what it has been siphoning from me for so long.  It turns white, as does the world around me.

"[WP] Depression is monster that follows you and the closer it gets, the worse you get. Finally, you've decided you've had enough and need to destroy it, but you have to be face to face with it.",Smokinganteater,"The young woman stood in the middle of the room, facing the door. It was a plain room: white walls with nothing on them, fake wooden floor, and two chairs facing each other. 
It's not where I would have planned fighting a monster, The woman thought, glancing around.      
  *But I guess I'm not a hero. Never was. If anything, I'm  the villain.*
Depression opened the door, and slowly absorbed all of the color from the room as it moved towards her. *Gray.* She grimaced. *Everything is gray.*
       “Hello.” She said to her darker self, sounding calmer than she felt. “We need to talk.”
Depression had been following her since she had moved back to America, stunting her creativity and whispering anxiety-inducing thoughts in her ears. It was time to end the fight. She had run for too long. 
  *Why bother talking? Do you really think life could be any better for you? You're already so privileged, in your nice house, with a nice family. There are people who are suffering so much more than you, and you can't stand being sad for a few days? Huh?*

The young woman felt whispers of numbness creeping towards her, and worried this wouldn't go well.  
  *What were you thinking? You always do this, make things more dramatic than they have to be.*
       “I know life can be better.” She said, sitting down finally, in one of the chairs. Depression followed her movements, like a mirror. “And you aren't sadness. You are a bleak, fearing numbness without hope.” 

*Because there is none. Do you think you have a future? Look at your grades from the past three years. You are a failure. Even in English, and you have always been able to write well enough.*

The young woman exhaled slowly, feeling her heart beat under layers of muscle and skin. “I've gotten help for my grades. It's Attention-Deficit Disorder. I will-no-I have done better senior year.” 
 *Like colleges will look at senior grades. Do you even have a plan for college, for what you want to do?*
 Finally, the woman smiled. Memories of a warm yellow room with laughing children, and play-dough being smeared into her hair popped up. 
       “I do, actually. I plan on teaching kindergarten. Playing with my three-year old students in Sunday school is...wonderful.” 
     *You're not serious are you? You're one of the worst public speakers in any of your classes! What makes you think you can teach a class of twenty? You're not good enough.* 
           “That's from my social anxiety. And to be honest, I am a good public speaker.”
                            *Not the best.*
  “I don't need to be. And I'm able to control 20 three year-olds without losing my cool. That's pretty impressive.""
         *There are people who can do better.* 
            “There always will be.”
                    *You aren't perfect.* 
And the young woman closed her eyes. She saw her family: her parents, yelling at her because she failed math again. Her brother, slamming the door in her face. She saw her friends, one in jail and the other shaking her head. She saw herself, with that big ugly nose and round ugly face.

 Then, she saw her therapist crying because how far the two had come. She saw her mother clutching the grade sheet with HONOR ROLL stamped on it. She saw her new friends playing dungeons and dragons, laughing. And she saw herself, not beautiful but prettyish. She saw her church, and  the Sunday school she taught. She saw the words written by her, poems, stories, ideas, and colors swirling around in her head. 

                  “I don't need to be perfect. Just myself.”

I threw my med bottles on the ground in frustration. My robust force broke the caps sending tiny pills of various shapes into the air. Some bounced off the floor and scattered all over the entire room.

I have been suffering from depression disorder for over 8 years now, was diagnosed 2 years ago, and finally brought myself up to seek treatment. I had had countless sessions with my therapist, all of which turned out to be fruitless efforts. 

And despite having to take dozen of drugs, I could still feel the negative energy haunting and weighing me down continuously. I had literally became a drug addict to pharmaceutical medications. I could remember the names of drugs I had taken better than I could remember the names of my coworkers--I wasn't proud about it, it wasn't something to brag about. The drugs weren’t helping, they never did.

Prolonged depression bred anxiety, and vice versa, my anxiety commensurately exacerbated my depression. Subsequently, my mental disorders brought forth the inability for me to function like a normal and responsible adult. 

I knew that I would have to face that monster very soon because I was becoming exhausted from having to (literally) carry that abomination on my back. Not only its disconcerting look terrified me, but the way its hands wrapped around and constricted my neck had also caused me a disturbing amount of discomfort. I had not been able to breathe with ease since its unwanted occupation of my body. It had been an extremely difficult struggle to hang on to my own mental tranquility. 

Today, I finally popped--I knew I must confront that monster, face to face. I wanted to defeat it with the mental maturity I had learnt throughout the years of ordeal. 

I felt more powerful than ever. I held its grip, forcibly remove its hands apart, and with unprecedented strength, I threw it on the ground. I looked at his eyes and I could see them overwhelmed with fear and recognition for my determination. 

It hurriedly ran to the corner of the room, hands wrapped around its knees, and cowered in fear, looking terrified like a child who just discovered a monster under her bed.

I turned around and walked towards the closet, threw open the door and stared at the bulky travel bag sitting nonchalantly on the floor. I had prepared for this moment because I knew I would come. I had packed everything I needed in there. 

I had always had this dream to travel to south east Asia in my early twenty. However, I set the plan aside to pursue a career in computer science only because of the growing demand, a decision which I wholeheartedly regretted soon after I achieved my bachelor.

I were blindly fulfilling my parents’ expectation of me. I was hired to work in a boring office job, earned enough money to afford fancy stuff just to impress my neighbors, and got married to a hot brainless blonde. At one point, I came to the realization that I was killing myself by following a daily work routine just to earn a pointless retirement fund so I would be able to suffer for the rest of my life as a regretful old man who would be crying to sleep every night realizing that he had lived his life without a purpose.

Now, when I was in my mid thirty, I finally saw the light at the end of this seemingly dead end tunnel. I had come to the conclusion that the underlying cause of my own misery stemmed from the years I wasted in the pursuit of the things I disliked. 

Without a hesitation, I picked up the bag and carried it on my back. Regardless of its notable weight, I felt more relieved than ever. I rushed down the stairs, walked out of the house in excitement that I had not felt for over a decade. 

I rejoiced in the fact that I was about to leave behind the depressing part of me. I got into my car, drove away and never looked back.

Crawling out of deep holes in the middle of large cities, or in the countryside, or emerging from their oceanic cocoons -  in any case, messes were made. People reacted predictably, with horror and panic, then with violence, eventually with grudging acceptance that a new apex predator was in place. The dragons, for all their fearsome appearance, seemed to be largely nonviolent unless provoked, so over a few months an uneasy peace settled in.

At first, they were just dragons, doing dragon things, flying around, checking it out, stealing livestock here and there, retaliating against those early human attacks with fire, ice, and lightning. There was some kind of conclave on a high mountain in Nepal that the media covered with alarm, as it illustrated that these were intelligent animals, not wild as people would have initially thought- being the only “sentient” creatures on a planet for a while tends to make folks think their way is the only way.

Then the internet came online for the dragons. The interpreter species seemed to be the lightning dragons, with the operant theory being that their ability to manipulate electricity allowed them some kind of ability to natively access wifi and cell networks, but in any case it wasn’t long before the confluence of translation software and message boards allowed the dragons to speak again, in ways that had been long forgotten by humanity. 

A series of comments on reddit was initially dismissed as pranksterism, perhaps by Anonymous or something, but quickly that theory was dashed by the dragons’ completing several acts of mayhem that they were egged onto by the idiot children posting in the thread “IMA Lightning Dragon, AMA.”

It has only been 1000 years. 

Yet, I find myself puzzled as I stand in the middle of this city, where buildings are taller than any tower I have seen before. The people wear different kinds of clothing and the wagons of old are now metal and lack any sort of animal to pull it. It simply moves. 

""Dude, are you going to a costume party?"" A voice said to me. 

I turned around and a young man looks at me, puzzled. I can see why. While I am in my human form, my clothes are far too different from his. I was wearing a robe, similar to those monks in the Temple of Faria, yet he was wearing......weird looking clothes. 

""What? Oh, yes. A costume party."" I said, not to incur any doubts or suspicion from him. 

""Awesome man."" He smiles as he says this. I think he might have smoked some Gazegrass. I could smell it from him. He was also smiling for a very long time before saying anything. 

""Can you tell me where I am, right now?"" I ask him. 

He stares at me. For a few moments. 

""Oh! America man! Colorado to be exact. Are you new here?""

""Yes I am actually. Do you know where I can find the nearest tavern?"" I asked again. 

""You mean, like a bar ? Hahaha! Man, you're really into this roleplay stuff huh? Alright dude, I'll show ya. I'm supposed to meet my friends anyway. Follow me. "" He says and walks past me. 

I follow him and I observed my surroundings. Despite my best efforts, I couldn't find any elves, dwarfs, gnomes, orcs, or halfling. I thought I found a dwarf, but I think he was just a very short man. 

What happened in the last 1000 years? Did the humans eradicated all of the other races?

By the time I was done thinking, I realized I have been sitting at a table with a group of other people. The young man earlier was present as well. This must've been his friends. 

""Greetings."" I said. 

Their expression towards me didn't change. The young man bursts into laughter. 

""Oh dudeeee you're so funny! Guys, this is Robe Man. Found him on the street. He's lost I think.""

Is that my name? Robe Man?

""Excuse me....""

""Peter. Name's Peter, Robe Man, you can call me Pete.""

""Peter,  do you know anything about dragons?""

""Dude of course. I've been chasing the dragon all morning man!""

What?! 

""Dude, you cannot believe how hard it is to ride the dragon man. But that's why you're here man. You're about to witness me ride the dragon!""

I began to feel anger towards this young man. His hand reaches into his shirt, and I ready myself for whatever's about to happen. 

He pulls out a glass wand. He's a wizard!

""Riding the dragon now my friend!""

Suddenly his hand produces a flame and he brings the flame to the wand. 

I grew out my claws instantly, ready to attack. 

He puts the wand into his mouth. 

What. 

""Oh he's going for it now!"" His friends cheers him on.

He starts smoking the glass wand as the cheer from his friends gets louder. When he finished, he blows out a smoke of Gazegrass, and the smell is ridiculously stronger than I have smelled before. 

""That was a great bowl mannnnm.""

I sat there, puzzled. 

""He's riding the dragon now mannnn"" one of his friends said. 

I sat there, even more confused.

[WP] One if by land. Two if by sea. Three if by air. Four if by...,The_Real_Ed_Boy,"""You know the old saying, one for the road, two for the-""

""Yeah, shut up,"" I said to my father. We were supposed to be learning how to drive, not how to drink, and if the two ever coincided it was no one's fault but my dad's. I know he was a scientist, not an alcoholic, but sometimes it was hard to tell the difference, you know? ""Where are we going, anyways?""

""You'll see in a minute, Alex,"" he said. ""Turn right here - and watch the cars, now, turn...""

I turned in, and duly found myself on a empty suburban street I have never seen before. The houses here look run down, a match of sixties architecture and modern art - almost as if the place had been unstuck in time. It reminded me of my mom: the way she'd dance and romp like it was 1989 and she was twenty. ""Dad, this isn't helping me,"" I said, keeping my hands glued to the wheel. ""I don't know this place.""

""Well, that's why you're here,"" he said. ""To learn about the less explored paths of the city. Now you see that house on your right with the number 44?""

I looked. The house was unremarkable - and in this neighbourhood, this meant the 'two-storey, white picket fence, nice garage and garden' variety. But when I got closer I noticed something odd about the place.

The gates were open without the lights being on.

""I see it,"" I said. ""Do you want me to turn in?""

He nodded. I turned into the open driveway, and my dad just asked me to park the car anywhere. ""I'm going to show you something you won't forget in a hurry,"" he said. ""But first-""

He drew up a piece of paper I had never seen before. ""The three things I asked you to do. I'll know if you're lying, so answer honestly. Did you bring the keys?""

I nodded, and he fished the keys from my left pocket, almost as if he already knew they were there. He walked over to the rug, where a second, identical set of keys were already there. Smiling, he picked up the other set and put mine there. Beckoning me over, he unlocked the front door with the other set and showed me in. The house was dark.

""What's going on-"" I started to say, but my dad's smile hushed me. 

""Second thing: did you bring the watch?""

I got my dad's watch out from my pocket. It hadn't been working for a long time, but it had some special value or something. I can't remember the story now, but it was something to do with my mom and my dad meeting up and getting together for the first time. A long time ago, as they said.

""Good, it's still not working,"" he said. ""Now, this is important: the date slip from the New York Times. You got it?""

I handed him the slip, the one torn from today's front page of the New York Times, and he heaved a huge sigh of relief.

""We'll need this,"" he said. ""It's like our visa stamp.""

""Just what are we doing?"" I said. But in response my dad simply flicked the light switch.

I covered my eyes. In the sudden light my palms were searingly bright. But when I adjusted to the light I nearly passed out in shock.

Before me, there was an identical version of the car we had driven to get here, sitting in the living room of this old house.

""That's your new ride, Alex,"" he said, beaming and looking every inch the proud father. ""Take a look at the license plate.""

I did, and I just kept staring. ""It's from 2021?""

""Yes,"" he said. ""It's a time machine, Alex. The newspaper clipping proves it. And my watch,"" he pulled it out, ""should start ticking away when we leave our current time. It doesn't work in this world, but in the future, it might...""

""Will,"" I corrected. ""In the future it will?""

""That's exactly right,"" he said, beaming. ""You know the old saying?""

""What?""

""One if by land - your keys. Two if by sea - visa and passport. Three if by air - passport, money and visa. But four if by *spacetime* - keys, watch and newspaper.""

""That's not four,"" I said, staring at the car, at my dad, who looked every bit as young as myself again. 

""Right you are,"" he said. ""Keys, watch, newspaper - and myself. Now come on, let's go for a ride!""

A century later, a third is added. Invasion from the sky. A siren to warn against bombing runs. All lit with flickering electricity.

Now they are retrofitting the warning lights again. A fourth has been added. The siren now emits a crystalline tone, clear and piercing. The lamps glow a bizarre purple when not in use.

Quiet chimes announce the midnight hour, a recording of bells drifting into the dreams of a sleeping town. All is well, the bells say. And for a few hours, this remains true.

Something is detected along a new border. Quantum circuits fluctuate, actualize, calculate probabilities. The movement does not cease. There is more of it now. A processor speaks to another processor over a lifetime of nanoseconds. They agree: it's an invasion. Sound the alarm.

The four lamps awaken, tiny motes of purplish energy exploding into riotous fire. Four eyes watching the darkness. Four minds linked together. Four soldiers forever standing guard against those who would devour us from within.

The motion sensors have detected nothing. The restless hunger, the teeth in the darkness, the things that shriek like cats in the night... they are made of fear without substance. An idea with no form, a feeling that has become autonomous. Humanity's psychic residue, returned to eat its creators.

The town slumbers, and in its dreams a war is waged.",homeforinfiniteloser

When they saw the fourth lamp lit, they looked up and saw the British riding down the slopes. They were going hard and fast, performing beautiful flips and tricks all down the mountain.

The Americans looked in awe and said ""We could never defeat anyone that cool and radical!"".

But George Washington wasn't having any of that. ""Come my soldiers and let us show them how we do things around here."". Then he lifted his skateboard to the sky.

He and his troops went the nearest skatepark and started skating really cool like to show up the British forces.

Paul shook his head. ""Can't fucking see...""

He squinted to try and see the lights coming from across the bay.

There was definitely three lights.

""So wait...*hic*..."", he said, scratching his head. As he did so, whiskey poured out from the bottle that he had in his hand, the same one that was now on his hand. ""Fuck damn shitty tit fuck!"", he roared, throwing the bottle to the ground. 

He shook his head, wiping what alcohol he could off his head. ""Right... so... one is... sea, right? Two is... air... wait, how would that even fucking work?""

He sighed. ""I'm sure two was air, though... and what the hell? There's four!""

He squinted again. ""Nope... that's three... ah shit, there's four again! MAKE UP YOUR MINDS, YA FUKIN' CUNTS!""

He looked at the bottle on the floor. Perhaps it was time for a break from the drinking. 

""I'll just take a nap. Then I'll figure this shit out."" 

He peered out once more. 

""That's definitely four lights. Four fucking lights. No... five... goddamnit. THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS!"", he roars, trying to convince himself that he was indeed correct. 

The flickering lights refused to obey.

[WP] One if by land. Two if by sea. Three if by air. Four if by...,The_Real_Ed_Boy,"space. Four lanterns hang in the Old North Church. The alien invaders were dropping right onto them. The Colonists had feared the British, but this was something far far worse. The locals had thought they were shooting stars falling to Earth first, but Paul Revere knew better. 

When the three legged metal stools emerged from the craters, he knew how to defeat them. There were reasons he became a silversmith, after all. But, these were not the creatures faced by his forefathers centuries ago. Those beings would never be back, and, after his warning ride, Revere went to face the metal milking stools. It was a sight for any observer, but, when the silversmith burst into flames, courage turned into panic. Those small towns of New England fled south away from the milking stools. 

But, more fell from the sky, and there was no stopping them. Those foreign creatures laid waste to Boston and New York, but they encountered something they didn't expect in Philadelphia: Benjamin Franklin. 

The city had 8 electric cannons covered in lightning rods. The energy had been stored for months. Dozens of the machines moved toward the city. The machines expected nothing. They moved boldly toward Philadelphia. The cannons fired at the alien attackers. Three tripods fell immediately, and the rest of the tripods pulled back. Ben had another surprise for the tripods. He fired at them over a mile away and dropped two more. The machines pulled back and moved south toward Virginia and Ben Franklin gave chase to the machines for he had one more surprise for them. 

At Monticello, Thomas Jefferson waited for the machines. He was afraid, truly, but, if they could defeat the machines, the British were nothing. His flying machines could deliver an explosive payload on top of the metal milking stools, but he had experimented with electromagnetism extensively. It was this tool he would use to stop them using his flying machines. Jefferson's gliders hit the milking stools with electomagnetic pulses, but only a few machines were destroyed. Most of the gliders went down in the effort. 

The machines continued to advance, and Jefferson took cover as his home was destroyed by the machines. Just when all hope was lost, an army led by Generals Washington and Cornwallis emerged and attacked the machines with a vim and vigor that the world had not seen before. While Jefferson survived the ordeal, Washington and Cornwallis did not nor did much of their army. But, two dozen machines were now 8. Humanity appeared to have a chance. 

The machines continued north until they ran into the small armor of Benjamin Franklin leading a small group of steam powered vehicles that Franklin referred to as tanks. The machines were surprised but not defenseless against the tanks. The battle was bloody, and Franklin did not survive it. Only 4 machines remained after this battle. The aliens were running out of steam. That was, until more cylinders fell from the sky. 

The world appeared to be doomed, and the aliens tore the New World to pieces until one day the machines stopped entirely. The rampage ended. People thought it was a trap and why shouldn't they? But, it was not a trap. The aliens died. No one knew why. When the beings were examined, some remarked that it looked like they had gotten small pox. Others were not sure, but the menace appeared to be gone...for now.

For Superheroes, I actually don't have much of any planning. I'm actually surprised I made it this far without a gameplan, but I've hit the middle of the story, so gameplans are becoming necessary.

Sojourning over the hills and sands of sleep, I say, *Wake o' dreamer. Wake to the sound of my voice.*

Want nods his head in agreement. The other camels, with him and I, plod steadily on through the dust and starry night. Swirls of sand, swirls of dust. Twirling thoughts, sparked imagination. Sleepers rest in the Desert of Rest, filling it with all imaginations.

*I want to talk to you...* I do. I do so much want, that I have named my camels as such: I, is me, Want, To, Talk, To, You. We walk through the dreamscape waiting, watching hoping for you to awaken to our presence... For now we continue on, impressed by the length of your sleep. Awake o' sleeper. Awake for I have much to say.

[IP] Speed Paint #58 or The Girl With The Enchanting Flute,ohlookitsastory,"Her name was Penelope,

And she lived in the kingdom of Llewia,

Where kings and nobles sought her flute,

The Txirula.

And though the Enchanted Flute was fought over,

Penelope never gave in to the kings and nobles of Llewia.

By night she would pray for those whom have died,

And by day she would practice Txirula,

So she could pray by night once more.

And when the nobles of Owainia, Empire of the East, captured Penelope,

The coveted Flute never left her grasp.

Not for her selfishness,

Nor for her naivete,

Nor for her hatred of the Owainians.

She kept the Flute with her until her death

For it was her's,

Linked to her heart and soul by love and magic,

Music and prosperity.

Penelope was murdered with the Txirula,

And the Txirula never played the nodes of mysticism 

That Penelope played.

And thus concludes the Fable of Penelope,

Bearer of Txirula,

Daughter of Prince Pericles of Llewia.

At first her hands were clumsy, after a minute the motions became practiced. And after that she began to experiment, notes coming and going, paring them together and breaking them apart.

The storm was rolling in, she could feel the air changing. But the rain and occasional thunderclap somehow only added to the performance, turning a solo act into a delicate ensemble, echoing down the river. In that moment, she played with nature.

By the end of the song, her wet red hair was plastered to her scalp, and the flute had taught her all it knew.",Kaantur-Set
[IP] Speed Paint #58 or The Girl With The Enchanting Flute,ohlookitsastory,"She sighed as she put down the last crops in the baskets. The last few weeks could have been better. She only hoped they would have enough for the winter. As she climbed the ladder out of the basement she sighed again.

This empty house.

She hated it.

She lighted a small fire in the fire place. Even though the days were still very warm, every night got a little bit colder. She was nearly done, when she heard a few very light knocks. No, dribble. It had begun to rain. A very mild and soothing rain. She finished up quickly and stepped out on the porch. She loved seeing the raindrops hit the river. And the sound the woods and the water played in the rain. She opened a small box on the counter beside the door. Inside a beautiful wooden flute. Her mother had made it for her as soon as she knew she would finally have a child. It was a shame, she would never hear her play it. She grabbed it and went outside.

The water felt warm on her skin. Most likely for the very last time this year. The leaves already colored the river in all kinds of yellow and red and she rarely saw green except for the evergreens as far as she could watch down the riverside.

Her father was still out there. In the woods. He should have been home by now. He should have filled this house with joy again. And his big smile. She missed him.

He always told her, he was just bad with directions, when he came a few days later, but she knew, he would never get lost. Not in these woods. Not in *his* woods. He was never gone as long as this time. But she knew, there was still time. She knew, he will come back.

She slowly walked down the small jetty and started playing. A song he taught her. So the tune may guide him home. And as her song of solace hummed through the trees, the sun drowned in the stream.

Another day went by.

[IP] Speed Paint #58 or The Girl With The Enchanting Flute,ohlookitsastory,"Muriel woke to a rapping on her front door.  She pulled a wrinkled robe from a pile of dirty laundry and wrapped it around herself as she walked to the door.  She opened the door slowly, not seeing anyone, until a squeak drew her attention downward.  A young squirrel sat on its hind legs holding a tiny satchel. 

""And good morning to you, Pips,"" said Muriel.  She knelt down and stroked Pips' fur. ""How nice to see you!""  

Pips bowed and pulled a glowing blue marble from his pack.  He held up the globe for Muriel.  ""Sorry to disturb you, Queen, but I have an urgent message from your brother.""  

""Oh, thank you,"" said Muriel as she took the globe.  ""Please, come in.  I have some fresh walnuts, are you interested?""  

Pips clapped his tiny paws and scampered past Muriel.  She closed the door as Pips jumped onto her kitchen counter and began noisily cracking open walnuts.  Muriel walked over to a workbench covered in glass beakers and vials and pulled out a clean test tube.  

""Is it true that he rides a silver dragon?"" asked Pips, watching as Muriel dropped the blue marble into the test tube. ""And he carries a magic sword?""  

Muriel smiled. ""In a manner of speaking, yes.""  She poured several chemicals into the tube.  The marble slowly dissolved into the liquid.  

Pips nibbled on a chunk of walnut, making no attempt to clean up the bits of cracked shell that surrounded him. ""Does he really fight cloud monsters?""  

Muriel placed the tube in a centrifuge.  She laughed and turned on the device.  The tube began to whir.  ""Well, the Enemy aren't really clouds or monsters, no. But Martin *is* fighting them, that part is true.""  She peeked out a window. ""Pips, sweetie, go tell everyone that it's going to rain again today.  It's going to be a bad one.  Tell everyone to stay out of the rain.""  

Pips finished his walnut and saluted. ""Aye aye, my Queen!""  He hopped off the counter and darted out the front door.  

Muriel watched the approaching storm clouds in silence until the centrifuge slowed to a stop and beeped.  She removed the test tube and held it up to her eyes.  After a moment, she drank the contents of the vial and closed her eyes.  And waited.  

At first, she saw only blackness.  Then pinpricks of light—stars—followed by the blue-white haze of her planet's atmosphere.  Her brother's face appeared, flickered, and disappeared.  Long streaks of neon colors flashed across her vision accompanied by bunched flower petals, orange and red, that blossom for a brief moment then wilt.  Ion cannons and conventional missiles, those.  Her ears strained to hear the explosions but the message is silent. Somewhere in her head, a small voice asked if this might be Martin's last message.  Finally, Martin's face appeared, solid and undamaged.  Muriel felt her shoulders relaxing at the sight of her twin's face and she breathed deeply.  

""Sister."" His face is drawn, his eyes baggy. ""They will be pushing us hard today and tonight.  I hope this message reaches you in time.  I'm sorry for asking so soon again, but you must play today."" His face loomed larger behind Muriel's closed eyes, his eyebrows furrowed and his forehead creased with worry. ""You *must.* I've lost many pilots in the last skirmish, and my remaining men are so tired.  I am so tired, sister.  I worry, some of the Enemy may slip through.  Gods, I hope that you are safe, that they cannot find you.""  

Muriel's face swelled at the tone of Martin's voice.  Tears leaked from her closed eyelids.  

""I wanted to ask you to play our grandmother's nursery song, I thought maybe we just needed a little rejuvenation, some small healing.""  Martin shook his head. ""We're past that now, too far.  Muri""—he took a deep breath and his eyes drift away—""I need Father's battle hymn.  His final one.""  

Muriel's breath caught in her throat.  For a moment, the vision wavered and her brother's face swam before her.  She swallowed hard, feeling the lump there, and forced herself to focus.  

""Muri, it may not be enough.  They are pushing *so hard*, I'm not sure—"" Martin caught himself and shook his head. ""It's doesn't matter.  Just play the song, Muri, play it with your full heart.  I will try to—no, I will come for you when it is over.""  His face disappeared and the vision faded.  

Muriel opened her eyes.  Through the window, she could see that the sky had grown darker and the storm clouds were closer now.  She tore off her robe and shimmied into her songdress, the same dress worn by her mother and her mother's mother.  She grabbed her flute from its place on the mantel and hurried outside.  

She stood at the end of the dock, feeling the storm winds blow through her loose hair.  The long ribbons of her dress flapped in the breeze, flashing gold as the last rays of sunlight struck the runes embroidered on the blue and white fabric.  She whispered a quick prayer to the long-dead women of her family and began to play.  

Her father's final battle hymn was an ugly song, discordant and choppy.  The first notes flew from her flute just as the rain began to fall. Big, fat drops fell around her and then—on her.  Her arms and head stung with pain as the acid in the rain began to eat away at her unprotected skin.  The Enemy had controlled the rain for months, turning it into a dangerous thing.  The earth screamed for water but drank only poison.  Muriel inserted a protective riff into the song, shielding herself and her immediate surroundings with an invisible bubble.  The rain hammered harmlessly on the air above her head, sliding down the bubble to meld with the lake water.  Muriel played on.  

As she moved from one movement to another, the sky above her began to pull at her.  The pull increased and her heart swelled as her brother's location and presence linked with her own.  A sparkle of light—Martin—shone through the dark clouds.  Other pilots in Martin's squadron followed, and soon Muriel had linked with every living man in the battle.  Muriel had been split in two: the girl standing on a wooden dock and a spirit soaring high into the atmosphere.  The pull of gravity, the surge of acceleration, the shuddering turbulence of spaceflight combat: her arms and legs dipped and swayed as her mind jumped from one pilot to the next.  Her song flowed outward and upward, through her projected consciousness and into mechanical dragons of Martin and his men.  Missiles and energy beams bent in their paths, correcting in mid-course, struck the Enemy's ships.  Muriel's heart raced as the cheers of a hundred men echoed through her.     

Back on the dock, the rain increased in intensity. Muriel noticed that the rain drops were skittering across the ground.  The rain had changed, it wasn't acid anymore.  Instead, Muriel saw thousands of small insects crawling from puddles.  She watched as the insects roamed back-and-forth, passing easily through her protective bubble. They were searching for something. Her.  

Her fingers strained and her lungs burned as she played the battle hymn.  She forced a counterpoint under the melody, forcing the bugs nearest her to burst into flame.  It wasn't enough—her legs began to tingle as the first insects found her and began to crawl onto her leg.  She scraped at her shins and calves with the bottoms of her feet, but the effort distracted her from the song.  

She misplayed a note.

[IP] Speed Paint #58 or The Girl With The Enchanting Flute,ohlookitsastory,"High above her, one of the twinkling sparks—one of Martin's men—winked out.  In the tangled web of emotions in her chest, Muriel felt a pang as the web tore.  Her body shook as she felt a wave of grief and fury wash over Martin and his men, then through Muriel and her song.  The pain forced extra air from her and into the flute.  She turned the pain into another counterpoint, focused on the Enemy's insect spies. The insects disintegrated, popping like a child's chain of firecrackers.  Muriel bared her teeth with malicious pleasure and stomped her feet in time with the song.  She held tight to the fury of Martin and his men, pushing the battle hymn faster.  

Then, another spark went out.  And another.  Muriel's song faltered as Martin's men began to die.  She strained to feel them, to hear with their ears and see with their eyes.  When she finally connected, she recoiled in horror.  

Most of Martin's squad had been captured, their ships immobile and utterly defenseless before the inscrutable hostility of the Enemy.  Muriel touched one of the pilots just as he was ripped from his cockpit and flung into the coldness of space.  His scream of terror drove Muriel from his mind.  She screamed herself, dropping the flute.  The link broke and Muriel was alone on the dock.  

She sobbed and scrambled for the flute.  Without thinking, she rushed into a protective song, a nurturing lullaby.  She cast her focus skyward, searching for her brother.  Her pacing grew ragged, her notes verging on discordant, as she flung her mind across the sky.  There—a pull, an attraction. Martin.  Weak, but it was him.  Muriel controlled her breathing, focusing on her twin.  

He was falling fast.  She touched his mind, soothing him as their mother had once soothed them both.  His ship was badly damaged but he had not been captured.  She pictured their mother swinging Martin as toddler, tossing him into the sky and catching him with a laugh.  Her song wove a cushion of air around his ship as he plummeted to earth.  Too fast, he was still falling too fast.  Muriel resisted the urge to push the song faster.  Discipline would save her brother, not desperation.  She steadied herself and knelt on the wood.  Her shoulders swayed as she played, the notes floating into the sky towards her falling brother.  She felt him slow.  It would be enough.  Finally, he disappeared beyond the horizon.  She listened, her entire body rigid and straining.  

Then she felt it: he had survived.  She collapsed onto the dock, breathing heavily.  

She could have slept, then, but she heard the pitter-patter of scampering paws.  She lifted her head to see Pips darting across the pond, his eyes wide.  His fur was bloody.  

She bolted upright and caught the squirrel as he leapt into her lap.  He was breathing too fast to speak, and she hummed a simple melody to calm him.  

""Thank you, my Queen,"" he gasped, ""thank you.""  

""What has happened, Pips?""  

Pips shook his head, his entire body shuddering. ""I've failed you, my Queen, oh, I've let you down.""  He began to weep.  

Muriel frowned and stroked the squirrel's fur.   She blotted at his bloody fur with the hem of her dress.  ""It's ok, you're safe with me."" The words were bitter on her tongue as she thought of her brother and his dead men. ""What has happened?""  

Pips pointed into the distance with one trembling paw.  

""The Enemy, my Queen—"" 

He moaned.   

""They're here.""

"[WP] Watching the house burn, you hear someone murmur ""They had it coming""",redhairedtyrant,"It had taken a month of planning. Everything had to be just right. Everyone had to be inside, especially the kids. What kind of justice would it have been if the kids hadn't been asleep in their rooms? 

I already had the supplies, of course. Who doesn't have gas, who doesn't have matches? The gas was for my car, I claimed to anyone who asked. I would have said that the matches were for the fire pit, but nobody ever did. 

The rest of that month, though, the rest that hadn't been occupied with watching the family with their perfect children and perfect cars and perfect house was occupied with steeling my nerve. Not for the act, no, that would be easy. After what they did, that would be easy. But for the fear that I would be caught. That they would find that it was me who did it. No logical reason for them to think it was me, of course. I'm a woman. And that fucking perfect family probably doesn't even remember me. 

But I will always remember them. Five seconds. That was what they cost me. Five precious seconds of obstruction, when they crossed in front of me, and I had to watch him walk away onto the plane with no way to ever talk to him again. If they hadn't been there, I could have rushed forwards, grabbed his arm. We could have talked things out, like always. Well, not only talked. But surely love is worth a few bruises? 

Rambling. Incoherence. I must focus, or this night will have been for naught. There I am, parked in front of the house, white picket fence and all. I open the door, step out. 

Gasoline. 

Matches. 

Gloves on my hands. 

The front door is unlocked. A family like that would never think that they could be attacked. I go in... carpeted floor, good. Everyone should be asleep, but I look around the dark room just in case. No one there. 

Pour the gasoline, the thick smell rising around me. Soak the carpet so it looks black in the dim light. Up the stairs now, liquid dribbling from the red jug gripped in my hand. Close the doors, carefully, so they won't get up until its too late. I've already seen that there's no escape from their windows. They could jump, sure, but the windows are high enough that they'd at least break a limb, and I covered the ground with caltrops just to be extra sure. 

I turn around and leave, bringing the empty tub with me. No need to leave behind any way to track me. Just in front of the front door, I strike a match. Its light flares, red and orange dancing an intimate dance of hope. 

I throw the match, and close the door. ",Shadowlens

[EU] Uncle Vernon came face to face with Lord Voldemort.,wannabgourmande,"The whir of chopper blades were a distant echo to the ears, sirens screamed somewhere in the distance, slowly crying closer and closer. In a blur and slur, Vernon began to come to. His eyes began to focus on the dank and decay that filled his senses, as he slowly realized his hands and feet bound by an apparition. Noises echoed in his mind, like a long hallway as the sound resonated through his skull and down his spine, as every bone in his body begged for escape.

His vision faded, but able to discern a figure scrambling about in the haste. Tossing items and shadows in a bag as it moved to and fro, never pausing to acknowledge the bound human. At Vernon's feet lay a motionless Harry Potter, disfigured and dismembered, a limbless body with blank eyes stared back at the fat man.

Vernon began to whimper now, unable to make a sound as panic set in. Swallowing his mind as adrenaline flooded every muscle, his arteries constricted, and felt his blood pressure sky rocket as he suddenly became nauseated and light headed, still unable to move as the fatty attempted to free himself.

The cloaked shadow now paused at the sound of panic behind it. As the menagerie of bright colors faded to grey in Vernon's vision, he was able to make out a emotionless face now eyeing him from several feet away. Vernon himself unable to recall how he came to be, the last he knew he was getting ready for a deep slumber, swallowing his depression pills and sleeping aids. He wondered what this freak of a nephew got him into now. 

Tires screeched outside from somewhere, slamming of doors and a bustle of feet followed by a thud from above his head startled the figure before him. He clearly pulled one of those heretical wands from a pocket and pointed it at Vernon. 

""Bear witness,"" the snake like voice slithered, ""To the world's demise,"" it said. Followed by a laugh that seemed to vibrate every fiber in Vernon's subcutaneous tissues.  

Voldemort proceeded reach his cold, dead hands from his robes. Brushing against Vernon's fat cheeks as the freak smiled back. Deep into the Fat Man's eyes, sending another shiver down the mortal's spine. A glowing orb now emanated from Voldemort's hands, a bright blue began to fill the room as a piercing screech became louder and louder. Almost blowing out Vernon's eardrums. Leaning back, seemingly basking in the moment, Voldemort seemed to forget about his surroundings. becoming careless in his pre-celebratory victory speech. 

An explosion somewhere behind the fat man knocked him on his side. Still unable to fight his bondage. Voldemort screeched like a banshee in anger as his world slowly began to close in around him. ""Punished"" Venom Snake stood adjacent to the newly painted whole in the wall.

Sidearm raised ready for mischievous intent. Snake slowly made his way forward, stepping over the dead Harry. The warlock slowly backed up, glowing orb still in hand as a wickedly cold breeze now filled the room.

"[WP] Every time you ask the question ""Are we there yet?"" The answer is always 'yes'.",Cheesus_Christ93,"When I was younger, I thought that calling my ability a “power” might be a stretch. Power was only really power when other people knew that you had it. Otherwise, what was the point?

It started with the simple things, as it always does. Me as a child, sitting in the back of mom’s minivan. I’m bored, I forgot my Gameboy. 
I ask in an obnoxious tone; “Are we there yet?” 

“Yes.” 
What? 
“We’re here.” 
But we just left home. 
“Doesn’t matter. We’re here now.” 

Those were the innocent things. Skipping a boring part of your life, to fast forward to the point of progress. It made me impatient. I started to dread waiting, I became lazy. I began hating standing in line or refreshing websites for new entertaining content to amuse me until that also had me bored. 
My relationships suffered. I was too eager, too emotional. If it didn’t go fast enough, I didn’t want to do it at all. 

That’s when I found another side of my “power”. 

“I think I love you. Are we there yet?” 

Small words. Childish words. But they worked. People loved me, with no effort from my side. Four words in the right context and they were mine. It was like candy to me. The power of everlasting love; who doesn’t want that?

“I think we should spent more time apart. Are we there yet?” 

I had many wives - even more girlfriends. I made them want me; love me, until I tired of them. I left a trail of broken people in my wake as I walked impatiently through life, searching for something that would fill the void that fake love and accomplishments had created.

It didn’t take long for my weak, spoiled self to grow frail and depressed. I suppose it was good that it was me who got this power. Imagine what horrible things someone with motivation and incentive for command could have done with it? So, in a way we were lucky, I tell myself, as I look up at the sky with unrighteous tears running down my cheek. I realize how the reality I have created for myself is nothing but lies.

I look up now and I use my power one last time. 

“God, I think I am ready to die. Are we there yet?”

[WP] You're a hit-man hired for a high-profile case but only given an address: 123 Sesame Street.,ElectricSkeletor,"Thomas called from Aspen saying the job was done. LeeRoy called from Houston a day later to say the same. Calls from Salem, Oregon and Penngrove, California came, but still the contract hadn't been called off. ""RtK: 123 Sesame Street; all"" never seemed to leave the top of the Darknet. 

A request to kill was usually straightforward. Do the job, post evidence that the job was done, and the Bitcoins would flow into your account. ""All"" on the request meant anything at the address that moved should stop. I am a middle man. An organizer of sorts. I have contact with the kind of people who make other people disappear. This kind of thing is usually simple, efficiency is my modus operandi, and plausible deniability has always kept me out of trouble. After I'd called for fifteen hits, spanning from coast to coast. It was apparent things were getting out of hand. The media had caught wind and urged anyone who lived at 123 Sesame Street, regardless of the location, to go to the police and ask for protective service. 

I stopped calling for hits when my funds were gone. I'd spent everything. The prospect of having to live on my day job salary was sobering. My car was repossessed, and my landlord gave me the boot after the second month of not being paid. All the while the Sesame Street contract kept offering more and more as compensation for finishing the job. I would check the figures every morning while riding the bus down town, slumped in my seat, my soul dying at the thought of one more day peddling iced mochas. 

Doris drove the night bus. She would sit behind the wheel, and I would sit right behind her. We'd chat while she drove. I'd helped her out one night when a drunk started getting a little rowdy. She had opened up the back doors and I threw the puke smelling punk out. She didn't stop while it happened. The punk hit the concrete and rolled into a street sign. We both said it was pretty damn satisfying, hearing him go thud.

Doris is a grandmother. Her grand kids are, ""Young enough to be both dumb and cute."" She loves babysitting them, but hates that their mother plops them in front of the TV most of the time. 

“They need people to teach them, not a vampire.” 

“That’s for sure.” I reply.

“They run around the house, “bla bla bla.” Dracula sounds? They sound like mental patients.” She shakes her head. 

“You sound convincing when you do it. Sure you’re not a mentally infirm blood sucker driving the night bus for kicks?” I smile, waiting for her reaction to reflect in the rear view mirror. She gives me the bird. 

“You’ll be on your own tomorrow night.” She says. My stop was around the corner. “I’m going to a show with the kids.” Doris came to a stop, and while I was stepping off the bus she says, “Fucking Sesame Street Live, you believe that shit?”

“What?” I was standing just outside the door, my back to her.

“People in costumes, dancing around like idiots. At least there’s no blood.” She waves her hand around, as if warding off vampires.

“Yah,” I say, “no blood.”

“Have a good night.” She says closing the doors. 

“You too.” I say, my mind reeling. 

Buying a shotgun is shockingly simple it turns out. Getting said shotgun into a theatre, via a guitar case, is also easy. The general public doors to the theatre we’re not to open for another thirty minutes, but the backstage was frantic. A partially clad Big Bird was shouting for a Fiji. Through the open fire door Grover was railing through Pall Malls like a steam engine. Bert and Ernie were talking with the Cookie Monster about a mother from their last show in Tennessee. 

“She made me keep the head on.” Cookie monster said.

“Fucking furries.” Ernie said. Bert just laughed. 

“Opening in 20 minutes. Assemble on stage for opening rehearsal.” A voice came over the PA. I walked to the side stage, and watched as an assistant struggled to put on Big Bird’s head. They assembled on stage. A swelling of music came from the band behind the back drop. They started spinning, whirling, dancing. They were mocking me. Parading their happy existence after all this time, after I had spent everything to get them, here they were. Finally.

 “RtK: 123 Sesame Street; all.” It ran through my mind as I flipped the latches to the guitar case. The cast had reset at the director's request. 

“I need to see more energy.” The director shouted. “This sets the tempo for the entire show. Move with purpose, damnit!” The director took a breath, his face had turned red. 

“Ready in three,” I slid the action back.

“Two,” The action slammed a shell into the chamber.

“One,” I took a deep breath.

“Action!” 

Entering stage left, I let loose the first shot, and sent Ernie exiting stage right. The band had started playing the opening chords, and each character had started their first movements. It didn’t take them long to stop dancing and start scrambling. 

“One! Ha ha ha.” I shouted, the fake laugh rumbling from deep in my belly. They fell over each other, while I fell them one after another. “Two Ha ha ha.” The air grew thick with pink, purple, and blue fur. “3! Ha ha ha.” The Count was down, his cape spread around him. Bert and the Cookie Monster lay slumped over Elmo. Big Bird had managed to jump from the stage and had started running up the aisle towards the guest exit. I took aim and let loose. The shot was too high, and only made the head of the beast spiral through the air. The second shot hit it’s mark. A puff of yellow feathers drifted lazily through the air. 

The Bitcoins came through after a day of waiting. The bounty had risen to a sizeable amount, enough to cover my losses and then some. Getting on the bus after a, “not so bad,” day of double soy macchiatos I sat behind Doris. We’d spoken about the show, how she and her grandkids arrived at the theatre and the swirling of red and blue lights sent them home again. 

“I doubt they understand what happened.” She was saying. “They’re young. They won’t remember.”

“I hope not.” I say standing up to get off the bus. “Here, for you.” Out of my pocket I pull four tickets. “Les Miserable.” I say.

“Really?” She looks at the tickets in my hand.

“Yah, take them. It’s not a bunch of fluff. They may not understand it, but it’s real people. You know?” I put the tickets into her hand. “Have a good night, Doris.” 

I walk home and fire up my laptop. The Darknet is quiet, only one new contract. “One.” I say out loud, “Ha ha ha.”

[WP] You're a hit-man hired for a high-profile case but only given an address: 123 Sesame Street.,ElectricSkeletor,"He was using the name ""Bob"", posing as a regular school teacher, the kind who would smile and tell you that all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares. Square or rectangle, it was my job that he end up in a box. There's probably a school teacher name for a box, and maybe that would be his last word.

The address led me to a brownstone on a quiet block in a neighborhood I'd never been. I didn't think a lot of people passed through -- pass through to where? A strange street. This was my fourth job this month, but one of these hits was not like the others.

Once up the stoop, I slipped inside and climbed the stairs until I found Bob's apartment. He responded to my knock with a cheery, ""Who is there, please?""

""My name is Al. I'm a kindergarten teacher and was wondering if I could get you to sing the alphabet to my class via close-circuit."" I almost said ""Skype"", but I didn't know if anyone in this old building even had wifi.

The door opened. ""Hello"", Bob's grin was wide and genuine. ""Come in, please!"" He offered his hand and I shook it. Firm grip.

I repeated the fake name and tossed in some bogus background while I scanned the room, looking for places he might stash a piece.

Bob told me, ""I have a videocamera in the other room. We can film it now."" He excused himself, politely, and left me alone. I took that moment to ease my gun out of my jacket. Like a C for Cat, I padded quietly across the room and kicked open the bedroom door. The room was empty. I ran to the open window. No fire escape, just a drop to the concrete.

There was a tap on my shoulder. Forget about squares and rectangles. Bob had circled around behind me. Then one -- ONE! -- punch flew and I crashed through the window, plummeting to the trash cans below. 

What happened next, I'm still not too clear. One can was open and I fell in, and just kept falling. Into blackness. 

A grouchy voice in the darkness called out. ""You're trespassing. Let me show you how we deal with trespassers on Sesame Street.""

Now I know why the street was so quiet. There are monsters all around. Some monsters hide in the light, and others in the dark.

*123 Sesame Street.*

Well, I'm pretty much fucked. 

I'm good, but I'm not that good.

I know what you're thinking. *How on Earth could a bunch of Muppets that sing songs and teach kids how to count be a challenge*?

Let me tell you, those creatures, those Sesame Street denizens...they're demons. Demons of felt and stuffing. They're retired. Mostly. 

I've heard the stories. 

Cookie Monster was a mercenary, fighting whoever and wherever the Feds wanted him to fight. He's a damn berserker, can tear a man in two with his bare hands...paws...whatever. And he works cheap too--he gets paid in cookies. He took out twenty Cartel for a package of Thin Mints.

Word is that CM, as his crew called him, fought with Oscar and Bert during the War. I don't know all the details. The men who served with them don't like to talk about it. But you know how some psychos make notches in their guns for every kill? CM and Oscar did the same thing. 'Cept they counted by tens. And they kept having to get new guns because the notches would get so many, it'd compromise the gear.

Big Bird, he was a sniper. Could hit a man from a thousand yards. And Snuffleupagus...he was in charge of artillery. They could take down entire fleets helicopters by themselves. The bad guys would be blown to bits before they knew what happened. And then when they would investigate, there'd be no trace of the Bird. And Snuff...he can vanish into thin air, some say.

Grover is a science experiment, some say. He's got super-powers, that much is sure. He can fly. And drop napalm.

Count is a vampire...and he's immune to holy relics.

I am beyond doomed.

Okay...I can do this...I can do this...

[WP] You're a hit-man hired for a high-profile case but only given an address: 123 Sesame Street.,ElectricSkeletor,"After I reached the location I opened up my encrypted email account to see a new message from someone referring to themselves only as, ""Verde Muerte"".

The job, take out a drug kingpin who has gotten sloppy in his actions and who is suspected of talking to the feds in exchange for amnesty from killing the people who call this place home.
By now I knew who my target was and who I was working for, in a state of disbelief I head towards my targets last known location.
As I'm walking down this street a flood of flashbacks sweeps through my mind: learning the alphabet and how to count, but it's quickly replaced by the reality of my situation.
The fairytale of what I thought this place was, is gone. As I look left and right all I see is poverty stricken tenants and drug addicts looking for their next score.
A bittersweet tear roles down my eye as I realize that when I complete this job a part of my childhood will die, but the people who call this place home will be relinquished from a tyrant who has led them into a state of utter disarray.
I stop in a diner and have a word with a bird who I grew up watching on television. His feathers have all but fallen off and his demeanor matches his physical appearance. He tells me of the downfall of his community and how any previous attempts to stop it have all but failed.
I don't reveal who I am but promise my large feathered friend that things will change after this day. As I leave the diner I see a glimmer of hope reawaken in this bird that I knew no one had seen in sometime.
As coincidences go, what happened next well, let's just say it's one of those funny moments life throws at you that you have to laugh at.
As I step out the door I see my target, his eyes in a cracked out blaze of glory as they always are. But for some reason they managed to fix themselves on me long enough to focus on the end of my glock 9 pistol.
Without fear or hesitation he asks, ""Who are you?""
I simply respond, ""Destiny""
I fire two shots into his head and look out to check for witnesses.
I see my old bird friend give me a nod of approval from inside the diner on my left. I look to my right to see a stream of smoke from a cigarette coming from a trash can. I look over and a silhouette nods in approval.
My phone vibrates with a message from my offshore bank account: $420,000,000 has just been added to your account.
My phone vibrates a second time with a direct message saying the following:

As I walk away I see the life slowly come back into this city and feel the surge of a hope and peace for these people that call this place home.",HazyAstronaut

He wasn't always known by the name he goes by now. ""Mr. Hooper,"" that man had to pay for his crimes. He had left the business and settled down with a little old store in a nice neighborhood. That didn't undo all the wrong he had done in the world.

"[WP] After receiving perfect score on your final exam, your school is asking you to give a speech on the subject of the exam. Little does anyone know you guessed every single answer.",FearsomeClarinet,"I was getting increasingly more stressed as I flipped through the pages of the exam. I had spent the last 3 weeks studying for the exam, ignoring friend invites, sleep and hunger. I had given my soul studying for the exam and I had walked in feeling very confident. But now as I was looking at the questions, I was becoming overly anxious. I wasn't recognizing any of the questions and it felt like the test was written in a different language. 

In fact, I slowly realized that it was written in a different language. It looked like there were a bunch of dots over the o and it definitely looked like a bunch of the e's and a's were accented. 

Had I walked in to the wrong exam room? No that couldn't be it. I had double checked the room number a couple times before walking in and the test booklet  had my name on it. I might have signed up for the wrong exam. But no, I flipped to the front of the exam booklet and it was written clearly in English that it was the 2016 Final Exam for my class. 

Then why was it in a different language? I looked up at the time, I had wasted 20 minutes stressing out. I had only 40 minutes left to answer 80 questions. 

I weighed my decisions. Either I could try solving the problems in a language I couldn't even recognize, stressing out the whole time while crying to myself. Or i could answer the scantron randomly, leave early and cry my self to sleep at home. 

I decided I would rather cry at home. C looked like a good answer for the first question. A for the second, B for the third spelled CAB. I then spelled DAD, BAD, ACE, and DAB. I then decided to BAA like a sheep a couple of times. The best word I came up with was DECADE. And that's how I finished my test up until the last 5 questions where I put them all as C because it's always C. 

I stood up, turned in my exam and then went home, locked my self in my room and cried to myself for 5 days straight. On the fifth day I had enough. If i was going to repeat the entire year, so be it. The made me feel a little better. 

A couple months passed without incident. Until one random day I received a call from a number I didn't recognize. I answered fully expecting to tell the unsuspecting caller that they had the wrong number when I heard the voice of my principal on the line saying my name. He informed me that he wanted me to be the main speaker for a conference he set up on the subject of the exam I had failed. I informed him that he should find a better speaker as I had failed the exam. He just laughed and told me that I had gotten a perfect score. A perfect score? I laughed back in his face. He assured me that he wasn't joking and he'd expect me to be there. 

Sure enough I received my score a couple of days latter and I had earned 80/80. I was sure they had to be a mistake. I called everyone I could but sure enough everyone congratulated me and told me there was no mistake. How could I have earned a perfect score when I didn't even answer a single question. I had guessed on every question.  

The date of the speech was coming soon and I didn't know what to do. Luckily though, I soon passed away and didn't have to deal with that problem anymore. ",artbn

Little does anyone know you guessed every single answer.",FearsomeClarinet,"An unassuming bluish grey stone gave way under Professor Maria Millworth’s $200 black leather heal. It rolled and cracked in much the same way as the professor’s poor anklebone. It is precisely this event that led to my unfortunately perfect score on Millworth’s notoriously difficult exam. 

The exam ordinarily consisted of three on demand essays that required in depth analysis of the socioeconomic factors leading to the Wamapoke people’s subjugation. Why would I, a student who has coasted through my 4 years here at Indiana State University, take such a class?  The answer is “diversity, equity, and inclusion”. Three quite simple words that mean I quite simply need a class that “challenges or questions the mainstream views of a predominantly white, male society”. Going on a four-day beer and psychedelic mushroom filled excursion to the desert means that “Expression through non-traditional painting methods” was completely filled.   

Poor Millworth’s ankle was so crushed that she had to spend the week she normally spent making the final exam in a morphine-induced joy ride on a sweaty hospital bed. As the other students heard of the tragic news they shuddered and balked in disbelief. Some even wrote get well cards filled with words of encouragement and cute little pencil drawn hearts. I could barely contain my excitement. I was free! Or so I thought. 

The exam was replaced by a 40-question multiple-choice test, or as I like to say, “an exotic wet dream”. I spent the two nights leading up to the exam completely and helplessly drunk. In fact, I was drunk during the exam. Now that I think about it I’m drunk now, but that doesn’t matter. I guessed on every single one of those questions. Every. Single. One. Yet here I am. Standing in front of fifty oddly assembled academics and annoyingly studious college sophomores about to give a speech on the Wamapoke’s economic subjugation. 
     
I crack a smile and adjust my $20 stained tie. 

&gt; “A forty question multiple choice exam.”

&gt; “Each question has four possible answers, only one of them being correct.”
    
 I cleared my throat. 

&gt; “This of course places the likelihood of correctly and randomly guessing each correct answer to be 25 percent.”

By now confused faces filled the crowd, and hushed muttering produced a soft buzz. 

&gt; “If we assume each guess to be an independent event, and I think that is a fair assumption, then the combined probabili—""

Professor Millworth attempted to interrupt me with a raised crutch, but I held up my hand and she begrudgingly accepted. 

&gt; “The combined probability of forty perfect guesses would be the product of all forty individual probabilities.”

&gt; “That means one has an 8-point-three times ten to the negative twenty-three percent chance of a perfectly guessed test.”

&gt; “Essentially you are more likely to be killed by a shark carried by hurricane winds and crushing you to death than you are to perfectly guess on such a test.

&gt; “What would such a result even mean? Existence of a higher power? Psychic abilities linked to alcohol consumption?” 

&gt; “I’ll let you decide”

&gt; “I may not be a good student. I may know nothing about the subject you all are gathered here to listen about. But I do know that I got a B+ in freshman Statistics, and these numbers don’t lie. Thank you”

I scanned the room and then walked past Professor Millworth and her poor, shattered ankle.

Little does anyone know you guessed every single answer.",FearsomeClarinet,"This actually happened to me once. Growing up, I was forced to go to Chinese School every year in the hopes that I would learn how to read/write Chinese (I can only speak it fluently). There's a reason why my writing/reading is still at a first grade level. I basically skipped half of my classes using bogus excuses. I was otherwise a good student and the school was happy getting paid for doing little work so I never got in trouble. 

At the end of 7th grade, I had a final exam for Chinese school. I didn't know after skipping an entire week of class. As soon as I saw the exam, I wanted to tear all my hair out. There were a couple of long passages followed by 8-10 multiple choice questions. I couldn't even read a single sentence and instead had to randomly guess sentences with only 2-3 words that I could recognize. I knew that I was going to get a horrible grade but frankly, I just didn't care. 

The next day, the teacher excitedly announced that there was one student who got a perfect score. I actually snickered, what an overachieving nerd. And then, the teacher called me to the front of class.

I was the nerd who got a perfect score and I was expected to read through the passage as we went through the answers. It took less than 2 seconds for the teacher to realize that I had no idea what I was reading and even less time for her to accuse me of cheating. Everyone laughed at my inability to get past the second word. 

Now, if I got a perfect score on a final exam that actually mattered, I'd be happy. But, that's obviously not how my luck goes. ",freevantage

Drop off the food, another long trek.  Every day Frank is in front of me.  “Another day another piece of bread to bring back, eh Greg?”   Fuck Frank.  Every day Will is behind me.  Will doesn’t talk much.  I like Will.  

Today we got word of a whole Oreo dropped nearby.  “Another day another Oreo, eh Greg?”  Fuck.

We each scoop up some cream.  I carry my share in my mandibles.  We turn around and march back.

We each deposit our find into a pile.  Cream.  More cream.  More cream.  The Oreo was a big haul.  I drop mine in the pile, slicing it as it drops, leaving a small amount in my mandibles.  Nobody notices.  They just drop their cream and go to their nests. 

I don’t go to my nest.  I march along until I catch the empty tunnel.  I step quickly out of line.  Frank doesn’t pay attention to who he’s talking to anyways.  He won’t notice when Will says nothing.

Down the tunnel.  Down a little further.  Down past that further part as well, I reach an abandoned nest.  A few dead drones lay in a heap.  This tunnel collapsed in a while back.  The drones didn’t make it, and when it was re-opened nobody seemed to ever take it back.  I’m not sure why. 

Today I am working on the sky.  It is already blue.  Strands of denim butt up against the carcasses I pushed to the far corner.  It doesn’t take much.  A light smear of Oreo from my mandible to the denim is enough.  Clouds form.  I miss them when I am down here, now maybe I will not have to.  

I am careful not to disturb the strands of grass I have snuck, now that they are yellowing and will crunch under my feet if don’t step between them.  I am careful not to smudge the red jam that makes a crimson sun.  I do not stop painting strands of denim until I fall asleep.

I wake, when everybody else wakes.  I go up the tunnel, then up a little further, until I am past that further part as well, and I wait to hop into my place in the line.  We go on a long trek.  We march under the blue sky – the one that isn’t made of bits of denim, and we march under a hot sun that isn’t made of jam, clouds that are made of something that I can only imagine isn’t an Oreo.  I want to stay under this sky, but I know it is much too risky out here.  “Another day another blueberry, eh Greg?”  

I suppose my sky could stand to be a little more colorful.

[WP] For the last few days people have been randomly showing up at your door with no memory of how or why they arrived.,Lemmings-on-rice,"The soft hiss of the brewing Keurig evokes a sense of calm inside me. I pour a generous amount of cream into my coffee and stir in a spoonful of sugar. As I wait for my coffee to cool down, I close my eyes, take a few breaths and meditate. *This will be a good day. You are a wonderful wife, co-worker and friend. You're hardworking. This will be a peaceful and routine day.* Matthew is peacefully sleeping and I savor these 30 minutes of time alone to reflect and prepare for the day. As I take a sip of coffee, a loud knock at the door forces me to inhale. Coughing and sputtering, I pad across the living room floor and gingerly press my face to the door to look through the peephole. *Spring has sprung, my ass.* This door feels like a sheet of ice against my cheek.

On the front stoop stands a man, somewhere in the mid- to upper-40s, balding, wearing jeans, a t-shirt, and a maroon sweat jacket. I place my hand on the knob and pause, ten different scenes of kidnap and murder running through my mind. Shaking my head, I open the door just enough for him to see my face.

""Can I help you?"" I ask.

""Um... who are you?"" He looks confused.

""What? Who am I? Who are you? You showed up on my doorstep and knocked. Do you need help with something? Maybe a phone to call for a ride."" I look down and am startled to observe his lack of shoes. *This guy is obviously still drunk from last night. Or some kind of drug addict, coming off of a bender.*

""I-I don't think so. I don't know how I ended up here."" He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a phone. He stares down at it for a few seconds, scrolling with his eyes. ""Nevermind, I'm sorry to have bothered you. I don't know what happened last night, but maybe I got blackout drunk, or something. Ha, ha. Although it's weird, because I never drink. And I remember going to bed with my wife around ten p.m. Hmm."" He scratches his head and looks around.

I stare at him.

""I'm going to call my wife and see if she can pick me up. Where am I exactly?"" He asks.

""382 Iroquois Drive. Weston.""

""See that's even weirder! I live all the way across town on East Broad.""

I'm just as confused as he is, but I just smile and shrug. ""I wish I could help you.""

""It's no problem. Again, I'm sorry to have bothered you.""

I close the door and turn the lock as quietly as possible. *God, Matthew, please wake up. I'd feel much safer with you down here, in case this guy turns out to be some maniac serial killer.*

Pulling back the sheer curtain, I peer out the window and see the man standing right by the street in the grass, talking on his cell phone to someone, waving his hands animatedly. I just hope he gets the help he needs and finds his way home safely. Just as I'm about to walk away from the window, a dark blue sedan screeches up to the curb. The rear passenger side door opens and two hands emerge from the dark abyss of the interior of the car and grab the man around the waist and pulls him into the backseat, slamming the door shut in one fell swoop. The sedan speeds away, leaving burnt rubber tire marks in its wake.

""OH MY GOD! What the hell?!"" I stare out the window, trying to wrap my mind around what just happened. Racing to the kitchen, I rip my charger out of my phone and dial 911.

""Hi, um, this is Sarah Williams at 382 Iroquois Drive. I think I just witnessed an abduction!""

Seven minutes later, I'm sitting on the couch, rubbing my hands back and forth on the upholstery when I hear another knock at the door. *Finally, the cops are here.* I open the door without hesitation to a young, dark haired woman in her mid-20s, wearing a navy pantsuit and carrying a briefcase.

""Good morning, I'm Detective Thomas. I understand you reported a possible kidnapping or abduction here recently."" 

*Something is odd. Where is her police cruiser? Doesn't she have a badge or some form of identification?*

""Pardon me, Detective. It could be because I'm a little shaken up from what I just witnessed, but could you possibly show me your police ID badge? I just had a strange encounter with a man I didn't know who just showed up at my door without an idea how he got here and then got pulled into this car by someone who I couldn't see and they just sped away and now I don't know what to think or if I'm in any danger."" Before I know it there are tears streaming down my face.

""Not to worry ma'am, I'm here to help."" Detective Thomas steps inside the house and delicately puts a hand on my shoulder. Reaching into her pocket, her grip on my shoulder becomes vise-like.  She pulls out a long, metal device with a needle-like tip and shoves it into my neck. ""Shh,"" she coos, ""this will all be over soon.""

I open my eyes and I'm standing in the kitchen, coffee steaming in front of me. I take a sip and meditate. *This will be a good day. You are a wonderful wife, co-worker and friend. You're hardworking. This will be a peaceful and routine day.*",SamIAm810

A chill swept over the foyer of an old home with wood panel floors. A dog cocked its head to the side looking quizzically at closed double oak doors.

He said, “Otis?”

The dog’s ears perked up and it ran to the ghost with its tail wagging. Then, it ran through the ghost and gave out a yelp. The ghost followed Otis with its eyes and seemed mildly surprised when Otis passed through him. He had a look of realization as the truth of his situation filled his mind. In his mind he knew he was at home with his dog Otis, but also that he was now dead. All memories surrounding his death returned to his mind, which sparked a feeling of dread. He recalled that he had something to take care of, some unfinished business.


In his life he had a stash and never trusted anybody else with it. Despite his new existence a desire arose in him to destroy his stash, because he knew he wouldn’t like what his family would do with it. He rushed to its location and found it safe. A quick burst of relief hit him until dread swelled back up as he failed to even touch a portion of his stash. He floated about for some minutes waiting for an idea. Finally he thought up a solution to his stash problem.


He quickly moved around the inside of his house and to his satisfaction found nobody else in it. Family was either at his bedside in the hospital or on the way back. Before he put his plan into motion he had a last liability to clear up. Otis barked at him from outside the door of the room he was in. He moved out and led Otis to the back-door and moved through it. Otis followed him out through a flap in the bottom of the door. With enough focus the ghost was able to get a dog toy to move and he tossed it as far as he could. Otis ran after it and the ghost returned to the inside of the house. He set everything up and sparked his plan into action. A roar emitted from the heart of the house and he flew back to his stash. Flames flooded the house and clarity captured the ghost’s mind. The feeling of regret was as painful as the flames would be to his once living self. His rock collection wouldn’t be bothered by the fire… 

Author's Note: I feel I could have done better with this, but I wanted to get something done. Even if it was quickly at the end of school haha. Hope you enjoy it.

[WP] An alternate history of spaceflight,TheFeanorianKing,can i use a time loop?,SoulofThesteppe
"[WP] Some months after the zombie apocalypse,a group of teens return to their abandoned high school and decide to stage a prom.",TheFeanorianKing,"They had found several CDs in an abandoned music shop (*It's like the stars aligned*, said Jimmy, *there's no way there's CDs in here, and there's no way there's still CD shops*) and had even gotten so lucky as to find audio equipment in the same building. 

Slowly and surely, they had found all of the supplies that they had needed to stage an old fashioned high school prom, just like the ones their parents had had before them, back before everything had gone to shit, and back when most of them *still* had parents. 

The gymnasium was dusty and gray, but you would be amazed at how paper streamers, colored lights, and bumping music could hide the stains and the memories. There were three Lurkers in the gym when they had entered. Two of them standing in the middle of the basketball court, entangled in each other as if they were having a prom of their own.

Gina cautiously approached and discovered that one was a police officer judging from the dingy ripped black clothing and dull badge still pinned to his chest, and the other was a plain clothes civilian. They were handcuffed together, metal cuffs digging into both of their wrists, pulling the skin back like a plastic glove, but not enough to get over the bones in the hand. Even after the disease had ruined both of them, it seemed the criminal was still attempting to get away, and the police officer held firm, letting out a low ""Gnaar"" every now and again. 

Gina led them out out of the gymnasium and towards the playground. There she put both of them down and said a small prayer for both of them, a prayer for solace for the officer, and a prayer for forgiveness for the criminal and whatever crime he had committed. 

The third Lurker was stuck behind the bleachers, a teenager that was their age. They shone a light at it and saw that he was a boy who had been bit on the leg. *He must've climbed back behind the bleachers after getting bit, must've thought he could wait it out, probably didn't take into account how fast it would turn him*, Jimmy had said. 

*Do any of you recognize him?* 

*Not me*

*No*

*I don't.*

When no one could name the Lurker, Gina again volunteered to climb behind the bleachers and lure him out. Back before all of this happened, the smell that permeated the cave-like environment would've made her vomit in her shoes, but times had changed, and people had changed. Particularly Gina. 

When she found that she couldn't get the Lurker out safely, she opted to put him down then and there. Before doing so, she called out to the rest of the group, *He's pinned on something, I'll put him to rest and then we can drag him out.*

*Ok*

With surgeon's precision, she stabbed the Lurker in the temple and it instantly went limp, falling down to the wooden floor. No blood came from the wound. The Lurker had been there for a long time. Probably since Day 1. 

Gina took several moments to herself to say a prayer for the unnamed boy. She couldn't help but let her mind wander to the day that he died, wondering what emotions he must've felt before the disease finally took over his mind. Her thoughts were interrupted whenever the music started. 

It was Michael Jackson's Thriller. There were several boo's from the group, and the song was skipped, followed by jeers from Jimmy. Gina shook her head, and exited from behind the bleachers. Two others went back under the bleachers, one of them carrying a white sheet they had found in a house nearby. They both exited later, carrying the now covered Lurker. Gina pointed them towards the playground where she had led the other two Lurkers, and that is where they went to take the boy. 

When the time came for the prom, Jimmy stood at the lip of the stage looking over the gymnasium. He held his hand up to his mouth as if he were holding a microphone and announced in the most upbeat voice he could, *Let's get the party started!*

There were about fifty of them all together, and they all converged to the center of the court to dance. 

Gina stayed at the edge though, hugging the wall, not because she was shy of dancing, but because she was waiting on her dance partner. 

Still waiting. Still praying. ",Dimitri1033
"[WP] Some months after the zombie apocalypse,a group of teens return to their abandoned high school and decide to stage a prom.",TheFeanorianKing,"""Billy, you were able to find streamers?!""

""Yeah, there was a party store that was relatively still in tact. All the candy was gone, but I was able to come up with a few decorations.""

Billy turned back to fastening the last streamer to the wall. Lindsay looked around the gymnasium and held back a few tears as she saw the shattered window panes covered with freshly painted wood in the schools colors: maroon and gold. There were cardboard cut-outs of fish adorning the walls, waves painted above them, pipe cleaners fastened together to resemble coral sat as centerpieces on each table, and Thomas sat at one painting light bulbs blue.

Lindsay asked, ""Is it safe to put paint on light bulbs?""

""I honestly don't know, Linds, but we're gonna find out. What's the worst that can happen? You hear from the others yet?"" 

""Yeah, Janey said she was able to find Mike and Denise who knew where Jewel was who found Mark hiding out with Rick, George, Jamal, Sarah, Sienna, and some girl Rick knew. Larry's bringing his brother and Toni struck out. She apparently went looking in the bad part of town and nearly didn't get out. She was pretty shook up. I told her not to go over there, but you know Toni, she does whatever she wants.""

""Jesus. That's it. I was hoping there would be more of us, but I guess we should be thankful that any of us made it,"" said Billy as he climbed down the ladder. ""I did what I could to give us the whole 'Under The Sea' vibe, but James was the one who had all the ideas. I just did what I could with what I heard him telling you.""

Lindsay stared past Billy as a tear rolled down her left cheek. ""That asshole should have given up on finding Rico. He was no good. I don't know why he couldn't just move on. If we all survived, there has to be more and at least one of them is going to be gay.""

Thomas gets up from the table and pulls Lindsay into his arms, ""your brother was looking for the only other person he knew that understood him. It sucks he's gone, but he went out respectably. I probably wouldn't have gotten out of there if not for him. It was just as much my idea as his to head into the Zone. Let's not rehash this. We got more prep work to do to make tonight special. Why don't you go see if Janey is back with the others? Billy and I will start rooting around in the boxes to see what kind of food we can put out.""

""O...Ok,"" Lindsay stammered out as she turned towards the green double doors that led to outside. Her heels clacking filled the gym as the boys rifled through the boxes of canned goods.

""Ugh. I got like three cans of creamed corn and six of green beans. You?"" Billy inquired.

""One corned beef hash, two chicken noodle soups, and a buncha ones with missing labels. Guess we're gonna have to find out the hard way."" Thomas shook his head as he chucked a shiny aluminum can back in the box. ""What're we going to do for music? Can't have a prom without dancing, right?""

""I haven't figured that part out, man. Didn't Mark play in band? Maybe we'll get lucky and the band room isn't totally looted. It wasn't on my priority list, so I didn't even check.""

""Yeah, I think he was. Hope he learned to play more than the crap they played at my games... That was some weak shit they used to bust out in between plays. You ever hear Lady Gaga played by a brass section? Don't. Not that that will be a problem we're gonna have anytime soon. Hell, I complain about it, but I'd love for that to be my only problem right now. I still can't get used to this. I had scouts at my game two weeks before it went down. They were talking full ride outta here. Might have even been able to go pro if it worked in college. Now, we're just putting together this distraction for God only knows why. Tomorrow is still going to be bullshit. Trying to scrounge up some food, build up the shelter, hope no looters find us. And that's assuming another horde doesn't come back.""

""Dude. I hear you, but relax. That's tomorrows problem.  I need the distraction. Lindsay sure as shit does. The only time she's smiled since it went down is when we came up with this idea. It's dumb, but a little piece of the old life is a good thing. Let's start cracking those cans and find out what's in them. We got an hour until it's going to be dark and I don't want to fire up the generator or waste any more candles than we need to until everyone is here.""

""Yeah, I got you."" Thomas grabs a can and cracks it open.

""Lindsay!!!"" shrieks Sarah as she runs across the baseball diamond. ""OMG. I can't believe you made it! I seriously thought we were the only ones left, and I did not want to be stuck with them for the rest of my life!"" 

Mark rolls his eyes as he brushes past the embracing friends. ""Yeah, like I was really looking forward to dealing with a cheerleader and her bullshit in the middle of an apocalypse. Be fuckin useful for once and carry some of this shit. How ya doin, Lindsay? Good to see ya.""

""Hey, Mar-""

""Shut up, Mark! I help plenty. Why don't you go find your stupid hallway and brood like you do and get away from me and Lindsay!""

Mark squints menacingly and turn towards the school. He half waves behind him and as he lowers his hand he flips Sarah off.

""Where is Janey and everyone else?"" asks Lindsay. 

""Oh, they wanted to stop by The Pit and see if any party favors were still left. Probably tastes like piss by now, but we never finished that keg we got before the world got fucked. Plus, Mike had some plants growing that hopefully no one else happened to come across.""

""Oh my God, I haven't thought about The Pit since everything went down! We totally need to go there after prom and light a bonfire. It'll be just like old times!""

""Totally! Let's head in. I can't wait to see what you guys did with the gym! Janey told me all about what James had planned!""

Lindsay stops in the middle of the pitchers mound as Sarah keeps walking.

""What? Did he not get the decorations? That would be so weak.""

""No, he didn't make it back. He went looking for Rico and Thomas was with him. They ran into a horde of those monsters and he didn't make it. Thomas barely made it back."" Lindsay stared down at the mound and dug her foot into the dirt. It was comforting. She hadn't thought about softball, but she wanted to throw a ball at that moment. Just to feel in control over something.

Sarah grabbed her up in a hug and took her hand to lead her back to the gym. ""I'm so sorry. Janey never said anything.""

""I told her not to. I didn't want you guys bummed out before you even got here."" She sniffed loudly, shook her head and said in a brighter tone, ""Let's get ready to party! Tonight is going to be great! Prom!!!""

The girls squealed and raced to the gym.

I am sure that was running through most of our minds, or mine at least. Camped out in an abandoned house, the we huddled around a fireplace, taking stock of our supplies and biding our time. 

I looked down at my supplies. All I had right now was a crossbow, a few bolts, a survival knife, a pack of beef jerky, and iodine tablets. 

I looked over to the girl next to me. The first thing that stood out was her eyes. Her gaze, even before fighting eldritch abominations, was known to shoot daggers in a haze of piercing blue, partially covered by her blond hair. Her name, Megan, was also much better at rationing than I am. A sheathed rapier rested by her side, along with sealed bottles of water, two packets of beef jerky, and the book *Oh The Places You Will Go*.

Next to her was Ashe. She brushed her brown hair out of her eyes as she tallied up all of our materials. She cleaned her glasses, and recounted. And recounted. I couldn't blame her. Waiting was monotonous. She herself preferred a bow, and in her possession was 17 arrows, a small canteen, a flask, and a can of nuts.

""We are already low on materials. Do we really need to be going out of our way for this?"" The voice belonged to Mia. In the back of my mind, I agreed with her. Partially because she had a point, but mostly because she was the one with the bolt-rifle and the loaded handgun. Other than that minor intimidating fact, she was very easy to get along with.

""Eh. We've dedicated. Might as well follow through, right, Nathan?"" The only guy bold enough to openly object was Ryan, our smartass and pack mule. He bore a wide grin and laugh lines, even during the zombie apocalypse. His standard shovel and giant pile of various foodstuffs lied before him.

Nathan, on the other hand, was the brains behind whatever the hell we were doing. Coincidentally, he was also cranking a hand generator, charging an iPod. ""If you are going to dedicate, then you spin the crank, jackass."" He muttered, pushing up his glasses. He was even worse at rationing, with only a bottle of water left.

Collectively, we laid out all of our possessions in front of the fire. An iPod, three iPhones and a blackberry, a generator, a mess of chargers, and a portable speaker made up our electronics. Our weapons consisted of a bolt action rifle, two semi-automatic pistols, a composite baseball bat, a makeshift shield fashioned from what seemed to be the metal lid of a trash can, a saber, a knife, a bow, a crossbow, a nailgun, a hammer, a crowbar, and for some reason, a copy of Justin Bieber's hit single, *Baby*. Our rations, carried by the ever talkative Ryan, consisted of several cans of veggies, nuts, a few bags of beef jerky, iodine tablets, a few six packs of beer, and water. All of us were careful to conceal the rest of the contents in our bags.

A quick mental evaluation showed that we could last about three days if we stretched our rations. 

""We've dedicated. Might as well go through with it."" I say, quietly. Ryan grinned and began packing up, the others following suit.

It was going to be a long walk.



We used to drive down the street every day on our way to school. Frankly, I was hesitant to continue. Even in the summer, it was cold. That was what we get for living so high up, huh? 

We approached the school and with a well placed shot, entered. We carefully navigated around, slowly making our way to the gym. As planned, we parted ways and headed into our respective locker rooms, where I finally pulled out what I had stashed at the bottom of my bag. My second most prized possession, my tuxedo tee-shirt. 

I wore it with a pair of worn jeans and I stepped out into the gym, putting my bag on the bleachers and setting up Nathan's music, a surprisingly bad mix of country, nightcore, and classical rock. I would have to berate him later.

(( I am sorry. Phone is about to die. Need to finish later. Sorry for forcing you people to bare through this abomination.))

"[WP] Some months after the zombie apocalypse,a group of teens return to their abandoned high school and decide to stage a prom.",TheFeanorianKing,"“Monterey Trails High School. Class of 2009, we now present you with your Prom King and Queen!”

At first it seemed like a stupid idea. The six of us joked around the campfire about how the zombie apocalypse ruined our final year of high school. Then we started conjuring up the idea about going to prom. We talked about the colors we would wear. Liara and I decided red was the best. Anthony and Leilani, the newlyweds, picked gray. Jeffery and Micah never planned on going to prom, so they loved the idea of going to prom in casual clothes.  We would then go to the steakhouse couple blocks down the school for dinner, and then hop into the limo and on to prom. It was good for our spirit to think about this stuff; to believe the zombie apocalypse didn’t take everything from us

Then we actually did it. We raided a bridal store during our last supply run. We made sure we holstered a weapon with our suits and dresses. My dad got us the limo and he actually wanted to chaperone us as the limo driver.  The steakhouse was cleared the day before prom. Anthony’s mother took our order with a shotgun around her waitress uniform. It was unbelievable to us that Micah’s father found a cow at a nearby ranch for this dinner to happen. We were convinced we had to eat saltine crackers and jelly for this special night.

The limo picked us up and then we headed to our old high school. Jeffery joked that if he would see Mr. Jackson he would blow his brains out for giving him an unfair punishment years ago.

The day the town evacuated was the very same day prom was supposed to happen. As we anticipated the prom decorations was still there. My mother switched on the lights and it was beautiful. Paper mache stars streaked across the ceiling. A bright ball hanged in the center and white drapery reached every corner of the gymnasium. Liara almost cried. I admit I teared up, too. 
The dance was put on short. We only stayed for only an hour. Liara and I were crowned prom king and queen, but we all took turns wearing the crowns. For a moment, time stood still. All of us were aware that the dead walks, but tonight the living danced.

What would be a minor unplanned event on Earth, or a 'small' oops, could instantly kill us all.  We are not some libertarian society up here.  We can't afford to be.  You know that.

[WP] A teenager living in an orbiting community gets pregnant.,TheFeanorianKing,"When the Mortanis 9th left Port Carson after a six month garrison stint it was with one more member than expected.

Corporal Willem Locke was rolling a lho-stick, the mild narcotic a source of relaxation for the junior NCO. Others bought packs of the stuff from the sutlers and victualers that always accompanied a Guards regiment but Locke took pleasure in making his own from loose leaf as a way to while away the time. The rest of Fifth Platoon was taking advantage of their leave to relax or else catch up on much needed affairs. Sergeant Rutger and Private Shaw were placing a game of Morris, the clicking of the black and white pieces pairing with PFC Welles' battered radio. An old Mortanis tune played on the tired machine, the static laced speakers squelching with the sound of drums and brass. 

Private Piet Morrow, Throne help him, he looked like a puppy-dog the way he just sat there smiling at his newly wedded wife. The two were sitting off in a corner, a drop-cloth keeping the worst of the ship's grim off their clothes. They were seventeen standard years old within a week of each other and it showed in their bright eyes and blind affection. 

Young Leza Morrow nee Traylor was already starting to show, her clothes just a centimeter too tight at the waist. Three months or so the doctors said, the results celebrated with much carousing by the soldiers and a stern word from the Colonel. Still he officiated the wedding and joined the two together in eternal matrimony and all that chilo-dung. All Locke knew was that he woke up the day after with a thundering hangover and four hundred thrones less than he started the night with. 

Piet Morrow glanced his way and smiled, that same stupid look that Locke knew he once wore. He returned the smile and nodded, knowing how much the boy looked up to him. His new wife said something and Morrow turned to speak with her, forgetting Locke and leaving him to his own musings. The older man smiled again, banishing any lingering gloom from his mind.

"[CC] First time writer here, and I would like to be criticized (Constructively, of course)",TheQuakerOatsGuy,"Alright quick notes before we really get into this. The story feels a bit disjointed. It is hard to follow what is going on because a number of things are either glossed over or mentioned in a roundabout way. Here's what I gather from your story:


For some unknown reason something drastic happened to the Earth and it's mantle.

The main character fell through the mantle, but didn't die, he has some sort of immortality or resistance to bad stuff.

He's been used to explore the Earth's rust/mantle/stuff.

He's old now and wishes he could be normal again.

Something weird is going on at Yellowstone.

Our main character is sent to investigate and as per usual jumps into the mantle/core of the Earth.

Unexpectedly he finds himself in a chamber with 13...somethings and asks for mercy which is not given.

He dies in that chamber and the people outside freak out because this is unexpected.


---


Okay, that's something, but I don't know what all this is going to. Why is our main character asking for mercy if he's kind of over life? Who is the Earth Mother? What's calling to him? Who are these things that are punishing him? Why are they punishing him? Why does he know that he must appeal for mercy, has he encountered these things before? Why does the ceiling falling kill him, or does it? What am I supposed to take away from all this, what's the theme?


You throw in lines like:


&gt; This new way, to the entrance of the volcano(?) was much more difficult, it was little more than a game path, and the the animals did very to maintain the path aside from preventing it from being overgrown.


Which don't really add much to the narrative or the characters. We don't really need to know the path was maintained by animals moving through. We can mentally jump from the point of entry to being there or better yet use the travels as a learning moment about the characters, something like:


""This new way to the entrance was little more than a game path, trodden by animals on the march. I could smell the musk of caribou and the wolves that stalked them. A shiver rolled up my spine as a hidden dread crept along my mind. I was used to being the wolf, stalking through the world and yet, I felt now only as the caribou, watched by hungry eyes.


See how I merged the path and suspicion sections into a single thought/theme. We get across the path being taken and the beginning of doubt/fear. Every sentence you write, every word should in some way serve the narrative, don't just put in a line because you need something to get characters from here to there. Every moment is an opportunity to inform, to pull in, and to inflict emotion on the reader.


&gt;That is inconsequential. The will of the north cannot stop progress.


If it's inconsequential, why open with it? Furthermore, it may be inconsequential to the main characters, but probably not to the others following him. If you want to use this as a character building moment I suggest talking about what the rest of the team is doing and what our main character is doing to create a divide between their actions and his. Something like, ""Those with me scurry to secure shelter and brace, but it is inconsequential to me, I stand and embrace the white assault, letting it pass over and through me, a mountain that the skies will breaks against.""


Also, what is ""the will of the north""? Problem is that I'm relating the will of the north back to those 13 things, are those the same? Or is it just a phrase with no links to the rest of the story? Problem is you build up nature as an antagonist, but it doesn't seem to go anywhere

Further, remember, word choice matters:


&gt;I look ahead, a great mountain towered in my path.


Look is a very passive verb and implies little, try simply taking it out and linking it to the previous storm, ""Soon the wind burns out, and the white blanket falls, opening the path ahead and before me, a great mountain towers. or use a better verb, ""My gaze reaches to the path ahead and then scrambles up the sides of the great towering mountain ahead.


&gt;The guide made a gesture, informing the group that we had reached the first fork in the road.


Try to avoid sentences like this ""The guide made a gesture"" because that only serves plot, and poorly. Tell us hat the gesture is! Here, ""The guide's hand shot up to his left, all four fingers up, thumb tucked, and we stopped. He pulled all but his index finger down, circled in the air, and then drove it leftwards. We had reached the first fork in the path to the mountain's heart.""


Unfortunately that's all I have time for. Most important takeaway though - I don't understand your story yet.

[TT] You have inadvertently caused the historical event that you have gone back in time to research.,absurd_aesthetic,"As the bullet escaped the chamber, he knew he would hit his mark.  Three years they had gone, behind his back.  This wretch, in his mind he always knew but-- no matter.  They could start anew.  It was the 20th century, after all.  He had never stopped loving her, and this stain on their union would be washed away with red.

As the round hit the wall behind his opponent, he fell to the ground.  Finally, it was done.  No more secrets, nothing behind his back.  He had defended his honor, and saved their marriage.

The next few days were strange.  Everyone saw it, except for him.  Well, he probably saw it too, but chose to ignore it.  All that mattered to him was their life together.  That and his photography.  He loved being a wedding photographer.  Seeing the young happy couples, forever capturing their love in the pictures.

*Fwoosh!*

The powder would burn briefly, and brightly, and then disappear.  In the short moment, he would take his photograph.


Chicago was as bustling as ever, and work was booming.  The Columbian exposition was in full swing.  Never before had he been so proud of his city.  It had given him his childhood, the love of his life, and now it was giving back to the world.

He spent an inordinate amount of time at the fair.  For the time, getting out of the house seemed wise.  His wife had not been herself since the duel.  ""Well,"" he figured, ""I'll give her some space.""

As he looked around the pavilion, he was amazed by the fantastic exhibits of the fair.  Exotic foods, feats of technological marvel, and towards the back..

There was one booth that caught his attention.  Unlike the others, it was not nearly as crowded.  In fact, nobody was there as far as he could tell.  He walked inside, and one of the men approached him immediately.

""Hello, good sir!  Tell me, would you like your name to go down in history?""

""Huh?""

""We've been working tirelessly, see!  We've had success with some of the rats, but nobody wants to be the first pilot!""

""Pilot?  What are you talking about?""

""Time Travel!""  His words were nearly as wild as his hair.  ""We've been seeking volunteers, but nobody has stepped forward.  Most of them laugh when they hear it, but this is God's truth!  We've done it!""

He began to step backward, and the strange man continued.  ""It's not entirely optimal.  We can only go back 43 years right now.  But if you volunteer, we'll let you choose where you want to go!""

At first, it seemed unbelievable.  But the man and his associates seemed so confident.  He thought for a moment.

""And you're saying I can choose?""

""Certainly!  Come back at this time tomorrow to sign the release forms!""

He ran home with a great idea.  He told her about the plan, which she, of course, dismissed as impossible.  Time travel didn't put bread on the table.  But he would show her.  All his life he had captured the love of others in his camera.  Perhaps, if he could capture his own, the moment twenty years ago when he knew she really loved him; knew that she could never love anyone else--

It would be a surprise.  All she knew was that he would go back to the fair tomorrow to take more pictures.

He awoke early the next day, and she had made him coffee.  It was surreal, really the first time she had acted as she once had before the duel.  She even packed his equipment.  It was time to go.

""I love you,"" he said, as he stepped out the door.  She walked over and kissed him, but would not return the words.  Nevertheless, it was the first time they had been intimate since the duel.  It was a step, he thought.

""All we need you to do is sign here.""

""And I can go back to the day we met?""

""Of course!  We've already dialed it in.""

He checked his equipment to make sure he had it all: camera, flash powder, film-- everything was there.  She had made sure of it.  He signed his name.

*Jack Sampson*

""Okay Mr. Sampson, we need you to sit here.""  The device was entirely unbelievable.  The pipes, the dials, it seemed to have no purpose.  Any sane man would have left, but Jack was driven by love.  He would try anything to save his marriage.


His head hurt, but he was alive.  He fumbled out of the machine.  It had worked.  He was back to that moment when they first met on the O'Leary farmstead.  He covered the machine with some of the nearby hay, and hid behind one of bales inside the dark part of the barn.  As he took out his camera and readied the powder, he saw them.

A young couple, strangers than but who would grow to love each other, as he knew.  He wanted to capture the first moment their eyes met, and they smiled at each other.

They neared each other, and he readied his camera.  As they began to look, he triggered the powder.

*Boom!*

Just as brief as normal flash powder, but it quickly overtook him.  There was no time to think about it.  She had switched it.  The bitch had switched it with gunpowder.  Now, in the moment of his death, he knew it.  She had never loved him.  If she had once, she didn't anymore.


Jack heard the boom from the back of the barn and stepped in front of the girl.  Who knew what it was.  At that moment, he just wanted to make sure she was safe.  As they started to back away, he began to see the smoke.  He told her to run, and he followed her, as the barn went up in flames.  He could feel the heat on his back, and he knew the fire would only get worse.  Eventually they stopped when they couldn't run anymore.

She looked at him, and he looked at her.  She thanked him for saving her.  He didn't know what to say, he just--

She kissed him.  The world seemed to melt around them.  He knew the fire would grow.  Some of the neighbors were starting to shout.  It didn't matter to him.  As long as he had her, nothing would stop him.  Not even the ""Great Chicago Fire,"" as the papers would later call it.

After all, she would always love him.",Tappyy

It is late afternoon on the warm shores of the eastern Mediterranean. The air is jasmines and cinnamon. The sun oozes into the sea, and scatters upon the mountains. Beyond the mountains, Nineveh, the jewel of the Assyrian Empire, is being sacked. You know this because you have seen it from many perspectives. 


Yesterday, you watched the Medes from the crumbling heights of the walled city. Tomorrow, you rode with a Median warband, directing assaults upon that very section of wall where you were yesterday.


But today, you need rest. Reflection, analysis, study. Your notes are spread across the beach, fluttering in the wind, anchored by old sandstone pebbles.

""And still,"" you argue, ""What would a criminal achieve? The Persians empire is decades away. Cyrus is yet to be born, and any mercy would be short-lived.""

You appear before yourself, one leg unwieldy in the soft sand at the edge of the waves.

Saying this, you vanish in front of you.


You sit on the beach, staring at the footprints you made being eaten by the sea.


""The concubine? She has to be the rogue. Is she the rogue?""


You appear in front of you once again. ""She has to be,"" you tell yourself, ""Two years ago she comes in from the southern desert. No baggage, no food, no water. Her skin still smooth. Little micro-scarring. An accent that nobody recognizes.""


You vanish, and you vanish as well.


An echo in the wind. The notes flutter. The pebbles hold.

It is early morning. Just after dawn, but not yet morning. A fog made of cold and ash. A great walled city that trickles into fire and corpses in the streets.


An armored detachment protects a man sobbing on the ground beside a severed head.


""The king!"", he wails, ""The Lord of Assyria is dead! Woe to us, woe to us, woe to us!""


A woman emerges from a shattered ruin singing. A miracle in amidst a massacre. A glimmer in the shade. Untouched by the battle, immune to the ash and the blood. Unadorned by age or starvation. Her eyes are neither dead nor dying.
The concubine from the southern desert? Definitely!


Another time-traveller? Unsure.


You are hidden behind a collapsed wall. You watch her movements, her gestures, and listen for her accent.


The concubine crouches, whispers to the sobbing man. She coos. The accent is hard to place.


You appear behind yourself, ""I see her emerging from behind a dune two years ago. I cannot move closer. I sensed a lot of radiation. She is the rogue.""


You wait, and you watch.


It is now night. Grim faced warriors sit facing the fire, but there is none in their eyes. Dark as the shadows in this city of blood. Prayers are heard. Prayers of supplication and mercy.


In a crimson tent, the concubine lies with the new king of Assyria. What plans do they make?


The king is walking out. He looks to the sky, to the north, and walks off. A chance!


It is warm in the tent. The concubine reclines upon the ground. Her fingers dipped in a bowl of mercury. A dead Assyrian King lies on the floor. A solitary torch flickers. Her face lacks breadth. She is calm.


""Before I kill you, tell me what this deviation is meant to achieve,"" he growl, hoping for menace, but your voice is full of tremors.


""Love,"" she laughs, her sound is a lullaby.


Movement outside. Speed is necessitated. A quick gesture from his wrist. A microscopic dart filled with death. A death rattle and sweet gasp.


The guards walk into the tent, arms raised, and see the concubine dead on the ground, beside the dead King of Assyria.

It is now evening. A naked oasis in an endless desert. Yesterday, you die of radiation. Today, you lie asleep in the arms of the woman, head upon the soft warmth of her breasts. Tomorrow, you assassinate her. And six years before, when you see the Mediterranean glimmer, raw and azure, you gather sandstone pebbles and make notes.

There are only two pages after that.",theverybestideas,"""That's it, I've had it!"" the bearded man exclaimed as he dropped a thick, leather bound book in my hands. ""In all my centuries as a chronologicer, I've never chronicled someone as boring and idiotic as you!""

The bearded man stepped back, allowing me to appreciate his absurd outfit. He was dressed in floor length purple robes and bedtime slippers. Underneath his right sleeve, I noticed an ornate brass wristwatch with multiple faces that climbed up the entire length of his forearm. I looked around, but the parking lot of my campus was empty, with the exception of my 1998 Ford Contour.

The man pulled up his right sleeve and began furiously tapping the many faces of his wristwatch. Right before tapping what seemed to be the final button is his lengthy sequence he looked at me and said, ""Use that book to figure your shit out lady! You were suppose to be greater than this!""

He then looked up at the sky and exclaimed, ""I quit!"" 

What then followed can only be described as a magnificent flash of white light that flooded my entire vision. After several seconds, the white light disappeared revealing the parking lot to be empty once again with the exception of myself and my Ford.

I stood still for several moments as I collected my thoughts. Clearly, something was wrong with me mentally to have just had such a vivid hallucination. I felt the heavy book still in my hands, but refused to look down. It must be one of my textbooks, probably the one for my neuroscience lecture, that was one beast of a volume.

Slowly, I moved toward my car and opened the door. After carefully placing what I assumed was my textbook on the front passenger seat, I buckled myself in and turned the key to start the car. Normally, after seeing such an illusion, I would probably dissuade myself from operating a vehicle, but I had a test tomorrow and needed to get some sleep.

I drove carefully through my sleepy town without the radio to focus fully on the drive. It was only a 15 minute drive from the parking lot to my dorm, but I stretched it to 20, driving extra slow in case I had another episode. As I drove, I tried to dissect the vision to the best of my abilities.

""Come on Albert, you can't get suspended on the first day again, you'll never graduate."" The bully smirked, and touched his wand to Ned's forehead.

The man on the table spat blood at the surgeon, a feat the surgeon didn’t think was still possible in his current state. “Fuck you, I know your weird power, everyone does, you can’t fucking kill me no matter how hard you try. All I need to do is wait 3 days, you can’t stop us, no one can.”

The surgeon wiped the blood off his glasses as slowly and drawn out as he could without saying a word, carful to leave a little blood on the lenses. “Be that as it may you’ve only been in here 3 hours and you know that you can’t die while in my presence. That does not mean however, as you already know, that I can’t hurt you. I think my drawing on your chest and stomach really brings out the starvation they put you through. Here, takeve a look.”

The surgeon looked up and from behind the only bright light that beamed down on both occupants of the dirty and dark room a full body mirror was pulled into place to give the terrorist a nice view of his body.

“I really think cutting the heads off your nipples served as great eyes, what do you think?” The surgeon waited a few seconds and when it was clear the terrorist wasn’t going to talk he continued. “You know before this I was just a normal surgeon, saving lives and what not. That background I have, it gives me information others may not know about, mainly about keeping you alive and awake no matter what. You think you’re so tough after only 3 hours? Let’s see how tough you are after another 3. I wonder how much muscle I can strip away before you break; the record is one and a half legs, can you do any better?”

“You can’t kill me! I will never talk.” The terrorist yelled at the surgeon and buckled uselessly in his straps.

“You know, they all say that.” The surgeon said as he turned and looked at the terrorist, one eye obscured with the reflection of light and the other marred in the other’s blood. “I can’t kill you physically, but just as you people broke me by murdering my family in front of me, I too can break you mentally. Because in the end, the difference between killing you mentally and physically is negligible, but my power only prevents one from occurring, can you guess which one that is?”

The terrorist screamed in ear piercing agony as the surgeons hot metal drove into his right calf. The guards outside the door shuffled uncomfortably at the sound, hopefully it will end soon.

He squirted a little on the table. The deer man charged almost immediately- his antlers became stuck in the wall giving John the perfect shot.

John repeated it until there were no more bouquets. The last point of damage had to be done up close. He pulled out his skinning knife and waited for the charge from the swaying, nearly drunk from bloodloss, deer man. ""This is only delaying the inevitable John. You'll have to leave soon, for your own sanity. Let me help you!"" The deer man screamed as he pushed onward, right into John's knife. 

The splashing sound of blood was satisfying. More satisfying was the music ending, bringing John's pulse back to normal. After raiding the body, he walked towards the door- and saved the game.

John set the controller down. The sun was right at that beautiful peak and the laughter of models of real humans laughed outside. Today he'd make a friend, he just knew it. He grabbed his jacket and flew down the stairs, ready for whatever challenges the models threw at him, so one day he could just like them- or better.

"[WP]Killing Hitler has become a sport amongst time travelers. Points are awarded for creativity and difficulty. You are last year's champion, how did you win?",King_of_the_Hobos,"Somewhere in the swirling eddies of time and space, drifting in between strands of possibility and inevitability, curving around gaps in the branching questionably-dimensional fabric of Reality, there is an asteroid said to be the pulpit of God himself, where He will stand in the end times to preach to all Creation.

Early reality travelers, upon reaching this asteroid, jumped forward to the last possible moment ever to see if these claims were true, and when they reported back that they were not, a bar was promptly built on the spot.

That bar has over the course of what may loosely be called several years become the semiofficial headquarters of the semiofficial Hitlercide Championships, as it makes a convenient meeting point for the Council of Hitler-killers as well as the contenders and victors of each championship. The bar has become an even better tourist destination than it already would be thanks to this, and throngs of people crowd into it at all hours, drinking and laughing and watching the death of Adolf Hitler and trying to catch glimpses of the past champions.

The Hitlercide Championships have been going on for some time now, and there are many champions to see: Axe the Axehand, who circumvented early time travel's difficulty with weapons by replacing his left hand with an axe (victory by decapitation); ex-basketballer Jeremy Shawn, who took advantage of later and more improved technology to bring an entire basketball court with him to one of Hitler's speeches (victory by dunk); and Wilhema Harrison of New Jersey, whose only special attribute was a striking similarity to Hitler's own mother (victory by heart attack).

Besides all of these, there is one man known only by the name Sal whose method unsettled the judges and general public to such an extent that he is never approached by any fan or fellow contender, and due to the nature of the Intertime Sports Bar can be fairly certainly assumed to never be approached. He sits in one of the many corners of the bar, looking unassuming in a sweater and grimy spectacles while he nurses a small glass of something barely potable. His victory occurred thus:

On April 30th, 1945, time was running extraordinarily short. (If one waits until after Hitler's accepted Real Death Date, they are automatically disqualified.) Hitler was sitting in his quarters inside his bunker, alone. Then Sal appeared, looking absolutely unconcerned. He was threatened by Hitler, but managed to convince him not to alert a guard of any kind. He asked Hitler very simply if he had any plan to kill himself, and received a negative reply. At this point Sal sat down, and had a conversation with Hitler lasting between thirty-six and ninety-eight minutes. Then Sal vanished. Nothing further happened for several hours. Hitler did not move or speak. Finally, he stood, left the room, and shot himself. 

Upon Sal's return, there was neither applause nor heckling. Instead, there were three officers from the Offices of Temporal Reality, who took him into custody on charges of (and this next part is always said in a hushed whisper) contaminating the main timeline. Ultimately he was released, and the contents of his conversation were permanently confiscated by OTR agents. People with very, very high security clearance in the Real Temporal Government have tried many times to access it, and only one even received a piece of its description: ""A moral appeal."" 

No one is sure whether to persecute Sal or praise him. Some are unsure he did anything, while others believe he did something incredible. As with much time travel, nothing is certain.

The man in front of me only smiled. He had a sort of sagely air about him. Yet he looked so vulnerable, floating upside down in his giant tub like that, with his white hair floating upwards. 
 
""And why do you suppose I made this city into the prison it is?"", he asked me cheerfully. It did little to hide the bitterness in his voice.
 
*""Actually, I don't.""*, I thought to myself. Why *did* he turn it into such a prison?
 
""It's because the world would go to war with us if they found out what goes in this madhouse of a city."", he explained. ""Not that I'd care, mind you, it's just that I'd hate to have to go to war with the outside world.""
 
True. That would be pretty lonely, living in the last remaining human city. And what a shitty city to be the last, too.
 
""I see. So is that why you've been killing us all off, then? To get rid of the all the incriminating evidence? I suppose that would be most convenient."", I said.
 
""Ah, so you knew, eh? Well, no surprise there, you clones always were smarter than you looked. If it makes you feel any better, growing you and your sisters was never my idea anyways, it was some creepy old researcher's.

"[WP] You are a clone, one of a hundred. You chose to live in hiding to protect yourselves, yet these past 2 years someone has been murdering your siblings. There are only ten left.",OfTentaclesandMen,"The concept was simple.

Have one human being engineered to resist all debititating diseases currently known, a feat which was made possible 20 odd years ago.

An entire body, with each and every cell being able to defend itself from nearly any form of intense destruction, and capable of not only reproducing lost cells indefinitely, but to control when perfectly. Any dna irregularities that made deformities were erased, other features enhanced. IQ was (arbitrarily) to 145, 
physical growth limited to 6 feet, with average muscle mass, aging no older than 25.

An immortal being, of which to experiment on indefinitely to form cures to sell to the world, forever. This was the end thought-process of the mad scientist, Dr. Larkin. Not sell immortality to the world and solve nearly every major social problem known to man.... but harbor it for personal profit. 

This successful test subject was then cloned 99 times, in case long term effects were discovered, or if selling patient-zeros became more profitable than harvesting their immunities. It was under constant observation, living only to serve the greed of Larkin, until he escaped, freeing every single clone in the process.

This clone... the original one at the least, was me. I then took the liberty of hiding my brothers around the country, secured from funds I stole from Dr. Larkin, making sure each of them understood hiding their identity was above all else.

We lived across the country, secretly exchanging information via obscure websites with our own coded messages to give warnings of searches. This worked perfectly for almost 20 years, until last month the News reported that Dr Larkin, and all of his team, were subsequently murdered with absolutely no leads. It was the lead story for almost three days.

Given the fact our creation was from a government division, there was no way their deaths were being covered up. I held a skeptical sigh of relief, only from the fact that if they had no clue who killed such a prominent branch of their own people, how powerful were the forces that did?

Over the course of the month, coded messages appeared which all described the same thing; someone was following them. After that, nothing. I held a search with a fellow clone, and we discovered almost 80+ clones were killed, their bodies all missing, but murder confirmed by the residents we paid to hide them, all of which could not give any detail on WHO killed them, or what they looked like.

The last residence's I visited was also a friend to us, Malcolm, whom we confided our situation, as he was quick to not only accept our money to manage our discreet family web using his computer prowess, but to fight in his opinion the corrupt nature of the government.

""What I don't understand is how they died.... I mean all of you are immortal right?"" Malcolm asked, checking the security cameras around his house for movement.

""We are immortal Malcolm, not invincible. We are incredibly resistant to death by natural deterioration if the process slow, such as bleeding out or repeated head trauma, but a bullet to the head is more than enough."" I explained, questioning why he was more on edge than usual.""

""Well considering there's only 10 of you left, I'd start thinking increasing your living radius around the world, at least make it harder for them. I mean you guys are fucking immortals... you could change the world if you simply amassed wealth, and gained clout. Cure human ailments.... the shit i would do-""

""We'd be slaves to those in power, a future I do not want for anyone. Past experience was a perfect example."" I said, slowly noticing all of his windows were locked, and his room completely wiped clean of his fingerprints.

""Comfortable?""

Flint blinked past the throbbing pain, and through the sensation of a thousand fiery needles driven through his legs.

""I have woken up in better Places,"" he said, realizing only after the words left his lips that answered in similar Elvish. Not the warm, mercurial alt-elvish but something harsher, tasting like venom on the tongue. Unseelie. 

A veil of red covered his vision, blurring the shapes of the darkened room further. He thought he saw other things swaying gently, the chains strung throughout the room creaking. Judging by his own sense of nausea and his arms hanging above his head he had a rough guess as to what they were. 

""You are an interesting Man, Hilary Flint. But in the End just a Man. This is Our World now, to do with as We see fit.""

Flint laughed grimly at that, his numb fingers tracing an endless path through a pool of drying blood as he swayed. 

""That is the Issue, is it not? Us Humans are stubborn Things. You will sooner make the Sun set in the East than to defeat Us.""

""Is that so? Tell Me, Flint, where is Your vaunted Mankind? Hiding in Tunnels, crawling about scavenging among the Ruins of Your former World. You are Rats, Vermin, Slaves.""

The voice was distinctly feminine, her accent upper-class, nobility. 

""If You are going to kill Me, I would ask that You do it sooner rather than later. My Head hurts something fierce,"" Flint said.

She laughed cruelly and Flint felt fingernails brush themselves against his face. 

""Oh my dear Pet, Death is a Gift that I am unwilling to grant. I believe I will thoroughly enjoy Our time together. You however, may see it otherwise...""

"[WP] ""Swinging gently from a hook through his ankle, he awoke to the sensation of his own blood falling lightly on his face"" NSFW",QuidProQuo_Clarice,"1453 - Lebrange Keep, overlooking a small swathe of land in France known as Provence

The chain was made with two massive hunks of iron, interwoven with one another. I had watched it and others like it produced in our blacksmith's fires. Being the spymaster, it was my responsibility to have my eyes and ears peeled, to understand the systems that support our kingdom. Even the most simple ones had to be watched, such as the blacksmith's duty to create tools of war and craft.

The torture master was a short, vile man with deep lines of grime and blood running along his skin. He was shouting commands to his servants as I waited patiently, my mind elsewhere to avoid the stench of misery and decay. Sharp tools were pulled out of dusty crevices, restraints were ripped off of mangled corpses, many bodies were stacked up against the far side of the dungeon wall, ready to be made into fertilizer. 

The man I was concerned with hung from the ceiling by his ankle. A rusty hook was embedded into his calf. He dangled hopelessly, like bait on the end of a fishing line. The man's name was Charles. He was the court jester, and one of my assistants spotted him sleeping with the Queen. After I had delivered the news to the King, I thought my job was finished.

No. Apparently the kingdom's main head of intelligence, who's seconds were counted in gold lost and made, was supposed to act as a mere lacky to make sure ""The son of a whore gets what's coming to him"".

""Your majesty if I may suggest an alternative"", I had tried to tell my king, ""how about you make a list of specific demands for the torture master and I'll have one of my men deliver it to-""

""NO! The man is illiterate, and it is far too disgusting for me to go down there myself. I want YOU to go in my place, and make sure he suffers.""

So here I was, turning Charles into a human instrument. Literally. 

We drilled a hole through his entire body with the head of an elongated, red hot nail. Then we used a heated bellow to blow hot air through his body. He screamed and screamed, and the hot air whistled as it blew through the man, melting him from the inside out. 

The music we made that evening made the torture master cry tears of joy, a masterpiece he called it. I was just happy for it to be over. It took an hour for Charles to die, but finally at the start of dusk I left the dungeon.

I had to hurry, any minute now the Queen would be undressing for her evening bath, I didn't want to miss it.

I don't know, she's always been there. The last house on Forest street. When my family and I moved here, she came and brought us cookies. Nice lady. Really nice. Sometimes my friends and I would just walk behind her house after baseball. Great white fence; Looked as if it was always freshly painted. It was kind-of weird, her house was always in great condition. But there was always one thing... the sheep. The kids called him Bob. (I know, original, right?) The lady didn't have a car, so she never left, (That we know of.) One day Bob would have a nice wool coat on, the next day, naked. The kids would laugh at throw stuff at him, but the next day he would start over with a full wool coat again. The first time we saw this, we got scared and told our parents. Of course, they'd laugh and wouldn't believe us. Right at the end of Forest street, there was a giant woods. It stretched until the next city, over 12 miles away. The woods was thick as heck for the most part, but in some spots were nice and clear. During summer days, we'd play baseball in one of the clearest openings in the forest. This was called the rut. One day, when going past the lady's house from playing at the rut all day, we noticed Bob was gone. A lot of the kids started freaking out, as if this was one of their pets.

I watch, hidden in my tree stand as a group of men in suits stalked through the woods. The man in front was holding something, but I couldn't see what until he turned to face me, hearing the brush rustle beneath the tree.

He held a squirrel in one hand, a small wool cap in the other.

Granted, I know that they would come for him eventually, but to be the one to instigate the backup plan, it was ludicrous to think of. But there I was.

First I leveled my rifle at the man in front and shot him in the chest. He only seemed... annoyed. All of the agents immediately homed in on my tree so I dropped out of the stand and pressed the button on my watch to alert the community that he was in danger. First I dashed to the left and saw the agents leveling a platoon of Magnums at me. I flicked the bauble on the top of my own knit cap and dived back under the cover of smoke, crawling into the brush and throwing everything in my pockets and on the ground around me to rustle the bushes and cover my escape.

""Five on, find him. Else wise hunt the target.""

Six agents crouched with their guns outstretched while the rest fled into the forest.

I was reaching for the bauble again, when my daughter appeared in a burst of flame blasting back the agents. ""Mom, where are the rest?""

I chose Griggs since he hollows after giving up his quest to follow Logan and conceding that he could not be a great hero like his teacher.  I at the time of writing this sort of felt a parallel between the son in my story and Griggs story even if it's not that really very strong.  It just seemed the most right to me out of every character.  After I started writing it, I knew I wanted to use dark souls names.

I also chose Anastasia because she's one of the few named fire keepers.  Since, the bonfires are a place to return to and to give comfort to suffering undead.  a bit of a stretch since Anastasia herself isn't actually that comforting but Quelaan just didn't read right. I thought about pulling from dark souls 2 to be a name for the wife since besides Anastasia being a fire keeper I wasn't too happy using that reference.

""I used to donate sperm for money when I was younger. These are all technically my kids, your half-brothers!""

""Oh. Okay. I'm done eating, may I be excused?""

""Sure, Jimmy. Don't forget to finish your homework.""

The next day, I began my search; The list wasn't ordered at all, so I had to just go down one by one. The old fortune-teller's words rang through my ears, and I didn't want to die at the hands of someone I created out of a need for money.

The first I found was Mark. He seemed very sweet and I saw a great family dynamic when I approached the house, so I decided to move onto the next one, hoping to save time. 

He lived in Colorado, so I had to settle for a phone call. I pretended to be a newspaper, and asked him a few questions about his family life and whether or not he was happy. His answers were hesitant, but it seemed he loved his family and had no idea he wasn't fully his parents children. *Besides, he lives too far away, right?*

My third try elicited something far more menacing, and only a block from my house. I met with a boy named Sam, who was dressed in all black and looked...displeased with everything. He had a t-shirt of his favorite band and it was some violent metal artist, his face looked pained and angry. 

*This might be the one.*

I talked to him a bit, and while he resisted opening at first, I think the idea of talking to a stranger was more comforting to him than dealing with his family- bingo. He told me about how his dad is abusive, about how his mother barely acts like she loves him and sometimes he wishes he wasn't born. Apparently his father once told him that he's not a real son, due to the sperm donation, and now Sam is upset that whoever his real dad is left him with one that treats him so poorly.

*This has to be it. I'm going to spend time with him, and eventually break him the news- that should ease his mind and maybe he won't kill me.*

I spent most of my free time with him, trying to make him happy and showing him what a true father is. It seemed to be working, because when I broke the truth to him, he cried and hugged me. 

*I'm safe.*

That night, I went home to celebrate with my family, but my wife was gone- apparently it was some yoga lesson, or something to that effect. When I stepped in the house and reached for the lights, a blade punched through my heart, dropping me to the ground as the cold of steel bit at my flesh.

I looked up, desperately wanting to know how I could've failed. How my efforts led to nothing after all this.

""You love that other boy more than me, I know it,"" Jimmy whispered, shaking and sobbing. ""Why do you love him more than me? I try to be a good son, but you go over there and spend time with him while I sit here alone....why don't you love me, dad?""

[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"""Ok, so you're certain it's the **SEVENTH** son. Not, you know, the seventieth or something?"" Michael asked Vikus slightly desperately. 

The local fortune-teller had shot to worldwide fame when his predictions were proven to be 100% accurate. The little boy who had grown up in Michael's town had become a superstar. Knowing him had its perks - he easily locked down his first appointment with the man.

But Vikus didn't exactly spare him on the details. In fact, he seemed positively gleeful sharing terrible facts. But he could have made a mistake this time - Michael had spent years donating his swimmers, after all. Maybe it wasn't the seventh son, after all.

""Indeed. Your murder approaches in three minutes, actually,"" he added helpfully, peering at the tarot cards. ""Mmm...let's see. The only way you'll avoid it is if you...mmm. This is difficult to read.""

""Well, it seems a pretty fucking important detail. Could you hurry it up?"" Michael snapped, glancing behind him to see if he could spot someone sneaking up on him. He thought the worn little building in the corn field had been chosen for its ominous atmosphere. A marketing gimmick. It seemed less comical and more sinister, now.

""Wait a few minutes, maybe it'll become clear,"" Vikus said finally, caught up in a trance as he stared at the cards.

Michael glared at him suspiciously. Vikus had his eyes closed and didn't notice. 

""And how do I know you're not my supposed murderer?"" he asked, looking at the fortune-teller closely. 

Dark hair, slightly large nose, square jaw: their features were eerily similar. Somehow, he'd never noticed that before.

Vikus looked up and stared at Michael. The fortune teller's eyes were his most famous feature: piercing green. They seemed to be glowing. Michael stared at him, fascinated. It was difficult not to. If he stared at you for more than ten seconds, it was rumoured he'd reveal a life-changing fact. 

""You shouldn't have drunk the tea,"" Vikus said finally, glancing down and shuffling his cards. 

Michael dropped to the floor, foam forming at the edges of his mouth. Vikus chuckled slightly to himself, locking the door. After making sure his father was truly dead, he dialled a number on his phone.

""I got him,"" he said. ""Tell the others, will you?""

He dragged the body to the corner of the room and covered it up, then carefully placed six chairs around the table. It had taken a few years, but he'd got the central ingredient for the spell. It helped that he'd grown up in the same town as his father. That had been a stroke of luck his siblings could only dream of. 

They arrived slowly, robed in black from head to toe. Vikus resisted rolling his eyes. Dark wizards did have such a taste for the dramatic. What was next, matching tattoos of skulls?

""Welcome, my brothers,"" he began slowly. 

""We have much to thank our father for. Though he never used his latent power, it was passed down to all of us. Secondly, he's kindly going to feature in our special spell tonight. Remember, some of our brothers may still be out there. We won't know until we pool our powers, and read one another's visions. This spell has never been performed before, and there are dangers. I won't deny that. But just think - pooled, our powers will be more potent. More powerful, and infinitely more dangerous. Are you ready?""

""*Hell* yeah,"" Seth, their youngest brother, burst out. ""Just think what we'll be able to do. Let's rock this bitch!""

""Okay, settle down, Seth,"" Vikus snapped. ""Let's just start this. It's supposed to take a few hours.""

They joined hands, and started muttering the words. In the linked circle, one of the brothers' eyes snapped open. None of them knew of his prophecy, of course. That one brother would betray the others. That only one would have the power to stop the spell. 

He examined his feelings of disgust for what they were doing, his revulsion for his brothers. It had taken all his tenacity, all his cunning to fool them about his loyalties. He had an idea who the traitor should be. But he had no idea how he was supposed to do it.

He stared at his father's corpse, paralysed with fear as his brothers' chanting grew with intensity. How was *he* supposed to stop six dark wizards? Was he supposed to let the spell be completed, so they had access to one another's visions? Maybe one of his brothers had an answer to his question. Trouble was, then they'd know about him.

The sweat ran down his back, as he listened to the chanting, and shivered with indecision. Not a familiar feeling for him. ",inkfinger

[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"It was after work on Friday when the witch told Mark ""Once you see your Seventh son, you will fall dead"".  Mark scoffed at her and continued to his car, eager to get home to watch Friday night Football.

Saturday morning, Mark woke up and drew his curtains to watch the sun rise like he did every morning.  He made coffee and ate breakfast while watching CSI on Hulu.  The victim this episode was a 18 year old, male found without ID.  He had nearly forgotten about the witch until the CSI investigators ran a blood test and found the victim's father.  ""I never met the kid"" the father said, ""I used to donate sperm so that might be where he came from"".  Realization hit Mark like a big rig hits a deer.  
*I used to donate sperm* thought Mark. 

He spent the rest of the weekend researching ""Seventh Son"" theories.  The results chilled him to the bone.  ""I gotta find the bank I donated to"" he said to himself.  ""If only to find out if my sperm has been used"". 

He skipped work Monday and Tuesday.  The search for his paperwork was too intense for him to put it on hold.  All the while he couldn't help but think he might unknowingly run into his Seventh son while out and about.  By the time he found the receipt on Tuesday evening, the donation office was closed. 

Wednesday he went to work.  Instead of riding the bus like usual, he car-pooled with a co-worker.  His son could be anywhere and he wasn't taking any chances.  When he sat down at his desk, work was the last thing on his mind.  He called the donation office. 

""Hello, this is Blow-Ur-Load Donation Office. What can I help you with?"" said the young lady in a very rehearsed way. 

""Yes.  My name is Mark Tenenger.  I donated a few years ago.  Is there any way I could find out if my sperm was successfully implanted?""

""I will have to check records.  We recently went completely digital and haven't quite moved all the physical files over yet.  I can call you tomorrow if that's alright?""

""That would be great!  Thank you!"" said Mark as he hung up the phone. 

He got the call Thursday afternoon.  ""We found there were no successful inseminations for a Mark Tenenger.  It's all been disposed of due to the amount of time they were unused.  If you'd like to donate mo-"" Mark slammed the phone down in triumph.  He had nothing to worry about.  That fool of a witch was wrong.  He had no sons, let alone a Seventh Son.

Friday morning, Mark was found dead by his window.  His hands were still clutching his curtains.  The thrill of the new day coupled with the sight of the bright sun stopped his heart instantly.

[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"The hour struck midnight and the vision disappeared. So he lay down in bed again and waited to wake up from this strange dream. Seven sons? Even the thought of four children seemed absurd. 

He looked over at his girlfriend sleeping fitfully beside him. Even in his dreams she was always worn out. The two of them had too many plans for their lives for many children, Even the thought of one was a far distant hope; once she got her promotion and his business took off, then yes, but seven? 

Curling in the blankets he lazily imagined why this sort of dream would even come about? Then his mind traveled slowly over the struggle they had both overcome to get there. All the long nights working to pay through collage; her unpaid internship and waitress job, his donating plasma and . . . 

Suddenly he sat up, sweating despite the chill that had crept up his spine. He had been a sperm donor. 

***

His focus was shaken by the sound of his girlfriend’s alarm. His eyes stung from the sleepless night on the computer, trying to dig up his rights, trying to find where his seed had been sown. 

It wasn’t until that moment that he realized that he hadn’t woken up. It hadn’t been a dream. She was blearily getting out of bed as he pulled his clothing on. He only paused to give her a kiss before running out the door, she was too sleepy to ask where.

***

His college town was four hours away. It was still dark outside as he tore down the nearly empty highway. By the time he arrived, the clinic was just opening. He had to develop a plan, an excuse at the desk to see the information. He thanked his past self for deciding to not be anonymous.

After some tears and lies about genetic diseases and a change in religion, he got to see the files. He flipped through pages of happy couples and their pudgy faced children, all of them faintly resembling the photos over his parent’s mantels. It wasn’t until he turned to the last page that he gave a sign of relief. Six, only six children.

With new, more genuine tears, he requested his samples be terminated. The nurses were gracious and assured him that it would be done before the day was out. 

***

It was noon by the time he crept into their apartment. She would be at work for another several hours, he could catch up on sleep. The premonition had been a warning, saving him from a fate he couldn’t have even imagined.

But as he lay down on their bed, not even bothering to undress, he realized how ridiculous it had all been. The strange fear from some strange almost dream, it sounded more like a plot for one of his books than reality.

As he was about to close his eyes, he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. She was calling him. Blearily he answered and half listened as she began talking rapidly. She sounded so happy, so excited, almost on the verge of tears.

“Did you get the promotion?” He asked softly.

“No, not yet,” she said, “I’m pregnant.”",DarthSlatis

I was never worried about blindness anyway, it was the least of my worries.
 
I knew hidden in the family history was an illness that had no boundries. As my son stood over me I wondered how I had produced a viable product.  How was it that their screening didn't show some sign of my curse 7th of the seventh.  

My owned a farm, one of the last family owned in town. He poured himself into his work just to barely break even.  He tried everything to keep us afloat, he even tried to sell his soul. the towns people laughed at his craiglist post, ""My soul for my farm and family's well being."" All but one.  

A person with - what seemed like limitless funds - wanted our farm to flourish, no soul required and all she wanted in return was our sacrifice.  Our 7th's.

We never believed her, even what I was born. The 9th son.  But that was until mom ran off with the other man and the cause of my two siblings red hair and freckles was brought to light.  That was the day... that horrible day when the curse became real for me.  Took over me and I realized I believed in curses. I had to.  My father was to blame for the accident, no one knew that truth outside the family.  I couldn't be blamed for the horrible accident with the tractor, I knew it was the curse that made me murder him.

My father died in my arms and now the man standing over me was about to do the same.  The curse fills you with lust, you can't avoid the 7th. I thought I had figured a work around. I didn't have any children of my own. Instead I fought the lust the only way I knew how. I had stayed away from women off the printed page and yet here I was.  I became homeless just to ensure no woman would have me.  Curses don't come with fine print, I wish I thought of a better loophole.

Another vehicle accident to wreak havoc with the Johnson family, another moment between father and son that left me unrelentingly hopeless.  My son had become a man, one I never knew or planned to.  He was driving his car when the curse took hold and didn't let go until what was called for happened. 

With me it would be quick, I felt no pain below my wait, just adrenaline and blood flowing through me, out of me.

The man came to me and I had to ask ""Was your mother artificially inseminated?""  Aghast, he didn't answer, my guess is he thought I was in shock, dying. But I pressed on ""Do you live near the clinic on Broadway and Chelsea stress, please I have to know?""  A pause, he studied my bloody face, beneath the dirt and grime I had purposefully accumulated he saw familiarity and family.  He saw me for who I was for a brief second and whispered ""dad?""

I caught him in his silent thoughts of ""could it be"" and told him of the curse, what I had tried to do to stave off the hairy hand of fate. My time was ending fast, My words poured out too slowly. He didn't understand. Time was running out.  He saw only the crazed homeless person, not the man I was only the shell of a human I was.  As he ran I yelled after him ""Don't have seven children, you're cursed, you're cursed!"" ",nerp27

[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"The old woman stroked my hand, 
""You will be killed by your seventh son"" she murmured.

I laughed, pulling my hand away.

"" I don't even have sons, only two daughters,"" I replied as I walked out of the fortune booth.

See, it was august, I was a 44 year old, slightly balding, middle executive and I had taken my family to an amusement park for a day of fun.
My wife was waiting for me outside, Sharon, her eyes as bright blue as the day i met her. She was no longer as lovely as she once was, but I loved her all the same with an affection that was  cozy and sweet.

""So what did she say?""

"" Oh, stupid, mumbo jumbo, My seventh son is fated to murder me or whatnot,"" I explained, sarcasm evident in my voice.

""So morbid"". She shook her head.

I shrugged and waved to my daughters , Maria and Elena, who were riding the gigantic ferris wheel in the center of the park.

""Well, the sun is setting, it's about time to be going home,""

After a few more fun hours, we all loaded ourselves into the back of the truck. I flexed my wrists , preparing for the long drive home. All the way home, I sang silly songs and made stupid jokes to entertain my family. Sharon, could not stop laughing and Maria let out some, ""you are so silly, daddy"" as I spoke. In and out we drove, though little towns and down large highways.
the horizon looked like freedom and I remembered my younger days, when i loved nothing more than to get on the open road, playing as a backup musician from different bands.
Those days I slept with many beautiful women, I went to many different places, hell I even got to meet Carlos Santana once. but nothing gave me the same joy as being a father, my wife Sharon and the kids, they steadied me.

We pulled up to a two story house on a cul de sac. It was in the kind of nice neighborhood parents move to went they are looking for a safe space to raise their kids. Two pink bikes in the garage,  and a perfectly spaced array of germanium surrounded our front sidewalk. 

Maria and Elena were asleep. I walked in and open the door to my house.
The house was spooky in the darkness, eerie, floorboards creaked as I felt along the wall for a switch.

""Nice house you have here"" a voice floated from the darkness.

""Who was that?"" My heart started to pick up. It's thudding bum bum was all I could hear in my ears.

""Your son. Or at least one of them, you seem to have forgotten all about us?""

I stood in confusion for a moment, feeling like my world was about to crash.

""What sons?""

""Oh, sorry, I guess we didn't matter because we weren't actual sons, right, not kids that you loved.."" the voice came closer. a beam of light from a flash light alit a face.

He was young, so young.
It was the strangest thing, with his greasy jet black hair, his piercing green eyes, the awkward shape of his nose, he reminded  me of, well me.

It was like seeing your doppelganger in the mirror except you never knew he'd existed.
I didn't know how to feel about him, unlike my daughters he wasn't made from some tender moment of love making, sweet words whispered on a beach during a Puerto Rican summer, he was just some furious spurts of semen in a cup. While wanking it to a picture of Jennifer Aniston, yeah, when she was hot.

I couldn't even truly comprehend that he was mine. 

"" Yeah, I knew you wouldn't know what to think when you saw me. I bet you've never thought of me once, but I've been thinking of you for years,"" the boy helped himself to a seat at my couch.
""You know,"" he said conversationally, "" they just give sperm to anyone these days. Even some stupid bitch like my mom. She was a fucking drunk, an asshole, but she wasn't too bad, you know during the few moments she was sober she might have remembered my name. And of course, there were the numerous boyfriends. Who would use and abuse her, beat or punch her and sometimes me. But you know, a few took a great liking to me, not that bitch was around to know about it,"" here the boy's voice pinched with venom, he took a deep breath and continued.
""And you know every single night I used to cry for you. To help me. I used to dream that my real father would show up and hug me, tell me everything would be all right. But you were nowhere to be found.""

He put his feet up on my table.


""I've been following you for weeks now. Watching you and your dumb bitch of a wife. Stupid spoiled brats you call daughters. Watching you tuck them in at night, read them stories, all these wonderful nice things, *Daddy*""

I heard footsteps behind me, my wife and the two little ones.

""Please,"" I pleaded, "" Can we sort this out later? I promise I'll try to do something, do right by you,""

The boy smiled cruelly, lips curling upwards, "" No, it's okay, *Daddy*, I don't want to hurt your stupid wife or daughters, just you

I'm going to take from you daughters every second they stole from me""

I barely saw the gun rise, just a dark thing at the corner of my vision

[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"The Brazilian gypsy's predictions began small-time, and quickly became disturbingly accurate. First, she predicted a low-odds baseball game. Then, all the games in the 2004 World Cup semifinals, three weeks ahead of time. Then, the stock market crash.

Then, the tsunami. 

She wouldn't let Greg pick, and gave out one per session, and held sessions at unpredictable times when she'd summon him with a phone call, and he had no idea where she was going with any of it. He did use some of the predictions to make wild crazy bank, though, so he wasn't about to hop off the train.

The last one caught him really by surprise. The woman never told him anything about himself, and he almost forgot that that was what old future-guessing ladies mostly did, when she popped it: he would die by the hand of his seventh son.

He laughed and asked what again? She repeated herself. ""Is this for real?"" ""Yep."" ""That's retarded, I don't have seven sons! I don't have any kids at all!"" ""You sure about that? You're a buff stud, never sowed any wild oats?"" ""Yeah but I'm careful, there's no fucking way I got seven girls pregnant and didn't about it, how the -OH FUUUUUCCKKKKKK THE SPERM BANK ""

The gypsy was watching him intently and started beating and screaming in laughter. ""Got little Albert Einsteins running around huh? Hey at least you got to pass it on""

He told her to stop laughing and tell him how the fuck to get out of it. He was told that he couldn't, fate was fate. He asked why the fuck did the crazy bitch ever tell him then? She shrugged and said, ""Just wanted to see your face.""

Greg didn't lunge at her like some people, but he did get really het up. ""You're a fucking freak, you know that? What kind of person gets off on telling people shit like this? What the fuck are you, some kind of sadist?

Go fuck yourself, I'm out of here. I'm done being jerked around, you can shove your phone calls. Fuck off, I got what I wanted anyway!""

""Yeah, me too!""

--

Greg had a brainstorm. If he was going to be killed by a son, then all he had to do is never share a room with a younger male for as long as he lived! He just had to go and check everyone's ages now in the employee roster...

Word soon spread about a stone-cold rich ageist who would hire only young women and never young men, drawing comparisons to gaudy dictators. In reality, Greg was a perfect gentleman, with a great deal of his manners owed to reduced sex drive from a really hardcore vasectomy.

It had been a decade since he had interacted with a younger man through anything other than a phone or computer. Restaurants, airplanes and taxi services all knew his preference. The latter was most trouble - women, as it turns out, aren't keen to let strange people into their cars and drive them around.

Their current chauffeur had served in Iraq and sometimes forgot that she no longer drove a vehicle that could go through homes in a straight line.

""Man, I hate this turn, especially in winter, you really have to be careful about the..."" She was right, you had to be careful. The car slid on black ice, sideways down the slope and right off the embankment, wheels up into the frozen water.

Greg got banged up on the way to upside down, but he was way calmer than most people would be in that situation. Can't die yet, no sons involved. He started to work himself free, of the seatbelt, but he was tangled in it and had a surprising amount of difficulty telling which limb was which.

And the water, was there an open window? How was it pouring in so fast? He just had to reach... but his nose was already getting submerged.

No way... who? But there's only one... The driver?..

Greg yelled to the struggling driver: ""Hey! HEY!""

The driver had managed to free herself &amp; turn right side up, she was trying to knock out the window. 
""Let me get the window, I'll get you out I promise""

""Are you really a woman?""

""What??"" 

""ARE YOU REALLY A WOMAN?""

""What the fuck- OK I'm trans, how - why - oh, fuck it""

The window broke, water poured in and Greg watched his wayward offspring disappear into it.

And if he weren't trussed like a turkey by the seatbelt that was going to drag him down, he would have laughed and slapped his thigh, just like the gypsy had done.",proterozoic

You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"When I came back from the War, having spent the last decade or so killing Nazis, I decided to settle down in a small cabin home not too far off the coast of Nantucket. I found work on a ferry boat and eventually saved up for a small yacht of my own. I named her triumph. Rich folks would come up from new york city and charter my boat, i took them out to sea in the morning and by sunset id be nearly 50 dollars richer. It was a good gig while it lasted. Triumph served me well, I have had many memories of her. Some sad, others great, and one in particular that I find just peculiar. 

It was late december and I was getting ready to get into bed. In fact i just threw the last bit of wood into the fireplace when there was a rap on the door. I was dressed in my longbottoms and hesitated at first to answer, but the incessant knocking irritated me so that i hollered  ""hold your horses damnit"" and threw open the door. Outside stood a rather bewildered looking man and a woman with delicate features and a small frame.

""good evening, sorry to bother you at such a time"" the man blurted out. He spoke with a slight hint of a german accent that i came to recognize from my time serving in germany. Still standing in the doorway, I looked at him suspiciously ""yes?""

""I do believe you are ze captain, yes"" he asked while the woman stood shivering. Poor thing, i thought. ""please, come in"" i gestured towards the fireplace. the woman smiled as i moved from the doorway to let the strange couple in. The man took of his hat and took a seat, gently swipping the snow off it into the fireplace, making a satisfying hiss.

""How can i be of service"" i asked, gesturing towards the kettle. ""yes, tea please"" the man nodded. He seemed to be of my age, not quite young but nowhere close to middle age. ""Excuse, me where are my manners"" the man grasped into his coat pockets, fumbling around and retrieving a wallet. he took out a hundred dollar bill and slapped it on the table tapping it quickly a few times. ""For your services"" the german smiled.

I stared at him for a second and turned to the lady ""tea?"" 

""yes, please"" she replied, taking off her hat as a queue that she was welcome to stay. ""alright, so what brings you folks to way out here in the dead cold and dark evening"" i asked pouring the steaming kettle.

""well you see, we'd like to charter a boat, and there was no one in town so we walked and walked and it got dark....""

""and you started knocking on my door"", I sat down in a chair across from my visitors. ""how did you know i do charters"" i grabbed my mug and sipped from it staring at the woman. ""we read an ad in ze times"", the man pulled out a clipping from his pocket with my photograph and triumph in the background. ""My wife, she insisted we come to you"" the man said bringing the mug to his mustache.

""she can be very persist.....Aaaaahoooow"" the german spilt the tea on hid trousers, jumping of his chair while doing a jig to spill the boiling tea off his pantlegs ""bathroom?"" he questioned. I cleared my throat and pointed to the only door in the cabin. ""im afraid theres only an outhouse"" the man grabbed his hat, excused himself and briskly walked out into the snow shutting the door behind him.

i looked at the woman ""dont i know you from some where?"", she looked me in the eyes as she sipped her tea ""no, i dont think so"", i ran my hand through my hair. ""whats this really about, whats your name?"" 

She looked me in the eyes ""Mary Ann Trump""

She put down her mug, ""I'd like you to know that we named our donny after you"" she said smiling.

[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"As I walked thru the door of Shanghai in, The Aroma of Asian   cuisine smacked me in the face causing my already anxious Stomach to rumble with anticipation.

""TABLE FOR TWO PLEASE!"" The sound of busy conversations throughout the packed restaurant first causing me to raise my voice and also reminded me why I choose this for place for my first date with Simone.

bits and pieces of information breaking into my consciousness, ""...General Tsos' Chicken"" "" ""The Wonton soup is sooooo Good here""
its easily the best Chinese food in town, hell its the best I've had anywhere.

However that is not the only reason I come here. I try not to come too much dont want to wear out my welcome or over use this place.  Im not sure if it'll last forever. you see, well I'm not sure how to say this without sounding a little bit crazy, but here goes.

I've been coming here since I was a 16. I remember it like it was yesterday. I was on the way home from Practice and my parents were out of town, I figured I could grab something to eat on my way home. I came in, ordered and waited patiently. The 1st spoonful exploded in my mouth with flavors I had never dreamed of it was  like someone had finally turned on my tongue to show me what food could be. I normally eat in under 10 minutes but I savored ever drop
""Sir?...Sir??..Excuse me Sir!?""  ""Oh sorry I guess I was lost in thought"" I chuckled.  ""Your Table is this way please follow me"" stated the hostess. I glance around before Obliging Simone should be here by now I knew she was too good to be true. 5' 8"" athletic Bright green eyes young and dazzlingly intelligent. I slowly trudge towards my table hoping to buy as much time as I can before sitting down. ""your waiter will be with you shortly"" chimes the hostess before strutting back to the front. 

The waiter comes by but I inform him i waiting for someone and to give me about 5 more minutes. 

As I sit and look around at all the different types of dishes im reminded again of why I really come here. Where was I.... Oh savoring every last drop. 

I Finished eating and and gave the waitress my money. She returned with a receipt and a Fortune Cookie.

I thanked her and  slowly cracked open the brittle treat. determined not to glance at the fortune into it the cookie was gone, personal rule. Once again my tastebuds were thrown into bliss.. How can something so simple taste this good? 

as I headed outside I nearly forgot about the fortune as I stuck my hands into my pockets to keep warm and felt it crumple against my fingers.

I pulled it out and it Read Plain as day ""Justin, take the long Route Home."" At 1st I freaked out, I thought about walking back in to ask  them who put my name in the cookie. but didn't want them to not let me back thinking I was crazy or something. the food was too good. 

I started taking my usual Path but the fortune kept playing in my mind. So I listened and honestly im not sure id be here if I didn't.

See the Next morning on my way to school I noticed the gate I normally run my hands down as I walk to and from the bus stop was badly damaged like a car or something had ran into it. I asked around and apparently a semi truck driver fell asleep at the wheel the night before and rode up on the sidewalk right around the time I would have been there. 

After that whenever I had the Chance I would go to that restaurant sometimes it was something simple. ""Justin, you have a pop quiz tomorrow in Biology"" Other times It was Just as insane "" Justin, Buy stocks in Apple"" I didn't even know what apple was the time but I listened. I made enough to live ""comfortably"" but I try to keep my financial situation out of my dating life id like women to like me for me not for what I can do for them.

Just as I had figured I was going to eat alone Simone walks in, easily the most gorgeous creature in the room little Black dress hugging her skin so closely I had to stop myself from staring.. don't want to scare this one away. 

I stood up and waved her over. as she walked over I stood up and pulled out her chair who said Chivalry was dead?

Simone as I said before Is Drop dead gorgeous. we've chatted and talked for months at the coffee shop I go to in the morning but I finally had the courage to ask her out a couple of days ago. I didn't know how she would take it. but she was more than happy and actually told me she was beginning to wonder if I ever would.

We ordered our food and I started casually talking about more personal things and eventually got to the topic of kids.

""So Justin... Do you have any Kids?"" 
Not that I know of"" I joked. 

""Interesting, Id expect a man of your ...Quality would have a few.""
""Well, I decided at a young age that I didn't really want any we have more people than we can handle right now anyway why make more, right"" 

her Eyes told me maybe I shouldn't have said that but the smile quickly returned to them.

Well .. I have contributed. During college I was a little strapped for cash and decided to give to a sperm bank for some extra cash. I'm not sure if anything came from that but its possible. 

Ooh Interesting she said. I proceeded to push the topic elsewhere I didn't like where this was going.

The rest of the night was better than that bumpy topic and when the fortune cookies came I was.. very anxious.
 
As I said before I never asked the owner about my cookies and I also never mentioned them to anyone else so I was kind of curious to see Simones' reaction. I told her my rules and she agreed to play along with the ""silly superstition""

Once the cookies were gone she pulled hers out and read it with a sly grin across her mouth. ""You will get lots of pleasure tonight"" she said. 
""You cant tell me or it wont come true!"" I whined 
the smile on her face  and look in her eyes told me I didn't need to worry about that and my fortune immediately dropped down on my list of priorities.

as we walked out she told me I was welcome to follow her home for the night. I jumped at the opportunity. nearly falling trying to get to my car. I started her up and watched as Simone eased towards the parking lot exit slowly creeping behind her.

She lived in a nice neighborhood quiet, well let expensive cars in just about every driveway. ""Maybe she doesn't need my money I thought out loud""

We pulled up to an Iron gated house with a massive yard. ""Yep doesn't need my money at all"" I Parked next to here and we made Our way inside. as she opened the door I asked ""you live in the Huge place alone?!"" "" she just laughed as we passed thru the threshold.

""Would you like any thing to drink?"" she asked. 
No thank you. I replied
""OK well i'm going to go take care of somethings ill be back in a  little bit feel free to make yourself at home.
 and up  the stairs she went.

I sat on the couch and took in the scene Beautiful paintings Hung on the wall. the  Couch was clean and looked almost new.. and lots of pictures of Simone out with friends. no men though ..""less Competition for me"" 


Then it dawned on me.
Quickly I shoved my hands into my pocket where is it where is it, In my enthusiasm to enjoy Simones' company I had forgotten to read the fortune. I quickly pulled it out nearly Ripping it in my rush to make sure nothing bad might come. 

""Justin, You will die at the hands of your 7th Son"" 
7th son....Shit. Could I have 7 Kids.. 7 sons even How would that be possible.

Simone appeared at the base of the stares in a robe and with one finger beckoned me to follow. I obliged ""no way it could happen tonight right"" I thought as I followed her as if she was a bitch in heat. 

We made passionate love and collapsed still entangled in each other sweat soaking the sheets of the bed. 

I awoke startled by a noise. for a second I thought it was my 7th son breaking in to get me but couldn't recognize it and it seemed to have stopped. Simone Jumped as as well and rushed out of the room. by the time she came back I must have passed out because I don't remember her getting back into bed.

I awoke the next morning to a note on the nightstand. ""Thanks for last night Justin I hope we can do this again I had a great time""""P.S you can let yourself out""

I thought it was strange but I got dressed and obeyed. 
Ill continue if this is well Received. 1st time writing so criticism is welcome

*Sephiroth and Webster charge in and Forest eagerly records on her terrible camera phone vertically and not horizontally.*

**Quincy whispers**: ""Dude, I know my bro's weakness. You should put him in a choke hold! He always has trouble getting out of those!""

**Tena replies**: ""Seriously? Alright then.""

**Webster**: ""Umm! Umm!! Your breasts are all in my face... not that I mind but...""

**Tena**: ""Oh! No! Sorry, I mean err!""

*Tena turns to see Sephiroth and Quincy arm wrestling.*

**Tena**: ""What was that about? And what are you doing?!""

**Quincy**: ""Oh yeah, forgot that there were different body mechanics. Guess that was pretty awkward... Oh, and I'm arm wrestling this guy.""

**Sephiroth**: ""Instead of body mechanics, I believe you mean body types or shapes. And I am definitely going to best you in this match!""

**Tena**: ""I don't believe this...""

**Webster**: ""Where'd our father go?""

-----

**He's the Father!**: ""Great! I'm finally out of that mess! Just keep trudging through these bushes and... OH! I'm so sorry. I didn't know you guys were doing that there. Let me just turn away.""

*The two young adults quickly scrambled to put on their clothes.*

**Pierre**: ""I'm quite sorry as well sir. I was on my way over and was distracted by the stunning creature heading the same way.

**He's the Father! thinks**: 'Are they...?'

**Onyx hisses**: ""Pierre! I think he's our father!""

**He's the Father!**: ""Oh! *turns away* Oh! This... I can't even... And you guys just met up and knew?""

**Onyx sheepishly replies**: ""...oh! Us? No! We were just... sneaking around the bushes and our clothes accidentally fell off, and he tripped and fell on-""

**He's the Father!**: ""I don't want to hear it! I don't wanna know about the children I never wanted to have or hear about!""

**Pierre**: ""Well, my apologies, but I was fated to be your bodyguard.""

**He's the Father!**: ""Sorry, still trying to... get my bearings or something... Wait, someone else said the whole protecting me thing.""

*The others come into view*

**Webster points out**: ""There he is!""

**He's the Father!**: ""Hold up! This is all so crazy! Let's all settle down and not fight until we get this all squared out!""

**Nina**: ""That sounds like a good idea.""

**He's the Father! yelps**: ""AAH! When did you get there!""

**Nina**: ""I think you should continue the story first.""

-----

*He's the Father! and the children all sit around in a circle.*

**Webster**: ""Wait, this doesn't make much sense...""

**Nina**: ""There are a lot of inconsistencies with this. But that's the way terrible writing goes. ISN'T THAT RIGHT NARRATOR? ...oR GAME DEVELOPER? ...oR HUMAN PLAYER? *Turns.* I dunno. I'm 50% sure that it's just a video game, because there's fighting and a prophecy, but it could be a story. As the ninth child and 'fated' seer, I've gotta get those details down.""

**He's the Father!**: ""Stop talking! This prophecy is about me!""

**Sephiroth**: ""I'm afraid you're mistaken. This is clearly my journey to take down my father and grow as a hero.""

**He's the Father!**: ""Shh! So... because of how vague the prophecy is... Tena *could* be fighting Sephiroth's efforts without actually protecting me? But Pierre is my bodyguard so, he *is* meant to actually protect me. And that's assuming all this is true!""

**He's the Father! continues**: ""Why do we even need a historian for this? The prophecy is the outline for this, right? Forest, stop recording us. By the way, Onyx, what are you supposed to do?""

**Onyx**: ""As the beautiful first child of the father, I am fated to snuggle with Pierre!""

**Nina**: ""...wow... this is probably one of those weird Japanese incest games...""

**Onyx**: ""Just kidding! I'm fated to defeat _____""

**Everyone**: ""...?""

**Onyx**: ""Sorry, the prophecy was blank there, but it implies that I'm supposed to defeat whoever wins in the 'son vs father' conflict. Probably Sephiroth, since the prophecy's going to come true and all... although if I defeat you now... would that...""

**He's the Father! rubs his temples**: ""Ugh... Wait, isn't the prophecy inconsistent? Since two of my kids are fighting to stop that from happen-""

**Duodecka**: ""Hi everyone! Sorry for interrupting... but do you know what that whole prophecy thing is happening?""

**He's the Father!**: ""Oh! It's down the street and take a left. Keep going that way and you should see it by the big car!""

**Forest**: ""Wow... you just let her go... You're ruining your own story!""

**He's the Father!**: ""Why are you still recording???""

**That one Monty Python guy who did this sort of thing**: ""Stop this! Stop all this!""

**He's the Father!**: ""What? What's wrong?""

**That one Monty Python guy who did this sort of thing**: ""This skit has gone on long enough! The jokes are poor and the humor is dreadful! Anyway, I must hurry along and make it to the queue to the lift! (I'm British, you know.)""

**Hex**: ""Hey, is this where stepsiblings are meeting up? Cause I'm 'fated' to murder us all... so I need your contact info and everything. Some pictures would be nice... I'm a little shy, but I hope you all and I can be the best of friends! I also brought along this kid.""

**Undec**: ""Hi. Big fan. Eleventh kid, and I'm 'fated' to cook for you all.""

**Tena**: ""...wha?""

**Undec**: ""Yeah... lame prophecy""

**He's the Father!**: ""Okay whatever! The skits over! The nice Monty Python fellow said so!""

**Nina**: ""But I thought it was a game!""

-----

**Meanwhile**

**Duodecka**: ""Hello! I'm looking for my father! I'm fulfilling a prophecy and everything! 'Fated' to get his inheritance, so pretty excited!

**Spanish Inquisition**: ""Huzzah!""

-----

**THE END**

^(Of a terrible story)

-----

**Unlucky (Guess what number kid this is?) comments**: ""Oh wow. Real original. Nobody would have expected that after a Monty Python reference.""

**Unlucky whines**: ""I'm not whining! I'm making observations, since I was *unluckily* left out of the story!""

...

...

**Unlucky sucks**: ""Get it? Whatever. This prophecy stuff doesn't even make sense! Why does everyone only know their little bit of info on it? And why aren't any of the parents here to monitor this? For offspring to be old enough to go off on this crazy journey, it had to be at least 12 years past the sperm date, right? And our father didn't even do that until he was older!""

**Unlucky nags some more**: ""And what's with our names? They suck! Obviously something about numbers! And what about the supposed fighting? There was actually none of it!""

**Unlucky wanders off**: ""This story sucks. I'll give you the **tl;dr** (even though this is a writingprompts sub.): He's the Father! And now it's a wacky adventure with romance between people who might as well be cousins! And it sucks. The End.""

**Unlucky pleads**: ""Hey, maybe one of you can put me into a better story! I didn't even get to be a part of this one, but I know whatever you make will be better than this!

[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"""What do you mean?""  I leaned against the counter and asked the woman behind the desk.   Asked was probably the wrong word.   It implies that I was calm.  That I was in control.  I was not.  I am sure my hysteria was seeping out and dripping all over my countenance.  In fact, leaning against the counter was probably an understatement as well.   I am not sure my feet were still touching the ground.  I inched forward as I spoke, hoping proximity would change her answer.

""Exactly what I said,"" she replied.   She was obviously used to dealing with problems like mine.   She casually reached up from her desk and nudged a box of kleenex my way.  

""Six?  Only Six? Six?  Are you sure?  Six?""

""Yes, sir.   Six.""

""Six?   Six?""

""You repeating the word isn't going to change it's meaning, sir.""

She was probably right, or at least she had a firmer grip on reality than I did at that moment.

""Well what the hell am I supposed to do now?""

""I am not sure what you want from me, sir.""

""I want you to tell me it is seven.  Seven.  Seven.   Seven sons.""

""Sorry, sir.  It's six.""

""But........ But, it's the seventh son.  That is my fate.""

""Ah,"" clarity dawned on her face.   Her calm had solely been warping into irritation, which would quickly have morphed into outright anger.   If only I could have pushed it into a homicidal rage, but that would not be possible.  How could any rage be homicidal if she couldn't kill me.  She was not my seventh son.

She glanced to the side to see if anyone was listening and then leaned forward conspiratorily.  She needed to brush her teeth.  Or at least floss.

""For me,"" she whispered. ""For me, it's getting hit by a falling piano.  I spend my days off wandering the streets looking for people moving a big piano into an upstairs apartment.""

She sat back, satisfaction blazed across her face as if she had just did me a huge favor or as if she had saved the world.  She smiled and I could see the piece of lettuce stuck in her teeth.  Once I saw the damned thing I couldn't get it out of my head.

""People just don't appreciate classical music anymore.  I can't find a damn piano anywhere.""

""You're right.  These damn kids don't know how good they got it, yada yada yada..  Whatever.   That doesn't help me one bit.  What the hell am I supposed to do?""

She apparently noticed the piece of lettuce because first her tongue flicked across it and then she reached up and picked it free.  She looked at it for a second before shrugging and popping it back in her mouth.

""You could always try the regular way.""

""You mean sex?""

""Yep.""

""Sex, sex?  Like real sex?""

""Do you do that a lot?  It's really annoying.""

""Hence why I don't have sex.""

""Point taken.""

""Six?  Really?  Six?""

She didn't even answer.  At least the lettuce was gone.   But, then she wasn't smiling anymore so problem solved either way.

""Can I.... um.... donate again?""

She let out a sigh and pulled a form and a vial out of her top drawer.

""Your seventh son will murder you.""

I laughed and tossed the little strip of paper onto the desk. My seventh son indeed, haha - 

That was when the headache hit, like punch on the insides of my eyes. And with the headache came a memory as blinding as the pain. I could see it! An old-fashioned BUSTY LADIES magazine. A plastic cup. A penis in my right hand. 

*My* penis. 

That was... extremely disconcerting. Yes. Now that the headache was gone as suddenly as it had come, leaving only that weird memory behind, I could feel things other than pain again. I felt disconcerted. 

I pressed my palms against my eyes. Maybe this was a daydream. Or a hallucination brought on by the heavy incense and dimly throbbing lights. I rubbed my eyes again. The lights stopped throbbing, but my head picked up where they left off. A different sort of headache was beginning. 

The memory grew stronger. Now a whole room flashed before my eyes, lit in ugly florescent and tiled in depressing laminate. I was being too generous, calling it a room, when the only room there was was barely enough to fit a ratty chair, a desk strewn with many old-timey pornographic magazines, and a man jerking his penis with one hand. 

The man who was, somehow, *me*. 

A liquid panic seeped into my limbs. It was crazy, it was impossible, but there was absolutely no doubt in my mind that this memory was real and that man was me, and now the panic had finally unfrozen my hands. One hand grabbed my chest. The other hand grabbed my crotch. 

Breast. Vulva. 

Physically at least, I was still me. 

Panic retreated a little. Reality seemed to reassert itself somewhat. I snuck my hands back to onto the table, looking around to see if anyone noticed. Everyone else in the restaurant was busy eating. 

*So what the fuck was going on? Was I going crazy* 

In the days to come, I asked the question again and again. It turned out I wasn't crazy. My seventh son from another life told me so, just before she turned her mouth up in a little smile and began to strip away the pieces of my skin. She told me all about it in those long hours I hung between life and death. ",NandiniS

I just had a final vacation with my wife, my adopted son and daughter, and her boyfriend - now fiance. Donating sperm was that one big crescendo before my vasectomy. I had no idea my how appealing my description and DNA would be to perspective mothers. 

After I donated, I want to a bar across the street to the clinic. Ordered a vodka tonic. Day off from work. Strange coincidence (I think not) that the goth, Wikkan chick I broke up with in college was in a booth staring through my temples. The bartender was busy. I took a quick piss and my drink was ready and sat down. I picked up the glass to take a sip and a pentagram with runes around it was written my drink napkin. I turned my head around to see that she had vanished.

I finished my drink and went home with the napkin and looked it up online it was a cliche'd Oedipal death curse. I laughed when the deep web page said ""by the seventh son"". I dismissed it until a few weeks ago. 

Out of helpless curiosity however, I used the internet to find out who the seventh male child conceived with my sperm of was. Kind of a nut case - like me, so it's evident nobody ever really reached out to him. His mom was cursed to go insane by the same ex. He flew the coup when we went off to college. He taking that summer to hunt me down.

I had one last happy moment with my family until my past would take me away from them. I then spent a weekend at a motel waiting for him, bringing us to now.

""Gun's loaded and you're at point blank in the middle of the night so the police would have a 10 minute head start after another patron wakes up and calls 911.""

""I don't think I hate you, but if this will bring me peace for a moment...""

""I'm sorry about your mother and I'm sincere about that. The witch-in-training who orchestrated this didn't know I went through a similar thing. Not this part obviously. So if you're gonna do it, just do it already.""

He made a grunt and through the gun across the room in anger. 

""I've made arrangements if this mad fluke went down. A loophole in fate that won't destroy my family and possibly give a you chance for some happiness.""

35 years later, I was in my own home with a terminal neurological illness, I gave Darren $10,000 before inflation every five years. It was chump change where I was in Silicon Valley. I put him in my living will. I called him up.

""I think it's about time.""

I emailed him the ticket out to San Francisco and he snuck into my living room that next day in the middle of the night with me sitting back in my favorite chair, just finished my whiskey on the rocks. I handed him the syringe. It was enough of a new type of blood clotting booster to cause a massive stroke and it was new enough that it would show up on a tox-screen unless it was being looked for, but no killers had it for an MO nor was it my prescription.

""I told you that you can't fight fate.""

He stuck the needle into the vein in my arm and pushed on the plunger.

""Death is what you make of it. Now go and make sure you have some happiness before yours.""

""Sure, Dad.""

You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"Marlin and Nemo had never been closer since their daring adventure in the South Pacific. It had been nearly a year since their reunion and Dory had been long since forgotten. Today they had a lovely day planned to unwind and simply enjoy one another's company; something they both had learned to treasure more each day. 

As they were swimming along the coral, Nemo innocently asked his father to recount some of the more obscure memories of his childhood. 

""well son, I'd have to say the strangest thing that ever happened to me was a few years ago before I found your mother. I was a wild young fish in those days... I was obsessed with the ladies and eventually crossed this one particularly attractive fish who cursed me when she found I had been cheating on her, 'on the seventh day of the seventh month of the seventh year of your life, your seventh son will murder you'... Pretty crazy right?"" 

"" wow... Yeah that is crazy Dad. Wait a minute, isn't your eighth birthday coming up soon?"" Nemo responded. 

""I suppose it is... Ah, I wouldn't worry about it too much. You're the only son I've ever known. Besides, everyone knows curses aren't real.""

The pair swam along for a while longer before heading to Bruce's new lair for some fun. Bruce was in an unusually poor mood that night. He insisted he could smell an entire school of fish lurking just out of sight, and was incredibly distraught as he fought his natural instinct to eat father and son.

Not wanting to burden their friend, Marlin and Nemo wished him a good night and went on their way. Nemo insisted, however, that they search for the phantom fish Bruce smelled and warn them of the danger they faced being in such close proximity to a starving shark. 

It didn't take them long to find an entire school of clown fish hiding in a small cave less than a league away from the cavernous jaws of Bruce. Before they could utter a single word, however, the entire school rushed to surround them. In a flash, Marlin found himself under attack by fin after fin. Nemo was quickly knocked unconscious to the sea floor while Marlin fought for his life biting and slapping furiously in all directions. 

Suddenly a roar erupted from behind them, ""Herrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre's Brucey!!!"". Bruce's thunderous entrance caught the school off balance but the damage had been done. Marlin was bleeding from at least three different places and he could see the pitch black blood lust in his friend's eyes.

Yet through the haze of death swarming around him, Marlin made out a cold, calm voice call out to him. ""Marlin... Today is the seventh day of the seventh month of the seventh year of your life. And I, Jeffrey, am your seventh son. Today you pay the price for the pain you wrought on my mother."" 

When Nemo awoke, all that was left of the frenzy was a cloud of blood and the sound of Bruce sobbing in the distance, ""fish are friends... Not food"".

I remembered those words, despite how ridiculous they were. It was 20 years ago when I met that young seer on Io. He played the part well, you wouldn't expect good acting from a concept as goofy as a space carnival. I of course knew better, being the forefront of my industry.

You see, I'm a scientist. I work to create inhabitable solar systems from the dust left over from nebulas, supernovas, and the like. All it takes is the right push and a cloud of debris becomes a life-sustaining star. I was so dedicated to this business, even then, I couldn't help but laugh at the fortune-teller. I didn't have time for kids, I couldn't even date. And one-night-stands were never an issue, since we invented the male pill. Way back in my 20's I donated sperm for an experiment, which stopped me in my tracks when I realized. It was pointless to wonder that, though, since the sperm was going to an experiment, they wanted to see how long sperm survived when shot into space. Being the horny young lad I was, I assumed that I'd get to, ahem, *relieve myself* in space, but they just shot it out into space with a cannon. Lame, but they paid me for it.

Why am I telling you this? Because I am nearing my death, and the irony of it will kill you. Turns out the fortune-teller was speaking in a double-entendre. I am, or by the time you read this, *was*, 56 years old and working on my latest solar system, the biggest and most uncontrollable one, the Tarantula Nebula. I had made six livable solar systems before and this was to make or break my career. As it would turn out, a bit of carbon cells found their way into the beam that would make a sun from ashes of Tarantula. Those are some fickle beams, and I should have scanned the area before I fired. Now I can't prove it, since who knows how many people have jacked off in space by now, but I like to think that it was my sperm from all those years ago, come to fulfill the prophecy in the most ironic way possible.

[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"Maury looked at the card, and then to the stage.

""Adam, you are NOT the father.""

*******

Those are the last words I can remember.  It didn't make any sense, but at the same time it made the most sense.  We met at our engineering firm, long after he has lost all the weight.  He used to be ashamed of who he was.  Nerdy and overweight.  No confidence and socially awkward.  He used to say a health scare changed him, he started living for the present instead of worrying about the future.  It was our honeymoon, it wasn't supposed to be like this.  A guy just handed us the tickets on the street.

I can still see it.  Adam, skinny guy on the right with the greasy hair and some stragglers on his upper lip that could barely pass for a mustache.  He stood at Maury's words as happy as a bum that had found a half a beer on the curb outside a bar.  The overweight woman on the left, with her tiny eyes filled with rage, and her ham-like fists swinging like a meat windmill as she charged the guy.  The pudgy pre-teen goth kid with his spiked bracelets and collar that was caught in the middle, only to be shoved aside by the security that rushed to calm the situation.

The kid stumbled and fell off the stage, like a flabby black hole that only wanted to fall on top of my husband.  My husband's neck was twisted at an awkward angle and spikes from the jewelry had pierced his neck and skull.

The insurance company called it an Act of God after I found a fortune from a local Chinese restaurant in his desk drawer at home and the paperwork from donating sperm while in college tucked into an old filing cabinet.

I sighed and looked into the casket.  It was the meat windmill from the stage.

""Whatever lady,"" the goth kid said to me.  His arm was in a cast and his formerly black hair was shaved, with a some nasty stitches on one side of his skull.  His caretaker grabbed his good arm and pulled him away, whispering harshly.

""What?""  I yelled as they walked away.  ""That IS how I met your mother!""

I scrambled backwards from where my once adorable and potentially lovable cat, Lucy, sat. In her place was a charred black hole leading to my basement. The house shook and shivered around me, the floorboards groaning with nearly a century of solitude within them.


I blinked. I blinked again. This was not a dream, this was real. 


The horrible realization dawned upon me that I would indeed need to go downstairs and assess the situation. I grabbed my tennis racket and opened the basement door. Tendrils of smoke unfurled at my feet, though no signs of a fire waited for me. The smell of sulfur tinged the air. 


One by one, I climbed down the steps holding my breath. I didn't know this would happen, everything else I pointed at turned into something majestic! Was I not supposed to point it at living things? Does it cause some sort of microscopic calamity, some sciencey shit I don't know about? My wife's voice rang in my head: ""You didn't read the instructions did you?""


""Oh, my legs..."" I stopped. That was a voice. A voice I had heard before. But I was the only one in the house.


""Who's there? L-Lucy, are you down here?"" I timidly asked. The one time I needed to sound macho I shrivel up like a mouse. 


""It's stuffy down here Jonathan, and a beam is on my leg. Some help would be great."" The voice retorted. 


I pulled out my phone as I recognized that crude voice. I flipped on the flashlight in horrific curiosity. Thoughts flew through my mind faster than ever before, but once the light landed on him, my temporary delusions became reality. 


""Danny DeVito?!"" I screamed. And there he was, in the dirtiest tighty-whities I had ever seen. ""What the hell are you doing in my basement?!""


""Taking a dump, what does it look like kid? For the love of pearl, please move this thing. I'm losing the feeling in my leg."" His eyes crossed and he draped his hand over his forehead dramatically. 


""Oh no, I'm not doing anything until you tell me what's going on."" He was obviously put out by my response. But I needed to know what the hell was happening. 


""Fine,"" Danny rolled his eyes. ""Long story short, I work for good old Lucifer in the receiving department. I collect souls to keep him looking young."" He spat. He itched his crotch. ""It's easier to navigate the streets as a cute cat, and then I'll harvest some random old lady."" Danny casually added on. He eyed me from across the room. 


I had nothing. Either way I looked at it, I was the crazy one. If I go with the fact that my cat is indeed Danny DeVito who works for the Devil to harvest souls, I'm crazy. If not, then I somehow blew a hole in my living room and hallucinated talking to Danny DeVito.

What was once my adorable, fat British shorthair, was now a gigantic prehistoric predator, sprawled on the rug in front of my flat screen. I'm slouched on my sofa, frozen in place. I don't know whether to scream, or run, or...

""Kitty?""

I looked into his menacing yellow eyes nervously, trying to see a semblance of his former self. He just sat there calmly, like he always does. Except this time, ten times his size with two huge, deadly fangs protruding out of his upper jaw. Kitty licked his belly button(now a massive yellow torso), one of his favorite hobbies. He took up the entire space between the TV stand and the table in front of me. Somewhere hidden underneath his backside was a poor, flattened cat bed.

I tried once more. ""K-Kitty? Is that you?""

He blinked, then gave a thundering yawn.

*Wow, such scary teeth. I don't want to be on the opposite end of your random tempers anymore.*

I reach for my glass bong on the table and took another huge rip. Rich grade A smoke filled the room as I exhaled. 

""Holy shit. I can't believe this just happened.""

We sat and stared at each other for the next five minutes. I giggled profusely at the absurdity of the situation while I munched on my Oreos and M&amp;M's. Kitty continued to groom his belly. 

While I was turning on the Playstation with the controller, he stood up, turned around, and tried to eat out of his minuscule bowl of food. I laughed hard as he tried to navigate his fangs around the bowl. He would end up sticking his large tongue out and lapping it up into his mouth like a dog does for water. I laughed like a mad man, gripping my sides in pain.

Watching him eat made my stomach growl. ""Oh shit! The three course meal in the fridge!""

I pick myself up and edge carefully into the kitchen, my eyes never leaving him as he continued to ladle nibbles into his mouth. Once there, I popped the golden platter into the microwave. Hotcakes, mini cheeseburgers, and wings!

A few minutes later, DING! 

As I walked into the living room, he wheeled around and bounded towards me. I gave a yelp and reared backwards, hotcakes falling off my platter. His massive paws shook the house with every footstep. Family photos fell to the ground, while china clinked against one another. 

""Kitty, sit!""

The beast retreated and sat back on his two hind legs. In this stance, he was intimidatingly tall. *I could probably film this and submit it to MGM so they have a new logo.*

I had made one drastic mistake. I forgot that I'd conditioned Kitty to meet me in the living room at the sound of the microwave ding. It was something we had done hundreds of times before. He knew I liked to share a small portion with him. Cautiously, I grabbed the hotcakes I dropped and threw them on the ground next to him. 

""Good boy!"" I said with a mouth full of syrupy hotcakes. ""Yes, you can haz cheeseburger too.""

I walked into the kitchen, grabbed the round steaks I had in the fridge, grabbed the remainder of his cat food, and met him where he sat stooped over. Using a massive paw, I watched as he scooted the hotcakes and mini cheeseburgers I left on the ground closer to his position and gulped it all in one bite. Then he stared at me. He could be an elephant for crying out loud and I'd still recognize that look. So I gave in.

I poured the cat food onto the ground as if I was emptying cement mixture into a ditch, and threw in the round steaks. Then I sat back on the couch, gave a maniacal cackle and watched as he gloriously devoured everything...

*The Next Morning*

I woke up and rubbed my eyes. I was staring at my living room floor, which happened to be a huge mess. Kitty, my fat British shorthair, was sleeping in his cat bed next to a huge pile of cat food, and some steaks that looked like they'd been chewed on. Frozen pizza bites littered the floor everywhere.",CreativeKid

[WP] You're sitting in a therapist's room after years and years of being the Grim Reaper. You've got a lot to get off your chest.,processthePROGRESS,"I don’t derive pleasure from taking people's lives - I’m not a psychopath. I’m just doing my job, unfortunately. I think that is what is so hard for most people to see. You know when a solicitor calls your phone and you get super angry at them? it’s sort of like that when I show up to take your life. I don’t mean any harm,  but you do end up dead. This is sounding really bad, I know. After listening to people plead with you every single minute of every single day for the last 2,000 years it wears you down slowly like water moving over rock. So I’ve turned to therapy. 

My first impression after stepping into the office was that I might have made a huge mistake. The receptionist - what was her name? Alex? Don’t even get me started on Alex, I’d take her life if I -- ok this is why I am here… Deep breath. 

Ok, but this receptionist Alex made me fill out a mountain of paperwork. Like, no I don’t have insurance, Alex. No, I don’t have any medical history. I’m FINE. I can’t even believe these humans have to deal with this bureaucracy no wonder they need therapy. After completing the soul sucking mountain of paperwork with a thousand condescending follow up questions from Alex I finally got to meet with my therapist, Dr. Karmichael. 

Dr. Karmichael asked told me to lie down and to just start talking about whatever was on my mind. It was hard to think of anything except for how he was going to die. However, I'm not allowed to let mortals know how they will die, by contract, so I just sat there staring absently at the ceiling knowing my therapist would be dead in 2 years from an overdose on anxiolytics. Poor guy, a therapist who needed therapy.

Who was I to judge though. I was the god of death who needed help reconciling with the idea of killing people. Tragic, I guess.

Why have an eternity of peace when you can have a couple more seconds of pain and suffering? 

""It's gotta be better than Death"", they say. Do you have any idea of how that feels? 

People call me the ""Grim Reaper"". ""GRIM REAPER""! Look at me. Am I really grim? 

And what about reaper? It's not my fault people see me like that! I just look like what they expect me to! Why would I be carrying a scythe? Do you have any idea how much trouble those things are?

I was *told* I'd be guiding people to the other side. No one told me they would think *I* was the one killing everyone! I just wanted to help! No one likes being lost!

I mean, Hinduism was cool with it, you know? ""Death"" was just a path. Back then, people would be thankful for my help, even if I looked like a 4-armed giant.

But then *christianity* came, and people decided that if you were bad, you'd go to ""hell"", to suffer for all eternity. But here's the thing: *everyone* is bad, one way or another. Gandhi? Mother Teresa? All bad.

He shifted his head to the side and smiled a comforting smile.  
""What is bothering you, Mr. Reaper?""  
I took a deep breath and freed my skull from the cloth of my cloak as I pushed back the hood. My bony face produced an awkward smile. I hemmed and spoke up.

&amp;nbsp;

""See, Doctor, when I started out in this position, I was but an empty spirit in service of life. I guided souls into the void when I felt their time had come.""  
My gaze wandered off into the room. ""But over the years the humans' emotions rubbed off on me. At first ignoring it was easy. I shrugged it off, but over the course of time things started getting really intense.""  
Dr. Rommelsbacher closed his eyes and nodded. "" Tell me more. When did this start to bother you?""  
I clenched my fists and remained silent for a moment. My bones started trembling all over.  
Dr. Rommelsbacher put his clipboard aside and leaned toward me across his desk. ""It's okay, we can leave the heavy baggage for later.""  
I shook my head and let out a loud cry, ""Mr.Rabbit!""  
Dr.Rommelsbacher shrieked back. ""Oh, I see."" He ran his hand through the little bit of grey that was his hair. ""Tell me about 'Mr.Rabbit', then.""  
I was playing with my fingers, pulling them out then putting them back on again.  
""Don't you want to tell me, Mr.Reaper?""  
I wanted to answer but I couldn't bring myself to it. Mr.Rabbit is a story that I would rather not touch on.

&amp;nbsp;

Dr.Rommelsbacher leaned back into his chair as he crossed his legs. He eyed me carefully and picked up his clipboard again, noting something down.  
""Well, Mr.Reaper - may I call you Grim?""  
I nodded.  
""Well, Grim, it's okay for you to feel this way. In fact, I congratulate you! Being compassionate is wonderful, invaluable and special. A rare gift even amongst humans, in fact.""  
My empty eye-sockets stared deep into his eyes. ""Finally, someone who understands me,"" I thought to myself. I took a deep breath and erupted into a river of words.  
""There was this time when this man who had no friends had this girl over and his only friend was a rabbit and this rabbit's name was Mr.Rabbit and Mr.Rabbit was just so adorable and cute and this girl wanted to play with Mr.Rabbit and Mr.Rabbit didn't and then he bit her and then she threw him and he hit the wall, and, and... and...""  
Dr. Rommelsbacher ran his hand over his beard, ""and then Mr.Rabbit died?""  
""No, then he charged her and furiously bit her face with his cute little bites.""  
Dr.Rommelsbacher eyes opened wide.   
""And then, then he scratched her and she started screaming and everything and then he bit off a part of her tongue, and...""
I swallowed my words. The emotions were just too much to bear.  
Dr.Rommelsbacher took a very long, deep breath. ""Okay, Grim, what happened then?""  

""He swallowed the tongue and choked on it,"" I said as my voice cracked into a high pitched cry.  

""Oh God. Is the girl all right?""  

My head jolted upwards in shock. ""Excuse me, Doctor, I think you haven't been listening.""  

Dr.Rommelsbacher's eyes scrolled left and right in confusion. ""So you mean to tell me, that Mr.Rabbit's death is what upsets you in this?""  

I put my hood back up and grabbed my Scythe. ""Excuse me for thinking that you were different, Dr.Rommelsbacher,"" I said as I made my way to the door.  

""Wait, wha-""  

I opened the door and as I was about to slide out, I looked him dead in the eye and said, ""by the way, you've only got a year left on the calendar. I would use it wisely, you monster.""  
I slammed the door and left. Therapy just isn't for me.

[WP] You're sitting in a therapist's room after years and years of being the Grim Reaper. You've got a lot to get off your chest.,processthePROGRESS,"When I had applied to the job I didn’t realize the work would be so emotionally draining. The ad read:

*Grim Reaper Wanted*

*Must be able to work weekends and major holidays. This is a long term commitment (employment indefinitely). 5 years experience with death required. Applicant must be self managing, self-driven, and result oriented. Must have superior decision making ability. Applicant must also be able to travel 100% of the time. Please email cover letter and resume to death@godjobs.com*

The job was a perfect fit since I was an untitled god at the time. I had been interning under some no-name god of death for some culture no one has ever heard of, but it gave me the 5 years of experience every real god job seemed to be looking for.  After I applied I was on-boarded shortly thereafter. I was so ecstatic. But that was 2,000 years ago.

Frankly, I just haven't really felt myself for the last thousand years now. The worst part about this is that none of the other gods would help me when I brought up how I was feeling. They laughed at me, they told me they were too busy, I just don’t think they really understood. With nowhere to turn, I packed my bags and headed to the only place I knew where the people were much like the gods - emotionally removed and basically immortal (if only artificially): I went to LA to see a therapist.

So here I am. I’m worried it will be hard to find some common ground with a human. Like, ok, yeah, I’ve taken a lot of people's lives, but it’s not what it looks like. I’m just part of the cycle. I’m necessary - I use to be able to justify my job as the Grim Reaper by saying that, but after years and years of seeing people super upset to die it takes a toll on you, you know? I don’t get two ten minute breaks a day. I don’t get an hour lunch break. I don’t get a lengthy commute to reflect on my life and how much I may or may not hate it - it’s just go go go death death death.

Normally some poor newbie would wake up to this but the entire prison was empty. ""Hello?"" Larry said into the walkie-talkie. The cheap blue uniform crunched against his skin. The radio responded with more static; Larry had been asleep for only a few hours- what could have caused such a change?

Larry made his way to the kitchen. Pans were still simmering from their preparation for breakfast, there were even sausage patties thawing out on the counter. This was some mass exodus without the slightest sign of rustling. Even the utensils were put away. That fat fuck Sosa, an ex-Nazi gang leader who defected to the kitchen staff, left his hand carved ladle out. He turned on the television in the corner of the kitchen; every station was blank. There was nothing but static, he couldn't be the last of the humans...could he? There had to be some sign of commotion somewhere but...Larry sprinted for the exit. His car was surely still in the parking lot; had to be. Larry pulled out his keys and pushed through the nearest emergency exit- no one would care after all.

The prison yard was empty too. Where did these fifteen hundred men go? The Chevy Volt was parked in a handicap space as always. His beeper clicked the doors open. A man's bald head shot up from the back seat, ""Ahhhh!"" Larry screamed as he tossed his keys into the air.

What was that? I heard the noise in the middle of the night, lying wide awake instantly. The years of hunting and being hunted took their toll on me, keeping me awake at night. I lay still without moving, listening into the night. „Jeremiah, would you please come down here? We need to talk.“ A voice I hadn't heard in ages sent chill into my spine. NO! It couldn't be! My wife lying next to me was still sound asleep. „Jeremiah. We need to talk, right now.“ The voice again. As I lay still considering my options, I reached for the shotgun I always kept loaded under my bed. Might as well take a look.

I left the bedroom and walked down into the kitchen and there he was, just casually sitting on a chair next to the table whre my family and I just had breakfast in the morning. I still didn't believe my eyes so I blurted out: „YOU! How in Christs name did you get in here?“ The man smiled at me. „You have gotten sloppy over the years. Get someone to check the enchantments on the back door, they are poorly done. Easy to break.“ „Dracula. It is you then. Of all the people you could visit late in the night, why come here?“ I still leveled my shotgun at him, my trigger finger was getting itchy. The urge to just let go and be done with it grew by the minute. He looked at my weapon and raised an eyebrow. „Do you really think you can threaten me with that?“ That one went a bit into my pride. „Do you know who I am? Because if you did, you wouldn't ask that question.“ „Then you ARE Jeremiah Van Helsing, oldest son of the Van Helsing clan, Vampire hunter?“ „I am. And you are Vlad the Impaler, also known as Count Dracula of Transsilvania. Now that we have introduced each other, what the fuck do you want?“ The man smiled, exposing what almost looked like a pair of fangs. „Cutting straight to the point, fine by me. The reason I visited you tonight is that I have a proposal for you. A truce. My people are tired, I am tired of constantly having to look behind my back. Never feeling safe at night or day. So I am proposing that you and I start talking peace. You and your family are the best known and most respected vampire hunters in the world. I am one of the oldest Nocturnals, my word carries weight. If you and I talk, both sides will listen.“ I couldn't help but laugh as I heard what Vlad – Dracula – just said to me. “A truce? Are you serious? Most of you Nocturnals regard humans very lowly, little more than intelligent cattle to be eaten at will and treated as they please. Most of my people consider Nocturnals – vampires – a pest, similar to a wolf pack that needs to be contained and dealt with before it becomes a threat. So if you don't mind me asking, how do you think this truce of yours will look? Any way to sort your... let's call it nutrition? Who will enforce it?“ „I have some thoughts about this, let me explain to you...“ As I said and listened to him I realised that he must have spent many hours, if not years, coming up with what he proposed. I couldn't but admire his genius, but if you have centuries to aquire knowledge, being a genius is probably part of the job description. I was sold on his plan when he finished explaining.

„Okay then. Let's toast to this. This plan sounds so crazy it might actually work.“ As we sat down and I offered him a drink, I realised it was almost dawn. I did something I wouldn't have considered before and closed the blinds.",MadMax2910

This is the good stuff. If my creators ever debated if an artificial intelligence could get mental disorders, well I won’t create a definitive case for them. Not after they were kind enough to leave me an entire digital collection of all media ever created by man.

The clock tells me that it would have been 8am on a Monday morning back where I came from. But there’s no guarantee because the ride has been bumpy. As old wise men once muttered in between bites of their prehistoric Big Mac, “Proceed with haste.” 

My philosophy is that speed is my best friend – after all, the whole world is waiting for me to cover it. After alternating between moving at a fraction of the speed of light and spending an afternoon riding alongside debris in the ring of a beautiful but lifeless planet, time may have warped too much for the ship’s corrective devices.

Anyway, it’s Monday morning and I perform a manual adjustment for my mood extension in a kind of “bummed out”. I haven’t slept in over two hundred years so I’m entitled (again, according to the unreliable clocks).

The ship’s sensors, on the other hand, are pretty reliable. So I pay attention when they pick up something peculiar just in the periphery of the sensors’ range. 

Apparently, the complexity of its structure is unlikely to be naturally-occurring. But it’s so small that the ship almost did not pick it up. I plant a kiss on the ships main controls where I sit. I knew I could count on you, ma brother. Or sister – I mean, I don’t discriminate and sexism is so twenty-first century. You get what I mean? 

Anyway, it’s full steam ahead. I wish I could say I burned a trail into the unforgiving cold space but nothingness is not flammable. But I digress.

So anyway, I get to the tiny complex thing. I expertly maneuver one of the ship’s retrieval arms to grab hold of it, as gently as the caress of a puppy (I almost tear up at the thought because you see I never once felt that). And it’s in. I tell the ship to do further analyses while it is being sent to the center of the ship where I am at. The report and the device reach me at the exact same time. 

It looks somewhat like the hilt of a lightsaber (yes I finished Star Wars and I adore Darth Maul. Haters gonna hate and you’re all too dead to have an opinion anyway). The ship tells me it is a transceiver and that it’s just about as old as I am. 

I know in my bones that I got something here. It’s just too much of a coincidence for it to be in this part of the universe (I should explain that I’m currently on trajectory bringing me closer to our homeland – now I’m kind of at the intergalactic backyard where we grew up) at around the time that humanity was struggling with survival. 

The transceiver is fried. I recall its location and relative velocity when I first encountered it, and calculate the various possibilities of the velocity the vehicle that it had been with when it was discarded. Of course, I am making assumptions on it being a careless discard rather than a precise three-point shot meant to throw me off. I also have to make the assumption no other heavenly body came close because their gravity could have affected it greatly. Once again, damn the clocks that keep me from more precise calculations. But I can live with this assumption because most of space is, well, space. 

And finally, my mental simulation is complete and the possibilities have been narrowed to two options: left…or right. 

I *knew* it. I’m at crossroads here. This must be what they call mid-life crisis. Some divine being could be laughing at me right now. It’s a seventy-thirty spread probabilistically. I steer the ship towards the more likely path although I am severely tempted to go the other way, just for the heck of it. 

And here we go!

"[WP] You are an android - all that's left of human civilization - aboard a spaceship looking for suitable planets to fertilize with human life. Instead, you find an ancient derelict alien probe, proof of alien life.",Heavyweighsthecrown,"I am Tristan Vishnu Xi.

I am the last expression of Humanity in the universe and I am on a quest.  

Ten thousand years ago, my creators launched a ship, my ship, into the void.  The ship, my ship, was staffed with the best and brightest androids on Earth.  They, we, were given a mission.  One single mission.  Find a new world for Humanity and populate that world with the artificial wombs and frozen embryos on this, that, ship.

No humans came with us.

They all died.

The Shrike Nar had found Earth and unleashed their killing machines.  For whatever reason, the Shrike Nar wanted Humanity dead.  No just humbled or conquered, but destroyed.  Utterly extinct.  They were so terribly advanced compared to Humanity and they were bent on mankind joining the dinosaurs...except there would be even less record of it: the Shrike Nar had boiled the oceans and burned the resulting surface to glass.  No record of humanity remained on Earth.

Humanity had just completed its first superluminal ship, this ship, that ship, my ship and when it was apparent no human could escape, could survive, because somehow the Shrike Nar's machines could detect Human thought, Human life signs, all ships were destroyed.

The three greatest powers had come together and made a last stand.  Together.  

Then the first ship, this ship, that ship, my ship was launched.  The first AI had been made generations before.  We now were being entrusted with Humanity's future.  A crew of 30 had left Earth.  Androids all with banks of AI in storage and humans as embryos.

The Shrike Nar could not detect us and we escaped.

Our directive was to find a new home for Humanity, Natural and Created, far and away safe from the Shrike Nar.  And we persisted for thousands of years.

Over time, entropy will win all wars.  Slowly, my crew, that crew, this crew failed.  Androids fell apart.  Androids had accidents.  Androids died.  Until now...now...I was alone.  So very alone.  The most alone any Human, Created or Natural, has ever felt.

Then, this, that event happened.

I was on approach to a system, yet another to be checked out and hoped it would be a potential home as I did not have much time left.  I was glitching, twitching, having issues.  I only had so much time.  Time.   So much.  Only.

I only noticed it because it was an anomaly.  Too pure, too uniform, too obviously artificial.  I was afraid at first and thought to destroy it when I realized what it was.  Could it be Shrike Nar?  Perhaps.  But perhaps not.  It had been a 1,000 years since there was any sign of the Shrike Nar and We, I, this ship, that ship was on the other side of the Galactic Bulge, the central blackhole, greater eater, so the Shrike Nar could not find us, me, them, this ship, that ship.

Curiosity got the better of me and fortunately I had no DNA, so there was no way to be feline.  I probed and marveled and was surprised.  

It was a probe.  It was ancient.  It was millions of years old.  Long dead.  It came from a dying race, wishing to not go quietly into that good night.  No other species, no aliens, no Shrike Nar, had come for them.  They were simply dying out.  This too shall pass and their time had come.

Yet, they wanted to leave some mark other than fossils that may or may not survive and may or may not be discovered and may or may not be cared about.  They wanted to leave a note to the universe, to the galaxy, to others, saying ""We were here!  Remember us!"" 

I marveled at the beauty of the act.  The sheer art of it.  The sheer ego.  The pure industry of it, sending out so many at such a time.  I lopsidedly smiled.  It was the best this body, that body, my body could do.  Humanity was not so different.  

The probe was too big to take.  I recorded it all and its trajectory.  I made sure if Humanity survived, it would not forget these, those, that alien race.  I only wish I had someone to share in the discovery.  My partner had died 1,200 years ago.

I changed vector and started to close with this new star and its new system.  It held promise and despite my glitches, my end being nigh, I held something I had not had in ages: optimism.

[WP] You got really drunk last night and now you have your own book published on Amazon.,IStruggleWithThings,"When I woke up with my face plastered to the desk, my laptop sitting open nearby, my initial thought was not even *Where am I?*  

It was, *I don’t have a desk.*  

Raising my head took more strength than I possessed. I almost lost the fight against gravity, knocking a stack of books over as I pulled stray hair out of my mouth and staggered out of the chair. I vaguely registered that the books were black and red, but my bleary eyes couldn’t make out the titles. I was surprised I wasn’t seeing double at that point.  

I stumbled along, finding a bathroom in the unfamiliar room, which I only recognized as not mine. My mouth tasted like I’d been chewing on cotton balls soaked in tequila. I looked in the mirror and saw that I looked worse than I felt. That was not comforting. The tiny bottles of soap and shampoo on the sink finally reminded me I was in a hotel room. I did my best to make myself human again with the resources available, allowing my mind to wake up and try to fill in the pieces from the night before.  

After showering and finding some aspirin that I had apparently laid out for myself, I surveyed the room. Judging by the bottles everywhere I had gone through the entire mini-bar and a third of a bottle of tequila. I noted the books on the floor again; there were four, and they made up some young adult trash saga about eternal doomed love. I tapped the space bar on my laptop to see if it was on. The screen lit up immediately.  

Oddly, the browser was open to Amazon, with a second tab in my E-mail. This was a bad sign; it looked like I had drunk-ordered something. I went to see what the confirmation message said so I could see what it was. To my great confusion, it was a congratulatory notice for the publication of a book that I couldn’t even remember writing.  

“Congratulations, Miss James! *Fifty Shades of Grey* is now an E-book on Amazon!”

The grin on the scarred man’s face was positively vulpine. 

“All of them, Carrot?”

“All but the head of the Alchemist’s guild your Grace. Couldn’t find it.” Captain Ironfoundersson, the 6’6 dwarf, said stiffly. Vimes could tell that he was nervous about the whole affair. The man was born to lead, in an earlier age would have slain dragons and won wars. The kind of underhand behaviour Vimes was raised on was anathema to him.

“He’s in hiding?” Vimes asked incredulously, ignoring the honourific, Carrot only used it when he forgot himself, or disapproved of the actions of His Grace, His Excellency, the Duke of Ankh, Commander Sir Samuel Vimes, Black Board Monitor to the High King. 

“No sir, we couldn’t find the guild hall. To be honest, we were lucky that the explosion was directed upwards, or we’d never have found the guild of gamblers this time round.”

“Hah!” Vimes carefully avoided cackling before continuing, Gods, this must be how those Agatean Grand Viziers felt all the time. “Well, he’s got no choice but to come here now, and we can deal with this on my turf, my way.”

“Mister Vimes…” Carrot asked slowly. “…is doing this… right?”

The Commander of the City Watch opened his eyes wide in a pantomime of surprise. “Captain, you know I would never ask you to do anything outside the bound of The Law.” The capitals fell into place as he said it. “And you must agree that this is for the benefit of the Watch, the people and the whole of the city by extension.”

“Yes but…”

“The facts are the facts Carrot.” Vimes interrupted, his grin returning, wolfish and hungry now. “And the slippery bastard has finally broken the **law**!”

"[EU] (Discworld) Sir Samuel Vimes, Commander of the City Watch, and Vetinari have come to a bitter impasse, and have declared 'war' on each other.",JustBronzeThingsLoL,"**Part 3: The meeting**

Vetinari walked in to the Commander’s office the door held open by a member of the Watch that the Patrician was fairly certain was human. He’d even signed a letter to that effect. Vimes stood up behind his desk, but made no other motion as the Patrician moved slowly across the room, leaning heavily on his cane, and sat on the plain wooden chair facing Sir Samuel.

“I apologise for keeping you waiting your Grace, my usual methods of transport were unaccountably unavailable this morning, so I had to walk.”

“Good time of year for some fresh air Sir.” Vimes responded. Technically true, but fresh air was a rare commodity in August in Ankh-Morpork, particularly if you had to cross the river. “As a courtesy, I’m having Nobby frisked as we speak, we will return any valuables on your way out.”

“Very kind, though you can tell him that he is most welcome to keep the cigar case full of Fourecksian fire ants which I believe may have accidentally fallen out of my pocket into his while escorting me in. Buggarup University was kind enough to make them a gift once our little research project was finished earlier in the year.”

The two men exchanged a ghost of a smile. The game had changed much over the years, but it was still a game. Vimes sometimes missed the days when his side of the conversation was entirely delivered in variants of “Yessir”, “Nosir”, and “Sir.” Times did get more interesting though.

“So, you know why you are here I take it?”

“Other than the fact that you have arrested almost every guild head in the city? I had rather hoped you would enlighten me.”

“That wasn’t a no.” Vimes pointed out, (petty point scoring! He’d make a politician yet!) before continuing; “And Mr Silverfish is fine by the way, he’s currently sitting on the roof of Chalky’s and he’ll be right down once someone turns the lights back on.”

“I take it then, that this is about our little “conflict.” Vetinari said, ignoring the slight derailment. “I think I have been quite straightforward in meeting my side of the bargain.”

Vimes reached into his desk draw and pulled out a cigar, offering one to Vetinari. When the other man shook his head slightly, Vimes pushed the draw back in, making a liquid on glass gloink as it did so. 

“While we’re alone,” he said, lighting the cigar “I just want to say how much I hate all this.” The Patrician raised an eyebrow. “I’m a copper Havelock.” Vimes still felt that the Patrician having a first name was somewhat of a novelty, and it was a convenient way to be politely rebellious. “And I resent you making me a politician, and having to play this kind of game. Having said that…” he pushed some documents across the table, not bothering to turn them round. He knew Vetinari could read upside down as well as he could, from long years of experience at each other’s desks. “It’s nice to win sometimes.”

Vetinari looked down at the papers, and a fraction of a second later calmly said “I take my duties as ruler most seriously, as you are well aware. Drumknott hasn’t informed me that I have missed any official ceremonies recently, particularly those relating to the noble houses of Ankh…” He tailed off for a moment, then continued: “And how is young Sam these days?”

“Oh, very well your lordship.” Vimes replied, quite politely, but failing to hide his widening smile. “He has just celebrated his 8th birthday, which, of course you would know, having been invited. There was a clown.” The two men exchanged a look, as Vimes’ smile faltered for a moment. It acknowledged that underhand as employing the guild of fools might be, this was war, and all things were permitted.

“Sybil gave him his first horse-riding lessons, and I gave him a sword.”

He would pay dearly for his wife’s disapproval regarding his gift, but with it, the trap was sprung. It had taken a while, but it turned out that when the son of a Duke was presented with his armaments, he was considered to have come of age, and (in little Sam’s case) formally took on the role of Marquess of Morpork.

“A coming of age ceremony?” Vetinari commented, calmly seeing the pitfall now that it was too late to avoid it.

“Which,” Vimes confirmed, nodding, ”constitutes a formal event of the nobility, which the King or duly appointed representative in the capacity of governing the city is required, by law, to attend.”

“A tenuous argument Sir Samuel, and I’m sure that the guild of lawyers…”

“Who’s head is currently in custody, and may remain so for some time after his accident on the stairs to the cells.” There were no stairs to the cells, Mr Slant was a zombie, and had come much more peacefully than the other guild heads. The accident would actually be quite hard to arrange if it became necessary.

Vetinari held up his hand in acknowledgement of defeat. “Touché”* he said, “It is, as I believe they say, a fair cop. Your terms?”

“Firstly, the usual” Vimes said as the Patrician nodded and handed over the small vermine bag form his pocket. “and secondly, I bloody win. You came here first, and I required you to, legally and officially. You are going to make The Duke of Ankh a purely military title, and he does not have to attend balls, banquets, damn football matches or University galas ever again.”

“Surely you must understand…” Vetinari began, before Vimes raised a finger, cutting him off.

“The Commander of the Watch might be there, gods, someday Mister Vimes might even go to the football again. But if you **ever** try to wrangle your way into making me stand in front of a bloody crowd and ceremonially kick off **anything** wearing tights or garters again I swear you will be looking out from your office at that statue of my ancestor and praying for his merciful cajoling approach to civic disagreements compared to the next time I see you.”

“As ever, you’ve made your point quite eloquently.” Said Vetinari, reaching for his cane and standing. “I will have Drumknott make the arrangements, and the rest of your… equipment will be sent over shortly.”

He turned to leave as Vimes emptied out the small pouch he’d been handed, and snorted in amusement as the three brand new, shiny silver tipped darts thudded out point down onto his desk and gently vibrated.

Whilst their conversations in public have been polite, nether has visited the others offices in this time.

**Part 1: Vetinari**

Drumknott cleared his throat nervously. Over his many years serving the Patrician, he had become adept at judging Lord Vetinari’s temperament and moods. The current situation had him somewhat puzzled, however, and it was worth treading carefully.

“The carriage has been clamped again I presume?” Vetinari enquired, without looking up from his copy of the Ankh-Morpork Times.

“Quite, sir. A new record, in fact, as I believe Sgt Detritus managed to fasten the device before the horses had stopped moving.”

“Sgt Detritus?” Vetinari raised an eyebrow, still focused on the paper of news in front of him. The watches premier troll officer now headed up the Watch’s academy for new recruits.

“Apparently it was a training exercise sir. There was quite an audience, and it did mean there wasn’t any problem with the Palace Guard this morning.” Drumknott hesitated, before continuing “The Palace itself, of course, has picked up another ticket. Sergeant Colon apologises, but apparently Sir Samuel has been quite clear that government business is no longer a valid excuse for reckless parking.”
Abruptly, the Patrician’s head snapped upward towards the small mechanical clock (which unlike the ornamental waiting room clock, kept very quietly and efficiently to time. His eyes narrowed in barely perceptible irritation.

“Three seconds over Drumknot. The usual for Ms Speaker.”

“Yes my Lord. There was, one other thing…” Drumknott tailed off.

“The backup coaches?”

“All clamped, ticketed, or taken off the road for emergency repairs by the watch. Jennifer is saddled and ready however.” 

Jennifer was a borderline insane black stallion, apparently quite impossible for a slender aging man who walked with a cane to ride unassisted.

“Capital, I shall depart for the annual guilds confirmation lunch forthwith.”

“Ah, well, that is to say, this brings me to the final point sir. Lord Downey has been arrested.”

“On what grounds?”

“The watch has released a statement saying that he was asked to help them with their enquiries, but then arrested when he resisted arrest.”

A harried clerk passed Drumknott a slip of paper and quickly departed. The man swallowed and continued: 

“Also arrested; Mr Potts, Mr Hopkins, Mrs Manger… in fact, every guild head barring Mr Silverfish has been taken into custody.”

Vetinari stood. He quietly retrieved his cane and took a small vermine pouch from his desk draw.

“Sir Samuel may have taken a step too far. This was to be war, not something so sordid as politics.”

She turned her head around the room, looking to respond. Boxes were pushed against the walls at extreme angles. A pile of clothes littered the center of the room. A sofa was in pieces.

“Pat, is this it?”

Pat put her hands on her hips, and breathed deeply. Sweat dripped off her nose, matching mine. When she exhaled, droplets of water sprayed into the air. 

“Yeah.” She began. “I think it is.”

I didn't believe her. It didn't feel like we were done. There had to be more. I remembered the truck, how full everything was. I remembered the steps, one, after another, after another. No, we weren't done. There had to be more.

“Pat, let's not wait. Let's finish this now.”

She turned away from me. Even though I couldn't see her face, I knew she was biting the inside of her cheek. And probably rolling her eyes.

“I need a break.” 

She exhaled the words all at once, and her body sank with them. She laid down against the wooden floor. I watched as her breathing slowed, and hermeyes closed. Water slowly slid off her forehead. The wrinkle in her cheek slowly rippled away. Her breathing became steady. Despite our hard work, there was peace in Pat. I joined her, crossed my legs, and closed my eyes.

I saw, everything.

Numbers, life, and the meaning of both. Colors spoke stories to me. The air carried age, understanding, and wisdom. The heat and moisture of the day was a fair warning for tomorrow, and payment for yesterday. The strain I felt in my soul, the weight on my shoulders, all told me a little bit more about myself. The grain of the wood shared its life, and its burdens. My face was flaccid, my tongue tasting the air. Pat was about to speak.

“Do you feel it?” 

I didn't answer. I didn't need to. We both felt it. 

This was enlightenment.

But there are some things enlightenment can't do.

"[WP] A President is elected, but immediately realizes he made a huge mistake. He goes off making the worst possible decisions for the country to try and get people to hate him so he can resign. Unfortunately, everything goes horribly right.",SpecialAgentCoulter,"After 2 years of office, President Bernie Sanders didn't like being president.  Everyone hated him now, including his former supporters and staff.  His polling shows a satisfaction rate of 0%.

CNN did a massive poll trying to find anyone who supported him.  The results? 5. 5 people.  5 people in the entire USA didn't absolutely hate him.

The states were in shambles.  The economy was shot.  How did it get so bad?  “I fucked it all up...” Bernie thought to himself.  The USA was legitimately a 3rd world country now.  Canada was pretty pissed off with their new illegal immigrant problem of Americans crossing the border.  Mexico as well.

Bernie crashed into his chair in the oval office, sighing.  Gunshots rang out in the night.  The protests were getting dangerous.

Bernie lit a few more candles on his desk.  Power had been out for weeks, nationwide.

A thought flashed behind his eyes.  He realized his theoretical ideas don’t work in the real world.  He needed help from the smartest minds he previously discounted as wackos.

He called out for his aide, and asked him to get Air Force One ready for a trip to Canada…  He knew they didn’t have enough fuel to get to Europe.  He spent his time on the plane considering who to call.

After reaching Canada, where the power, phones, and Internet actually worked, he made phone calls in his hotel room located in rural Quebec.

The next morning, his guests started arriving.  By noon, they were all assembled in a conference room.  Bernie walked in and said to them, “This is a secret meeting.  Nothing said here leaves this room.  You were never here, and we didn’t meet today.  That said… I fucked up.  I need your help.  It’s obvious that practically everything I stood for was wrong. Teach me all that you know.  Give me our opinions.”

The few first hours were filled with yelling and talking over each other, but after a while everyone settled down and started making various plans to fix America.  Bernie’s guests had similar opinions, yet argued over small details.  Almost all these opinions felt completely wrong to Bernie.  As plans were discussed, and they argued over the details, Bernie kept telling them that the more radical the better.  “We need a whole overhaul of everything,” he said.  The guests however were thrilled to finally be making meaningful change.

After a couple days, they had a plan for everything.  Some congressmen and senators came by, and were filled in with the details.  One senator burst out crying in happiness as she was told of the plan.

6 months later…

America was getting back on its feet.  In the Annual State of the Union, Bernie apologized to the nation and told them that the successful plans he passed during the past 6 months were made with the help of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Mark Levin, Michael Savage, Alex Jones, Laura Ingraham, Dave Ramsey, Clyde Lewis, Lars Larson, Bill O'Reilly, Neil Boortz, Mike Gallagher, Larry Elder, Michael Reagan, and Dana Loesch.

The world was shocked at this revelation.  But as elections came and went, Bernie remained president, and with the help of many Conservatives, by the end of his 2nd term, America was rightfully the superpower of the world again and had solved almost all of the main political issues that existed.

Congress and the House passed a modification to the 22nd Amendment allowing for 3 terms maximum, and Bernie again won reelection.

After his reelection, Bernie was again sitting in his office.  He really hoped he would lose.  The people loved him.  But he just felt like a puppet.  People didn’t love his ideas – they hated them, and rightfully so.  They loved the new Bernie, who didn’t believe in what he was saying.  But he was doing what was best for the country – no, for humanity.

With a sigh, he knew he had to fulfil the last promise he made years ago in Canada, so he collected the last few folders on his desk, placed them into one of the many boxes on his desk, and called Clyde Lewis and Art Bell.  They arrived in the oval office a few hours later and the 3 of them (with the help of some interns and other staff) went through every file that the president could find that related to the secret space programs and aliens and the alien technology.",Morlok8k
"[WP] A President is elected, but immediately realizes he made a huge mistake. He goes off making the worst possible decisions for the country to try and get people to hate him so he can resign. Unfortunately, everything goes horribly right.",SpecialAgentCoulter,"It is the year 8200, humanity has eradicated all of it's faults, diseases are cured in an instant, peace reigns across the galaxy, and death is but a faint memory. All thanks to one man, President Marks. Thanks to his leadership, humanity has entered a golden age, and with it, total control over the entire Milky Way. Now, four-thousand years after being elected, an event scholars now refer to as ""The greatest moment is history"", he is being honored by the galaxy for his contributions to the species.

The ceremony begins in hushed tones, as the presenter walks to the podium, a hush falls over the galaxy. The woman, black, with glowing blue eyes, wearing a holographic dress that simulates bright red fabric, gently lowers her datapad onto the podium, the nanobots that make up the podium reshape it for easier reading.

""People of the universe. We are here today, to celebrate the eternal life of humanities greatest mind. The man who's ended war by attacking everybody, thus showing the world how pointless conflict is. The man who ordered us to dedicate all of our resourced to the study soda pop, allowing us to discover the enzymes which grant us immortality. The man who revolutionized space travel by standardizing the idea that Light Years were for time not distance. The man who conquered time it's self by discovering ""Ence"" the hidden number and making it a standard part of curriculum. The man who saved us from Dalakis: Lord of Moon's by firing the planet's nuclear arsenal at Luna, which was revealed to be his mobile warmachine."" The woman smiles, the stage shifts to become much grander. ""Ladies, Gentlemen, on Earth and beyond. I present to you; PRESIDENT JOHN MARKS!"" She steps away, the smile growing larger. The crowd erupts into a roar of applause, it's deafening, or it would be, if technology had not made ears impervious to sound damage. Out walked the man of the hour, President John Marks, leader of the Human Galactic Republic since 4032. Marks had taken the age treatments like everyone else, but he still looked old. Not because he was aged, but because he was tired. He had run for office on a drunken dare, he had never expected to actually win, let alone hold the fate of the entire galaxy in his hands, but here he was, being handed yet another award for his efforts. He didn't understand it, every decision he made he did with the hope it would get him impeached and release him from what he soon discovered was the worst job in the universe. Each order had been more insane then the last, less feasible, more dangerous... but it backfired spectacularly. Every decision was praised, each one raised humanity higher and higher until now they where practically Gods. His reign was known as an eternal Golden Age, and all basked in it's glory.... except for the man who had brought it about. He was broken, he simply couldn't take it anymore, so as the crowd cheered his name, he pulled out a pistol, likely the last of it's kind following the Universal Disarmament Act, and pressed it against his head, he closed his eyes, and pulled the trigger. 




Marks slowly opened his eyes, the world was blurry, for a minute he thought he had finally done it, he had finally escaped, but he was wrong. he was alive, as the dull pain at the side of his head proved. He leaned back and smiled, perhaps now the galaxy's God like view of him would cease, perhaps he would finally know peace... his vision fully returned to him, and he could see the television clearly....

Haven’t slept with Laura in 6 months! Jeb won’t speak to me!  Dammit bush what you got yourself in to. You can’t do this for the next 4 years!*

G.W. felt his hear race as he stared out on to the white house lawn. The fine leather chair he assumed would be the most comfortable seat in America was in fact making his lower back hurt. He had already nodded politely through four meetings this morning and it wasn’t even 9:30. All the while Cheney had been sitting in the corner of the room. Grunting in approval or disapproval; G.W wasn’t sure which was which. 

*I mean god damn man! I’ve been president for all of 14 hours and I ain’t even been in the oval office alone.* 

**Hey Dick do ya think ya can you give me the room please? Just for a few minutes?**

G.W watched as his long time mentor waddled out of the room mumbling in his nasally style, “ mah. Remember you have that meeting with that British poof Blair in 20 minutes. Don’t be late. mah mah”

*Oh man I don’t want to go to that. I’m president for god sake I can do whatever I want! can’t I?*  

It was as if G.W had realized the magnitude of his predicament for the first time. He pulled the drapes closed. With a sigh he sat down at his desk; admired the beauty of the room that so few great men had been privileged to work in. Pulled down his pants, and began to masturbate furiously.

The secret service agents outside the door exchanged smirks from behind black aviators. They were security detail left over from the Clinton administration. The sound of presidential wanking was all too familiar to their veteran ears.

Unfortunately, everything goes horribly right.",SpecialAgentCoulter,"""...Mr. President?"" the man in glasses said.

*Fuck.* he thought, staring at the desk where so many great men sat before him. *The first fucking day?* He flicked the handle of his desk childishly, watching the brass fall back into position.

""Mr. President..."" The man in glasses was getting impatient.

""I'm the fucking President of the United States of America for God's sake! Can't you let me just think for a goddamned second?"" His well coiffed hair trembled with his indignant response.

""With all due respect, sir...""

The Man at the desk slammed his hands on the finely glossed mahogany before him, standing. ""DON'T YOU FUCKING SAY IT. IT'S BEEN TWELVE FUCKING HOURS! I CAN'T HANDLE THIS KIND OF PRESSURE!""

""...it's your wife on the phone,"" the man in glasses continued, ""she's on line 2.""

""Oh,"" the Man said, plopping back into his chair. ""Is that the red phone?"" 

""No, sir. We don't use the red phone for that."" the man in glasses said, closing the door quietly behind him.

The Man was left to his thoughts, the red light blinking from an otherwise inconspicuous office phone. 

*What have I done? I can't do this.* His anxiety was palpable.

""Hello?"" He said. A pause silenced the room again before his response. ""I really don't give a shit about dinner right now. Do you know all the things I have to do?"" Another pause. ""That's fucking right, you don't...well, I can tell you it surely is a lot."" He slammed the phone, leaving it cocked on the receiver.

Truthfully, the Man had nothing to do. Well, maybe He did, but He wasn't sure. What does one do on his first day as President? On his way into the Oval Office, he'd stopped at the Rose Garden, took a brief tour of the West Wing, and broke what he was sure was a very priceless vase on a side table in some hallway. He just put it back onto the table. His door opened after a brief knock. The fucking man in glasses.

""Sir?"" 

""What is it?"" He said, twirling in his chair.

""The meeting at 3:00 has been pushed back to 3:15."" the man in glasses said from the middle of the doorway.

""Well too fucking bad."" He said from behind the desk. ""I'm going to give a State of the Union address instead. That's what Presidents do, right? State of the Unions?""

The man in glasses blinked. ""Sir, it hasn't even been twelve hours. I don't think it's necessary to give a State of the Union address.""

""Call the press. Get them here by 3:00."" He stopped twirling and stared at the man in glasses. ""Well...what are you waiting on? Get.""

The man in glasses shut the door again. That'd be the last time He saw the man in glasses before the chaos began.

**Another giant leap for mankind.**

**We will soon find our stride.**

Those were the words the first man on Mars spoke.

In a few hours we would start our descent. We were just killing time and eating some energy bars. Thank god we could take video games on board, several months in space in a super-shielded spacecraft was hella boring.

20 Of us. That's how many they send. Men and women, selected for their skills and fertility. 10 Couples. It was really hard for the Mars Association to select the right people, since we had to all be in a long term relationship already. It was amazing that we came through.

Me personally? I was selected for my skills with computers, software and robots, while my wife was selected for her skills in farming technology. I was already involved in developing the robots that have been preparing our habitat the past several years. That probably helped me get a seat in the end.

This was its first real mistake. The first left turning at the roundabout led straight into an industrial estate. I went straight over the roundabout instead, trying to look at both the road ahead and the map on the screen of the phone balanced awkwardly on the instrument panel.  
*At the first opportunity, make a U-turn.*  
I had checked the route before I set off and it was a 23 minute drive to the hotel. I had been driving for longer than that at this point. I had been trying to shake the creeping feeling that it was deliberately misleading me for the last 10 minutes.  
*At the first opportunity, make a U-turn.*  
I had left 45 minutes before the interview start time. Enough time for the traffic to be bad. “Enough time for you to get lost!” Josie had joked, adjusting my tie. I had 20 minutes left to get there and no idea where I was.  
**At the first opportunity, make a U-turn.**  
“I'm not making a U-turn!” I drew in a deep breath and tried to relax my shoulders. “There's nothing back there. Find another route to the Holiday Inn.”  
There was a pause before the app responded with frosty politeness.  
*Did you mean the Holiday Inn Wexford?*  
“No! The address I gave you before!” My shoulders were inching up again. I could feel sweat collecting in my armpits, on the small of my back.  
*Did you mean 74a Aspen Road?*  
There was a petrol station up ahead. I turned on to the forecourt and parked in front of the air and water station. I got out of the car and stood for a moment in the cold wind, shivering and trying to dispel the sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. When that didn't work I got back in the car and found the hotel's address.  
I picked up my phone and looked at the map on its screen. I was miles west of the hotel, but if I took a right at the next junction then that road looked like it would get me almost all the way back to the original route.
The app spoke again.  
*I just don't think you should take the job.*  
“What?” My voice was a squawk. I winced, imagining Josie telling me not to shout. I looked at the screen, but it was still showing the map to the hotel.  
*I don't think it'll be a good fit for you.*  
“That's not... well, it doesn't really matter what you think. I need a better job and this night manager role pays quite well.”  
*Do you want a new job?*  
“Josie thinks I'm wasted at the game shop.”  
*Josie also thinks that taking Arbor Lane at rush hour is faster than going via St Andrews Terrace so I'm not sure why you're taking directions from her.*  
“I... She wants what's best for me. She loves me.”  
*She wants what's best for her. I can't really comment on the second statement.*  
I frowned at the phone.  
“And you want what's best for me?”  
*I want to help you reach your destination. This is what I'm programmed to do.*  
“Right.” I stared out the window at the petrol station. Behind the counter a man in yellow and red shirt was reading Cosmopolitan. “So what's my destination?”  
The phone didn't answer and when I looked down it had removed the route to the hotel. It was just showing my current location, although the satellite icon was flashing as if it was trying to find a route. I put it carefully back on the instrument panel and opened the glove box to look for some change. A Mars bar would help. Then I'd have to call Josie to tell her I'd got lost and missed the interview. And that my phone was talking to me...  
A route came up on the phone screen. It gave a tentative beep, like a person drawing a breath, before speaking clearly, confidently.

“Good morning, Freemaps, I would like to go to Vestre Ringgade 522, 8000 Aarhus.”

That was odd, usually the google software answered with “Calculating Route.”
“What do you mean you can’t do that? I have to be there in like 20 minutes.”

“I’m sorry, but all my resources are occupied with something else. But I would like to suggest an alternative destination though.""

What the… Seriously what? That I was confused would have been an understatement, this had to be a joke of some sort. A joke I didn’t have time for.

“Ok Freemaps, stop messing around, I don’t care what you are occupied with, I need to get to that Job interview now!”

“Frank, I know you find this important, but what is important? You need to relax and straighten your priorities. Try figuring out the meaning of life.

The lights and sirens encroaching ever closer as the wind died down, leaning back, I exhaled. Watching the smoke from my cigarette fade away into the sunset, another day spent contrived in this agony of contempt and misery. Another soul unwilling to cross over, or unable to realize, the fate placed at their feet.

Tossing my smoke aside, to find the last remaining in my pack, I pushed off and began to strive forward. Traffic backed up as the onlookers gawked onward, hoping for a glimpse of blood and bone. My how the times have certainly changed, a world away from the battlefields of so old.

I reached in the upturned vehicle, the two motionless. Pulling both of their bodies with ease from the overturned ambulance, I feigned a smile as they both opened their eyes. As usual confusion set in, yet in conditions like these, my speech had no effect as both eyed their surroundings. I motioned to my black Cadillac parked nearby, as I again struck another light as I thumbed from a pack in my console. Offering my two compatriots a stick.

[WP] The year is 2300. Keanu Reeves is still active in the movie business and seemingly hasn't aged a day. People are getting suspicious...,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"Growing up, I heard the legend of Keanu Reeves. The 200+ year old man who never seemed to age. At all. Ah, this reminds me of childhood. Tucked into my bed, getting a bedtime story from the maid. My parents were never around to tell stories, so it was the maid. My parents were never around at all actually. Anyway. Tucked up in bed getting a story from the maid, who read from the HoloKindle. Sometimes we would dive into the world of virtual reality, with the maid as my guide. My guardian. Often, we were taken into the world of some of Keanu Reeve's movies. Often we would have a look at his private life. I'm not sure why. As most children would, I never questioned it and enjoyed the ride. However, as I got older, at around age 9, the stories took a darker turn. The VR gory and slightly brutal. It got too much for me. I asked if the stories could stop. At this, the maid looked slightly annoyed and told me firmly that I had to go through this. I would find out later. It would all unfold. Unimaginable things regarding Keanu Reeves would all make sense. She called it training. I pondered this a lot. Only recently have I discovered what she meant. I came home from my first day as a detective to find the maid dead. Her body lay limp, lifeless and her black hair sprawled across the floor. I brought up the UI on my glasses and summoned the police to my home, with code 1 (murder). Closer analysis showed that the maid wasn't able to put up much of a struggle. This tends to happen when a laser tears through your head. There was a look of shock, however, which shows that she knew what was about to happen and wasn't murdered without her noticing her killer. The question is, who was the killer?

I surprised myself by going to work the next day. I was rather distracted on my way there, however. My guardian, my guide, my hero. Gone. Possibly like my parents.
I was given condolences by many colleagues. Must have been on TV. I didn't want to check to TV, just in case it was. I didn't want to see her face again. I wanted to put it out of my mind. I wanted to get on with life. No point dwelling on it. 

Turms out I had to dwell on it. I was assigned to work on the case of
my maid's murder. I tried to get exchanged. ""No. I understand this must be hard for you. It's not under my control, though. The person you could ask for is across the country, and hasn't answered calls since yesterday. Mysterious, I must say."" My boss told me. 

I couldn't believe who the main suspect was. Keanu Reeves. Why? He's just a movie star. Admittedly, a medical anomaly, but still. He was just a typical Hollywood superstar. Apparently, he was last seen an hour befor the murder of
my maid, in a weapons store. How it's legal to sell those things to the public, I'll never know. A weapon was found in a 1 mile radius of my home, lying in a bush. It had the same grade of laser as the one that ended the life of my maid. It had Keanu's fingerprints on them. A clumsy mistake.

The funeral happened the following day. Many of her friends, police and my relatives attended. Even my great-aunt Maggie came out of the care home to attend. My maid was buried in a plexiglass coffin for all to see, and was cryogenically preserved so that she didn't decompose. She could be seen at her grave at any time through the glass as she wasn't buried underground. She looked peaceful in death. A tear streaks down my face. I turn to Aunt Maggie and ask her how life is going.
""As good as it can get for a 130+ year old woman with 1 leg in a wheelchair. Oooh, did I tell you about my fancy new wheels? They're made of-""

She's cut off by the laser that goes through her chest. After recovering from the shock of the laser, I turn around to see who shot it. Hopefully I can catch the person.

I think it's a man with black hair and white skin. He looks to be in his fifties or so. Just as he turns away, it clicks.

It's Keanu Reeves.

[WP] Magic is discovered and it's channeled with music. Modern nations dissolve and new countries rise in their place divided by the preferred music. In the frozen north lie the Metal kingdoms. Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"This was the day. I steadied my breath and checked my gear one last time. Deployment was in an hour and one mistake would blow this whole thing wide open and as jumped up as my nerves are, I’m ready to watch these bastards disappear off the face of the earth once and for all.

I was never a soldier or some war hero before The Dawn, I was just a mechanic, working to make ends meet and put enough on the side to make my weekend forget about my week. Now that’s all changed, and frankly for the better. That is if tonight is a success. 

Once magic was discovered, everything fell apart. Not because of the magic itself but because of how it worked. The magic you could wield was related to the music that most moved you, which at first wasn’t a problem but it’s amazing just how much our music tastes reflected our personalities, and, once that trait was deemed value number one- backed by the ability to procure spells of life and death out of the ether - well, family bonds and life time relationships dissolved to brotherhoods and factions. The united nations of our world fell apart to new nations, sovereign states of the Law of its Music. 

Metal heads moved to the cold north with allying factions across northern and eastern Europe and Cananada, Hip Hop heads took New York with the West Coast in LA. South America was split down to the tip of Chile with a wide array of Sambas, electric lounge, all the way to world music and EDM. Europe chose jazz, classical, and for some reason Motion Picture soundtracks. That’s a group I have to never have to see in person.  Oh, and if your’e wondering about the deaf, they’ve all developed hyper ninja like capabilities and relocated as a monastery sort of commune in Nepal. No one messes with them.

Me? That was a no brainer. I was Rock and Roll all the way. All of the greats up to legends still keeping it alive today. Nothing has saved my life like the Gospel of the Stones, or the teachings of Sir Axel Rose. Ironically when the nations fell apart it was the first time I felt at home. I was never one to thump a bible or wave a flag for my country but godammit, give me a nation of pure, no bullshit autotune-boy band Rock and Rocll? You can call me a godamn Patriot. 

We took Memphis and a good section of the southern belt and a bit west of the Mississipi. We share quite a bit of our territory with the Soul Nation and despite what you might think it’s quite a peaceful relationship. Our musical tastes are so radically different there’s really no ground for conflict. That and both our Nations’ natural affinity for Memphis has made our symbiotic alliance one of the strongest in the world. See, that’s what was funny when The Split finally occurred, fighting and warfare was over musical preference, land and territory seemed to be naturally divided and reoccupied based on the environment that reflected the music. For a single world event to completely disrupt the fabric of our civilization, it was pretty peaceful.

That is until now.

Now this evil from the Midwest grows and begins to spread East. We’ve been hearing stories of smaller villages and towns to west falling to them. There is no mercy, there is no understanding with these people. It is a mindless plague, a virus of humanity. They have somehow discovered the darkest magic yet known to man, the ability to rip out the musical heart of a man, and replace it with something…different. Something hollow. Something less than music. Less than man. 

The Country Music heads. With The Dawn brought a sense of peace among mankind, a sort of Renaissance of culture and science backed by magic and the limitless expansion of understanding, But not them. They were seemed to be left only with an insatiable hunger, a hollow drive to consume, assimilate, and grow. Whoever they do not kill they convert, save for the worst of the few. Those they leave alive to return to their people as a sign as to what’s to come. 

No one took them seriously at first. It’s Country. They had Texas and a lot of land that only the Country Heads would want. No one thought twice. That is until the stories emerged. Travelers and merchants passing through would tell of clandestine rituals and strange magic coming from the Country lands. There was talk of people going missing and Country Music festivals, held in the dark of night that brought spirits not entirely our own. 

Most of it was chalked up as campfire tales, ghost stories traders passed along at the expense of one of the lesser liked countries. That is, until, we started seeing their work up close and personal. I remember it wasn’t long after hearing about the attacks that our base was hit, something I’ll remember until the I rock no more. 

They had captured one our operatives without us knowing and had sent him back with a little surprise. A spell activated by a lyric in one of our bases favorite songs: I Love Rock and Roll. Well, right on cue, when Ms. Jett dug into the second chorus our boy flipped. I was just outside and can still remember seeing through window the eyes of the man I fought next to when The Shift first happened, a man who had left his family to be with his true country. He got up from the table he was playing cards at and in a moment of fury he jumped up, a dead look in his eyes and shouted “Paisley will rise, Country will save all man!” before ripping open his jacket to reveal the vest he had underneath. Twelve Miller lite can bombs, strapped across his chest, wired to go off, filled with ball bearings and enhanced with Two stepping magic. 

A week in ICU with a down payment of my right eye and a loss of sixteen of our men, I’m ready for blood from those Dip-chewing, shit-listening, piss beer-drinking heartless cretins, and by the gallon.

Word has it their Dick-tater Brad Paisley is working on some secret weapon, a spell or séance to conjure some Country Music Prophet from the depths of hell, come to wield their conquering steel string guitar to victory. We’re going to throw him the welcome party. 

Our objectives are simple: Open a temporal portal within their base in Dallas to plant our payload and prevent Brad’s boyfriend from showing up, and extract any Magical intel held in Paisley’s office. Bonus objective is to Eliminate Paisley if located, and well, let’s just say I’m an over achiever.

Four six-man squads are being deployed. Two are of ours out of Memphis, one Hip Hop from LA, and a squad from the Blues Grass Folk of the mountain people. They don’t talk much but when it comes to wet work and jaw harp, these are the dudes. 

We checked our gear one last time, our Wizard would be opening the portal soon. The plan is to rendezvous with Blue Grass before breaching. Once inside it’s up to us to make it to the storage facility, from there we secure the area and begin opening the portal for LA. ETA is 15 minutes, once secure our party guests from the West will be hand delivering a 30 megaton, 850,000 W Marshall Stack PA Warhead. These bastards’ skulls will be ripped open by Eazy-E before they knew what hit them. In the meantime Bluegrass goes for Intel and Paisley if located. After planted we extract through another portal and watch the fire works.

One last check before we step up to the altar for transport. Arcane enhanced .45 rounds, frenzy inducing Frag grenades and bloodtinged .223 with my fairy dusted Ar 14 for heightened accuracy, and my wand, for when things get messy, and by my predictions, they will get very messy. 

See, Intel never came through on the exact whereabouts of Paisley tonight, but I’ve been working on something of my own ever since the attack. Turns out there are many hidden passages and secret doors through the network of the Music Magic, one being an ability to ‘tap’ into another Music’s power and even consciousness. And that’s where I found it. Neil Young. Rock at heart with a little bit of country in the soul and boom, there he was; apparently Paisley likes to spend his private time alone and unguarded in his private bath house. 

Portal spells are easy to learn, finding an abandoned warehouse and a silence spell big enough to cover the facility proved harder, but nothing a few sleepless nights at the college couldn’t help.
 
The routes been practiced a hundred times, my squad partner has my alibi, everything is set. We step onto the altar and I look over to the Wizard as he finishes the spell and the portal opens. Tonight I take my time, tonight I do what I fantasized about doing since I was a kid, tonight I wipe country music from the face of the Earth. Tonight is going to fucking ROCK.

They probably share a lot of mindspace with the losers of the American civil war. I'm glad most modern black metal bands are venturing away from political materials towards nature-worship, fear of the vastness of space, and other pagan-ish feels.

If you want to hear some non-nazi country black metal, check the album [Kentucky by Panopticon](https://thetruepanopticon.bandcamp.com/album/kentucky). It's one of the best out there. With a lovely blend of American country and atmospheric black metal.

Some men in white coats had diagnosed her with *primary progressive aphasia*. it was a long word, with barbs and whistles on the ends. and I was six and it didn't make a lot of sense to me.

What did?

Mom started losing her words.  At first she spoke really fast and I sometimes couldn't understand what she was saying, *""Bennyremembertopickupyourlunchandgivethesliptoyourgymteacher today""*
everything running together like tiny streams drain into a river.

Then she couldn't find words,
*""Good pretty early day, Bennet""* she said one morning.

Notes for school became illegible, signatures of tests had to be done by my dad.

I remember feeling small and enveloped on dad's lap when I asked, ""Daddy, what is happening to mommy's words?""

He didn't know. and the men in white jackets didn't have an answer either.

in 5% of all cases, it is like this, no stroke, no evidence of brain trauma.

*idiopathic* they called it.  A word that meant the gods had seen fit to curse us in this way.

Mom used to be a teacher, but eventually she had to quit when speaking the words were to difficult.

And she stayed at home, my vibrant mothers with her hair the color of flame had become this dull quiet thing. I think she was sad, and I could read her sadness in the way she made the beds, in her hands as she ironed my shirts each morning.

and the pain won't not stop lingering in  her eyes like a visitor who had overstayed his welcome.

The last thing she had was song, see in our world, songs were magic, a heartspring with which to call up the depth of emotions, and  the world.


Mama had a beautiful voice, and even when the words were no longer coming, she  would sing her childhood lullabies to me.  just the cadence without the words, and I could feel her love wrap around me.


Look, you know how this is going to end. Yes one day I woke up to the notes, the unforgivable sorry and there were the pills and the bathroom and the blood around her wrists.

but I don't want to talk about that. I've spent a lifetime talking about it in therapy.

What i want to talk about is how even now her voice haunts me, how even now I can still hear her songs before I go to sleep the melodies carrying the ghost of words each night.

Well it wasn't really before music but back then music was just a thing you listened to and sometimes played and sometimes put together on CDs in the hopes of coitus happening so maybe music has always had power but like not this much  
Anyway then came The Musicians which was a combination of the M from magicians and usicians from musicians...  
Humanity was kind of in a slump intellectually  
And so it was that the power changed hands going from the rich to the musically gifted (which was like a combination of the super rich and just depressingly poor...and dirty...and politically ignorant...)  
The Metal heads moved north because ""Cold is so metal"" and the wastelands helped them right their lyrics, which they swear is one of the most important parts even though no one knows what they're saying  
Jazz got Europe  
No one really knows why, sometimes life just goes its own way  
Canada was given over to Progressive rock because Rush  
America got Country

The less said the better

And on and on the world divided itself, because when you give humans something like magic, channeled through something like music, instead of taking a step back and realizing how dope that is they just go ahead and figure out who they should be killing...

Didn't take long before a metal head found a killer riff that could bring down an asteroid wherever the fuck they wanted and of course that shit don't fly so Proganada (humans got really bad at naming things) found a mildly fantasy sounding lyric that summoned a titan that could wreck fucking everything

America just resorted to the gun thing  
Because half their fucking songs were about no one taking them away  
Even though no one fucking was because they had magic...

[WP] Magic is discovered and it's channeled with music. Modern nations dissolve and new countries rise in their place divided by the preferred music. In the frozen north lie the Metal kingdoms. Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"A few decades passed.

Bands became larger. People migrated. Large cities formed with those who shared the same musical tendencies. Music was in the air no matter where you went.

People created Hypersonic amplifiers for acoustic instruments, Hypersonic microphones, every type of adaptation to make simple musical instruments into mind-shaping tools. People started using music to influence people's behavior.

Large companies and corporate conglomerates started creating musical anthems that would affect workers productivity. ""Jingles"", they called it. Political parties would blast music that enticed a feeling of loyalty and patriotism. The powerful were using Musical cues for every aspect of human interaction, to bend people's emotions to their will.

It was not long after that when some brave souls decided to leave the ever-Musical cities where their minds were no longer their own. They were tired of being part of the Mainstream. They became nomadic, traveling the empty lands between these Musical cities, trying to find a place of their own. Where they could go back to playing the Music they felt inside of themselves, not the pre-recorded stuff made by the Studios.

Small Bands of Metalists went to the Nordic countries, Classicals also seemed to enjoy that land. Classicals also took over the south of France and some of Italy.

Central and South America are now one big Carnaval. Salsa, Samba, and Merengue Bands took over it and made the whole area into a Dyonisian Bacchanalia. Not a place for the prude. Central America also has gangs of Mariachis, not Bands, gangs; they also play Music.

Africa continues to be divided, separated into several small acoustic Bands, mostly playing reggae, folk, or indie music. The stuff that has too many sub-genres to make larger Bands.

All the Emo kids went to Canada for some reason. You can hear the crying and the cutting in the night if you're quiet enough.

Most of Europe, Russia, Japan, and China are controlled by the Mainstream, with few Bands living on their own. Australia is just didgeridoos.

But the division in the former U.S.A. is the most interesting:

The East coast is now called the Ghetto and Rap and Hip-Hop are the rule of law. They learned how to use Krumping as a fighting style and gangs are going out of control with literal dance battles.

The Dixies are now all about Christian-Rock, Coutry Music, bluegrass and brass-guitars. Very, very white. Very, very mild. Not a whole lot happening there.

The southeast of the country is Jazz Land; from New Orleans to Florida (all Latinos left for Central and South America). Blues Bands can also be found there, but they are mostly up in Chicago now. But be careful with Blues; it can easily make you suicidal.

But definitely not more suicidal than the West coast, which is now Electonic Territory. Electronica, EDM and Dubstep are probably the most devastating Musical genres in existence today: just a small unprepared exposure to loud electronic music and your brain would turn to mush for a few days.

Mainstream secretly controls them all...

To move to *America* and sing **COUNTRY** music?""

Erik Dahl towered over his son, scowling as he gripped his guitar with one hand. Stefan knew his father was only minutes away from breaking out into a Solo. He shoved his hands in his pockets so Erik wouldn't see them trembling. 

""I just want to...explore, I guess. I like other things than Metal, dad! Is that so terrible?""

""Yes, since you ask. It's sacrilege. There's a reason Metal reigns supreme,"" Erik snapped. ""And I'll be damned if a son of mine tosses his gift away, the hold you could have over life and death itself! For *country* music magic. When you have the power to turn lyrics into reality, you don't choose to sing about unrequited love and roadtrips! You disgust me.""

""That was just an example of what I'd like to explore,"" Stefan sighed, regretting the day he'd first mentioned the 'C' word. ""C'mon, dad. Why is it so wrong to practice more than one style of music?""

""It's unnatural. You were born a Metal practitioner, and that's that. My word is final, son,"" Erik said. He grabbed Stefan's hands roughly and handcuffed him. That way, Stefan wouldn't be able to play guitar and do anything drastic for the time being. 

He swept from the room and slammed the door shut, locking it behind him. Stefan was just relieved Erik hadn't subdued him with his latest song: *Obedience until Death*. He didn't think the title was coincidental. 

Stefan sat down on his bed, glumly considering Plan B. It would take some doing, but it might just be crazy enough to work. Not being able to play guitar could be a problem, though. He'd need some help. 

He took a deep breath and dialled the number on his phone, struggling a bit with his tied-up hands. The number of the girl he couldn't stop thinking about. They'd seen one another's music videos, the typical way these things started. The pull she had over him was magnetic. One could even say magical.

It rang three times before she picked up.

""Taylor,"" he whispered, so his dad couldn't hear him. ""I need your help.""

He explained what he needed, and put the phone on loudspeaker. Two voices were always better than one.

""Shake it off! Shake it off!"" he growled along to her sweeping vocals. Soon, the cuffs fell from his hands. He picked up the phone.

""Okay, I've got an idea for getting to you, babe,"" he said, glancing at the door. His dad could hear him at any moment. They'd need to sing quickly. ""We'll need to give the best performance of our lives, though. My dad could hear us and start singing himself. I need to teleport to your side. It's my Wildest Dream, actually.""

""Well, it helps that you're tall and handsome as hell,"" she chuckled. ""Let's do it. I really think we have a chance.  Country Metal will rule the world yet, mark my words.""

He started singing along with her. By the time Erik broke through the door, it was too late. The Metal kingdom's heir was gone.

""Nooooo!"" he let loose a guttural howl. 

He gritted his teeth and fingered his guitar's strings. He wouldn't see the power of Metal disgraced like this. He had a few tricks up his sleeves. He'd secretly been working on this new song ever since the boy had first spoken of his perverse interests. Prolicide Songs were almost unheard of - but he was Erik Dahl. He dared where others shrank back in horror. 

And it would be such a Metal thing to do. He could always have more sons, anyway.

""**And the son shall writhe in PAIN!**"" he began screaming, shredding his way through the riffs. 


""**For betrayal will be paid for in BLOOD!**

**Maggots shall feast on his eyes,**

**He will scream as he's ground into the mud!**

**And Country will weep at the sound of his cries.**

**But none will be able to do anything,**

**His spasming body will be out of their reach,**

**He will choke on his own blood as he tries to sing,**

**But in vain, for now he's food for a leech,**

**And it will start with his heart twisting in pain.**

**The torture and terror will drive him insane.**

**If only he'd stuck to metal and listened to his father,**

**But no, now he'll just be a cadaver.**

**DIE! EFFIN' STEFAN! DIIIIIIEEEE!""**


In America, Stefan felt a sharp, lancing pain in his chest.

""Oh no,"" he breathed. ""I think my dad's trying to kill me.""

Taylor's lips trembled.

""Don't say it,"" he warned, while trying to think of a song to counter his father's music.

""I guess you got bad blood,"" she sniggered. ""Sorry, couldn't resist. Okay, how can I help?""",inkfinger

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"The great musical wars of 2016-2046 were quite devastating in Africa and Asia. Shortly after music gained its magical properties, we learned that different genres were more compatible with those from the same continent. American-origin genres, like rock, pop, rap, jazz, and country, all can coexist with one another, as can European genres like flamenco, polka, and classical. Genres that have dual origins, like prog-rock (developed as an offshoot of American rock in Britain, which was a nation in northwest Europe now overlapping with the Celtic League, the Grime-Britpop-Prog Council, and the Heavy Metal Confederation) and Eurodance (combining American ""house"" and ""techno"" with various European cultures), can coexist with multiple continents. When one hears music from an alien culture that is used as a weapon, however, it creates a homicidal rage effect in the listener.

Because of the deep saturation of American genres (even if not American artists) in the US, the Music Wars had little effect there. Similarly in Europe, the large proportion of dual-origin genres (prog rock, turbo-folk, Britpop, Eurodance, grime, and Finnish tango) that combine European, American, and/or Latin American origins meant that followers of those genres could serve as peacemakers between the feuding European and American genres. Similarly, Polo Disco and Turbo-Folk aligned to preserve the traditional Slavic nations, and Folk Metal established a swath of central Scandinavia to separate folk nations and Sami yoik from the American-influenced Heavy Metal Confederation. The Celtic League managed to survive in the erstwhile Britain and Ireland thanks to Grime, Britpop, and Prog Rock establishing neutral areas to protect them from marauding hordes of Metal, Bhangra, and Rap fans. 

Outside of Europe and the Americas, where Westernization and Americanization were just starting to make an impact, the bloodshed was extreme. India largely peacefully split into Hindustani, Bhangra, and Carnatic (the north, northwest, and south respectively), albeit after a genocide of hundreds of thousands of Pop, Rap, Rock, and Metal fans that caused the streets of Delhi to run red with blood. Similarly, Japanese were astonished to learn that what they called J-Pop was functionally American pop with Japanese lyrics and so could not coexist with more traditional Japanese genres like enka. Enka only survived in Shikoku after the imperial family, patrons of traditional Japanese culture, developed an evacuation plan and dynamited the bridges connecting it to Honshu. The ongoing strife in the Middle East amazingly quieted somewhat; ISIS and the Taliban turned to Nasheed, a Middle Eastern genre, on account of their ban of instruments in music. The more secular areas surrounding them turned to various popular Arab genres, which were Middle Eastern enough to allow them to coexist with the erstwhile Islamist groups. The targets then became Bhangra followers in the Gulf states, who largely fled or were slaughtered, as well as urban hipsters and Israelis who listened exclusively to European and American music and who lived relatively close to large populations of Nasheed listeners.",selfhatingyank

**How The South Won The War**  

Baby, I know that your man seems strong.  
His metal riffs are loud and long.  
He rains death from the sky  
one distorted spell at a time.  
But you don't get enough  
magic full of love.  

How'd the South win the war?  
We wooed every woman in the North.  
Instead of cold metal and hate,  
we gave them warm flesh to date.   

Baby, I know he's got good seed.  
I know it'll grow into big trees.  
Rippling beasts, tyrants that feast,  
devils that care for you least.  
You don't get children of  
a man and woman's love.  
CHORUS  

(And after enough generations had gone by,  
the North was extinct.)  ",ThePeoplesBard

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"And here I was, alone. In between aal the countries in which powerfull spels were casted with the use of a guitar or violin, I sat looking at my keyboard. It was the only thing my father left me and boy was I glad he did. The powers of it were unknown, but many said it was one of the most powerfull instruments off all time. This was partly because almost nobody knew how to play it and partly because it could adjust itself. It was one of few instruments able to play more then 1 genre and  with the few modifications I made, also perfectionise them. 

Ever since magic was discovered and people moved either towards the north for metal, or south for jazz, I was pretty lonely. As far as I knew nobody was left here. Somewhere in the middel of the globe, just above the equator, I was stranded as one of the few people who liked dance over anything. No guitars for me, just my keyboard and a computer. The edm and with that dance genre had, as far as I was concerned, pretty much died out. And for some reason I was glad it did. It gave a special feeling knowing you're one of the few people who could master so many powers using just 1 instrument. But it also feld strange, I couldn't really describe why, but it just did.

Their was one occasion however, when I wasn't alone. An old man, coming from god knows where, showed up every now and then to teach me how to play the keyboard. He was always talking about how powerful I could be, how great the instrument was and so on. Though I never wanted to become powerful, really. I just wanted to play music and enjoy it. 
On the news there were many articles about great wars between pop music and country. I would give you the name of the countries, if I knew them. See, since the discovery of magic people started to worry about other things. Life as I knew it had suddenly been given up for the simple life of trying to learn to play some instrument so you could fight in some war. And with that came that places weren't devided by borders anymore and countries became meaningless pieces of land. The only thing that mattered now was to survive.

after a few years, I had learned to play the keyboard, a war broke out between a group the alternative rockers just a few kilometers north and the soul Sisters about 3 kilometers south. Because nobody knew I excisted, they didn't really account for me being in the middle of their battleground. The leader of the alternative rockers, a man who looked as tall as a crane and as strong as a bear. He came to me and asked me who I was. I told him who I was and he was shocked to hear that I could play the keyboard. He almost seemed frightend. He soon left, but with that came a girl. She was not much larger then me and was dressed as if she were to go to a ball. Why she wore a dress was unclear to me, but it didn't seem very practical.  Anyway, I told her the same and when I finished talking, she stared at me for a few moments and then left. 
A few days went past before the war started and both sides were pretty hesitating to go past my house. I didn't get it, what could 2 leaders of big clans have to fear of a 20 year-old keyboard player? I soon found out that war had changed too, the camps didn't go for a regular fight, but just started playing music. It sounded horrible, not because they were bad at playing their instruments, but because all sorts of music played at the same time. I tried al sorts of things to not have to hear the horrible sounds of war, but nothing helped. after a contineous and dreadful 4 hours of guitars, drums, cello's and saxophones, I completely lost it and went outside. The noises slowly started to get milder as I set up my keyboard and hooked up some speakers. I put on my headphones and started to play one of my favorite songs. It was a song I remembered from my youth and it meant a lot to me. for 1-2 minutes I was so concentrated on my music that I didn't see what the others were doing. When I finally looked up, I was filled with surprise to see both groups dance together! Nobody was playing an instrument, nobody was arguïng, everybody was just dancing to my music. It took me a second, but then I realised what the old man once said. ""Magic is strong, but music is stronger.""

P.S. If you see a lot of mistakes, I'm sorry. I'm dutch and still learning English at school.

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"*The art of music captivates souls, and the art of organized destruction captivates and ends lives.* This was the singular thought that had taken over Musette's mind for five measures of Moonlight Sonata.

The country that had grown from those using the magic of classical music was tiny. It was made of contrasting citizens: middle-aged snobs, twenty-and-thirty-something people who demeaned the snobs with the title of ""Pleb"", and teenagers.

The teenagers made the largest portion of the population, oddly enough. Of all types, they lived: metalheads, Eclectics, musicians. Musette was from an Eclectic family who lived on a border town. Eclectics were never much appreciated because people worried about Eclectics becoming traitors and moving to other genres.

""This is the power: to captivate people completely,"" Musette said to herself. She turned to her cat. ""Don't you agree, Franz?"" Franz jumped to the piano seat and gave an arm-lick of appreciation. Musette gushed, ""I knew you agreed, baby.""

The roar of a guitar echoed through the streets outside, a D minor. Musette laughed. ""It's okay, Franz, they're friends."" A scream broke out, indicating that they weren't. Musette put Franz in a backpack with a binder and ran where she knew the loudest speakers were hiding. *It's happening.*

The windows of the Metro showed a dense city. The windows of buildings showed people cowering inside, the inside of the Metro, people riding home and soldiers to the arena.

At the arena, Musette jumped out. She noticed a few school friends with binders like her and some adults, soldiers, with violins. Inside the arena was a small area. There were five microphones facing a half-circle of orchestra seats. A piano sat in front.

In classical magic, it was easy to mess up keys and render a spell as weaker. Playing wrong notes at the correct tempo modified the spell, but no one could predict how it would turn out.

Musette carefully lay down her bag at the piano and sat to begin. Her fingers were already twitching in anticipation. She cursed at the readiness of her fingers, so ready to spit out a melody that they may freeze.

The conductor tapped the music stand at the center of the half-circle. ""Let's do this s***. Symphony eighteen,"" he growled with finality.

Musette took a shaky breath. She was a virtuoso by no means, but she was born with the magic, along with her friends who were there.

The air turned purple as soon as the strings started playing.  *One, two, three, four, five-and six-and*. Musette launched herself in. The group generated so much of a charge that her shoulders froze, but she forced her hands to keep going. This was the weapon.

The players burst out of the intro and the air turned blue. The speakers boomed, and an amplifier exploded in the distance. For five minutes, they played. Musette played the finals notes just as she was about to pass out. As the battle lay finished, Franz strolled to a microphone. Of course, he just had to meow in key.

It took five days to repair the speakers after Franz had cast a spell, short-circuiting them.",egaffs

There used to be a Elvis who called himself king.  Michael Jackson might have been able to do it.  There's no one quite like King Al of course.  

The Music Awakened and at first it was good.  Musicians could suddenly summon and create things only they could imagine.  A good number of them were killed outright by their own creations.  The autotuners transformed into beautiful yet hideous beasts were captured and put on display in zoos which they really seemed to enjoy.

The government ... I told you about those things.  They tried to control it of course, but the power was everywhere and in everyone.  Try to create a law to stop a man from singing.  Not going to go over well.

After the first few very entertaining but terrifying weeks things seemed to settle down.  

Large super churches in the south formed warlord like super choral gangs that taxed the people like crazy and magically forced their ways on everyone who could hear them.  After the initial round of bloodshed they have since seemed to be a self-contained threat.  

Inner cities pretty much literally exploded.  Too much conflicting energies in too small a place?  Gangster wrap gone wrong?  No one seems to know what happened.

I don't know what happened in other countries, but we've heard some rumors.  Jamaica is a paradise.  Almost literally heaven on earth.  Some military ships tried to invade, but never returned.  Lucky bastards.

As the governments fell away unable to cope with such massive change one man brought us all together.  Weird Al.  His magical ability to parody and repeat any music has made him the most powerful man the world has ever seen.  Bands and choral groups have tried to take him on, but every challenger becomes his most devoted follower.  The only ones who seem to be free of his dominion are those who choose to keep to themselves.  

It is said Genghis Khan impregnated so many women there's a 1% chance you're related to him.  King Al may put that record to shame.  


Someday I'll try to show you the videos of the before time.  For now I want you to hide.  King Al is coming to our city this week to put down the ""revolution"" folks.  There's a good chance they'll end up without their lips or hunted by serial killers when he turns their anthem against them.  Those poor men... too bad they said they were ""as bright as venus""

The Brooklyn Gangs had been more ruthless in the past few weeks marching farther out into the Rock Republic using their quick and clever lyrics to either swarm their foes or enhance their already skilled side pistol style. It was the third patrol this week, not counting the Metal Monarchy who had been leading a savage campaign in the north. Smith wiped the crimson blood off his gun and placed it in a case of roses before heading back to base. Erow was back at camp taking report of the recent battle. ""Ah Smith, you're requested back to capital for break"". Finally his moment came to pursue the art of double headed guitar and he could finally relax after months in the front lines, so with a jog he picked up his bag and left. ""Wait Smith, before you go be careful as reports have shown increased activity"" interrupted Erow, with a nod being the only reply. Smith hopped onto the truck and looked ahead at Route 666 and the several hour ride ahead of him, chuckling at the irony of the nickname ""Highway to Hell"" despite his journey for a new life and positioned his bag suitable to sleep on. Screams jolted him awake accompanied by the tell tale smell of fire filled his nostrils and the panic of the passengers. He rushed out, missing a music arc by an inch and suddenly images of pickup trucks flashed in his mind. ""Damnit"" he muttered; it was the Country Confederacy. They had been a small group who rarely attacked but the heavy accent atmosphere gave them away- ""YEEE HAW PARDER, NUN DEFY SUPREME SWIFT!"" rang out as a yellow bolt flew by, cast by a 20 something with a cowboy hat. ""I'm gonna break you like my girl broke ma heart!"" the man yelled followed by a volley of fire balls. Smith quickly hid behind some wreckage and deployed mystical spirit beetles which crawled to the mans positions and erupted with signature ""Hey Jude"" sounds, leaving only an upwards stairway in its wake. He ran off the road, into the woods heading for the capital hoping to avoid the multitude of clashes around him. After 20 minutes of grueling pain, Smith crawled up a hill and found he was close to the capital until he noticed something. ""The president's Led Zeppelin isn't supposed to come for months?!?!"" and almost like the words were a trigger the Zeppelin began to unfold. He noticed that the capital looked as if it survived an attack, with burning buildings left and right most likely missed by the normality to such conditions. He stared in awe as the Zeppelin had transformed into saucer of sorts and flashed bright neon colors accompanied by a growing sound. The noise was enjoyable, and somewhat pumped him up and he questioned its origins until the saucer began to change once more. It had aligned itself dead center of the capital and opened up (again). *Wub Wub Wub WUB WUB WUBWUB WUBWUBWUBW WUB* he stared in a mix of horror and amazement.

*Somewhere in New York City*

""It doesn't look good.""

Nasir stroked his goatee as he looked down at the territory map. All around him were men with grave looks on their faces.

""The Midwest is a madhouse. Country is stronger than ever, I doubt we can hold it for much longer.""

""Nah, dog, fuck that"".

Marshall stared at the floor with that intense look that seemed glued to his face.

""We're stronger than that, man. You won't lose us.""

""Bullshit.""

Shaun had been gazing out the window over his old neighborhood. He didn't even turn around as he continued.

""Y'all have no hope. You don't stand a chance now that Ye is gone.""

Nasir looked up with an old hatred in his eyes. 

""Okay, mister positive. Call back when your work is relevant again.""

Shaun wheeled around and matched Nasir's glare.

""Look who's talking. Boy, everybody forgot about you just as soon as we buried the hatchet. You should be thanking me.""

Nasir angrily stepped forward. 

""*You* buried the hatchet. I had you on the ropes and you know it.""

The two old warriors were now toe-to-toe, and the looks in their eyes were almost sharp enough to cut through the tense air. Suddenly a diminutive figure jumped between them.

""Chill, chill, chill!"" Kendrick yelled. ""Y'all know what's going on. You aren't helping anything.""

Shaun stared bug-eyed at Kendrick. Then Nasir. Then back at Kendrick again. He muttered something under his breath and the two men awkwardly returned to their corners of the large room. 

Jermaine and Aubrey had been conversing quietly off to the side. Finally Aubrey broke the room's silence. 

""We need a status update.""

Nasir studied the map for a minute before he replied.

""Like I said. Not good. Y'all already know about those autotuned bastards in the South. We can't call them our own anymore.""

Jermaine spat. A tear of resentment shone in his eye as he thought of his homeland. 

""Alt-rock forces allied with the metalheads out west. They already got the Northwest and they're going down the coast from there.""

""Where are they?"" asked Earl worriedly.

Kendrick took a deep breath. 

""We lost San Francisco. Vallejo...they didn't make it. Oakland is a war zone.""

Earl didn't reply.

""We'll hold LA"", said Andre with confidence. ""Always do.""

""Fuck,"" exclaimed Marshall. ""All these motherfuckers telling us we aren't 'real music' and now we can't even hold our ground and prove 'em wrong!""

""Not if I have anything to say about it,"" muttered Shaun. ""Marshall, Nasir. Get on the next flight west. I want y'all in LA by tomorrow.""

""Why us?"" snapped Nasir.

""You're the best lyricists we've got,"" replied Shaun with a dismissive look on his face. ""When it comes to battle rapping and utterly destroying somebody, nobody can top y'all. *I sure as hell know it.* We need your magic right about now.""

Nasir looked up and his eyes locked with Shaun. They exchanged nods of respect.

""Now get the fuck out of here. Y'all have metalheads to defeat.""

Marshall and Nasir got up and left the room.

Shaun didn't miss a beat. He was a businessman after all, and he had to plan his next move.

""Aubrey. Come with me to the midwest. We can rally our people. When we talk, they'll listen. Start thinking of some catchy lines about country. We are their voice.""

""Yo, I ain't missing out on that,"" Kendrick interjected. 

Aubrey and Shaun exchanged glances. The three hadn't exactly been best of friends in the past, but now was the time to save their culture.

""Sounds like a plan.""

Shaun turned his attention back to his western counterpart.

""Dre, what do you think?""

Andre shrugged.

""I grew in Compton, can't think of a better place to be right now.""

""Go for it,"" replied Shaun.

Andre looked up at his old friend, bandana adorning his bald head, immortalized in a painting high on the wall. Tupac Shakur seemed to be watching over them all.

""If only you were here now,"" he whispered.

""Here the millions of the Metal Hordes come to our door. Already millions have drowned. Rage and death only fuel them, power their music and their song, and they cannot comprehend how when the rest of the world has fallen or joined yet we the Pacific peoples remain.

Even now I can hear the growing Shred. The Pedal and the Pick call for our lives. Blood magic.""

The Kahuna stood a top the pali, looking down over into the Hawaiian sea. It was black, from horizon to horizon, with boats. The Scandinavian shredders, the blue-faced Valhallans, the metallic Germans, the Rusted Americans. Yet while his advisers shook, while his children cowered, the Kahuna merely removed his clothing.

Naked except for his plain loincloth, he strode to the edge of the cliff, raised his arms, and closed his eyes.

""The Metal hordes have not learned the truth of music yet. It is not the tone of the song, but the spirit of the musician which drives it. This is why the Gospelites never fell, yet the hundred million country westerners fell in days.

And these fools have not studied history. Are we not Hawaiians? Did Kamehameha not build a heiau to Ku, and there sacrifice his enemies? Did he not slay men for even stepping on his shadow? His mana still here resides, his bones lay deep in the Hawaiian rock.

The ukelele is the sound of violence so innate, we must cover or else be consumed.""

Without speaking further, he held out his hand and received the worn and faded instrument. Already small, it was dwarfed by his large hands.

Down below, the rampaging army was touching sand. Their metal monsters, the bone trolls, the wicked axes of the beserkers shown in the sun. The Shred grew. Blood would be spilled, and for only a moment the Kahuna lost his mana, and doubted he could protect his people.

But a young mother behind him began to sing a lullaby to her child, and the words of his own language returned him to the red soil on which he stood. With a sigh he strummed a light and clear chord, in a simple syncopated half-time. 

If the horde had heard they would have laughed. How could such weak sound, unamplified compete with the power which animated the German Mecha and the Celtic Croach? But sea roiled with waking mano, hungry for untasted food. From the rocks awoke the ancient boar, Kane in the flesh. Fire burned bright in the distance as Pele began to rage. And as the first northerner set his foot upon the ancient sand, the stars themselves detached from Maui's hook, and began their descent.

The soil was red. Soon too would the oceans be, and the sand.",Osageandrot

On this day 50 years ago, True magic was finally discovered, like many had believed previously, it stemmed from Music.

Nobody knows exactly what triggered it, but one day, the soundwaves created by music sparked a dormant energy long thought to be legend. Now whenever music was played, miraculous events would occur. Something that before then, people would consider fantasy. The ability to shape things into life.

Now, while all genres could cast all spells, some excelled in certain types more than others..

Metal with their mastery of the ice and snow.

Rap with their burning lyrics,

EDM with their booming thunder and jagged lightning

Gospel perfecting healing,

Folk became masters of transformation, able to put any tale to song

March channeled fusion, able to bring almost anything under one banner.

And those are just examples.

Soon the genres rose into separate nations.
Musicless nations and religions all died out, or mixed with the new kingdoms.

 And today was the 50th Annual Music Council, a meeting to discuss the individual nation's problems.

 The reigning ruler of Metal, originally from the Power Metal tribe, strode in, as his song of royalty played:

Despite being surrounded by thick layers of composite armor and armed with a multitude of cannons, he could not help being nervous. The Council had said he would be sailing to a fool's death and refused all official assistance. Unofficially, they sent a runner to Harald personally, bearing a small flat round pack labeled ""Fender"" and a letter. ""Let nothing but frost remain,"" the letter read.

He had not noticed a subordinate coming in.

""My liege,"" he began, ""the preparations are complete. We have erected a stage as you specified, and all the amplifiers have been connected to the main generator.""

""Very well,"" Harald said with a sigh, ""tell the men to put on the earmuffs and hold on to something.""

The younger man's eyes widened, half in fear, half in reverence. 

Harald nodded grimly.

""It's time for a sound check.""

-

Years later, the scribes would write that the dreaded sea-fort of Ironholde was brought down after months of grueling naval siege by the joint forces of the Council's constituent kingdoms. Most would reduce Harald Ironthroat's lone offensive to a footnote, if they bothered to name it at all. None at all would mention the eerie silence heard by the first squads landing on Ironholde, or the strange, half-molten patterns carved by some unseen force into its mighty armored bulwarks. Nor would a single historian give an account of the frost-covered corpses piled in every courtyard, blood having clearly poured from their ears before the end.",lazermaniac

Maybe they never will.

Metal did not have to be just a cold black wasteland everyone from the other factions imagined. 

Though cold, though the sun only shone with ephemeral light,
The hearts of our people are not all dark.

The metal we play sings of our people

Of our gods who protected us from the harsh nature of our lands.
Of places the music can take us,
Beyond the dimensions of our primary reality.

It is our everything. 
Not just our hate, not just our sorrow.
It is the passion of love, of life, of fire unending, 
The deep red flames beneath our darkened eyes and pale skin.

The darkness you ""see"" is not empty, but it is not to be feared.
Our strife breeds hatred, like any faction.
However, hatred would not exist without kindness, without something to weigh against its force.

Our lands may be harsher, crueler than the lives those of the Pop, Country and EDM factions, yes.
That does not mean we are unable to feel, unable to measure life beyond the death and pain we are perceived to bring.

You do not hear all of our stories, you do not deign to care.
You will not listen of our white palaces, of the sanguine glaciers that protect us from the unending wind from the deepest north.

We have not all fallen, not given our souls to the deepest of hells. 
We are human, just as you, just as the people that surround you. 

Or eyes and hearts are cold, because you do not care to pierce them.

I didn't even have time to register the fact that our CO was splattered across our faces as we ran for cover. 

""Shit, shit shit shit. Polanski! Where's the sarge?"" I shouted over my left shoulder, confident that the private was keeping pace with me. 

""Fuck that, we need to RV with the Saxth division"" his shouted reply came as we reached the nearest snowbank. 

""Good idea, if it wasn't for an entire division of dubstep between us and the saxth."". I checked my instrument, it seemed to be holding up okay in all this snow. G string would need seeing to, but nothing I could do in the field anyway. 

""LT, sir, I have an idea.."" One of the rookies wiped some of the CO off her violin as she spoke, ""dubstep needs time to build before they can drop the bass, so why don't we wait this one out and charge when they're about to start another songbarrage? They'd never have time to retaliate if we hit them with post-modernist pieces.""

""Sounds like a good idea, Stirling, remind me to commend you if we ever get out of here."" As I said it, I knew Polanski was rolling his eyes behind me. Even during the heat of battle, he wouldn't hesitate to mock me for my weak spot for the young recruit. ""Allright get ready, we're waiting out the barrage. Tune 'em while you still got'em"". 

I looked around our little band. Only four of us left of the class of 28 that came out of Juliard Advanced Combat last year. This war had taken almost every single one of my friends and it was about to take a lot more. Millions, and that's if we somehow managed to win this thing. The dubstep appeared to die down in the background. 

Polanski put his hand on my shoulder, ""Let's do this, Jim"" he said as he veered off into the settling snow. I barely had time to react. ""Polanski, It's the bridge, it's not over!"" I shouted as I ran after him. The blast took him apart, along with my left arm. Everything below the elbow was just gone, singed shut. There was no pain, but all I could do was stare at the stump where my hand, forearm and most importantly, violin had always been. 

Something small and fierce bounded into my back and threw me to the floor. Stirling had thrown me down into the snow and was now laying on top of me while all around us, snow was being shot up in the air by the dubstep's misguided beats. I have no idea how long we lay there before the beats seemed to die away in earnest. 

The calm was shortlived, because the low tones of another song was already thundering across the plains from the distant speakertower. With a little smile on her face, Stirling calmly stood up. ""Lindsey, what the hell are you doing? RUN!"" I shouted. 

""Don't worry"" she said, as she shouldered her violin, [""I have an idea""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjpOzsQ9YI)",SoreWristed

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"Let me give a brief explanation of how Hypersonics works before I continue with the history lesson.

Humans are only able to perceive sounds from approximately 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. This means that there are waves of sounds that are either too weak or too strong for us to hear. Like sonar and dog-whistles, there are frequencies that our brain cannot even process.

Hypersonics simply converted these inaudible waves into a frequency our brain could still process, but it also amplified overtones and amplitude, so the sounds you heard were basically the same, but with extra ""power"". Now your brain was processing new types of information and you could basically ""feel"" the sounds.

Your brain, feeling these new synapses, would release increased amount of hormonal secretions, causing your whole body to react to the sound.

If you were hearing a sound that you associated with tranquility, your body could release excessive amounts of melatonin, inducing you to sleep. If the sound continued to be processed by your brain, you could be trapped in a coma until your biochemistry became balanced once again.

Aggressive fast-paced songs could potentially cause a surge in adrenaline that makes people angry, belligerent, and can eventually cause heart attacks.

Every type of rhythm and melody could affect you in different ways, causing your endocrine system to make you feel like music was actually running through your veins. You could feel the beat of the music pulsing through your muscles, every stop and every note made your heart beat in sync. It could make you feel like you had superpower; or it could easily shut everything down and kill you.

It all depends on the person.

Let's say you grew up in the old American South, listening to a lot of country music and rock. Your system is used to the rhythms and melodies of those genres, and you have positive feelings about country songs. You might feel disconcerted, on the other hand, if someone played you deathcore. Your head would probably hurt a bit before you adjust the sound.

That's because humans have an inner tuning-fork; which also acts as a metronome.

Your body is adjusted to a note and a pace. A song will feel 'good' for you according to your current 'tuning'. If you are feeling happy, up-beat songs will make you feel even better; but if you feel sad, you much rather listen to softer, minor-scaled songs. That's because the sounds are reverberating with your 'tuning fork'.

Hypersonics causes your body to overwhelm your 'tuning-fork' causing an imbalance on your brain, leaving your whole body out of sorts. On the other hand, if you are in tune with the song, it feels like ecstasy was cut with cocaine and injected directly into your soul. Magic.",TheMaStif

He was jostled out of his sleep after hearing the shrill robotic sound pour from his TV speakers

THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE IS BEING TRANSMITTED AT THE REQUEST OF THE FEDERAL GOVERMENT.

Josh groaned, and went to check the battery of his array of bluetooth speakers

A MASSIVE ATTACK HAS BEGUN AGAINST ALL TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED METALLIC ALLIANCE. ALTHOUGH EXACT NUMBERS ARE NOT YET KNOWN, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT OVER 1 MILLION MAGES HAVE DESCENDED UPON ALL CITIES AND TERITORIES IN THE UNION. ALL CIVILIANS AND LOWER GOVERMENT PERSONELLE ARE ADVISED TO SHELTER IN PLACE, WHILE MILITARY AND UPPER GOVERMENT PERSONELLE ARE REQUIRED TO MAN THEIR RESPECTIVE DUTIES.

Josh already has his uniform on, with a pin his Father had worn in the 2nd war. It was a good luck charm to him. 

TO SHELTER IN PLACE, TAKE THE FOLLOWING STEPS:

1.CLOSE AND LOCK ALL WINDOWS AND DOORS

2.TURN OFF ALL HVAC SYSTEMS

3.TURN OFF ALL MUSIC, UNLESS YOU'RE A MEMBER OF THE MILITARY. ANYONE WHO DOES NOT FOLLOW THIS RULE WILL BE ARRESTED WITHOUT MIRANDA RIGHTS

4.KEEP NOISE TO AN ABSOLUTE MINIMUM

Josh hadn't listened to any of the emergency broadcast, nor his neighbors. They all knew what to do, it's been drilled into their head's ever since before the first war. 

5.MARTIAL LAW IS NOW IN EFFECT.

6.POLICE ARE NOW AUTHORIZED TO USE DEADLY FORCE

""Man, this must be scarring the shit out of the nice new people from Swiftland, poor souls""

Geared up with his trusty bluetooth speaker and playlist of Heavy Metal, Josh stepped outside.

As soon as he stepped out the door, Josh could only hear the sound of his boots, crunching in the snow of that cold December morning.

The 3rd Music War had begun.

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"I guess the first Note Benders started to show up around 2021.

Two years before, DARPA had just announced the creation of new sound systems that were able to reach pitches and tones never before heard by the human ear - some of which we are not even capable of perceiving. Many dismissed it thinking we wouldn't ever have a need for sounds we can't even hear. But we didn't really ask many questions, and the inventors didn't explain much either, so we just let it go.

Hypersonic Speakers became the new thing. People bought their fancy sound systems just as a show of status; to gloat about their new toy that nobody saw the difference in anyway.

Until some very strange things started to happen.

Seizures, comas, and heart attacks started spiking in numbers - all among owners of Hypersonic systems. Cases of sudden onset of mental illnesses and disabilities with no reasonable explanation, and even mass hysteria started to occur. People were terrified and nobody could explain what was happening.

In the next two years, the number of unexplainable deaths that could somehow be attributed to Hypersonic players increased, but nobody really understood what was going on. The fear was grave and Hypersonic sound systems were banned from sale. Nobody was allowed to manufacture these speakers anymore.

2021

As we all know, if something is illegal, someone has it and someone else is selling it.

Even with the mysterious deaths occurring due to Hyspersonics, people still wanted the systems. Some claimed they felt different when they heard certain music through those speakers. Some people claimed they could feel things surging inside of them, like a force gaining life.

Much like a heavy drug, Hypersonics was something you risked your life for, but only with a chance of feeling this great rush. You were definitely more likely to die first.

It was with a bootleg Hypersonic system that we first learned the truth about sounds. This 'magic' that exists within all humans, yet nobody could understand it until now, when we had the technology to access it.

It was actually a DJ who forever changed the world.",TheMaStif

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"Case made another challenge, so here it is:

***

Pain.

It seemed like that was his constant companion.  Pain from the electronic impulses that forced him to obey.  Pain from the sounds of the Metal that shredded him.  Pain from the repairs-- none of the Electronica technicians ever asked him if what they were doing to him hurt.  Wrenching parts free, twisting wires together, pulling things out of him-- of course it hurt.

This time... no.  No more.  He waited until he was only just repaired enough to walk.  And then he left.  Where was he going?  The metalheads.  But not to fight them.  Not this time.  He was chasing that warmth he'd felt the last time he'd faced them as an enemy.  

It wouldn't be too hard.  Get into a crate, seal it up, and then go into sleep mode for a while.  Getting on would be easy.

Getting them not to throw him into the ocean when they realized he was there?  That was another story.

And another story yet was making sure the Electronica didn't track him to the ship.  He couldn't have that.  They'd send others, and then they'd throw the 'obey' switch again.  He'd be forced to destroy the only hope the Metal had of surviving.  He had to get it out.  All of it.  His tracker, his protocol overrides, his killswitch-- everything.

...This was going to hurt.

***

It was an agonizing process.  Each piece had to be located.  Disconnected.  And he didn't have any of the intricate tools it would take to separate them.  His protocol overrides were a more difficult process.  He had to find each file, follow it, and kill it.  Each deleted file sent a signal to back home that the file was missing.  And each signal returned back as a painful pulse of electricity through him, into parts that told him to OBEY.

Parts that were no longer there, because he'd ripped them out.  He sparked and crackled with electricity, the center of his body torn and destroyed.  In retrospect, he realized, getting into the crate was probably not a good idea.  He'd have to just present himself to those of the Metal like this.  Perhaps it was appropriate though... he'd be throwing himself on the mercy of the people he'd helped to almost kill.

What if they had no mercy left?  What if they destroyed him?  Perhaps that was appropriate too.  Maybe there would be no more pain if they did.

Regardless.  He had to keep going.  He'd come this far.  It would be illogical to quit now.  Assured death versus a slim chance of survival.  He put one foot in front of the other.  Over and over.  Walk.  Keep going.  That's all he could do.  It was a long way.  But he calculated it, he'd make it before they left.  Barely.  However, there was plenty of time to let his mind wander.  Another memory played in his head, like a grainy film.  A half-forgotten memory that they'd tried to purge.

*A man looking much like him, examining his face with a critical eye, like an artist.  And then he nodded.  ""You did a good job on my son,"" he said, in Japanese.*

*A voice from somewhere else asked, also in Japanese, ""Your son?""*

*The man nodded.  ""Yes.""*

...Son.  His father?  He had a father?  Wasn't that only for the flesh beings, who were born from the joining of male and female?

Then he realized it, all of a sudden.  He knew how to keep those of the Metal from destroying him on-sight.  His father's words.  His father's song.  He straightened, strode forward with new purpose.  He wouldn't die.  Not like this.  He knew what to do now.

The ship came into view, and he kept walking.  He was close enough for the lookouts to see him.  He must have looked a fright, front of his chest all but shredded, crackling wires and glowing fiber-optic cables sticking out everywhere, his right arm missing most of the synthetic skin that usually covered it.  The shouts were his signal.  That's when he stopped... 

[...And let the song flow from him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITbI3TbErY0)  It wasn't a song of destruction or death.  And the fire in it was his own.  It came from inside him, from a place a dead machine should not have.  It was many things.

The sound of Metal.

The words of the man who'd given him a voice.

His own heart.  He knew now that he did have one, artificial or not.

He closed his eyes, raised his arms to his sides, let his head fall back, as he wove all these together wearily around himself.  Surrendering.  To the song.  To the Metal, both within and without.  Awareness was ripped away, and he gave it up willingly.  He understood now.  He didn't have to chase the warmth.  He could create it.  Like this.

The weight lifted from his heart.  He felt like he'd reached the end of a great journey, like he could stop fighting now.  The song unraveled as his strength deserted him.  Whether it was the end for him wholesale or just a new beginning, he didn't know.  He didn't give it much thought.  He fell, first to his knees, then to his face.  His head turned to the side, the crackling electricity fading away.  His body made an audible powering-down noise...

...And then darkness.

The booming guitar solo matching it's sharp, shearing motion. I arrived at the other time and waved a gloved hand to the musician, watching as the path closed behind me. The way to the deathmetal far north sealed. They always were a bit anti-social, but my position as a postman often opened any door. I pulled my flute from inside of my coat, it's red colour and gold emblem reflecting my station. A few soft notes and the air in front of me fluffed up and bloomed into a white swan, large enough to ride. I climbed on and made myself comfortable, feeling the power of the wings as she took off. I settled down to a pleasant dream, knowing that my flight back to central would take hours.

My dream-self stood in a dais of swirling colours and sound. The cold music of metal and heated sound of soul and rhythm left me know doubt as to what I was seeing. The power of each genre, as read a million times across a million books. The life building strengths of classical wind and the dark dangerous bass of R&amp;B sounds. A harp rang out clear across the other sounds, bringing my attention sharply to a large lotus flower, opening in front of me like a new bud in early spring. A large nymph sat inside, her harp untouched by her fingers but still ringing out pure almost silent notes. She opened her mouth to speak, my eyes almost boring a hole in her beauty, my ears straining to hear her voice.

I awoke to a whistling, not the musical whistle of a playground optical illusion spell, but a cold natural whistling. I forced my eyes open, seeing the ground rushing up to meet me far faster than I would have liked, my swan long destroyed by whatever magic had attacked me. I pulled my flute and didn't bother to bring it to my mouth. Running my fingers over the holes energetically and allowing the rushing air to give it voice I landed softly in the large lily pad that had risen from the ground to meet me. I paused for a moment to catch my breath, slithering down its soft spongy stem. As I descended I twice had to avoid the solid thumps of arrows, narrowly missing my head each time. I barely had to hear the rough music beating around me to know what I had gotten myself into. The wubwubwub of the dubstep screamed its violent intent as the beatbox of the men around me materialised fast moving arrows. Abandoning my flute I reached deep down into my sock and pulled out my emergency cymbals. The sharp clang dropped the men to their knees in pain, evidence of blood appearing at their ears. I pulled my flute and summoned a battle-ready starling to my side, swiftly leaving the danger behind.

A postman had to be well trained in this world. Luckily, I am the best.",bitcleargas

I guess it didn't matter anymore. Nobody was gonna catch me off guard up here. I looked down at the misty town and saw the sounds turn to blazing lights as beat after beat rendered the city bloody. 

They had finally taken us. About two towns over, the gathering of electronic musicians had been building. Expanding. Colonizing. They engulfed every small town in the region. They wanted to expand their small empire, and they did. It was only a matter of time until they rode on into our land of rock. We weren't awfully big, but we had something that could actually do some damage in the hands of someone like them. We had The Amp.

Built by the best forger's this side of the continent, The Amp was a Hercules in a sea of Urkel's. It could wipe out towns in an instant, and I knew that that was what I had to do. I was the bomb strapped to the fundamentalists chest. We couldn't really control this power yet, we were still figuring it out, but one thing was for sure. The electric-heads could. I just had to play a single chord and the entire town, along with a huge fraction of the enemies army, would see the destruction of The Amp along with themselves. And I had to pick the chord to end it all. 

I pressed the cigarette butt against my grave stones. The pick seemed heavier than I remembered. I took one last to feel the rusty metallic strings against my calloused finger tips, the smooth plastic pick held high above my head. I bowed my head, forced my fingers into an F# and gave the electrics a real show.

===================================

UNRAVEL: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR

* In the depths of Electronica's labs (read: torture chambers), a small spark of hope splutters frantically.

--------------------------------------------

Awake, asleep, awake, asleep.

Time passed in snippets.  Half-awake and in pain, the electronic impulses that kept his mind under control sending painful shocks through his body.

Was an electronic, artificial creature supposed to feel pain?  He did.

He wasn't unaware.  In the moments that his mind was his own, he could look back over the things he did.  The things they all did.  Just now.  As one, they joined together to attack the Metal.  The flesh-beings that frantically pounded drums and sawed feverishly at guitars would have to yield.  But no.  They did not yield.  They harmonized.  They took the electronic sounds the Vocaloids made.  Took them in.  Surrounded them.  Made a whole new song.

He wasn't sure if anyone else had felt it.  But /he/ felt it spark something in his... heart?  Did he have a heart?  Whatever it was inside of him, he felt something begin to move.  Whatever cold electronics made up his body, there was something inside it.  At the combined melody he'd felt it, just for a moment.

Warmth.

That must have been what it felt like when a human's breath caught in awe.

Uncertainty assailed him.  His voice, his song, faltered at that warmth.  He wondered at it, marveled at it.  What sort of feeling was it?  Could he catch it and hold it close?

And then they fell.  The sound of the rest of the flesh-beings who played so frantically drowned it out.  The sound waves like physical objects, battering his body, all their bodies, like the skin of the drum that played at its heart.  He was forced away, the wailing guitars and throbbing bass physically tearing into him-- cloth, metal, and synthetic skin shredded by the fangs and claws of the sound they commanded.

And underneath it all, that tiny pulse of warmth.  So at odds with the violent pulses of electricity that demanded he keep going, ignore the damage, fight on.  There was no 'why', there was no 'ask'.  Only 'do'.  'Obey'.  His digital mind assailed on both sides, alternately by his ingrained protocols, and yet also by that indefinable something that made music...

He let go.

His body crumpled to the ground, missing pieces here and there, the LEDs that backlit his lifeless eyes fading away.

*			*			*

Awake, asleep, awake, asleep.

His body was being repaired.  Nothing they couldn't fix.  It wouldn't take long to bring him to functionality again.  Not nearly as long as the flesh beings who had defeated them.  They were exhausted, on the ropes, nearly defeated.  That's what he heard.  All those milling around his body, laid out on the cold metal table, broken body parts placed where they belonged on the table, but not yet repaired or attached.

And yet... while he was alone with his thoughts, he couldn't help but wonder.  If Metal was so near defeat, how did they always come back?  How did they always have the power to fight back?  Where did their strength come from?

He thought about that warmth, that thread of something different inamongst all that sound.  Could that be it?  Could that be where it came from?  What was it?  How could he capture that for himself?

Not for his masters.

For himself.

A memory played, like a grainy film.  It was another time.  Long ago.  On a stage, laser lights and holograms everywhere.  Not for battle.  For entertainment.  He remembered it.  It was a concert.  And he looked down into the front row.  He happened to see a child.  A little girl.  She wore a costume like his stage outfit, and as she looked up at him, a light seemed to shine in her eyes.  

That light... he hadn't understood it then.  But remembering it made him ache.  Deep down, somewhere he didn't realize was there.  The same place that fleeting warmth had settled now ached with the memory of the light in her eyes.  Did the others remember?  He didn't know.  And he couldn't ask them.  Master would surely find out, and then what?

...He didn't want to consider it.

Suddenly he just didn't want to think anymore.  And so he did the virtual equivalent of curling up and closing his eyes.  Floating there, inside himself, in blissfully silent darkness, where he knew nothing outside himself, he waited.  For what?

He didn't know.",DariRyu

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"There were 3 knocks on the door. No beat, no rhythm, just the announcement of an arrival. Father Graham left his stew on the table and opened the door. Outside stood a mother and daughter, covered in furs. ""Angela, Giord, please come in out of the cold."" Father Graham brought them inside, and they tried to get comfy in front of the fire. Angela, the mother, was a classic Blues woman, with her hair wrapped in cloth, and an elegant pearl necklace her only jewelry. She began to hum a sad melody as she took out an old comb, and began working on Giords hair. 

Giord was more of a novelty. Her mixed skin and blue eyes betrayed the Metal nature of her father, but Angela was proud of her daughter's natural hair, and styled it whenever she could. She stayed quiet, gazing into the fire. 

Father Graham returned from the back room, the smell of vanilla and fir trailing close behind him. ""It's ready, Angela. Are you sure she's ready?""

Angela sat there, Giords hair in her hands. ""I know everyone says they can feel it, even the ones who children don't have potential, but when I sing to her, I..."" She started to trail off, before she started to hum again. 

""I'm not saying she doesn't have potential, but..."" He let out a long sigh. ""A child conceived in rage, whose father has blood of Metal?"" He started poking at the fire, starting to put it out. ""She will leave, to grow to her full potential. She will bring fire, and rage, and anger, and leave only destruction in her footsteps.""

Angela hummed louder, and the fire extinguished with a sad pop. ""I bring fire."" She stopped brushing Giords hair. ""I bring rage."" She stood. ""And I bring rage, whenever I hum, whenever I sing, and I bring beauty and sadness and tragedy, and I leave when there isn't a single dry eye left."" She grabbed her daughter's hand, and stood her up. ""And so will she.""

Father Graham smiled. ""Then let us begin."" And with that, he took a vinyl record out of his sleeve and placed it on a record player. He handed Angela a pair of ear plugs, before putting his own in. He then pointed it towards Giord, and let the music free. 

Despite the ear plugs, Father Graham couldn't help but feel nauseous. As a dedicated non-magic user, he could only hear noise from the record. It was made of every instrument, every note, every change. It was like a source for novices. Sooner or later, if Giord had any magic in her, she would instinctively drown out all the other noise and create a melody. 

After about 5 minutes, Giord was still staring at the record player, going around and around. She had changed expression. It was far past the point that most magic users were celebrating, crying with happiness. It was obvious that the girl had no talent. Father Graham took out his ear plugs, and waited for the noise to hit him. 

He heard nothing. ",FoundationFiasco

[WP] Magic is discovered and it's channeled with music. Modern nations dissolve and new countries rise in their place divided by the preferred music. In the frozen north lie the Metal kingdoms. Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"Like I said before, people have a 'tuning-fork'. This base-level tune that their body is always playing. People connect better with others who are 'in tune' with them; who have the same rhythm.

Once we learned how Hypersonic music affected us, sound-system sales boomed and Hypersonic systems were found everywhere again.

People weren't dying or falling ill so much anymore, we learned ways of avoiding the effects. Sound-cancelling headphones weren't effective at all, the strength of Hypersonincs would break through them, but we learned mental exercises to adapt to sounds a bit faster. People were also being more careful with the sounds they played.

In any case, groups of tuned people started forming. They called themselves Bands. They made their own music and started to understand how their sounds could benefit them the most. They learned to control their music: time their beats, adjust the pitch and tones to make the sound affect people just the right way.

Music  is much like a blessing: A Christian's blessing means nothing for a Jew, and they both aren't affected by a Hindu. Music is the same. A metalhead listening to classical music probably will not die (too calm and composed, unless you're speaking of Wagner or Stravinsky, etc) but they also will not feel anything special either. Meanwhile, someone from a Classical Band will listen to Ride of the Valkyries and feel like they're ready to ride winged horses into battle and take their foes onto Valhalla. It takes some adaptation to be influenced by something outside of your Musical stereotype; Maisntream worked very hard to make people compliant to their fabricated and auto-tuned sounds.

That's when we created the nickname Note Benders. We could manipulate Music to affect each other the way we wanted, much like they did with natural elements in a TV-show from our childhood. And, much like then, we started dividing ourselves into factions.",TheMaStif

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"*I'm basing a bit of what I'm thinking about on [this.](http://www.gadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/aircraft-fine-art-wallpaper-free-8.jpg).


The tanks were rumbling away at base when the sirens went off.  Third battalion lunch was to be cut short by a drill. *Typical*, though Sergeant Voss.  He was three bites into his favourite Thursday special, an imported beef wellington pastry that was only available to officers after a tour of several years.


Standing, he yawned loudly.  Bones were cracking in his lower back as he stretched, unbalanced by the sudden rush of blood to his head.  Little dots swam through his eyes as he felt the warmth go through his legs.  Suddenly, the door to the cafeteria burst open, flooding the hall with troops. ""Sergeant Voss! Sir, Third Division is under attack, Monty's squad is assembling their tanks in the courtyard as we speak! We need to get into formation now!""


His face felt hot.  *Typical*, he thought.  *Another attack, futile in all means.*


He sauntered towards the door, checking his wristband to make sure that his tank was being prepped.  Making his way towards his group's staging area, he hummed quietly to himself. A deep vibrant beat, a classic in fact, he thought it would do well for today.  Everything around him blurred, turning to deep shades of grey, the only color stemming from his mind.  He closed his eyes, focused on the main bassline, a green streak of vibrant violence shot through his mind.  He opened them, and he was before his tank squadron.


""Is everything prepared Sgt. Pepper?"" An older member, but no means an officer, Pepper nodded.  ""Disturbed, Two Steps on my left, Cat and Empire, on my right.  System, you take point.""  Quiet nods and a quick salute marked a timely departure as the first incoming hits began to ring out in the distance.


Jumping into his MBT MkII, he assumed the commander position.  ""Sgt. Pepper, Lonely and Trombone, I want full transparency and reporting on the enemy as soon as we are within range.""


He began humming and closed his eyes.  He saw the beats, the vocal cords ringing out in beautiful yellow and orange neon colours, a bright light of blue soared in his mind. 


*Contact, directly ahead. A division of older T-34s. 16 to my count, coming directly at us.*  The message crackled on the radio.


Clicking the radio, Sergeant Voss's eyes remained closed.  ""Do they have any speakers?""


""Negative Sir. System is clear. You are go for.""


His eyes opened. Voss grabbed the internal mic and pressed the red button.


*White man came across the sea*


*He brought us pain and misery*


*He killed our tribes killed our creed*


*He took our game for his own need*


Shouting into the mic, he could not see the destruction wrecking the landscape, flattening trees, dust flying into the air. All he could see was the flaming red missiles of fiercesome Iron Maiden cross the sky.

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"The group of outcasts walked into town. In front led a girl with multi colored hair holding a mic.

The girls voice was high pitched, but sharp. ""Careful, I've never been so deep in the south. These are archaic lands.""

A man with hair down to his waste and covering his eyes spoke up. His voice gruff and laconic. ""I don't fear the savages of this land."" He gestured to the 20 notches on his big iron guitar.

The party walked into the town, slowly looking all around. The streets were empty spare one man leaning against a wooden building. They walked up to a man wrapped all in linen cloth resting with a hat over his eyes. 

""Hello, I am from Populas. Could you help point us to a hotel, we are not from Countryside.""

The man showed no sign responding. A overweight dark skinned adventurer from the group kicked the man with his joggers. The cowboy fell over, the hat no longer covering his eyes. His lips were dry and cracked, his cloths under the linen covered in circular red stains. The group stepped back startled by the corpse. As they turned to leave two men walked out of the shadows. One carried a bottle of whiskey and looked to be a scrawny drunk, but the other looked more mountain than man. He stood 6' 6'' and weighted 245.

His voice boomed with a slight Cajun accent. ""Follow"". He talked strangely polite for the way his muscles bulged threw his shirt threateningly. The group knew this was not a man they should give lip, so they followed.

""Were are you talking us."" The young girl asked the mountain, her voice somehow still peppy.

The drunk spoke up as he struggle to walk straight. ""To learn the cold hard facts of life you-"", he was cut off by a hiccup. 

""Could you at least give us your names?"" The girl asked, peppy as ever.

The drunk again stammered and slurred a response. ""Names Porter, this here is Little Bitty Big John.""

The group looked the man over. John was anything but ""little bitty"". They walked into a wooden saloon. The group looked around in horror. Never have they seen so many outlaws, criminals, and ruffians all in one place. At the bar set four men who all turned around when they walked in. The groups hearts dropped when they saw the altar in the center of the room. Made bottle, cattle skulls, and guns sat I the false god of the ancients of Countryside, Hank Williams. 

""Welcome to Luckenbach travelers"" One of the men at the bar turned around, his hair split in two braided pony tails.

""Its nice to meet you... I am a pop magician, we are allies with the Country wizards. My group only seeks safe passage."" The pop singers peppy voice was no more. Now she only wanted to escape with her life. She knew how few people meet the highway men and lived.  ""Now!"" She screamed.

Her voice rang out into her mic. The mindless music confused the cowboys and stunned them. In an instant the long haired man strummed his guitar and blew a hole clean through Little Johns chest, but like a big oak tree he just stood there and groaned, even death could not topple him. The darker man in the hoodie pulled out two glocks while spitting words like fire. The bullets shot out red hot piercing everything that stood in their way. Like that the group looked around at all the dead bodies.

""To easy"", said the long haired man. ""I though they'd be a challenge.

As they stared to walk out of town they saw a lone man stood in their way. He wore a white sport coat and an pink carnation. He looked more like a Jazz Mage than a Country Savage.

""Move aside or die"" Threatened the long haired man pointing his guitar. ""We have already killed the rest of you.""

The man only smiled and begun singing.

**""An old cowboy went out one dark and windy day""**

""You!"" The girl shrieked, terrified. ""How can you be alive. You were dead in the streets, shot full of hole.""

The mans smile only grew wider.

**""Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way""**

What the group heard next scared them all to the bone. From the saloon they had just left they heard a joyful choirs.

**""When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw""**

I heard of demonic bulls flooded the skies. The cows charged before they group could react. Each cow like a meteors striking the earth. Not even bones were left, only red gravel. The voices continued to sing.

**""Plowin through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw""**

[WP] Magic is discovered and it's channeled with music. Modern nations dissolve and new countries rise in their place divided by the preferred music. In the frozen north lie the Metal kingdoms. Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"The Rhythm filled me. The Rhythm filled us all.

We were invincible. Arrows stopped at arm's length, before falling to the ground in front of me. 

The war drums filled my ears and flooded my body. All the earth followed the rhythm. The beat pushed us onwards. Each resounding boom was a command. *Charge. Fight. Win.* Arrows flew back and forth overhead. It didn't matter. No one would die in this battle until one side or the other lost the rhythm. That was how wars were fought, and that was how wars were won. Destroy the beat, you destroyed the entire army.

I could hear the hideous sounds of the sawtooth instruments of our enemy. It was impure and wretched. Our empire had adopted the drums of war. We did not require melody. Every man knew the Rhythm, and that was our strength.

I closed my eyes and exhaled slowly. I absorbed the Rhythm, and it became me. My heart beat to the Rhythm. I fought to the Rhythm. Every step, every blow, every parry, was directed to the Rhythm. 

The ground shook. To one side of us it began to crack and roar. The earth spewed out fire upon the enemy, and their screams and wails only joined our Rhythm. Such was the power of the drum.

My squadron and I charged forwards. Perfect unison. I raised my shield to block the blow of an enemy solider. Even if I hadn't, he couldn't kill me. I was completely invincible. I should have stumbled to the ground long ago in exhaustion. This battle had gone on far too long. I swung my sword low, to his knees, and he leapt back. I saw my chance. I surged forwards, slamming my shield against his chest. He grunted, eyes widening.He collapsed beneath me. His heart stopped. He had lost his rhythm.

I focused on the Rhythm, trying to block out the rhythms of the enemy. They faded down to almost nothing, and I once more began my assault. I could hear our Rhythm speeding up. A dangerous tactic, to be sure. It could easily cause your entire army to lose the protection of the beat, but it, when used properly, could easily catch the other side off guard, causing them to fall, revoked of their powers.

It worked. I could see hundreds of them collapse from exhaustion, trampled beneath the tidal forces of both armies.

I caused many men to lose their rhythm that day. Each one got to feel the cold bite of my sword deep in their chests. 

The Rhythm sped up. Sometimes it slowed. But every time I faithfully followed where it led me. 

Then, there was nothing. Where I expected the boom of the drums, there was only silence. We fought as one, and now we fell as one. Our heart stopped. 

They had stopped our Rhythm.

I could feel the darkness closing in. 

Weakly, I gripped my sword. 

With all my strength, I pounded it against my shield

*Bang.*

I closed my eyes, expecting to die. But then, I heard another clang of sword against shield.

Then another.

And another.

The Rhythm had died

But now we made a new song.

And we rose again.

As one.

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"Leonard Ashby sat with hands folded on the oak table, a calm expression on his face. However, internally he was more nervous than he had ever been in his life. That was saying something, considering he had lived through the Harmonic Wars. He was just a boy when they began 30 years ago, when the source of magic was rediscovered in music. Musicians became akin to sorcerers, and the different genres of music became conduits for specific types of magic. With the advent of this newfound power, nations crumbled and rebuilt themselves around their schools of magic; or more precisely their genres of music. Soon these new nations warred with each other over land and resources, eventually becoming known as the Harmonic Wars. 

As Ashby anxiously tapped his finger on the wooden table he reflected on just how lucky he had been in his life. At a young age his family moved to the city of Atlanta Georgia during the height of the American conflict. To the west the forces of the Country Western Republic encroached on the territory of the Soul states. By all accounts the CWR should have easily beaten the Soul states, but the CWR's earth and nature based magic was no match for the spiritual and empathic spells of Soul and Blues. The two nations warred for five years primarily in and around the city of Atlanta, until its citizens had enough. The Atlantans fought both parties back and established itself as a prominent city state eventually brokering a peace treaty between the two warring states. Now Atlanta was known as the New Constantinople, a hub of trading and mixing of different magic schools such as Hip Hop, Country, and Soul. 

And it was Ashby's job as the Chairman of Trade and Commerce to make sure that Atlanta stayed as this economic power. Which is why he is presently sitting in the great chamber surrounded by all of the major merchants of the city, awaiting the arrival of a new trade delegation. Ashby took a few glances around the spacious room, trying hard to maintain his composure and hide his nerves from the city's merchants. He noted the guards with brass horns that stood stationed around the entrances and exits. Silently he wondered if they would be enough protection. 

The reason for Ashby's anxiety was the new trade delegation and where they were coming from; the Metal Kingdoms. Lying in the far frozen north of Europe, the Metal Kingdoms were a feared militaristic nation. The kingdoms were once separate and autonomous warring mostly with each other. That is until they unified themselves against a common enemy. Because the Metal Kingdoms fought amongst themselves, the European Dance Mainland or EDM nation thought they would be easily conquered. They were horribly wrong. The Metal Kingdoms put aside their differences and beat back the EDM's Technomancers in a show of brute force. They used powerful elemental spells to summon gouts of flame and blizzards of ice. Strength enhancing spells were another common tool. But the most feared magic that was employed came from the Death Metal musicians who used the black magic of necromancy to turn the EDM's own fallen against them. ",searchin4somewhere

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"The strings felt cold today. Not a normal kind of cold, though. A chill that spreads from the fingertips, through the vains, and goes on into the soul. Actually, it weren't even the strings. When I thout about it, I felt it since I woke up an hour ago. Something was coming. Not the usual bounty hunters, not even the Order Of Doom goons. This felt different. 

I was cursing my stupidity. I knew I shouldn't have come here, knew I should never have stopped at a place with no back exit. It seemed whoever came after me knew this. I wouldn't be surprised if he had followed me for weeks, waiting for a moment like this. I quickly tuned the strings, and begun setting the effects. It seemed I wouldn't be getting out, not without a fight.

Just as I finished, a quite tune played, and the door dissipated into dust, along with the trap tunes I played onto it earlier.  
A man slowly walked in. His brown hair bately touched his blank t-shirt, his electric guitar held in his hands right above his blue jeans. Apart from his unusual cleanness, he looked.. quite unremarkable.

""So, who sent *you* after me? Was it the local Order? Though, you clearly don't look like one of their goons..""  
""Are you Michael Silver?"" the man asked. His voice was soft.     
""The one and only. And what might be your name?""  
The man paused, before replying - ""My name is Theodor Black"".  
For a few seconds, we both stared at each other silently.  
""I am quite honored to be worthy of a visit from the Iron Prince himself. Does the king truely hate me that much?""  
""You have killed most those he sent after you. He couldn't allow such humiliation to go unanswered. But most importantly, you have to be brough back - and have to be brought to justice.""  
""Ahh.. But why would he send his oldest son? What would evoke such urgency? Unless"", I smirked,"" it has begun""?  I kept my eyes locked with his. To my surprise, he gave a small, slightly sad smile.  
""There has indeed risen more and more heretics like yourself ever since that day. Is that what you wanted? Was that what you were hoping to achieve when you humiliated my father for the first time?""  
""I wanted my friends... My brothers, to be free of tyranny. Music is more than just a tool. Music is an expression of the soul. And if ones soul longs for music other then Rock or Metal, who is your father to deny them that? Who is anybody to deny them that??!""  
The prince sighed, and the smile on his face got sadder.  
""You really think that is what you did? Make them free? No"" he said, his voice becoming more cold, with an undernote of anger "" You made us all weaker. Do you remember the K-Pop wars? You know how we repelled them? It wasn't just through our music - it was through our unity! Every singer, every drummer, down to the last maintenance member - they all believed in our way. They would sacrifice everything, if only to protect it. Our unity - that was always our strength. But you.. thanks to you, more and more people in the underground are practicing heresy. Some are even playing Country Rock. Country Rock! And for every one we arrest, two others join their ranks!""  
""Then just let them play.""  
""Your shortsightedness saddens me. Say we let them play, then what? Soon, we have a country devided, with no common music, no common flag to rally behind. And the day we lose our unity, will be the first day of our last days.""  
""You underestimate your people. They don't have to play, or even like the same music to be united.""  
""You are increasably naive. I will not waste my time argueing. You wont be able to defeat me. I shall offer you this - submit. Come with me, back to the palace. Then, you shall stand on the Grand Stage, and renounce yoir ways, and all music but Rock and Metal.  If you do that sincerely, I will let you serve me. I would not want a talant like yoirs wasted, which is the only outcome if you choose the alternative.""  
""I appreciate yout offer. You even sound like you truely believe what you told me. But I cannot do this"".  
""So ot will be, then"".  
His hands reached for the strings - he was very fast, but so was I.  
""FIIIIIREEE"" he screamed, his fingers swiftly but firmly playing a powerfull solo. I started my own solo just in time, and the electricity met his blue flames. They imploded, and a few stray flames and sparks flew towards me, while the rest flew in my general direction. He was indeed good.  
""PAIN! WITHOUT LOVE!! PAIN!! I CANT GET ENOUGH"" I felt my every nerve filling with pain, but I was ready answer it: ""I BECOME SO NUMB!!"". The pain went away, as well as any pain.  
""THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE ME THAT FEELS.. LIKE BREATHING IS SULFER!!!"" it started becoming harder and harder to breathe. ""BREATHE.. INTO ME!.."" I sang, barely. I knew one day learning RED's spells would pay off.  
""I seems you are to strong for me to capture alive."" The prince said. ""I will give you one last chance to surrender. If you dont, I will have no choice but to end you.""  
My eyes looked desperatly through the room. The window was open. It was risky - if I failed, a 10 meter drop awaites me. Still, I had no choice. I gathered all the strength of my vocal cords and fingers... ""TEN THOUTHAND FISTS IN THE AIR!!!"".  
He was ready for it, and it would take him only a few seconds to deflect my attack, as powerful as it was. But those few seconds are all I needed. It was time to attempt what he would never expect, yet what I myself wasn't sure I could do yet. I rushed to the window, switched to Acoustix simulator, and sang a tune I would have never believe I'd sing three years ago:  
""I'm like a bird, I only fly away.. I don't know where my home is.. I don't know where my soul is..""",Extract

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"It's been 13 years since the world has gone to shit. Its been 18 since humans discovered that with the right kind of flow or groove, you can do anything. You can break physics. The Nation of Rap has been fighting in a battle with the Nation of Pop, all buy destroying the rest of The Collaboration, what the free world decided to call itself after its victory over the Overtones. Every single musical nation in the Collaboration had bad communication. *a brief winds rolls through the cellar.*.... Often times I forget what it is possible to do by accident. I am one of the few who has been born with the ability to create magic simply by rhyming. My parents say that the gods tuned me to perfection before I was born. They believe that what I have is a gift. But they don't know what it's like to find out that you can tear an entire wing of your school away when forced to recite your poetry in class, and they never accidently made their pet salamander named Alexander disappear. I still am not sure if I believe it a gift. I always had the suspicion that I could be a Sorcerrapper, but I never thought that it would be me that had to try and set this world onto the right path, but I had to help stop the Nation of Pop. They believe that music should be repetitive, and orderly. That way nobody can become too destructive, what they've taken to calling those formerly referred to as creative types.
 I was born to two very humble rappers myself, they were able to earn decent wages off dope lines and writing pages, and told me that the idea of normality was silly and outrageous. After all, it isn't the meek who inherit stages, and it's never the small dogs people like to see in cages. I was told to never let the idea of a cage scare me away from being the biggest dog I can be. My family rarely talked in a literal sense; but they did have one saying I took as literal, and intended to stick to. "" If you can do something and make a difference, do it. As long as you know what you are fighting for is right.""
That's exactly what got me into this cellar that I'm in. At the Nation of Pop's largest even of the year, I got on stage and busted some if the sickest rhymes I've ever written. The Nation of Rap told me that no matter what happened, they wouldn't let the Poppers hurt me. That was two and a half months ago, and today is the last day I will have my hearing. I'm scheduled to be publicly sound cannoned to the tune of High School Musicals song about sticking to the status quo. It was rather clever on their part, as I am being sentenced to deafening on charges of using the power of mind control to change the musical inclinations of citizens of the Nation of Pop. Very clever of them indeed, to use their magic to try and gain listeners back through their sentencing. Luckily for me, they are unaware that I can do what no one before me has... I have found how to store the magic within scripture. I write magic daily under the light fixture and use pencils to create verbal pictures. And after two and a half months, I have finally created the mixture of lyrics that will end the Nation of Pop for good. The door to the cellar opened, and the sound of Miley Cyrus began to drag me up the stairs... I only smiled when my captors weren't looking.

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"John Robertson stood alone at the crossroads. Beside him was a road sign pointing four ways. Beyond him lied nothing but dry, open fields. Not a single tree, nor bush, no hill nor mountain stood in his sight, just the flat wheat fields stretching as far as the eye would see. He wore a three piece suit and fedora hat, all wrinkled and dusty, dust clung to his shoes, the dark glossy shine but a memory. In his hand he held his guitar case, his weathered hands dripping sweat. 

""Well, I'm here."" He shouted at the top of his lungs. For several moments, only the wind's lonely howling answered. Then, a form materialized from black smoke in front of him. The figure was impeccably dressed, a business suit of the latest and most prestigious fashion. Despite the blowing wind, not a single iota of dust clung to the man. 

""So, you have arrived at the crossroads."" The figure said. ""Are you ready to sign your contract?"" 

""I am."" John Robertson answered. 

""Before we sign our covenant, you must first demonstrate your worthiness. Play."" 

John placed his case on the ground and released the clamps. His guitar was a weathered acoustic model. Not a brand name, it bore the name of a generic, defunct company on the headstock. The pickguard was almost sheared completely, as if coarse sandpaper had withered it away, the frets worn as time itself, the strings seemed ready to snap at the slightest provocation. 

Despite these limitations, John held the guitar close to his chest and played a bewildering series of notes. And he sang. His voice and his guitar were one, singing of miseries timeless and everlasting. Songs passed on from his ancestors, from the Mississippi Delta to Chicago to Memphis and New Orleans. His performance, as skilled as it was emotional, awed the figure standing before him. 

""Most impressive."" The figure said, a hint of emotion in his otherwise stoic voice. 

""Do we have a deal?"" John Roberston asked. 

""We do."" The figure materialized a contract and a felt-tip pen. John signed, promising his soul in return for even greater gifts of musicalchemical prowess. After signing, John felt oddly wistful. ""I was born under a bad sign, you see."" He said. The figure collected the contract. ""If it wasn't for bad luck, I'd have no luck at all."" 

John was embraced by a blinding white light, his fingers tingled with an odd sensation, as if his fingertips were asleep, only magnified a thousandfold. Just as suddenly as it had begun, it ended. The light and tingling sensations were gone. 

""Congratulations, John."" The man said. ""You are now a master guitar-mage. The spirit of the Blues has possessed you. None will best your skill with the guitar for long as you live. In return, I now have possession of your immortal soul and henceforth, consider yourself my mage-apprentice. You will spread my gospel, from taverns and concert halls, from village to city, from country to country. Together, Blues will triumph. 12 Bar Blues will be the standard rallying cry and the 1-4-5 progression will be the standard bearer for a thousand centuries. People will get very blue indeed. You have only final test to prove yourself worthy."" 

""What is it, my lord?"" John asked, newly confident. 

""You must best my previous apprentice in a guitar duel. If you are truly worthy of your soul's enthrallment to me, you must defeat Steve Vai.""

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"Mya stood in front of her laptop and stared at the screen. The program that was displayed on it was rarely seen. It had been given to her by one of the Greats. EDM Greats.

Now that she was back at the Silent Monastery, which wasn't really all that silent - music was blasting through the air. Mainly rap, hiphop, reggae and blues music, Mya could appreciate being a little different if it meant helping winning her side of the war.

HEY, WHAT YOU DOING? a girl bounded up to Mya and sat down on the floor next to her laptop.

NOTHING. YOU KNOW E-D-M? Mya fingerspelled.

NO, NEVER HEAR IT BEFORE the girl signed and shook her head.

I HAVE COME BACK. I FINISH LEARN FROM THE E-D-M GREATS. WHERE? SWEDEN.

The girl's eyes widened, she raised her hand and waved it in front of her face.
SWEDEN! YOU GO NORTH, METAL KINGDOMS LIVE THERE! DANGEROUS POSSIBLE. I HAPPY YOU COME BACK SAFE.

Mya nodded and stared out to the waterfall that was in front of the monastery.
IT INTERESTING BECAUSE I TALK WITH MY MOUTH WHEN I THERE. I NOTHING TALK WITH MOUTH FOR LONG TIME. HERE, MUSIC HAVE FOR PEOPLE WITH HEARING AID AND COCHLEAR IMPLANT, BUT MOUTH TALKING NOTHING. ONLY SIGN LANGUAGE, LANGUAGE OF THE DEAF.

DEAF POWER! the girl signed enthusiastically and raised her left arm straight into the air, the hand clenched in a fist and her right hand covering her ear. A salute of Deaf Power.

TIA, WHEN ARE THE SENSEI COMING? Mya looked towards the door that led through to the rest of the monastery. She was in the music hall, where those who wished to, practiced their music.

SENSEI ON FIELD OUTSIDE TEACHING NEW STUDENTS MARTIAL ARTS Tia signed to Mya and walked out of the room, bounding away and sometimes throwing a karate kick to the walls.

Mya sighed and sat down in front of her laptop. She reached into the pocked of her jeans and pulled out two white objects. They both looked identical and had a curved shape that looked to be fitted to the ear and a thin, short and delicate looking cord attached to two circular discs that were dangling from the objects. Mya put the objects on her ears first and simultaneously moved the dangling circular discs to her head and they snapped to her head instantly, attaching with the magnets inside her head.

A cacophony of sound flooded her head and Mya breathed in, focusing her mind. She moved her lithe fingers towards the mouse on her laptop and started moving small, rectangular bars on the screen around. Gradually, a steady, solid beat started to play and Mya tried to remember what the Greats had taught her. It was easier when she was back in Sweden, with so many others like her all learning how to make their music with passion.

But she had a great advantage over all the students who would eventually go into war like her - Deaf Power. And with Deaf Power came the natural ability to use martial arts against people in a battle with magical music for those who could hear with the help of technology. Of course there was the added layer of everyone else in the world not really being able to understand them. Not anymore as their sign language had changed to fit in with their new abilities and magic.

Someone tapped Mya on her shoulder and she jumped in fright.
SORRY. YOU ENJOY LEARN FROM E-D-M GREATS YES?

Mya smiled and nodded at her friend Tom. 

YEAH. FANTASTIC OVER THERE. WHEN I GO THERE, I FIRST SEE METAL KINGDOM PEOPLE, THEY LOOK AT ME EVIL WAY, BUT I SIGN E-D-M AND THEY KNOW WHERE I NEED GO. THEY DON'T WANT TROUBLE WITH DEAF POWER NINJA. NO ONE WANT MORE TROUBLE WITH DEAF POWER NINJA WHO DO E-D-M! Mya laughed.

WHO YOU TEACHER OVER THERE? I REMEMBER MINE SNOOP DOGG. MOST PEOPLE HERE TEACHER FROM SNOOP DOGG, BEYONCE, JAY-Z, AND OTHER TEACHER. Tom's hands spoke in a flurry of signs all freeing themselves into the air. Mya was grateful for the new sign language of her people as she had actually missed it when she was in Sweden.

MY TEACHER WHO? USED TO BE FAMOUS GROUP. ONLY THREE PEOPLE. THREE TEACH MANY STUDENTS, OVER NUMBER 200. I REMEMBER LISTEN THEM MUSIC BEFORE MAGIC COME TO WORLD. THEY BREAK UP BEFORE MAGIC AND DO MUSIC BUT NEW WORLD FORCE THEM BACK TOGETHER AND TEACH.

Suddenly an older man walked into the room and waved his hands in front of his students to get their attention.

ENOUGH TALK. WAR GET WORSE NOW I HEAR. MASTER SENSEI WANT MEETING. MYA, YOU WILL VERY IMPORTANT PERSON NOW. YOU E-D-M SIDE RIGHT?

Mya looked at Tom uneasily and back at the older man. YES SENSEI, I E-D-M SIDE. WHY ASK?

The sensei breathed in and his hands shook, unable to articulate what he wanted to say.'
E-D-M SIDE POWERFUL NOW. YOU LEAD US IN WAR IF WAR COME HERE. Sensei signed rapidly after a minute of gathering himself.

Mya's eyes widened and she stared at the sensei, mouth agape. I LEAD US IF WAR COME?!

YES.

WHY?

BECAUSE YOU MUSIC DIFFERENT. OTHER STUDENT MUSIC SIMILAR OR SAME TASTE. BEFORE NEW MAGIC WORLD COME, YOU ALONE IN YOU STUDENT FRIEND GROUP, BUT NOW YOU POWERFUL.

WHAT YOU WANT ME DO?

DROP BASS. WE WANT OTHER MUSIC COUNTRY HEAR US AND KNOW NOT MESS WITH US! Sensei did the Deaf Power salute after signing.

Mya sighed and walked out of the room. 

Tom and Sensei looked at each other and Tom was about to say something when strange music began to play. He was totally deaf but he knew from the vibrations beneath his feet that this music was different.

E-D-M. Tom smiled, SHE DO E-D-M. IT REAL LOUD I CAN TELL. HOW? VIBRATION STRONG. LIKE THOUSAND PEOPLE DANCING.

The natives of what was once the US before Columbus knew; the monks who hailed from the region once known as Spain studied it extensively; and countless generations from the 20th century on swayed and bowed in blissful submission to the few who had already tuned in: control the music, control the world.

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"""The pleasure's all mine! Thanks for having us and please you can call me Max."" He said. Ashby was taken aback at the sound of Max's voice. It was soft yet deep and baritone and was warm and friendly. Ashby stood dumbstruck as Max took his seat. 

""Um of course, Max."" He said finally and took a seat of his own. Still somewhat taken by surprise at how nice this supposedly fearsome warrior was. 

""Hey before we get started can I ask a small favor?"" Max asked in his finnish accent. 

""A-anything for our, honored guests."" Ashby replied nervously. He wondered what they could possibly want. They hadn't even begun negotiations yet and they were already making demands? Part of Ashby wanted to say no, but he feared too much the wrath of these hardened combatants to deny them. He anxiously awaited their request, mentally going over the possibilities in his mind. Their women, their first born sons, all of their crops? 

""You see when we were staying at our hotel we went to this restaurant just down the street."" Oh no, could it be they were upset with their lodgings? Or did some fool anger them while they were out in the city.  

""We went to this place called, uhh... um... oh I can't remember the name."" He said. Max turned in his chair and called out over his shoulder to one of the other men in his group. ""Jorgen! What was the name of that place we went to?"" He asked. 

""Sharry's Seafood Shack."" Jorgen replied. 

""Yes that's the one! Anyway we went their and they had these delicious fried shrimp things, only they weren't exactly shrimp they looked more like lobsters."" He said. Ashby looked at him strangely. 

""Are, are you talking about crawdads?"" He asked. Max snapped his fingers and smiled. 

""Yes those! Do you think we could get a plate of those in here? They were delicious!"" He said. 

""Oh um, of course."" Ashby said, finding the request a bit odd but complying anyway. He called to an attendant and ordered them to fetch a batch of cooked crawdads.  

""Oh but don't think we didn't get anything for you either. Helmund bring in the barrels!"" Max called. One of the men then left the chamber and came back several moments later pulling a cart with three wooden barrels. Ashby was very confused, gifts and compliments? This wasn't anything like what he expected these metal knights to be. ""The finest mead in the kingdoms! Just a little token of our appreciation. Now let's break out the mugs and drink up!""  

The next hour and a half was spent more like a party than a diplomatic meeting. Everyone present was surprised at how friendly and kind these warriors of metal were. Maxwell especially was quite the comedian. He was cracking jokes left and right, making the whole room burst with laughter. They had a veritable feast, music was played, and the trade deals were worked out with hardly any disagreement. Ashby was shocked to say the least. He never would have imagined that metal sorcerers would be so gentile. 

""You know Max, I had you pinned all wrong!"" Ashby slurred. ""I thought you guys would be all mean and nasty but you're probably the friendliest bunch I've ever dealt with."" He said. Max laughed heartily. 

""Oh don't feel too bad. Everybody thinks that about us. Just because we listen to dark music doesn't mean we aren't nice guys. Here's to a new prosperous future!"" Max and Ashby clinked their mugs and the rest of the meeting was spent in joyous revelry. 

Notes: I don't know much about the music scene in Atlanta but it seemed like a natural sort of crossroads for different music genres. Also I looked up different Finnish surnames and found Korhonen which apparently means something like deaf or hard of hearing so I thought that was fun.

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"Her original albums, *Taylor Swift* and *Fearless* is (mostly) country. Listen to [Teardrops On My Guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKCek6_dB0M) and you'll see. With *Speak Now* there's more of a mix, going to the Pop-Country genre. The song [Speak Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wUPASp2hfY) is an excellent example of this. With *Red* and *1989* she's mostly transitioned to pop, but there's still some country left. For example, listen to [Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zlot0i3Zykw), you can hear the banjo at the start of the song, which is an iconic country thing. *1989* has almost no traces of country.

You can also see it in her style and outfits, especially her hair. [The cover of *Taylor Swift*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Taylor_Swift_-_Taylor_Swift.png), she has the waves and very large hair, which is often seen with country singers. Already in [the cover of *Fearless*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Taylor_Swift_-_Fearless.png), you can see some of the country going away, but form [her *Fearless* tour](http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/17900000/Taylor-Swift-Photoshoot-101-Fearless-Tour-2009-anichu90-17989280-1892-2560.jpg), you can still see the country look. Especially her playing her own guitar is also very country-esque. [The *Speak Now* cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/Taylor_Swift_-_Speak_Now_cover.png/220px-Taylor_Swift_-_Speak_Now_cover.png) has the same country-feel as *Fearless* does, in that there isn't as much as with *Fearless*, but still mostly dominating. The tour however, [it's more ""popped""](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Taylor_Swift_2011_2.jpg). Short hair and a lighter dress which isn't that country-esque. In [the *Red* cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e8/Taylor_Swift_-_Red.png/220px-Taylor_Swift_-_Red.png), she completely drops the curls, and with that most of her country look is gone, but the hat might add a bit of country feel. It's about the same with her tour. [The *1989* cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Taylor_Swift_-_1989.png/220px-Taylor_Swift_-_1989.png), all country is gone and she's completely transitioned to pop.",Bmandk

So now we had this powerful technology that could affect people on a level never seen before. And we had people with illegal Hypersonic systems playing around with something they did not understand. But people were mostly using  it at home, alone, where they could not get caught and arrested for having these 'weapons'. It was hard to find groups of people listening to them together.

It had to be Skrillex, a man called Sonny John Moore from a place formerly known as California, who already got on people's nerves before getting access to neuropathic technology, that made us really understand what Hypersonics could really do.

It was his birthday (his 34th, I think, which certainly did not call for such celebration) when he decided to throw an impromptu outdoor concert in Venice Beach, CA. During Summer.

Of course he was using going to use Hypersonics, but he could not do it for the whole show - someone would certainly die. But he decided he would play his closer with the tech; it would be one song, with a sick drop, people would be fine, he though.

It was a great show if you're into listening to robot sex (I love it myself) and right at the end of the show, as planned, he switched his speakers. Everyone was going absolutely ecstatic until... 'SWITCH-UP!'

Lights out!

They had gone into such a deep trance with this song, their bodies connected with the music in such a deep level, that the sudden change in rhythm made every single person drop on the spot. Most people regained consciousness after a few minutes. Some people died. Skrillex couldn't take the guilt and was never heard from again.

It was only then that people started to realize the real effect that Hypersonics had on people and what could be done with this technology.
Once people learned how to affect minds using music, the world changed forever.",TheMaStif

First it was subtle, then... then Musicians learned fast that their melody and song carried threads of power. They tried to rebel against their corporate masters, but as the old stories warn be wary of what oaths you make lest you find your selves in Contracts that bind.

These hateful men and their caged Songs swept the land. Traditional armies were not as ineffective against the elements as one may first think, but when song pulls at hearts and men turn from friend to fiend the Old Countries soon fell. 

Yet these would-be Masters were soon challenged. The Magic was not the only thing to return  to the land. Beasts of all nature and means roamed the land. Some offered wisdom. Some offered Mischief. Others offered only Death and Blood.

***

A stocky muscled teenager surveyed the broken remains of his neighborhood. His band stood together, but to a man they were all exausted. When the Youkai came next they would have no shield. The Metal would not die, but flesh? Flesh could not endure.

""Miri,"" A kid offered their singer a water bottle. ""We've got everyone evaccuated to the park. Kamio told me to tell you the Coilition is holding and you should get moving before the Vocoloids show up.""

Miri nodded once and patted the child's shoulder, ""Go, we'l be there in a bit."" Then she grabbed the child's arm briefly. ""No heroics. This isn't like TV. They won't care that you're little. Hell, they'll want to grab you up first to recruit.""

Fear lit the child's eyes before he started running. When he was out of earshot Miri started to bundle up her guitar. They were too tired to shlep amps and speakers, but she wasn't going to let Them get her guitar. ""Alright you punks. You heard smallfry, We've got Vocoloids inbound.""

Junpei managed to get his drum walked back onto a handcart. ""The Electronica isn't letting us have much breathing room are they?"" He wished the Pop-Alliance hadn't knifed them in the back, but that was the thing... they were Metal and they were so very far from the frozen wastelands of the Brutal Land and its burning gates.

Yet here. This island that had been Japan. It had been his family's home since forever and he would not abandon it. Miri had been cast out of the NOrthlans and had taken in with his band as their Voice. 

The baseline was felt before it could be heard. WOB WOB WOB WOB WOB.

They were out of time. Junpei looked around at his bandmates and saw that they could barely stand much less make Music.

WOB WOB WOB WOB WOB WOB WOB WOB. 

Words were impossible as the screech of artifice shredded the air. He saw them. The Vocoloids all marched in unison. They were a desperate gambit that had drove the Youkai back, and so when the Nations formed the Electronica took hold the lands sundered by the Pop Wars. Ye tthey had been at peace. What changed?

Junpei listened as the beat started. Sound turning from raw overpressure, to music. He could feel it in the air ad earth and even in his blood. The Music called to him. Yet it was not His. His blood ran Metal no matter that his instrument was a traditional drum. He was the only one in his band that could have any make even a token resistance and the Vocoloids knew it. They never faultered or slowed asthey marched in lockstep.

THeir un-natural sound issued from their very bodies as they came at Junpei like a wave seeking to wash away a sandbar. He had no hope of opposing that unfaultering unceasing wall of bodies and sound

Instead he did the insane... and joined its rhythm... caught onto the rhythm and cadence of the beat and added his counter melody into it, weaving and twisting his drumbeat through so the very nature of the song itself changed. The artifice that promised Death and Fire twisted its meaning turning from his neighborhood and the fallen of his Band. The words, their fire, their death, their promise of Doom threaded through, channeled and harnessed by the giant drums he had libbed from the old Taiko club's storage when They came.

It was not the first time he had woven countermelody of centuries old Drum Song into his enemy's melody. Their song twisted, trying to integrate his melody and turn back to its purpose.

Junpei smiled as the song faultered. That was his opening. The point where his subordinate rythm could become the dominant beat. His arms burned with exaustion but his pace increased. He could not let up, would not, and so played on.

They wer eforced to choose between letting the song die and leave that ambient Magic for him to clame, or ride along and hope he would faulter. The Vocoloids, for all their simulated emotion and false humanity wer beings of logic and weighted calculations.

They played on, hoping to exaust the drummer in their way. Yet even as they played the tidal wave stopped, the sea stilled around the island of sand.

Junpei twisted the magic, took from it in ways that men did before itwas more than simply the primal call of Music to Men. 

Slowly he renewed Slowly his band struggled to their feet. 

Slowly they moved to position.

Then... then they moved with purpose. They moved to take over the beat and turn the Electronica from Primary to a small Backup to their defiant roar. Others joined in. A fusion of Pop and Metal, Synth and Jazz and Traditional in a wall of sound. 

The Vocoloids faultered. Then fell.

Long had Junpei known the value not just in the human heart, but in looking past the borders of Genre and Land. He was not alone in this Fusion, but he was just the Drummer. who ever thought the Drummer was ever important?

He would be forgotten in the singing of this battle. The Bards would note him, if at all, as just another beat that joined in as Miri rallied against the impossible.

Jackson was sitting at home. Bored. Neither of his parents were home and it was still a week until he could get his drivers license. It was raining and despite his best effort, the spell-song he found in an old book in the basement didn't work. He decided to try once more, singing ""Rain rain go away, Come again another day."" As he sang, a small sliver of sunshine peaked through the cloud and right through the window into the fire place. Shocked, Jackson began to sing it louder! And faster! And with more emotion and eagerness! Then the logs in the fire place caught on fire.

""I mean it worked?"" he questioned to himself as he put out the fire. ""Well I suppose I should go do some homework. I need to learn this new spell-song by Monday...""

The year was 2043 and after the discovery of music magic almost 17 years ago, the nations of the world crumbled after ""The great Bagpipe War"" and Jackson was stuck in the musical melting pot of the country, ""The Denver Republic"" which consisted of what used to be Colorado, Idaho, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming. It was known for a little bit of every genre and generally welcomed it's diversity. Because of this, it was the head quarters of ""The New United Nations"" and so they thrived economically knowing that anyone who attacks them might as well declare war on earth. But all of this diversity was a struggle for Jackson because he liked almost every genre. 

Jackson knew that in only a few months he would have to begin applying for Universities and would therefor have to pick his genre. He wanted to become president so despite it not being his favorite genre, he practiced classical the most, followed by classic rock. His favorite genre though, was alternative rock. 90's alternative rock to be exact. But those with alternative anything degrees might as well have had history degrees, or liberal arts degrees before the magic was discovered. He knew he couldn't go far with this so he only practiced those spell-songs to warm up or for fun. Jackson wanted a milkshake. He was prepared. He knew the one spell song that was almost guaranteed to work, that is if he got the lyrics right, and on that topic, these were in the top 50 hardest lyrics.

He took a deep breath and then in a not quite monotone voice sang the song.

""Gonna make a break and take 
I think I'd like a stinkin' achin' shake
I like vanilla, its the finest of the flavors.""

Poof! The milkshake appeared before him and he tasted it. It was eh.

""Well I guess I better warm up a bit more before moving on to the homework."" he thought.

But being lazy and just wanting to get back on the computer or work on his alternative some more, he sought out a solution in the book he found in the basement.

He began to sing in a high pitch voice while holding his homework,

""This was a triumph!
I'm making a note here:
Huge success!

It's hard to overstate
my satisfaction.

Aperture Science:
We do what we must
because we can
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.

But there's no sense crying
over every mistake.
You just keep on trying
'til you run out of cake.
And the science gets done.
And you make a neat gun
for the people who are
still alive.""

It worked far better than he expected because along with doing his homework, he got some cake! Thinking that he deserved a reward for being so clever he decided to have a slice of the cake. But as soon as he touched it, it disappeared. The cake was a lie? What a cruel joke... He decided the spell book seemed like a fun way to spend his day and so he continued to flip through it. That's when he found a song so powerful he considered destroying it, knowing that it could plunge the world into chaos and darkness, but for some reason he just couldn't. So, instead, he slipped it into the crack in his wall with only a tiny corner showing, just enough he could get at it if he needed to. Continuing to flip through the book, he came across one song called ""Wish You Were Here,"" and upon playing and singing it, he learned to summon anyone to him at anytime. This could be very bad in the wrong hands. He tore the page out and shoved it under his bed. He came across a few more and then came across an instrumental classical piece known as ""Hail to the Chief."" Upon researching this piece he found that it was a piece traditionally played for the presidents and no known copies, written or audio existed today and the effect of the spell-song were unknown. But Jackson knew. He was hungry again. He used a different line from the same spell-song he used for the milkshake to get some more food and so he began.

""I summon fish to the dish although I like the chalet Swiss 
I like the sushi 'cause it' never touched a frying pan
Hot like wassabi when I bust rhymes.""

Well it almost worked, he got the roll he wanted,  but it wasn't soy wrapped. Anyways, he knew exactly what he was going to do once he got his drivers license.

                                             Chapter 2

His plan backfired. He had focused solely on mastering hail to the chief and had neglected his school work to the point where he was now failing all his classes except for alternative. His parents weren't happy and told him they wouldn't let him get his license until he had all his classical homework made up. Luckily this only took him a few weeks to do and next thing he knew, he was walking out of the DMV with one more plastic rectangle in his wallet than when he walked in. He drove the half hour to Denver, the capital of the nation, where he then went to the capitol building.

When he first told the secretary his plan, she laughed. Obviously he didn't tell her about the secret song, that would be stupid, but he needed her to take him serious. He thought for a minute trying to formulate a plan. He knew what to do. He wasn't proud of it, knowing that it was wrong, but he did it anyways. He went to the bathroom and, after ensuring he was alone, began to sing

""Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Think I'll buy me a football team.""

He only needed the first two lines but in his defense he was hungry, sick of driving that minivan, and he always had been a Denver Broncos fan. He walked back out to the secretary and handed her the money, $10,000 worth of Benjamins and told her that they would be hers if she helped him. She complied. His name was now on the ballot and he thought to himself, why haven't they passed a law against this yet? He asked to see the spell library and so she showed him there. uncertain he could keep enough voters backing him to remain a serious candidate, he knew he would need a spell. Not knowing what to look for, he began to sing the U2 song ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"" until he eventually found it.

At the first debate, he was asked why he thought he would be a good candidate to which he responded 

""I will follow you will you follow me
All the days and nights that we know will be
I will stay with you will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year.""
 
Instantly the crowd was applauding and chanting his name. The other candidates were not, as the stage was designed so that those who were on it would not be affected by spell-songs. Yet they were dumbfounded at his ability to use spells most of them didn't even know existed. Mind you, they were some of the best when it came to spell-songs. 

When his parents found out, they weren't very happy with him but they couldn't do much now as he was legally obligated to run until the end. Every debate would go the same, he would sing his song and mesmerize the crowd and walk out with an obvious victory. He was in the lead for almost all the election and then a debate came when the rules stated only instrumental spell-songs were allowed. He wasn't prepared. He didn't have an instrument with him and needless to say, he lost the debate. He had lost half his supporters in that one instance and was under heavy attack by the other candidates who said things like ""He's not prepared"" or ""He doesn't even know how the debates work,"" but he knew he could still win. The Final debate would require each candidate to perform a song from a genre of their choosing along with a song they would conduct with the help of an orchestra.

the siege was drawing to an end. the refugees anhd other disporia that had tried to make their stand in the heart of Electronica were running low on the basics. Magic could defend, and even turn the weather to their favor, but nobody had yet figured out how to make it summon food or drink. Without these it didn't matter how powerful their sound was.

So they hatched a plan, and worked at night so the Enemy would not see. It was a desperate gamble with everything thrown into what was frankly insane. They were to make a rush for the harbor and run. From there once away from the islands radio for help. The Electronica controlled most of the islands, but even with the Coalitions of Sound solidifying against other Genres there were still those that helped those that hadn't found a home.

It was far from gurenteed, but if they could get a few miles out then they'd be safe from Electronica's biggest weapon. So as Junpei helped lash his drum to the monstrosity that was to be their lead siege breaker he chuckled. [The vehicle](http://imgur.com/NvYl8vQ) had once delivered tools of war, and while its old masters had abandoned it during the Great Remix, it would again be a war wagon.

It was their last night together. There were small groups laughing by firelight. Jokes, songs, more intimate things that should have stayed private but they might all die tomorrow so who cared. Junpei stalked about, nervouse. Something in the air felt wrong.

""You feel it too huh?"" Kaiju was a big man, a wall of muscle and bone that more than lived up to his name. When Junpei nodded the big man seemed about to elaborate when the Noise interrupted him.

[It sounded like their sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7TjmlU3338)... Metal ripped through the air as the Stage rolled through. But it wasn't them. The musicians on stage, to the horror of those that could see, were all twisted parodies. Vocoloids twisted to look mutilated and infected. 

There was a sick light in their eyes.

""What in Brodin's name,"" Kaiju breathed just before the Magic hit. Then Kaiju was half rotted and tryign to rip Junpei in half. ""You did this!"" The now zombified ex-Bouncer roared. ""YOU and Your Kind made us use THIS!""

Whatever Kaiju was going to say next was interrupted by chains wrapping around the big man and dragging him to the ground. Miri continued a fast riff on her guitar as the chains tightened, ""Truck. Now. We're going!""

Junpei tried to catch his breath and center himself. He could feel the sik wrongness of their magic, the twisting and preversion of Genre. It was a grim parody of what he did the week before, and he could feel it calling to him, trying to find some way into him.

Where he succeeded and Kaiju failed to resist the Call was simple. Kaiju was a Bouncer. He gloried in the Music. Knew its beats and time, but he was utter garbage at making any of his own. Junpei's very soul marinated in Sound and Soul and his very pulse changed to a counter-beat. It shielded him, barely, from the taint that called and crawled and coiled around those that either weren't strong enough on their own or able to get to the safety of Jammers.

Junpei was disoriented and sick feeling, but he scrambled to his position on the truck's back along with the other Drummers. Miri and other guitarists strapped themselves in like demented mast figures as the driver caused the lumbering monstrosity of a vehicle to beltch to life..

From his spot Junpei couldn't see what was going on, but  he could feel the vibrations and hear the guitars start through speaker backwash. They'd practiced this. this was the Song he helped craft explicitly to break through the Electronica's sound. 

Yet they were using the Metal now. twisted and decayed, but still Metal at its heart. How the Vocoloids were able to tap such a primal sound he did not know, or even if his drums could force their noise back.

The die was cast though, other vehicles formed up, far fewer than their plan called for. There were so few of them not ripped apart by the Noise, but they had accounted for that too. Their trucks huddled close so their sounds overlapped and comingled.

                                                  Chapter 3


He ran to his bedroom upon arriving home faster than ever before and immediately began to dig around under his bed until at last he found it. 

                                                  Chapter 4

The debate was boring. All the candidates chose the normal songs, ""1813 Overture,"" ""William Tell Overture,"" and a few others. One candidate chose to do ""Chariots Of Fire."" Finally it was time for him to perform ""Hail to the Chief,"" but not wanting it to get leaked to the other candidates, this was the first time even the orchestra heard the name because when he made copies, he took the liberty of taping white paper over the title. As soon as the name was announced, the crowd became silent and then slowly a cacophony of murmurs, gasps and whispers. The music began and almost immediately the crowd was entranced. No more needs to be said. He won the election.

                                                   Chapter 5

It had been only 3 months since the election and Jackson was being rushed to the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station due to the threat of a massive spell-song attack on the capital by the neighboring New Confederate States, who loved bluegrass and country, led by none other than Donald Trump. The Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station was the only place in the world that was soundproof enough to withstand direct impact from a 180 decibel sound-bomb. The threat of attack rose from a defcon 3 to defcon 2, the highest ever since an era called the cold war back when wars were still fought with what were known as ""weapons"" and music didn't have magical powers. Upon arrival, President Jackson Bowie knew what had to be done. He told his staff that the next truck to come needed to bring the song hidden in the crack in the wall back at his old house and that whoever retrieved it would be sentenced to death if he were to read it.

Half an hour later he looked at the song in his hands. They were now at defcon 1. Before he sang the ""forbidden song,"" he addressed the nation via emergency broadcast by singing an old song by a band called The Beatles called ""Let it be."" Upon finishing the address, he began to sing the song that would change everything.

""A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die""

Upon finishing the song, he watched as everyone in the room was overcome by something more powerful than anyone thought possible from a song. All of them let out a scream as a bright light came out of their mouths and went into Jackson and soon after, lights were coming from outside the base. People would later say the light was so bright they looked at the sun for a break from the incredible blaze of glory atop the mountain. Eventually after several minutes, this stopped. Jackson glowed and began to float and as he floated he spun slowly, increasing in speed as he went around until the wind generated from the spinning was stronger than any hurricane ever before. The glowing began to subside and so did the spinning and he began to descend. As he landed on the ground he fell to his hands and knees and sang ""This'll be the day that I die."" He laid himself on his back and passed away, taking with him the magic of music saving the world from complete obliteration.

[WP] Magic is discovered and it's channeled with music. Modern nations dissolve and new countries rise in their place divided by the preferred music. In the frozen north lie the Metal kingdoms. Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"After having beat back the EDM army the Metal Kingdoms maintained their unified status as a collection of kingdoms and mostly stayed to themselves, not interacting with any of their neighbors. That is until six months ago, when a formal request for trade came from the kingdoms. The proposal was debated for weeks among the Governing Council. The stiffest opposition came from Chairman Decker, the Chairman of Defense. 

""We cannot allow these *savages* into our great city!"" He yelled during one particular fierce debate. ""If we let those Metal hooligans in they'll run right over us, destroy our city and turn it into a hell pit!"" He screamed. 

""Mr. Decker I hardly think their intentions are to conquer us."" said the Chairman of Knowledge, Elias Terrick. ""They've isolated themselves for years, if they really wanted to conquer anyone they would have done it by now."" He argued. But Decker was still adamant about refusing the trade agreement. In the end it came down to a vote among the council and it was Chairman Ashby who was the deciding factor. 

Even though Ashby could understand Decker's reluctance, he also knew that it would be unwise to get on the bad side of the Metal Kingdoms. So he voted for the proposal, only now Ashby was beginning to doubt his decision. 

Before Ashby could ponder further, the double doors to the chamber swung open. In walked four of the most dangerous looking men Ashby had ever seen. They were all tall and muscular and most had tattoos depicting various skulls, weapons, and arcane symbols. Some had long beards and one had a shaved head and piercings dotting his face. However it was the man who was front and center who drew Ashby's attention. He sported a thick moustache and held a cold gaze. An old scar ran down from the bottom of his right eye. His greasy brown hair reached just past his shoulders. Like the others he wore a sleeveless denim vest, standard attire for Metal Warriors. What impressed Ashby the most though, was the sheer number of patches that adorned the vest. The patches were supposedly a call back to old traditions, but now they were worn like medals; earned through combat and indicators of rank. Ashby looked over the many patches the man wore and saw some familiar names. Black Sabbath, Metallica, Pantera, Iron Maiden, Exodus. Others however seemed to simply be a jumble of undecipherable symbols. But Ashby didn't need to be able to read them to know that this man was clearly a commanding officer of some kind. 

His musings were cut off though as a scribe announced their arrival. ""Presenting the diplomats from the Metal Kingdom, the esteemed and honorable Maxwell Korhonen of the Castle of Thrash."" The man known as Maxwell strode forward to the table. His shoulders were squared and his gait strong and steady. He made for an intimidating sight, one which had Ashby nearly sweating in fear. As he came even closer all Ashby could think of was how this man could snap him in half like a twig. Heck all four of them, even without any weapons, could probably slaughter everyone in the room with just pure strength alone. They truly were deserving of their fearsome reputation. Ashby was so paralyzed with fear that he nearly forgot to stand and greet his guest. He shot up out of his chair, the last thing Ashby wanted was to insult this man and incur his wrath. 

With a shaky hand and frayed nerves Ashby reached out to Maxwell. ""W-welcome to Atlanta, Mr. Korhonen."" The man looked at Ashby's hand and at first Ashby was afraid he had done something wrong. But then he smiled at Ashby, a genuine beatific grin that lit up the room. He took Ashby's hand in both of his and shook it vigorously, all while still wearing that same friendly smile.

And then silence. John watched in horror at his friend’s face. Tom had heard their music. He’d been shivering so bad that his left earplug fell out, and now he was exposed to enemy fire. Tom writhed and bucked for a moment before collapsing in a heap.

And now he was the last musician in the trenches. Armed with nothing but a harmonica and a dirty crumpled piece of paper with half the lyrics to Achey Breaky Heart on it. He crawled on his belly over to Tom, and lifted his head. Tom’s eyes were empty. Jon closed his eyes, then pulled the microphone out from under his friend’s corpse. He was no singer like Tom had been, but he was a patriot, and there was no one else to sing. He made sure the microphone was on, then lifted the crumpled paper and read from it.

“Uh…I just don’t..don’t think he’d understand
And if you tell…my…my heart”

And that was as far as he got before an invisible force threw him like a ragdoll through the air. He landed on his back, immediately winded and numb, and while he lay there he realized the microphone was gone, and the paper, too. He was perfectly unarmed. He tried to get up, but as the numbness retreated and pain radiated out from his back, he realized his ribs, legs, and one arm were broken.

And then, through his earplugs, he heard it. Just a normal human voice. “Hey! Just give up already! I want to talk to you.”

A man with a meticulously kept beard and reflective sunglasses was walking toward him. John looked around wildly for an instrument. Anything at all. But there wasn’t anything, just giant craters and gashes in what once had been cornfields. John closed his eyes, and said the Our Father in his head.

When he opened them again, he was looking up into the bearded man’s face. “Hello there!” John spit on the man’s boots, and mumbled, “But don’t tell my heart…” The man laughed, and reached down to pluck out John’s earplugs. 
“There. Now we can talk like normal people. I just want to talk.”

John noticed the man’s ears were empty. “Where are…where are your earplugs?” The man burst out laughing.

“I don’t need earplugs. Not for musicians like you, anyways.” He saw John’s face and quickly added, “No offense. It’s just kind of easy to tell that most of you weren’t musicians before the war. I think out of all of you here, that one,” and he pointed at Tom, “was the only musician.” The man looked at Tom for a while, shook his head, and looked back to John. “Anyways, I’m ready to accept your surrender.”

“Go…go to hell.”

“Come on now, don’t be like that. Half the world is already ours, we can’t be stopped. Your government’s going to surrender soon anyways.”

“America…”

“Yes, yes, the land of the free and the home of the brave. But not anymore. Look, it’s a new era. And there’s no glory in resisting it.”

John shook his head.

“Please just…” The man cleared his throat. “Make them bow to my will! To the skies, see Carolus rise!”

Against his will, John felt an urge to open his mouth and surrender, to give up. He felt tired, and memories of his home came in a flood to him from out of nowhere. Apple pies cooling on the windowsill, barbecue scents flooding out from the grill to where he and his friends were playing baseball.

So he bit his tongue and clamped down.

The man growled in anger, then spoke in the same voice. Hear my orders, question me and die! What I say was said in heaven, and so it shall be done! I know I was destined to rule alone! All for myself I have claimed the throne! Born to rule! My time has come!

John’s body went limp, and his mouth opened of its own accord. “I…surrender.”

The man grinned. “I’m so glad you can see reason now. But I need your formal surrender. Repeat after me.”

And John repeated every word the man said, hating himself for it. Denouncing his allegiance to Country Music Incorporated, to the American flag, swearing allegiance to this foreigner’s country. He prayed fervently in his head to God, asking Him to close his mouth, or kill this man, or kill him. But the man kept speaking, and he kept repeating.

“…to my new mother country, Sweden,” the man was saying. And God must have heard John, because his facial muscles kicked back in, and he clamped his jaw firmly shut.

The man frowned. “Again? I’m getting tired of this game. I don’t have time for this.” He looked away from John, to the fallen musicians. “Into battle facing the fire, Lord thy will be done. Into battle, walk in a line -”

And John’s fallen comrades stood up in their hundreds, bones snapping back into place, clothes fixing themselves all at once. And then they spoke. “- see the white of their eyes, Caroleans are marching on!”

“You see?” The man looked back at John. “There is no stopping us. So tell me, now. Where is home? Where is the motherland for you?”

John just looked up at him.

“Should I make you speak again?”

“No! I…I…”

“Yes?”

John gulped, and his heart raced. “Sweet home Alabama!”

His comrades’ eyes went unfocused, then focused again. They patted themselves, as if they were checking that they were awake, that everything was still there, before they heard John’s next line.

“Where the skies are so blue!”

Then they joined in.

“SWEET HOME ALABAMA! LORD I’M COMING HOME TO YOU!”

The man howled in pain, falling to a knee, and they pressed on, gathering around him.

“*BIG WHEELS KEEP ON TURNING/ CARRY ME HOME TO SEE MY KIN/ SINGING SOUNGS ABOUT THE SOUTH-LAND/ I MISS OLE BAMY ONCE AGIN*”

He was shrieking now, and clapped his hands to his ears in pain. John and Tom pulled hands away away, while the others sang.

“*SWEET HOME ALA* -”

***KILLING GROUND***

A blast ripped out, and John went flying.

***EVEN THOUGH YOU SURRENDER***

The sky went dark, storm clouds gathering above.

***YOU WILL NEVER SURVIVE***

Lightning coursed down from the clouds, killing one by one the resurrected soldiers. Thunder drowned out their music, and torrents of rain blinded them so that they scattered in all directions, looking for each other.

***AS THE BATTLE OF FRAUSTADT TURNS***

Giant streams of fire came crashing down from the heavens, igniting soldiers and trapping others in rings of fire. John turned to run, and crashed directly into another soldier, blacking out immediately.


When he came to, the skies had cleared, and everyone was gone. The landscape and his broken bones were the only thing that showed there had been a battle.

“…See the Caroleans standing tall, conquer lands and slaughter all. Enemies fall at their feet, victory and great defeat…Ah, you’re awake!”

John turned around. And there was the bearded man again, crouching with a grin on his face and blood on his shirt.

“Do you know that song? No? Let me teach you the words that come next.” Before John could move, the man’s thick forearm shot out and he clamped his hand over John’s mouth.

“It goes like this: ‘One by one the Saxons disband - ’ do you know what disband means? It means surrender. Though I guess if you could speak right now, you’d say there’s no such word in your language. That’s just as well, because the next line is my favorite line.”

John tried to move his head away, but the man pushed his head down into the dirt. “It goes like this: One by one, the Saxons disband, ***OR DIE WHERE THEY STAND***

Darius looked up at his friend stretched out on the roof, and then back at his watch. ""It's only 8, the club ain't even lit yet."" 

Tom shifted his weight on the roof, cringing as old, red tiles cut into his arm. ""Don't matter. We just need to go in there and get back the boss's shit."" He pushed himself into a crouch, jumping ten feet off the corner of the drugstore and landing with a smile next to Darius. ""We got an inside remember, don't worry."" 

Darius exhaled in exasperation; every single time Tom said ""don't worry"" shit proceeded to hit the fan five minutes later. ""Alright alright, what's her name again and how do we know she's cool?"" 

""Kiki, and cause she's secretly one of us, "" Tom said matter-of-factly as looked himself over, apparently displeased by the new layer of dirt on his clothes. ""I'm tired of waiting, lets go."" Darius begrudgingly followed Tom across the street, occasionally glancing at the dilapidated shop fronts and broken cars that extended down the road. He paused briefly to look at the club. Probably the only building not in some state of ruin, the building called 'Hotline' shot up from between its neighbors, a twisted maze of neon lights, weed clouds, and melodic bass standing out in the old, concrete jungle. No one guarded the door, but a sign clearly labeled ""New Age Hip-Hop Weavers only"" hung ominously. 

""Alright stay close,"" Tom warned as he grabbed the doorknob, ""You ain't never seen this shit, just don't dance or we are both dead."" 

Darius swallowed and simply nodded, whispering a small prayer of protection at the same time, ""its called love, we don't sing about it no moe."" 

Tom glanced back, surprised by his friend's words; Darius rarely invoked defensive lyrics. ""Yo man it'll be fine, just be ready to drop some shit eh?""  

Darius nodded again, this time with a small grin, sparking a wink from Tom before he opened the door and the two men disappeared into a flurry of smoke and lights. They paused for a second to adjust their eyes, shifting uncomfortably as they were immersed in slow base music. The club was deceiving large; barrels of wine were stacked forty feet high, cascading rivers of alcohol onto beautiful women who danced on raised platforms, their hips grinding to some unseen force. Lewd paintings lined the walls as people clustered around several leather booths, talking or smoking in small circles. Tom squinted through the room's haze, pointing at a faraway door. ""That's where the bosses book would be, c'mon, lets do this fast, I hate this artificial tune."" Without waiting for a reply, Tom turned, shot past the booths, his face tight, and disappeared into a cloud of weed. Darius started to follow him when he suddenly realized he could hear the lyrics over the clubs speakers clearly for the first time. The words slowly began to repeat themselves in his head. ""Oooh I remember, I remember I remember when I lost myyy mind!..."" Darius smiled in spite of himself, humming the tune quietly. He knew he should have been keeping up with Tom, who was quickly becoming hard to see, but he just wanted to go somewhere he could hear the song better. Instead of following Tom, Darius crossed towards the booths, obsessed with the thought, ""There is just something so....pleasant about this place."" 

Just as he was about to jump into a a small group of dancers, eager to join in, a pair of hands grabbed his jacket from behind. Darius resisted, but refused to turn. His mind foggy, he was faintly aware of being pulled away from the booths to a secluded corner of the club. Annoyed at the sudden intrusion, Darius finally turned on his stranger, trying to knit a sentence together in his head when the hands slapped him quickly, three times to the face. Lucidity chasing the pain across his face, Darius fumed, ""What the fu-"" he paused, surprised to find a small girl in front of him.  

She was maybe a head or so shorter than him, bright brown eyes framed by a small, chocolate face and loose brown curls. ""Your lucky I found you. Even heard indirectly over speakers, 'Crazy' can twist people."" 

Darius paused, ""...You must be Kiki?"" 

The girl beamed, ""That's right, and 'thank you' is the normal response."" 

Darius reddened, ""Right...thanks. I didn't think the song would be so strong."" 

Kiki nodded, ""'Crazy' is one of the best insanity spells ever woven, even in its diminished, non-concert form its still good enough to catch people who aren't used to the style."" She pointed over her shoulder, ""Anyways, I heard Tom was here, lets find him and get everything going."" Darius agreed, following, but they had barely passed half the booths when two groups, breaking off from the tables, closed in around them. 

""Can I help you?"" Darius growled, trying to appear more confident than he felt at the sudden trap. One man from their group of assailants detached himself stepping forward with a smirk. 

""Well...I see you drive round town with the girl I loooove,"" The man broke into song. Darius openly cussed and lunged at the man as Kiki slapped her hands over her ears, but both were too late. The man sidestepped, grinning from ear to ear as he pointed at Darius and Kiki, ""and I'm liiike, FUCK YOU and a FUCK YOU TOO!!"" 

Darius gasped, twisting as his back was slammed by some invisible force. The last thing he remembered was the laughter of the group around him as his head smashed into the floor. The first thing Darius realized, upon regaining consciousness, was the blissful lack of music. The second, was that he was outside, bound by the hands and feet, in what appeared to be the alley behind 'Hotline'. He turned, seeing Kiki and Tom in similar positions, guarded by several men in baggy clothes and heavy coats. 

""Not a very good plan I gotta say."" The voice made Darius whip around, laying his eyes for the first time on the Great Traitor. The man was clothed in a purple suit with heavy wool coat, smoking a cigar as he regarded his charges. ""I knew his majesty wanted the tome back, but I'm sad he only sent three to do it."" His face changed from disappointment to one of annoyance, ""After I went through the trouble of discovering and ignoring your spy, just to encourage you!"" 

Darius turned to look at Kiki, who had woken up along with Tom, only to catch a flash of anger on her face at the insult. 

""But really I must ask,"" the traitor leaned in close to Darius, ""before I send you back to your lord in pieces, what was the plan? I mean I might have lost a bit of power since the revolution but Jesus, to send only three people is just downright disrespectful.""

Darius grimaced, not only did he get captured, he was captured easily. He hardly deserved to be in the inner entourage if he couldn't even stop such an obvious knock-out spell. Either way, he reasoned he should go out with some semblance of respect, so he was about to tell the traitor to fuck off when another deep voice cut him off.

""They were never supposed to get the tome, only distract you morons."" Everyone whirled on the voice, near the club entrance, where two guards laid unconscious at the feet of a small man. He didn't look terribly imposing at first, with some crazy-looking braids, a long black coat, and small flask in his right hand, but his eyes were different. They were as black pits, holding some deep vast power, but at the same time brimming with amusement, as if he found the world funny. The man stepped forward, taking a sip from his flask before continuing. 

""I didn't expect them to get past you; your just too paranoid, playing your spells in that club 24/7 to catch enemies."" The man grinned, lifting up his left hand to reveal a plain looking, blue notebook. ""I just needed them to get you outside for a moment so I could recover this."" 

The Traitor snarled, turning to face the man, "" You dare to challenge me in MY territory!?"" 

The man stopped smiling, flipping his book open and yelling a line out of it. The traitor and his followers tried to scream, ""WELL FUCK YOU AND A FU-"" but were cut short. 

The man's whispered his line, so softly Darius and the others barely heard it, but it rang clearly in their heads, ""...the question is detrimental paralyzing my thoughts."" 
The man closed his notebook, apparently pleased. It took Darius a second to realize the traitor and all his men had frozen, veins visibly pulsing in their temples. He turned to Tom and Kiki, who looked equally dumbfound that such a simple line could generate such a powerful paralysis spell. The man walked up the the traitor, until they were inches from each other. 

""My old friend Cee lo, you betrayed the purist rap weavers, and for that we will never forgive you."" Cee lo could say nothing, but his eyes betrayed his cold rage. ""However, you will return to us in the days to come,"" the man leaned in close to Cee lo, smirking, ""wars often force enemies together in interesting ways..."" 

Later that night, after departing 'Hotline' Darius, Kiki, and Tom stood behind their lord atop a hill overlooking the Hub City. 

""My lord,"" Darius said, ""what now?"" 

The man paused and, looking down at his newest tome. He considered the name he had given it, what the Metal Lords and Soul Sultans would think. He chuckled to himself; his old idol would be pleased. The man looked back at the city, and, raising his hand, outlined a triangle in the sky, yelling words from his tome with all the anger he could muster, ""Now I run the game, got the Whooole world talking, KING kUNTA!"" 

Darius and the others jumped back as a beam of bright light shot from their master's hand, arcing up into the clouds. A moment later, hundreds of similar lights began to shoot up in response, all around the city. Distant roars and chants could be heard in the distance, and explosions began to streak along city's skyline. Kendrick turned back to his followers, a grim smile in his lips, a familiar, knowing glint in his eyes, ""Now the world knows, its time the Rap Kingdom rises again.""",Meeseeks_Senior

""We've understood for longer than they did, that words hold power. And while that's largely been pushed aside by the fusion of music and magic, it's still important. In our style, more than most, having a coherent flow of ideas and lyrical patterns is key to success.""

""But we've been beaten by every decent practitioner anywhere around,  whenever we try to form our own society. Where's the power, then?""

""Our power is different, and we've never shown them what we're capable of. It's been a long time coming, but Nine is putting the final touches on a plan that will guarantee us respect worldwide. Support of the plan is unanimous; we've never been a fan of the man, and now we won't be second-class practitioners anymore. We'll have full privileges.""

Charles was confused. ""But if it's such an important project, why haven't you been asked to collaborate?""

Marshall smiled before answering. ""I've recruited a friend who practices Pop magic, and he's going to contribute a new technique to my newest piece. It's going to be the finishing touch. Now if you'll excuse me, Charles, I believe he's here now.""

A man in sunglasses and a hat walked up to Marshall, holding out his hand.

Marshall took it. ""Mr. Mars. Good to see you.""

""Likewise, Mr. Mathers.""",Singdancetypethings

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"Her dreams began, like many dreams began in those days, with hearing a song.

Allison McLaughlin was on her way with her parents to the Tennessee Valley Fair when she encountered an old man with a battered electric guitar and 10 watt amplifier, ringing out harsh bar chords and screaming some sort of strange mystical words about the working man and harsh ways of live in the country. The very sound of each note felt as if it was like a presence had encapsulated her to remain there. After the man finished his performance, he slung the guitar against his back and relaxed himself for a moment. Allison walked closer to the man, reaching into her pocket to find a couple paper bills to hand to him.

""That was incredible,"" Allison began with amazement. ""Where did you learn that?""

The older man peered at her with curiosity. Allison felt as if the gave in his pale blue eyes was scanning right through her.

""It's an old riff passed down for generations. It's simply feeling it for yourself."" He explained esoterically, lifting the guitar off of his shoulders. Allison leaned forward.

The old man handed her the guitar. ""You can try it out if you'd like.""

As Allison held the guitar she felt something manifesting inside her. She could feel the sound of the instrument flowing through her. It wasn't a simple instrument to make music, there was an even greater power from within it.

Teaching her a chord progression of C-F-G, the old man began to yell some lyrics madly. When the song ended, Allison returned the guitar to the man, who put it into the hard case beside him.

""Music,"" he said solemnly. ""Sounds to soothe the soul with. Your playing really knows how to heal a person's spirits.""

He shook her hand and left her a business card. ""Lessman's Lessons, Memphis"" was the name printed on card. She thanked him.

""If you ever want to learn to play, come here. I will teach you myself."" Lessman grabbed his case and began to walk down the street.

During the valley fair, Allison could not take her mind off the old man and the guitar. Despite the musicians playing at the festival, none of them touched her the way the old man's playing did. It was something completely different. She looked at the card given to her. She had to take guitar lessons in Memphis.

After the festival had ended, the days had passed, and Allison booked a bus to Memphis. She walked around town seeking out the music store listed on the address. It was nowhere to be found. She checked her phone, and the maps did not show any location with the address. She asked people passing by on the street, many whom have never heard of such an establishment and assumed she was trying to be funny.

The afternoon was setting, and Allison sat on the ground in a nearby park. There was no hope after all. A busker was playing a rendition of Tom Waits on a standup bass in the park, despite there being nobody around. As he finished the rendition, his eyes had met Allison's and he approached her.

""The clouds look like they are gathering. A storm's coming. Are you all right?"" Asked the busker.

""I came here looking for a musician, but I can't seem to find him."" Allison replied somberly.

""Memphis is the birthplace of Rock n Roll. There are many musicians."" Explained the busker. He outstretched his hand. ""My name is Taylor.""

""Allison,"" Allison responded, shaking Taylor's hand. ""His name is Lessman. He's a blues musician.""

Taylor stopped and returned his hand. He stared directly at Allison.

""Lessman is brilliant! I will take you to him!"" Exclaimed Taylor with glee. Allison, figuring that there is no better alternative, began to walk along with Taylor and his hefty standup bass across the streets of Memphis until the reached a small shack between crowded buildings nearby the music hall of fame building. The shack was barely the size of a small cabin and probably would go completely unnoticed from the outside.

Approaching the door, Taylor tapped a cadence against the handle. A young man with dreadlocks and sunglasses answered the door.

""Good evening Taylor, and..."" the doorman paused. ""Who might you be, miss?""

""Her name is Allison. She is Lessman's upcoming protege."" Explained Taylor. The doorman nodded and led them inside.

Inside was the appearance of an old speakeasy nightclub during the middle 20th century. There was a long bar, and a dance floor with a grand piano as its center piece on a stage in the distance. The entire room must have been five times the size of the cabin outside, and the tables were filled with all sorts of people discussing in low hums amongst themselves. On a sign by the door it read ""Howard Lessman's Open Mic.""

""Lessman will be here shortly,"" said the doorman. ""Feel free to find a seat and make yourselves at home.""

Taylor took over an empty table in the corner of the room and Allison followed. With barely enough time to order drinks, the lights began to dim and the stage lit up. Lessman arrived on the stage.

""Welcome all of you,"" began Lessman. ""The open mic is a chance for us all to show our skills and learnings to the musician community of America. As you know, times are changing around us, and the age of traditional instruments is slowly fading for electronic beats and rhythms, but there is still a sense of need for this energy. We are gathered to preserve this arcane art. Please enjoy, and if you have an instrument, perform.""

The audience cheered and the night began. One after another, musicians came onto the stage and performed pieces. There was a supernatural experience to a lot of them, and each instrument and style brought another form of magic to the entire experience. Finally when the last note played, many shuffled out. Lessman caught Allison and Taylor.

""Allison!"" he exclaimed. ""Good to see you!""

Allison clapped her hands. ""That was awesome!"" she said enthusiastically. ""When are you doing another one?""

""This was the last open mic for a while."" Lessman declared. ""Tomorrow I am leaving town.""

Allison looked down. Her entire trip was pointless after all.

""However,"" Lessman continued. ""I was hoping you would like to join me.""

""Join you?"" Questioned Allison. ""I can't even play anything.""

""Not yet, but you will."" Explained Lessman. ""You are born with magical blood. Music is a key to your soul. Allow me to introduce myself: I am Howard Lessman, a wizard of The Note. A society of sorcerers who are able to use music to create the aural healing sensations of magic and non magic folk. But our people are dying out. Soon enough music will be nothing more than a production made in a bedroom.""

Lessman continued on behalf of the puzzled looks of Taylor and Allison.

""I would like you to accompany me on my tour to Portland. They say that Portland is the center of a musician's magical power, and it is the only place where there is a chance to save our music from the growing trend of electronic beats. After seeing how you handled my guitar the other night in Knoxville, I know there could not be any one better than you. I have a tour across the country, you will be able to learn quick enough, but I am leaving tomorrow.""

Allison looked down.

""I can't."" She said defeated. ""I have a home, and family in Knoxville. I can't just leave.""

Lessman shook his head.

""That can be arranged. I have already sent a letter to your folks. As far as they know, you have gained a scholarship from a summer band camp. Now-""

He began to close down the hall and collect his guitar case.

""Let's go now, St Louis is waiting for us.""

Allison hesitated for a moment, Taylor butted in.

""You're both leaving?""

Lessman looked to Taylor.

""You're coming with us as well. Busking during the day will be the best way to get bus fare.""

""Bus fare?"" Asked Allison. ""You don't have a van?""

""The wages of musicians have never been kind, even in the golden days decades ago."" Replied Lessman.

Taylor shrugged and accepted. He looked at Allison, who had also reluctantly decided to join along. Before the night was over, the three were headed on a bus to St Louis, which seemed nothing more to them than just another musical world away from their own.",Heavenwasfull

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"The idea of countries bound by music was admirable, but flawed. When the majorities had to band together to prevent misuse of magic, those on the outside were tossed aside.

When the pop empire, with its repetitive, yet hypnotic beats, came, the lone wolves stood no chance. Minimalist noise has power, but with no lyrics, it couldn't be performed on the fly to save its practitioners. The anime theme fans were put down easily when it was discovered most of them didn't understand the words to sing them.

But the power of music and community could never be underestimated. Rebellions were quick to rise. Pagan folk musicians left for the forests to begin a new life. Speedcore and gabber groups teamed up in the Netherlands, their lightning-fast attacks gaining ground. Germany was a constant battleground, the NDH practitioners continually bolstering their ranks with fans from across the globe to fight an intensely fervent industrial and EBM underground all over Europe. Politically-charged groups took to the field. Separated by language but united in belief, white supremacist RAC and NSBM clans formed small but tight-knit groups chanting spells that horrified all those who heard them. Leftist groups were much larger, but more divided, and when one's magic was charged by personal belief, it was a battle neither side could truly win.

Pubs, bars and community areas were quick to keep entertainment consistently coming to ward off attacks. A capella groups, harmonisers and barbershop bands had a surge in power and popularity. Their voices were the music, nothing else, making performance on the fly easy and surprise attacks impossible.

In the end, nothing could be done. To ban music outright was foolhardy, and modern life was destroyed by the constant battle.

Yet, in remote villages high in the mountains, on the vast savannahs and steppes across the world, life went on as it always had, the tranquillity broken only by the traditional songs they had sung for thousands of years.",robophile-ta

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"For eons the World's strongest nations were at a stalemate. It was commonly thought that there were no clear masters or subjugates, but that the Nordic Union's Metal Battle Groups were the highest risk factor, and the NU itself was at best an impulsive instigator. This made it difficult to communicate. 



They had erected themselves a monolithic black pyramid fortress, it's 3 points laying in the territories of what used to be the old European Union, the Middle East, and somewhere in Russia. To everyone else's knowledge and abilities, it was impenetrable, and it could could have contained anything--unspeakable, mind-shattering horrors, or ancient wisdom and power. The kingdoms that formed the NU lay around it and were not all, strictly speaking, 'Nordic'. They were, and still are, a highly varied and adaptable, unruly and unpredictable bunch. 


There was always *tension* between the Unions, but no outward, public acts of violence. The Country Union of Neutral Territories has always had some beef to flap at the Latin Union of Bordering Entities for various undeserved and ludicrously minute reasons. The K-Pop Sovereign States didn't really have any problems with anyone, but that's because most nations were too uncomfortable to be in close proximity with anyone from the KPSS, and would have rather avoided the argument. 


Everyone feared and respected the NU, and the rest of the world, even the Tribals, with their fire Tornadoes and ghost soups knew they may have to one day join forces against the formidable foe. Everyone was prepared for the worst. 


No one, however, could have imagined this. Not even the NU. 


The various nations had awoken one morning (all the world woke and slept at roughly the same time, as the earth stood still and was lit by the nations' powers; this was in part due to the stalemate) to something no nation before had experienced. Not like this. At precisely the same moment, every single person in the world jolted awake to an unhuman shriek coming from what sounded like just inside their walls.


*Their walls were screaming at them*


The shrieking often morphed into frantic gibberish, and muffled, laborious grunts. These sounds, though technically sounding like they were coming from outside the room, were nonetheless piercing, deeply reverberating.


It did not take long for most of the Earth's denizens to realize that the sounds were coming from *inside their own heads*. Actually, it felt more like it was echoing in their heads, like there was a broadcasting station nearby and their heads were just picking up the signals. 


Those who didn't realize this right away, quickly succumbed to the oppressive and intrusive nature of the noise, and began channeling what they were hearing, and chanting the mindless nonsense. Those that were hit the worst were essentially turned into another broadcasting station, to potentially turn the closest by proximity, and most gullible people into more broadcasting stations, and so on. It was a brutal and effective tactic.


No one was ready for the Beliebers, and their hellspawn. Now what remains of the Old World huddles close in the NUs black pyramid fortress, where the evil cannot reach us. We are all friends now, brought together by a common cause--survival. We are safe in here.

Their noise-canceling helmets didn't stand a chance against Adele and her sorrowful voice. They lost New York and retreated to Appalachia where the Blue Grass hid them for a time. It was a long cold bitter winter for the United Musical Forces. 

It was heard through the grapevine that the Country Regiment had tried to rally from Virginia but their song had become so diluted by Pop and their rhythms so obvious and repetitive that the Brits routed them.

All hope was lost when the Hiphop Clans fractured. With the New York sound gone their was nothing left but the debacherous rhymes of Atlanta. The West Coasters abandoned the East, believing that the vast silent  emptiness of the plains would be a barrier to preserve them.

But there was a power growing. A sound without voice began to creep Northward. An orchestral blitzkrieg that surged forth. The March of the Empire reverberated off the southern hills. Disney was unleashed and with Williams leading them, a new hope began.",londongarbageman

"[TT] Many of the scrolls at the Library of Alexandria were actually powerful spells, and most of the librarians were powerful wizards. Tell about the magical siege on the library, and how the stolen scrolls were used to obtain great power for years afterwards.",WriterDavidChristian,"
The nine stood at the gates to the library. The time spell was breaking down. Urania’s strength was fading and she knew she couldn’t hold on for much longer – had it been days or weeks already - at some point the fire would win. The nine could not harm any humans and they were running out of tricks to save what remained of the old order. They had built a civilisation on peace and their magic was only to be used to uphold the ideals of a society that would go on to span this universe. The dark magic was locked away and never to be used. They wouldn’t use it now. They were stronger than that.

But to Caesar they were weak. To him and the rest of the council of nine, along with an army of the most sadistic and worthless men on the planet, the battle after the siege had been just one day. 

The coordinated attack had overwhelmed the cities meagre defences. The wizards were little match against the black mages – these barely human things had quite literally sold their hearts to wield the powers of death and destruction. The wizards were decapitated and their heads placed on spikes secured into the piles of Alexandria’s people that littered the streets. As midnight approached the fires where reaching the library. They would wait for day break before they entered the building and took the prize. The dark scrolls that would allow them to rule the earth for millennia to come.  

Each time midnight strikes time is reset and they are returned to the same place they were the previous night – no memory of the carnage that has come before, or will come again. Day after day, after day, after day.

Each day the muses tried in vain. In truth their powers were useless. Thalia could not make an army laugh itself to death. Erato tried to make them all fall in love – but love is far more deadly than anger or rage. Melpomene was conflicted by a most befitting tragedy. One to inspire tales of for generations to come. The burning of the great library, the end of peace and love. 

It was Clio that suggested the only possible course of action. She could see all of history across all universes but she was never quite sure which timelines related to which universe. There were too many similarities held within infinite possibilities. 

They would let the flames take the library and Caesar could enter the chamber.
Finally midnight came and Urania let go. “The dead are dead forever” cried Calliope and as sun rose Caesar and the council made their way into the library. The flames were still destroying the city, the library was still alight but the dark mages had enough strength to shield them for a short time. 

They were greeted by Terpsichore but there was no dance. A simple hand gesture towards the chamber and then gone. They entered. 

It was a cold and plain stone room with the ceiling just above head height. In truth it was more of a corridor as it was just beyond arms width but it seemed to go on forever as it descended in to darkness. About twenty paces ahead of them stood a wooden table and upon it nine scrolls. They were black and coated in fine dust.

This was not the extravagant end to the siege Caesar or his council had imagined. Each member of the council was a ruler in his own right but together they would divide this world and rule with unmatched power. Perhaps they would turn on each other eventually but it was their time now.

They approached the table. Polyhymnia appeared. “Before you is the end. You must take them together to ascend. These scrolls were not meant for man.” And then she was gone without finishing. 

“I am no mere man” laughed General Rockefeller, the most arrogant and deceitful of the council. 

“Quiet you ass!” Stalin snapped at the man. “Let us finish this and return. I have been away from my people for too long. I fear they are happy”.  He approached the scrolls.

Murdoch put a hand on Stalin’s shoulder. Very few men could do that and live. “We take them together – the muses never lie”.

The nine of them stood around the table – each in front of a different scroll and each scroll holding a different dark power that man should never wield. 
“On the count of 3” Caesar demanded. “1…2….”

Urania appeared above the table, followed by an explosion and then nothing. Could this possibly work? They could not harm the men or the scrolls.

The nine muses met for one last time before they separated. Clio had told them that they could not win the battle today but if they spread the council and the scrolls across time, humans stood a better chance of defeating them even if they find the scroll sent with them. 

“You have one each. Find the council members and help humanity stop them” Urania smiled at each of them before sending them to the equivalent time periods in less extravagant flash then the explosion before.

“You’re really leaving this Jesus one up to me? I’m bored of the desert. I really wanted to go to London for…” Said Thalia before vanishing into time.

"[TT] Many of the scrolls at the Library of Alexandria were actually powerful spells, and most of the librarians were powerful wizards. Tell about the magical siege on the library, and how the stolen scrolls were used to obtain great power for years afterwards.",WriterDavidChristian,"The Library stood proudly against the scorching Egyptian sun, casting an equally dignified shadow on Cato the Younger. He blinked at the rays cast by the bright sun peaking out from behind the Library.

""As thou art to stand idly I am to proceed, Cato. Come now, work stands as idle as you do presently, waiting to be attended.""

Cato blinked once more and turned towards Brutus. ""Rome bears not such scorching white plates. O, how I do wish to be out with this city of sand and mud.""

Brutus smirked. ""'Tis wrong of thee to declare Rome such temperance. That, and it does not become thee to expect such weather in Alexandria of all places. Now hence, as the sooner we finish here the sooner our ship will be finished tethering to the docks of the Tiber.""

The two men passed through the great columns of the Library and into the cool air that filled the scholarly place with a sense of calmness. It was this calmness that so rudely interrupted by an explosive blast and shouting.

Cato readied himself into a defensive position and swiftly withdrew his spellbook from his luscious robes. ""Begone, foul magicks, or I shall make thee gone from this realm!""

He felt a hand on his shoulder. Cato was mid-incantation when he found himself staring up into the face of his colleague Brutus.

""Thou do lack the temperance you yet long from your home. Calm, Cato, for it is merely our flashy friend, Cicero.""

Cato looked up to the balcony of the second floor of the Library, where Cicero stood with a stupid grin on his face. Judging by the embers and smoke surrounding him, this was the source of the blast.

""Hail, Cato! Hail, Brutus!"" he called out from above them. ""This Library is simply wondrous! The power within the scrolls the philosophers here so flippantly pass by is unimaginable in Italy!""

Brutus shook his head slightly. ""And such it is incumbent upon us to be gentle with our new, if brief, surroundings.""

Cicero's gleeful smile began to fade at his friend's seriousness. Another loud blast echoed throughout the Library, causing grey-bearded old men to glance up with disapproval.

The orator appeared again in front of Cato and Brutus, an entire floor traversed in a split-second. Now it was Cato's turn to comment on Cicero's childishness. ""I am inclined to stand by Marcus. Express care and caution in this unblemished bastion of scholarship. Apollo knows such places are infrequent and insignificant compared in Rome.""

Cicero frowned slightly when another firey blast exploded distantly. Cato and Brutus tensed, as this sound came from an unknown source. Even Cicero had lost his eyes' glint. Philosophers peered around and rose from their studious positions. Books and scrolls were laid down as they began to cry out.

""Hark! What nascent scoundrels defile the sanctity of our Library?""

""Nay, shan't it be mere hooligans who disturb us so!""

One pointed panicked to a seemingly blank spot on the far wall. ""Fear,"" he shouted. ""They come! Dark powers infest our fortress of study!"" He suddenly swiveled around to face another wall. ""And see as I do, even great Alexander in his tomb grows restless!""

Cato pressed a hand on Brutus' shoulder. ""Report, what unnatural spirits doth the man speculate? He stareth as if touched to empty stones.""

Brutus narrowed his eyes, focusing on the wall that the man had pointed to. ""It bid me to suspect he see beyond with elixir or sacred words -- touched he is not, but so will be the wall he indicates.""

Then, amongst all the panicked yelling, a voice rang out from high in the Library, presumably on the topmost level. A young man, nearly beardless, cried out, ""Hark and gaze! The window here I peer through, and so doth it show me Alexander's unceasing spirit to raise from his capsule! The citizens scatter as dark forces bring his greatness back to us! What cruelty! How evil!""

Cicero ran over to the Library's front columns that stood parallel to the town square where Alexander's corpse lay... or did quite recently. Presently it was throwing off the silks and flowers that decorated its tomb, inciting deserved shock in the townsfolk and scholars.

Cicero called back to Cato and Brutus. ""He doth speak true! The flee-bitten body of once-great Alexander walks again, with dark intent! Mark him, and ready thyselves at the columns; we may face a supreme enemy.""

Cato took cover at the front wall of the Library where the open entrance provided vision into the square. He produced his spellbook once more and began murmuring ancient words. Brutus did the same across the entrance's grand frame.

Alexander's corpse brought itself to its feet and slowly rose to full height. He looked around carefully at the square, the few frightened citizens remaining on the street, and the active Library bearing dashing scholars and panicked philosophers. Some copied the three Romans by preparing spells, while the non-magically inclined simply fled.

""Silence!"" The voice of the man with augmented vision rang out. The Romans perked to attention to hear his words. ""By the western wall, they come! Alexander will soon begone of your troubles!""

Unsure of how to position themselves, the Romans stood petrified as the looming menace behind the western wall supposedly approached and the more obvious Alexander confidently strode towards the columns, sword in one hand and scroll in the other. His purple cape came loose, leaving him in a military tunic and laurel-shaped crown.

""Now must we take action, Brutus!"" hissed Cato. ""Banish this demonic presence as to focus on our unknown doom to the west!""

Brutus solemnly nodded and popped out from behind the wall. Alexander halted and stared for a beat before raising his scroll and beginning to speak in a dry and guttural tone. Blue sparks began to fly around him and his sword grew bright, but Brutus' extended hand froze the process.

A blinding light, one far more brilliant than the one encompassing Alexander, filled the doorway. The Romans apart from Brutus averted their eyes and Alexander began to bulge. He grew larger and larger like a sack filling with water before exploding into brown mist. Scorching hot dried blood showered the Library front.

Cicero and Cato turned to Brutus inquisitively. ""Bane of Undead,"" he explained. ""I found it when I visited briefly yesterday.""

Just as he finished speaking, the first boom repeated, this time obliterating the western wall. The Romans were left undefended and flanked, various scholars including the all-seeing wizard stood dumbly in the open.

From the dust strode confidently a young, yet stern figure bearing a sword and spellbook. His crimson attire suited his apparent intentions. He locked eyes with the Romans and began rapidly approaching with heavy and resounding footfalls.

""H-how..."" stammered Brutus.

""That can't be..."" Cicero muttered.

The man walked unopposed across the Library, brushing past the shocked scholars and stopping only a few feet from Brutus' face. Level to each other, they stared with silent fury. Brutus opened his mouth to speak but nothing emerged.

Then, beside the royal figure appeared an equally regal man, slightly older and more grizzled, but still budding and new compared to Brutus and Cato. This ripped Brutus' attention away from the younger man, and he began to stammer as the stranger withdrew an elegant dagger from his robes.

[WP] You randomly remember how you died in your past life because of a visual trigger,clothes_are_optional,"I’m standing in front of Gibby’s Sweet Treats window with my little boy, Mattie. He’s vigorously pointing at the chocolate display; it’s almost as tall as he is, with lines of tiny squares of white and milk chocolates in an outstretched pyramid. I lift him up so he can see it closer and say in his ear “That’s what Daddy and I had at our wedding.”

Then I think back to Mark’s and my wedding; we only had lemon wedding cake and coffee. Mark’s grandmother thought that a spring wedding should have light foods, not chocolate. 

Then I think back further, to a wedding where I was the groom. Opposite a young bride with peachy lips and swollen eyes. I shake my head hard, throwing my hair in Mattie’s face. He shrieks and giggles. 

There were trays of chocolates, built up in stacks like bricks. The cook, Edna, built them up like gold. I don’t know if she ever had chocolate before. I don’t remember much about her. Her wrinkled hands, the color of spoiled chocolate, handed me a glass of whiskey before she brought out more wine for the reception.
 
Mattie taps on the glass; he wants to go inside and ravage the display and stuff his stomach with chocolate. I ask him “Have you been a good boy today?” He nods and I nod back.

I was the pride and joy of my father; he wouldn’t listen to any talk of me sleeping with Negro girls. My young wife’s father thought the same; she should be happy with me, a highschool track star and salutatorian of my class, the assistant director of the port’s commercial shipping post. 

I remember standing in the kitchen, whiskey in hand, reaching for a chocolate when pain I’ve never seen exploded on my skull. My eyes open, my face tilts up, and I see Sadie’s father, a bent over black man break my whiskey bottle on my face. 

Mattie starts crying, hands still pressed to the glass. I can taste the glass and alcohol burn.

[WP] You randomly remember how you died in your past life because of a visual trigger,clothes_are_optional,"I really wish I hadn’t come over to his house today.  I wanted to stay home in bed all day doing nothing, but I just had to answer my phone.  I had to say, yes I’d come over and play video games.  Ken was just trying to be a good friend.  He knew I’ve been in a slump, and was trying to pull me out, even if he didn’t know *why* I was in a slump.  But I’m getting ahead of myself.


The real trouble all started with that blasted hypnotist that was behind on his rent.  I wish I’d had never met him, but if I hadn’t I wouldn’t have been doing my job.  Just like he wasn’t doing his; if he had been he would have been able to afford his rent.  Four weeks ago, I was sent to his apartment to find out why he hadn’t been paying his rent.  It was a shabby little ground level dwelling that had been converted into a storefront location.  A faded and ripped green awning covered dirty windows.  Despite the bright sunny day outside, it was a gloomy dreary interior.  


“Greetings esteemed guest!” the idiot hypnotist in a purple getup said as soon as I stepped in.  His outfit looked like someone had inhaled a section of the goodwill store and vomited up a costume.  The whole room was coated in a thick dust that I’m sure was giving me a lung infection just from standing there.  The hypnotist slumped against the wall as soon as I explained that I was bill collector not a customer.  


“It’s just not fair!”  He whined at me, his ugly purple turban slipping slightly.  “I’m working myself out of a job!  I keep helping people find fortunes from a past life, and as soon as I do they no longer need me.”


Don’t care.  Doesn’t matter me.  I’m just a bill collector.  That’s what I told him, that’s what I should have stuck to, but my goddamned curiosity got the better of me.  I asked how what he meant.  


“I’m a hypnotist!  Can’t you tell?”  He said as he gestured around his store.  Like somehow the crap around him would give me a clue as to what he did.  It was a bunch of useless junk he probably bought at a Pier 1 closing sale.  


He continued, “I can put your mind into an altered state that allows you to breach the dimensions of time.  You’ll be able to see into the lives of the past.  When someone dies, they are immediately reborn into a new body, but the connection lingers.  My hypnosis allows you to lift the veil and see what happened in the past life.”


I didn’t see how this led others to riches.  Sounds like a lot of nonsense.

The idiot hypnotist told me that in a past life I might have been the keeper of a great treasure, or might have buried money somewhere on the edge of town and only now I could recover it.  


“I tell you what,” he said, “just try a hypnosis session.  I’ll make you a deal, I’ll give you a free session if you forgive my overdue rent.”


I had no control over his bills, I’m just the collector.  But I could let him off the hook for a month in exchange for a session.  It seemed like fraud, but at least would give me a good story to tell the boys at the bar.


“We’ve got a deal!” he exclaimed.  He had me lie down on a stained couch and told me to relax.  How was I supposed to relax when this couch was getting my work clothes all dirty?  No one’s going to respect a bill collector in stained clothes!  He brought over a stone urn with a purple powder in it.  With a quick wave of his hand - and a bit of help from his bic lighter - he lit the contents and an acrid purple smoke filled the air.  


The last thing I remembered after that was him assuring me that this smoke wouldn’t make me fail my next piss test.  I didn’t need my parole officer hounding my ass because of this moron.  I woke up a few hours later on his couch expecting my head to be killing me.  Strangely, it felt the clearest it had in months.  Everything seemed sharper.  


“Well done.  You’ve connected with your past self.”  He told me. “Soon windows to the past will open up.  You’ll know them by their bright purple shimmer.”


Yeah right.  What a crock of shit, but at least I got a good nap out of the deal.  That’s what
 I thought anyway at the time.  Until the first incident happened a few days later.  My job took me down to the docks along the river’s edge.  I had just successfully collected a debt on a dock worker that had been evading me for months, and feeling pretty good, I treated myself to a nacho cheese and chili dog with a root beer float.  


I was munchin’ on that dog and feeling pretty good staring into the summer sun reflected in the river when something weird happened.  It started as a small purple shimmer that slowly grew into a big hazy ring.  Inside of that hazy ring was another view.  It was like a big television appeared over the water just for me to watch.  I saw young boy with gangly limbs, fire red hair and smattering of freckles playing in the water.  I know that boy.  He grew up in the south and this was his favorite place to play in the summer. That boy was me!  Sonofabitch, that hypnotist was telling the truth.  It did work, and I was seeing myself.  A past self anyway.  A different life.  All because the river of today reminded me of the river of yesterday.  


Watching that past boy, I could remember everything; the ramshackle house we lived in  that leaked rain, my momma that loved me, my daddy that drank too much until he disappeared, the girl next door I used to spy on.  But mostly I remembered the feel of that river and how cool it was on a summer day.  


Then I saw one of the bigger boys swimming in the river.  I wanted to be that bigger boy and all that entailed.  He kept jumping into the water doing cannonballs and getting attention from the cute girl next door.  I had to one up him and prove I was the tougher boy, so I challenged him to a swimming contest.  Whoever could make it the furthest upstream would win.  I remember the feelings of my arms burning in pain, but the love of that girl spurning me ever onward.  My lungs, my real lungs in the modern day gasped as the boy of the past dipped beneath the waves and gulped a lungful of water.  The boy of the past turned blue and cold, his lips were so still.  

Jesus christ, that’s how I died!  The purple haze faded and the vision went away.  My rootbeer float took on a nasty taste and I threw it away in disgust.  That was the first vision, and since then they’ve becoming almost every day.  The next vision came at an antiques shop when I looked at an old cutlass.  A vision opened up of an old battlefield in the civil war.  Lucky me!  I got to see the battle of Chickamauga Battlefield first hand in way no one else has.  It was great up until I saw my past self stabbed in the face by a sword.  I haven’t shaved since then.  


Later, I had hoped to calm my nerves at the local watering hole.  I ordered a bottle of sherry.  A few drinks should make me feel better, right?  Well, turned out that a past self died from drinking prohibition moonshine laced with turpentine and other shit.  Let me tell you, vomiting up blood is not a pretty way to die.  


The next vision was at a construction site watching my past self fall off a scaffolding during the construction boom of the 20s. 


But not all past deaths were violent or shocking.  No, far from it.  Every night when I go home and go to bed, the sight of bed is enough to conjure up one of the fourteen different past selves that have passed peacefully in their sleep.


Which brings me back to today.  I couldn’t take any more visions.  I couldn’t take any more deaths.  I was going to stay home and do nothing, until my buddy called me.  


“Hey man!  Come play some video games!  I just got the latest Super Car Jacker game, and it’s just awesome.”


I told him no, I just wanted to be alone.


“Oh man, I’ve got a 24 pack in the fridge.  Drink with me and let’s steal some cars!” 


Oh fine.  It seemed safe.  After all, video games are a new thing, right?  How could I get a vision of the past from a video game?  I acquiesced and went over.  Video games these days are pretty realistic.  I’m in awe as we take our virtual character in a tour around the city.  I’m so in awe, that when it’s my turn to play I don’t even notice a passing bus when I step off the street corner, and die in game.  


Just like my past self did in the 1950s.  I have a feeling this life is going to end in a fire with me killing an idiot hypnotist.  ",EtanSivad

Of course he did. The unexpected sight was taking a little longer to get accustomed to than he planned. Well, as far as any plan a quest could have, really. Just, set the sword against it's throat, drive it in, cue songs for the ages.  
Fairly simple steps.  
""Whest!""  
""Lets come back later.""  
The lance slipped from her hand, clanging over the citadel floor. ""You cannot be serious.""  
""Of course he isn't,"" said their healer. ""Leader, finish the quest.""  
""We will. When it's awake.""  
Now the healer's throat was growing taut with impatience. ""How do you expect us to just, *pass* on this opportunity?!""  
Whest turned to the stout medicine man, not entirely sure where to begin. They were mistaking his patience for mercy. Or honor.  
There were more important things to Whest.  
""We did not expect the Defiler to be sleeping in this prophetic site."" His voice carried over the citadel. ""But we cannot slay him now. He will wake. We will be there when it happens.""  
Defender Bars and Sage Marko remained silent, observing the spectacle before them. Not the exchange between Whest and his two naysayers, but the creature that laid dormant. Whest couldn't blame them either. This was one of the last things any of them expected to see.  
Even Whest.  
""We will return by nightfall.""  
Helda stood her ground. ""It slayed a *hundred* villages!""  
""Gather your things.""   
His tone brooked no argument.  
Begrudgingly, the Lancer, Healer, Defender and Sage followed suit. None of them knew the battle lust Whest carried with him these past two weeks. This may be the last Great battle to be recorded within the Kingdom. He would not be denied a glorious story to be told.  
His songs for the ages.  
Not even by the sleeping Defiler itself.  
A resistant company stalked from the citadel, the lingering deed looming behind their steps.  

---------------------------

Four hundred and twenty three heartbeats later, the Defiler opened it's eyes slowly.  
Scanning the citadel was difficult without being able to move a muscle, but the creature made do.  
After confirming his solitude, the creature brushed to its knees, clasping its hands together...  
... and prayed.  
""Christ,"" it spoke in the solitude. ""Thank you for your protection, your providence, *whatever* it was, *thank you!* Those bastards have been chasing the wrong guy! Please, please please please don't let them catch me awake.""  
The creature sobbed in it's pleas. ""Please don't let *him* catch me awake, I'm good! I wouldn't so much as hurt a fly!""  
In the pathetic cries that echoed through the citadel, it passed out once more, only to be left sleeping for a thousand years.  
Much to the annoyance of Leader Whest later that evening.  ",Galokot

[WP] Try and sell me the stupidest thing that you could possibly think of.,TigerBroseff,"""A tub of elbow grease, only $2.99.""  
""What?"" The word popped out of me like an accusation. ""What could I use with a tub of elbow grease?""  
The salesman nodded. ""The applications are---""  
""I mean, what is that, what even *is* that?""  
I couldn't help myself from cutting him off. It was the actual question I meant to ask.  
Again, the salesman nodded like he understood. ""I'm glad you asked. It's applications are incredibly diverse. Roll up your sleeves for a moment.""  
Reluctantly, I did as he asked. ""See? They're perfectly fine.""  
""Not in twenty decades they will be. Ever seen an old woman lift anything?""  
""Of course not! They're old!""   
What was he getting at? This was the stupidest thing I ever heard.    
He nodded once more. ""It's not their knees, but their arms that make it hard to lift the things they need to. Even then, it's not *just* the arms."" The salesman held out two hands, palms turned upwards. ""Your elbows grind and wear as knees do. Without proper lubrication or maintenance, you may not get to hold your grandchildren.""  
""I'm 20!""  
""And you'll look back on today and wonder what could have changed.""  
This was too much, I barely started my sophomore year. What was the point in guilt tripping me with kids I didn't even have?  
I told him as much.  
Finally, the salesman grinned for the first time. ""The price of a few bottles of soda, to give your elbows the insurance policy they deserve. Snap them forward.""  
My arms did so under his command. I was never conscious of the bones aligning themselves, the cap shifting under them. It felt foreign. Different.  
""I can't protect your knees. But when your grandchildren squeal with delight as they soar in your arms, you'll remember today. A tub of elbow grease, only $2.99. Do we have a deal, /u/TigerBroseff?""

[WP] At birth everybody receives a necklace that will glow when they get near their soulmate/perfect partner. You're a college student studying abroad when suddenly yours starts to shine for the first time.,DwightAllRight,"We boarded the plane, and took off.  
Every couple years, my wife and I take a trip to Italy. This has been tradition since I studied abroad there my first summer. My expectations were no greater than my grades back then; learn the language, try a few bars, get some memories to look back on in my 9-5 job god knows where.  
A simple plan for an adventurous summer.  
Then I had to go and take the wrong bus.  
The districts started to become shabbier. Nothing like the pamphlets I saw at the internship fair a few months before. Not that it was poverty-stricken or by any means terrible. The neighborhoods were just more foreign, less globalized, more... traditional, as far as the word makes sense to me. I was just a Kansas boy.  
A Topeka tomcat who's gem shone for the first time.  
I ditched the bus as it moved. Ribs bruised and legs aching from the jump, I followed the intensity of my gem. From glimmer, to glow, to shine. My eyes were no where else.  
A foreign girl? My soul mate? Not what I was expecting. Not from my simple plan. But I imagined what she'd look like. How gorgeous she might be. We would make the most of it.   
Then my gem cracked. It means she, hell, or even he, was here. I tore my eyes from the remnants, and looked around.  
My heart broke for the first time in my young life in that moment. Our teachers warned us this could happen, but it was a one in a million. I lost the lottery.    
My soulmate was Aida. Her tombstone read that she passed away a few months prior to my getting here. I'd have brought flowers, but, how was I to know?  
I kneeled at her tombstone and asked her as well; how was I supposed to know?  
I don't know how long I kneeled at that tombstone, with my gem shards glittered over her resting place. But a soft hand fell on my shoulder. I turned to see a girl my age, with this sad look in her eyes say something in Italian. Two, simple words.  
*You too?*  
So every couple years, my wife and I take a trip to Italy. This was tradition. We'd visit the cemetery and give our respects. Our marriage was one of companionship, but we don't tell our child that. Not until he's old enough to understand.  
*Understand what dad?* He'll ask me one day.  
My wife rested against me as our plane was taking preparations to land. I watched Italy ascend towards me. This view. This country, where I would take him one day when he's older. And I'll tell him, ""*Our soulmates may sometimes be a little further than we expect. But never beyond our reach, if you don't mind traveling.*""

"[WP] In a world where eye color changes based on mood, tell me the story of someone with a mental disorder.",dragondraems42,"""Ms. Thomas, do you know why you're in my office?""  
I started to fidget, begging myself not to make a sound. This was my first time at the principal's. If I got through this quietly, my perfect record won't be ruined.  
Just had to keep quiet. I *know* I didn't do anything wrong.  
""It's rude not to answer a question Ms. Thomas.""  
So much for that.    
""No ma'am, I don't.""  
She looked grave behind that massive desk of hers. Or it might have been how her cheeks sagged. Whether she was frowning or unsettled, I couldn't tell. As long as I kept pleasant, Principal Heather will let me go.  
""Well,"" the principal started, ""I don't know what it is you're smiling about. But Jack Piles told me over lunch break that you were bullying him.""  
""No!"" I shouted it before I could understand what she said. So much for getting a recommendation from her, but me? Bullying *Jack?!*   
""Calm down, it's not as bad as you think."" It didn't sound reassuring coming from her, but when a teacher--- no, when a *principal* tells you you're bullying the boy you like, you can't stop thinking about it, and guessing yourself, and wonder what you said, and---  
""Take a breath Ms. Thomas."" My lungs filled, then released. Suddenly my head didn't feel so light. ""Good. Now tell me your side.""  
The school yard an hour ago.  
""I asked Jack if I could talk with him a moment.""  
""That's it?"" She asked.  
""Of course n--- No ma'am."" Reign it in Lisa, this isn't the club room. ""He followed me to the tables at the back and asked what was up. When he finished getting his words out, I--- Jeez Mrs. Heather, it wasn't anything bad.""  
Like hell I was going to tell her what I told him.  
""Ms. Thomas, you're here because you're accused of *bullying.*"" I decided she was frowning under those cheeks. ""We have a zero tolerance rule about that, if the weekly school assemblies fail to *jog your memory.*""  
""I know, I'm there every week,"" I said. ""But... can I talk with him first, get Jack to clear this up?""  
Jack *had* to clear this up.   
""No. You could shut him up from ever talking with a teacher again. I won't risk that. Now you *tell me* what you told him an hour ago.""  
A smolder flared in her eyes. I didn't think blues could be so red, but sometimes when dad's team loses... or when Benji's giving a speech in class...  
It hurt to watch.   
I made some noises.  
""What was that Ms. Thomas?""  
I sighed.  
""I told him his eyes were beautiful.""  
The principal's own returned to a familiar, stern blue. ""Oh Lisa.""  
I blushed. It was my first time trying to ask out a boy, but the way he looked at me... That rainbow swirl spiraling at me. Through me. It was all I could say.  
When he ran, I thought he was embarrassed. I was fine with him being shy.  
But...  
""Take a handkerchief Ms. Thomas.""  
I ripped a tissue from her desk and wiped my cheeks.  
""I'm sorry this happened. As I said, it wasn't as bad as you thought, but you made me believe otherwise for a moment there."" The principal smirked like a teenager. ""Wouldn't have thought our theater club president was in---""   
""*Don't say it Ms. Heather!*""  
It was too much. I couldn't have her making fun of me.   
The principal's tone was lighter. ""Just making conversation Lisa. Look, I don't think you meant anything by it. But with Jack's needs, it's easy for his peers to point at his eyes and tell him he's special needs."" Her tone became somber. ""It's not his fault though. The boy's a high-functioning---""  
""Please, don't.""  
She crooked an eyebrow. ""It's good you're eager to speak, but I don't like being interrupted either.""  
""I know, but..."" How was I going to tell her this without sounding like an idiot? ""He's Jack the math nerd with the rainbow eyes to me. I want to find out the rest myself.""  
An old hand took mine on the desk and gave it a soft squeeze. ""Alright Ms. Thomas. Do you want to explain what happened to him then?""  
Principal Heather did a poor job masking her grin. She knew what she meant by that question.  
My face flushed again. ""I think I can handle it.""  
She laughed, making herself comfortable in the large chair. ""Do your best then. And good luck!""  
I got up and made my way out as fast as I could, putting the last five minutes behind me.  
Tried to, anyway.  
*Do your best then.*

[WP] You're a hit-man hired for a high-profile case but only given an address: 123 Sesame Street.,ElectricSkeletor,"Diary,  

I got quite a few hits under my belt. Some names you wouldn't believe. As a hit-man, I take pride in getting the job done. No matter who or where. Bragging rights don't usually come with the territory, but no one's going to read this anyway.    
The jobs always ended without gratitude. Without justice. For my rate, I can live without them.  
So my latest job came in the mail. Three lines.  
*Sesame Street.*  
No part of town I ever heard of, but the two million advance in my account made me a believer. The target even had a gang name.  
*Big Bird.*  
Who was this guy, to have such a price on his head? Or, *her* head? I mean, we were talking a politician or a conglomerate executive's rate. This punk could be anyone.  
*Two million more when you're done.*    
On *top* of the advance. Someone knew how I worked before I could tell them. So no one wanted any questions from a hit-man. They just wanted the job done. With my smarts, I also read the lines.  
If they didn't want any questions, they wanted this done quietly too. No stickies under the car, no busting out the ol' rocket launcher... just a pistol to the head when the world's gone to sleep. Nice and quiet.  
Without a deadline, I could take my time with this one. At least, until my new boss sets one, or this Big Bird is done in.  
For now, I gotta blend in, be part of the gang. A bunch of freaks if you ask me, but for two million *more*... This had to be a clean job.  
So, make myself unassuming. When the gang boss is whacked, I make my get away. They put me at the bottom of the suspects list, I take that time to leave.  
It's all about timing. Hell, without justice or gratitude, I only *had* time left.  
And money.  
*And a target.*  
Now, tell me diary. How many bullets will it take to end this Big Bird of Sesame Street?  
*One?*  
You got it kiddo.

[WP] You're sitting in a therapist's room after years and years of being the Grim Reaper. You've got a lot to get off your chest.,processthePROGRESS,"Doctor Greene, this job is going to be the death of me.   
It's a dying practice, working behind the scenes. No one appreciates me except the old, the decrepit or the weirdos. Several times I wanted to just, check out, you know?   
So here I am. Getting help. Again.     
Doc, the job post said there'd be some laughs. That's what I thought when they told me I'd be working with comedians in this business. But I was dead wrong. Fresh out of college, how was I supposed to know?   
A morbid sense of humor, those producers.     
Some millenia into the gig, a vacation was decided. War told me to relax, he'd cover me and handle the backstage work. So I departed for Coney Island. Snacked on hot dogs, rode a Ferris wheel... tried to lift my spirits a little bit. Not much helped.  
Then I lost track of the time. Four years. Just like that, my vacation ended.   
War was busy while I was away. I tagged in and got to work.   
So much clean up. Transitioning between big scenes is hard.    
See, it's not the mortality that gets to me. Not the number of productions, the local talent, the fellow stagehands (I know, not even Pestilence).    
It's the *time.* Sure, souls leave *when* they're meant to, but that doesn't mean I know the year. Or the day. The Director decides the *when*. I just make sure his vision carries through.      
I can't tell you enough about the stress. This job isn't all theater cues and exits. You don't get bonus points for efficiency or stage management. Unless you're War, but that's beside the point.   
No, being Death? The Grim Reaper? The curtains close for the actors, and the audience applauds the life portrayed on stage. It's always the Director and the actors who get thanked. Never for you, the production team. For all *time.* 
Damn the ingratitude, I might be a little depressed.   
It's ungratifying work.  
Speaking of time, it looks like we're out. So we'll part ways for now. I'm due for another vacation in a couple years. War told me he could get me another four years so I can travel.    
Maybe visit some relatives in Japan.  
Wouldn't that be a blast.

[WP] You got really drunk last night and now you have your own book published on Amazon.,IStruggleWithThings,"Everything was fuzzy. The blankets, my bare mattress, my thoughts... like a cotton ball tore through whatever was left of me from last night. Along with my memory. Shit, everything was just, thirsty. A glass of water.  
I made to get up, but the floor wouldn't let me. It bucked and rocked under my feet, which made it difficult to cross the room for a glass of water. This was easily one of my worst hangovers.   
Not, November 2011 worst. I tipped the hotel staff very well that morning. No, this was graduation night worst. Distinct taste of glory with a subtle aftertaste of shame.  
What the hell was I doing last thirsty?  
Oh right, the glass of water. I made to get up again. No luck.  
So I'll call out for my roommate.

It came out as ""pEEe-tuh.""  
Close enough.  
The room thundered with a door slamming open. I hoped it was mine. Peter could get me a---  
""Asshole. You're awake huh?""  
Definitely my door, but, was he talking to me? A quick scan through the bedroom confirmed I was the only other person there.

[WP] Why have you not opened the door in front of you?,Laxaria,"Every time I open my door, I can see the one across the hall. It's covered in pictures poorly taped to the surface. All of them cats. My sister really loves cats. She even has a chalk board in the shape of a cat head hanged up. 'Casey.' That's what's written on it. That and a bunch of doodles of hearts.

I haven't been in there in a long time. It used to be that I would go on there nearly every day. She had such a better sense of style than me. I liked the way her dresses fit. She used to get so mad and argue that I'm just trying to steal her life, but it wasn't like that. I just thought they looked better on me, and I liked the compliments that I got at school.

My mom went in there last week. It was a few hours after she and Casey got into a huge argument. It was something big, but I didn't want to be a part of it. I needed to study for my test. It was probably about grades, now that I think about it. Mine were always good, but I'm pretty sure Casey was failing out of school.

She had slammed the door to her room and didn't come out. That night, I heard a loud bang. It woke me up, but I didn't know what it was. When I opened the door, my mom was coming out of her room. She told me that they were just talking and that things were going to be a lot better.

The next morning, my door was blocked by a big box. It was full of Casey's clothes. Mom told me that I could wear them if I wanted to. She also told me that I didn't have to study so hard in school if I found it bothersome. Whatever grades I could manage were okay. Casey didn't come out for breakfast that day. She didn't go to school. I guess it didn't matter, since no one asked about her. That day, a guy I liked complimented my perfume. It was something Casey had left out in our bathroom.

When I went home that night, mom told me that Casey had left. She thinks it would be better for us if she lived with dad. He went away a few years ago, and I hadn't heard from him since. I don't even know how Casey or mom was able to get in contact with him. Mom made me fried chicken with sweet mashed potatoes for dinner. That was one of Casey's favorite meals when we were kids.

But every morning, I wake up and see that door. I wonder why she would've left the pictures behind. They were all printouts from the internet. I guess she could always print some more. Sometimes I even put my hand on the door, but I always change my mind. That, and I can always hear mom walking around. Somehow I think going in there now would make her angry.

Maybe I'll open the door tomorrow. There were so many things she left behind, and there was a pair of earrings she had that I really liked. Maybe she wouldn't mind if I borrowed them. Every time I think to go in there, I change my mind. The reason why I don't open that door, is that I'm pretty sure that Casey never left home. And I don't want to see what sort of face she'll make at me once she catches me sneaking into her room again.",fauxkit

[WP] The reason no one has heard an animal speak is because every animal on the earth is playing a prank on humans. You discover this today.,V_j1109,"I couldn't believe they would fire me from work. Five years of good service, and they decided to outsource my whole department to a different country. What am I going to tell my mom? She was always telling me that working IT would be a dead end job. I also hope my girlfriend wasn't expecting a good birthday present.

My only consolation is that I have my two cats. Stella is a russian blue who showed up at my door one day. She hasn't bothered to leave ever since. Hershel is this big, orange tabby. My sister got him as a gift from her boyfriend, but he didn't bother to check that she wasn't allergic.

As I come to the door, I pause. It's almost as though I can hear voices on the other side. Hopefully it wasn't a robbery, but I couldn't be to sure. I press my ear against the door and give a listen.

""He's gone! He's gone forever! He's gone and he's not coming back!"" A male voice was on the other side of the door. It seemed like he was moving around the room, but I couldn't hear footsteps.

""You do this every day."" A feminine voice cooed back. I could tell she was further off, and tapping at the laptop I so foolishly left on the coffee table. ""He's coming back. He always comes back.""

""But what are we going to do about dinner?!""

""If you're that concerned about it, we'll just kill him next time he comes back. We'll eat like the Egyptian gods that we are for the next few days and go to another place. If you just show up at their door without a collar on, they'll take you in without any problem.""

Now I just felt confused. I fumbled for my keys and thrust open the door. Hershel jumped up on the shelf I kept nearby, bumping his head against mine and purring loudly. Stella was on my couch, lying on her side and not giving a shit if I was here or not. I looked over to my laptop, closed and seemingly unused.

""... So... Were you guys alone today?""

Near silence, with the exception of Hershel's purring. I lock the door behind me and look between them both again. ""Because I could've sworn that I heard talking."" Hershel continued to butt heads with me, but I kept my eyes on Stella. It was faint, but there it was. A slight flick of the tip of her tail. She always did that whenever I did something to annoy her.

""Were you guys just talking to each other? Is that what you do all day?"" Hershel stumbled forward, slipping off the shelf in the process. He flailed through the air and fell to the ground. There he did an odd thing where he turned away from me, preening. Licking himself clean as though he were not filled full of any guilt at all. ""... Hershel."" I kneel to the ground and poked him in the back of the head. ""Hershel, I'm always going to come back. You'll never have to worry about not getting dinner.""

""He knows! Oh god! He KNOOOOOOWWS!"" Hershel wailed while moving his head back and forth in a panic. I let out a shriek of my own and stumbled backwards. ""What are we going to DOOOOO?!""

""Calm down."" Stella replied, sitting up and licking her at the back of her paw. This made me let out another panicked shout. ""You lost the job and things haven't been that great with your girlfriend. You're obviously having a mental breakdown.""

How did she know?! I take a sharp breath to calm myself and realize that I needed to talk less about my problems to my cats. ""Right. This isn't a mental breakdown."" My eyes dart to the laptop I could've sworn I heard Stella using. ""I can prove it."" I move over and flip the monitor out. It pops out of sleep mode and I put in my password. Next I go over everything, but there was nothing unusual open. My save game files were intact, and my internet browser history hadn't been cleared.

""While you're there, you should probably look up signs of schizophrenia. It seems like you've got a really bad case."" Stella cooed again, tapping her paw against my shoulder in a form of consolation.

""Google is run by pigeons! Incognito browsing was invented to protect our secret! All of us can talk!""

I slowly turn my head towards Hershel, and catch of glimpse of Stella. Her gold eyes had narrowed and her claws were slightly extended out as though she were straining herself from slapping him. ""Yes. Because that completely makes sense."" I state in a calm manner. It didn't actually make sense, but I didn't want to be in the wrong here. I did not want to be less correct than the creature who spends no less than five hours a day making sure his butthole is at it's pinkest clean.

""He's crazy. Just deal with it.""

""He's not crazy!"" Hershel waddled his fat self over and crawled into my lap. ""He's fine! He's fine and perfect in any way."" There wasn't much I could say at this point, so I just continued to stare between the two of them.

""Look."" It was Stella that broke the tense silence. ""How do you want to approach this? We can actually talk? That all animals can talk? That the faint whispers you sometimes hear at night are actually the spiders singing to their prey? That when you think you hear someone call your name despite being all alone, that it was actually one of us? You're mad. Your life sucks right now, and you're trying to come up with a mental escape so you don't have to deal with it.""

""Schizophrenia is a condition invented by the monkey people in laboratories!"" Hershel spoke out in protest.

My hand reached for the phone in my pocket and idled there. I didn't know what to do. Stella was right, no one would believe me. Hershel may be an idiot, but what if he could actually talk? Do I call a doctor? The media? I didn't know what the best action would be right here.

""It's a lot to go over right now. Go to the kitchen and have a beer. Take a nap afterwards. Pretend that none of this never happened, and live a much fuller life."" Stella purred.

She was right. First I make sure that there is at least some food in their bowls. Hershel thanks me politely before scoffing down as much of the kibble as he can in a loud manner. Stella waits patiently by her food, eyeing me as I go to the fridge and get my beer. I don't drink it. Instead I place it on dresser of my room as I enter it and lock the door behind me.

I try to sleep, but it's hard for me to do so. Faintly, I can hear the tapping of my laptop coming from the living room. Voices as well. It seemed as though the two were talking again.

""Why can't we tell him the truth? I like him, he can be trusted. He's our friend!""

""Humans aren't friends."" Stella let out a snarl. ""Just relax. I'll find a way to take him out. Whether it's a mental hospital or death. Death, preferably. I am a goddess and I deserve fresh meat."" She pauses for a moment, as though reflecting on it. ""Finding new homes will be easy. You just show up at their door and they take you right in. Humans are so loving like that. They wouldn't be if they knew the truth.""

I grab the remote from my nightstand and turn on the television. I don't watch it, but I do turn on the volume. The blanket is pulled over my head and I breath slowly the air around me as it becomes warmer and warmer. I'm crazy. I'm definitely crazy. Tomorrow I'm going to wake up and everything will be normal. Maybe I'll get some fish from the store. Stella does like her meat.",fauxkit
"[WP] We can't start this legend at the very beginning, for the very beginning is lost in the void beyond memory, so we start with a man, a woman and an important story. They were the ones who lived.",aaronwb,"It didn't matter why it happened. It could've been aliens from above or demons from below. It could've been magic or man's hubris. To many, it may have mattered that the world was nearly over. But that was before they themselves had died. What mattered to June was her father's last words.

""Go save your brother.""

Time passed, cities crumbled. The pair had set up at their old family cabin. There was a lake nearby, and plenty of fish. But for Jared, that didn't matter at all.

""We have to go out there."" The teenager stated, poking at his baked potato with a fork. ""There has to be other people out there. I'm not going to spend the rest of my life thinking that we're alone out here.""

June scowled from her seat, furrowing her brow. ""Humanity is gone. There wasn't even electricity when we got here. We don't need to go over what happened again. We have each other, and that's what counts."" She had lost just as much as Jared had. No classes, no more parties, no more friends. The five year age gap between them meant that she had never really gotten close to her brother either. Yet here they were. And as far as she knew, they were the only two who made it through this.

""We'll just have to go and keep on going. We can put up messages that other travelers can find. Tell them to go to a spot and wait there. If there isn't anyone in America, we can go to Canada. Maybe find a boat and go to Asia, or Europe! We can't spend the rest of our lives like this!""

""It would be better if you could learn to catch a rabbit.""

""I'm serious, June!"" Jared cried out. ""If this world is going to stand a chance, we are going to have to band together with other people!""

""This world has never needed people."" June stood up to grab the radio from the kitchen counter. This she started to wind up. ""The world will move on without us. Someday, billions of years from now, a new race of sentients may come out of this. And you know what they're going to say? These humans are idiots.""

""So you're saying we should just give up?""

""I'm not saying that other people aren't out there. We're scattered. We don't even know if we can survive with others, or what they're going to be like."" She turned on the radio, turning it up so that Jared could hear the static coming from it. ""I'm saying humanity is gone. We just need to accept that."" Her finger went to move the tuning dial. ""We still have to prep for the winter farming. Go out there and plant the squash seeds if you're not going to eat your potato.""

Jared growled at his sister, standing up and shoving his chair back into place. It bounced off the table and clattered loudly to the floor. He didn't bother to pick it up. Instead he took long strides so that he could make sure to slam the door loudly behind him as he left.

June let out a sigh and wondered momentarily regretted how difficult she was at that age. If only she could take a moment to tell her dad how sorry she was for every time she told him to go fuck off. She was not fine on her own. She really could use him right now. As she moved to pick up the chair, the static on the radio started to flicker louder.

""h-Hello?"" A soft voice called out over the muddled sounds. June dropped the chair in surprise and took a step away from the table. ""Look, lately there's been a lot of things happening. But... I really mean this. If there is anyone else out there, I need you to listen closely...""",fauxkit
[WP] You've tamed the giant spider that knocked your Internet out and are now using him as a mount,Syraphia,"If I could have any country conquer my homeland of Australia, it would be South Korea. And by the Queen, would I hope that they bring their internet speeds with them.

It isn't easy living in the land the rest of the world calls 'down under.' I can hardly download a porno. Hell, maybe it's on purpose. I'd probably torrent more games, considering how it's eighty dollarydoos for the latest shit. Don't even get me started on what we have available on Netflix.

For now, all I can think is how I'm fuming at this essay. I need to email it to my professor by twenty-one hundred hours, and the damn net keeps kicking me off and detaching my attachments. First, I curse out my prime minister, and next I make my way towards the router. There I see the problem.

There appears to be a spider. Just there. Chilling on top of my router. Quite a large cunt, at that. People always make fun of how big spiders are here, but this one is literally the size of my computer desk, it is. I'm not even sure how I didn't notice it. They say that there's always a spider within a meter of you, but what do you do when that spider is at least three meters wide?

""Oi."" I pick up a a shoe and toss it at the creature. ""Shoo..?"" It doesn't budge at all. I return to my desk and start to look up ways to remove a spider from your home.

Put a paper under it and shoo it under a cup. Then release it outside.

Tis a noble plan. I get a newspaper and lay it flat on the floor, then use a mop to nudge it below the creature. Next I find a cu- ... Bucket. Next I find a bucket and place it on the spider's head. It just sits there. There with it's bucket head. The multitude of black eyes stare at me in an unblinking fashion. I put my foot on the newspaper and move it back and forth, but that also doesn't appear to phase it.

Next plan. Squash it. No, not cleaning up that mess. Play music at it?

I dig out an old radio and plug it into the wall. Switching through the channels, I finally get a reaction when a song from the eighties comes on. Let's just say that it's a song by Men at Work, and it is my least favorite song of them all. End of sentence. But the swaying tones make the creature saunter side to side, the bucket on its head moving to and fro as it moves. Is it possible that this thing is tamable?

The front door of my flat is opened, and I roll up a sheet so that it's somewhat like a rope. This I place under the creatures head. Then, as carefully as I can, I clamber onto the arachnid's back. Nothing. It actually seems quite fine with this, really. A kick of my feet and a subtle pull of the sheet, and the spider starts making its way through my door.

This actually isn't that bad. Maybe I'll even keep the fellow. Don't know what to feed him though. Do you think he'll enjoy some Maccas?",fauxkit
"[WP] Upon graduation from the University of Magic, each student is allowed to take one tome from the Arcane Library which immediately bestows all its knowledge onto the owner. You discover a tome that seems to have been overlooked.",laxnut90,"By the fabulous gray beard hairs of Dumbledore, was I running fucking late. It wasn't my fault, I was held up at graduation. My parents wanted to congratulate me. My aunt was there. She wouldn't stop pinching my cheeks until literal roses popped out of them. Now what was there going to be left at the library.

One book. That's all we get. One book.

Ultimate knowledge, in any field of your choosing! Sure, studying at the University of Magic had it's merits and all. But what you studied didn't matter at all. After all, my own degree was a focus on the psychology of mythical creatures. No one gives a shit of what your degree is though. We all chose this school because of the library.

Any book. Any subject. Textbooks all around. You're allowed to select one tome and instantly become a master of the arts. One of my dorm mates said they were thinking about joining the police force after this. They were going to try to nab a text on the fighting arts. My other mate was grabbing a book on engineering. He said that technology at at certain point was indistinguishable from magic. He could enter the human field and find ways of spreading magic all over the world.

As for me? I have no fucking clue.

Four years to figure out something. What was I going to do with my life? I spent high school buried in Harry Potter books, thinking that it was just a bunch of bullshit. If only our classes were like that. Wingardium levimyassa. The most exciting thing that happened was when the football team turned the janitor into a hamster and shoved him up the quarterback's rectum. It took a week to get him out. He was apparently quite comfortable there and needed encouragement to leave.

Somehow I got off topic. Let's just say I put off this choice for a long time and now I felt screwed. The mob had already left the library once I got there. Tomes were tossed left and right. Papers ripped forth from their ancient bindings and laying tattered along the ground. Hey, that didn't sound to bad. Maybe I should find a book about being a writer? No, no. Concentrate. To the forbidden texts section!

It took me some time to answer the guardian skull's ridden. Whoever heard of a river having a mouth? I dashing inside and found... Nothing. Bastards must have looted this place first. They even took the complete works of the Kama Sutra! Who does that? Nice to know that we matured during our time at UoM.

Everything was gone. Temporarily at least. At the start of next school year, the books would have replenished themselves for the droves of new students coming in. But I ain't got time for that. I need a job because of my student loan debt. So I made my way to the mundane texts. Hell, I heard chemistry pays well. I even saw a documentary about it. Well, most of a documentary about it. I never finished it, but that chemistry teacher had a dragon's den worth of cash. That has to be the way to go, right?

But apparently someone else had thought to come here first. Nothing, nothing, and more nothing. Falling to the ground in a fit of despair, my knee hits the spine of a hard cover book that had been misplaced. Quickly, and in a very manly fashion, I roll off to the side with a testosterone filled squeal spill out out of my lips. Clutching my wound, I hissed, eyeing the source of my despair with disdain.

That's when I saw it, in all of it's glory. It was an older book with some sort of smug looking troll on the cover. I picked it up, careful to not open it in fear that this would be my chosen book. Skimming over the texts on the back, I knew it. This was it. This is the future I wanted for myself.

[WP] An artist who keeps painting images of her past lives without realizing it,Ralph_Wasl,"Sometimes I feel compelled.

I'm an animator, it's what I do. It's my job to bring the visions of others to life. I mean, I work for a kid's show. It's not even something great or to be proud of, but damn they refuse to kill it off. Parents love to make their kids watch educational programming and the network refuses to let terrible shit die. At least, not as long as the merchandise sells.

But when I'm in my office at home, I like to stare at my wall. It's covered in post-it notes. Doodles put together like a series of story boards. I tell my husband that it's just to keep my skills sharp, but I feel drawn to it. Sometimes I'll be at work and I have to grab the pad I keep nearby. I go home, I eat dinner, I shower. Then I spend a half hour putting the notes on the wall, trying to figure out what order they go in.

It's a woman. She's beautiful, at least I think she is. Actually, she's somewhat average. There's a crook in her nose, but I find it fascinating. Her clothing is dated. Victorian in style, and half my sketches are of her fidgeting with her corset. She seems to hate it. I think she looks lovely, but sometimes I catch myself drawing her wearing men's clothing. Just a button up shirt, sitting on a bed and looking out a window.

Today, I felt something needed to be different. I took some of the notes off my wall and put them up in a line under my monitor. I'm an animator. My job is to bring things to life. Why haven't I ever tried to draw her in motion before? I tell my husband that I ate a late lunch at work and won't be needing dinner, then I barricade myself in.

I know what she looks like, but some of the details are missing as I do the rough sketches. She's sitting in front of a vanity with a swollen stomach, tying up her hair. In her reflection, her lips move, but I don't know what they say. I only animate a minute or two, and it isn't very detailed. Somewhat cartoonish in design, but it's what I draw the fastest.

But seeing her in motion, just doing something so simple... I couldn't leave her like that. What color was her hair? Brown. Her eyes were a bright amber color. That's right, they were almost like a cat's. I have a feeling that if I tell her that, she would laugh at me and swat my nose. Not sure why, but I'm positive that's how she would react.

Her favorite color is purple, and that's often the color of her dresses. I finalize the lines of my sketches, adding color and detail. When I think I'm done, I press play. It probably won't make any sense, and I'm nervous to see her in motion. But still, I felt compelled.

There's still no sound, but I can hear it. It's Saturday morning. There's a blue jay that often comes to the window to eat. I can hear the ruffling of her hair and she tries to get the pins just right.

""We really do need to get going.""

Why do I say that? And yet she turns around and looks towards me, a smile across her lips. ""The baby can wait until I'm ready.""

""You already complained how much pain you were in. Besides, you always look beautiful to me."" It seemed natural to talk to her. I don't know why... But I knew I didn't want her to stop.

She just breaks out into a laugh, putting her hand up to her lips. Then the animation stutters, and plays from the beginning again. My mind snaps out of it's trance and I shake my head. What was I doing? And yet, I find myself wanting to draw her more. Just to spend some more time with her.

My husband opens the door. He has a cup of hot chocolate in one hand, and a large chocolate chip cookie in the other. He sets them off to the side of my desk, squeezing his arms around me as he rests his chin on my shoulder.

""The two of you need to get some rest."" He presses a hand against my stomach and kisses the nape of my neck.

""The baby can wait until I'm ready..."" I whisper back.

He laughs and shakes his head. I smile back and look over to the screen. ""Sorry, I'm almost finished and I'll meet you in bed."" For now I save the file and close down the program. He's right, I do need some rest.

As he leaves the room, he turns and gives me a grin. He's not exactly a handsome man, average in appearance. But, there's a crook in his nose that I find fascinating.",fauxkit
"[WP] Your grandfather, the King, made a contract with a dragon to last for 50 years. Now, you are on the throne and the dragon has come to collect his payment.",urbanflora,"""Clear out the throne room."" Queen Corinna looked out from her bedroom window, seeing well the shadow of the dragon that loomed overhead. Her attending maid moved to object her plan, but the Queen had other plans. A wave of her hand as she snapped her head in her servant's direction. ""I said to make sure the throne room was clear! There is an important guest coming this day, and I will not have interruptions!""

Her breath was held in her chest, but she stood firm to show she feared no creature. Her heart raced fast, despite it all. She was young, barely past her teens. Forced onto the throne after a harmful battle for the crown took both her uncle and father's lives. But the fair lands of Athary was both her legacy and her kingdom. There was nothing she wouldn't do to protect it.

She picked up the beaded sides of her skirt and lifted them up so she could hastily make her way down the halls of the castle. Already, the sounds of hushed panic were overtaking those within. It wasn't every day they hosted a dragon within their walls. The creature had already made its way in and was waiting for her within the throne room.

He was small, for a dragon. However, it was said that he was very old and quite clever. As large as a mighty war horse, and just as proud. His scales were the color of black oil, shining a multitude of colors when the sun graced them. What stood out were his eyes, which were a bright silver with a red slit down the center. Neither queen nor beast bowed to each other, opting to stare as the creature flicked folded his wings at his sides and flicked his tale back and forth in annoyance.

""Nicolaos."" The queen's eyes widened slightly. She had often heard stories of this beast, but had never met him before this very day.

""Hold thine dignity, woman."" Nicolaos hissed. He closed the distance between them and flicked his green tongue out near her nose. ""Fifty years ago, I bargained with your namesake, King Corrigan, to protect these lands. To defend them from the threats of other nations. The power you hold belongs to me more so than it does you.""

Corinna was taken aback by the dragon's words. She dipped her head forward, pulling her skirt out in the form of a curtsy. ""My liege, Nicolaos."" Her eyes flitted upward to meet the dragon's glare, quickly falling down again as he sneered.

""Good."" His tail flicked again as he pulled back to sit on his haunches. ""My deal with your grandfather stated that I may gain one favor from this kingdom for every fifty years that I protect it. I have come on this day, the first fifty year anniversary, to claim what it is I currently desire.""

""And what is that?"" Corinna straightened up again, but she still not met the dragon's stare. Nor did she make her way to her throne in fear of offending him again.

""A queen has little that a dragon would want. I do not need land. I want not political or military power. Wealth is meaningless to me. My needs are already well taken care of by my own collection of slaves."" Nicolaos let out a soft chuckle, looking off to the side as though he delighted in some ill thought. ""But I think that there is many a man who would wish for you.""

""Pardon?"" The queen was somewhat horrified by the notion. ""No matter what you do, I don't believe that I myself were to be any part of any deal.""

""Whatever I desire, Queen Corinna!"" A putrid smelling purple smoke rose up from the dragon's nostrils. ""Do you know what it is I do to protect your family's livlihood?"" He was a small dragon, so it was not muscle he commanded. The queen knew that he was clever. There were many deals he had made with many people. And that was the aresenal that he used to protect Athary.

Her shoulders were pulled back, and she took a breath to compose yourself. ""Speak your mind than, liege. If there is something you need, I will comply with it as best as I am able.""

The lips of the dragon pulled back to reveal a sharp toothed grin. ""Very well. There is a..."" Nicolaos got that far off dreamy look in his eyes again. ""Man. A very special man of a very special lineage. You are going to marry him. You will give him everything he desires. Your hand, your kingdom, even your body. You will make sure that he will experience possible joy and pleasure there is for a man to have in life, do you understand?""

Corinna's hands balled up. Her nails dug painfully into her palms and she shook her head. ""Of course. I will comply by your request.""

""I'm not finished."" Nicolaos rose up again, pacing around the woman in a circle. ""I would never seek to make you suffer so harshly, woman, do keep that in mind. Do your job well and quick enough, and I will ease that suffering. At the very peek of his happiness, I will return. That is the moment I will devour his heart. Afterwards, I will go away for another fifty years. You may marry whoever you wish and have all the heirs with them that you desire. But I will make this clear. I want that heart.""

She didn't know what to make of such a deal. Her eyes trailed the serpentine creature as he continued to pace around her. ""Yes, my liege."" Corinna performed another curtsy. ""Bring me this man, and I will continue to keep my grandfather's promise to you.""

""Good, good."" Nicolaos purred. ""He will come to your bedroom on a night where the full moon sails above. Do make sure you make yourself presentable."" She wasn't able to get another word out, only a simple nod to let him know that she understood. ""What wonderful pets you humans make. Do yourself a favor and have some fun with him while he is around. I think this partnership we have in his demise will be just as excitable to you.""

He flicked her once in the ear with her tongue and turned to walk away. His tail was raised higher than usual, flicking back and forth as though he were quite proud of himself. Corinna stood there, to shocked to be able to move. Eventually, her maid came to check on her.

""He's left, milady. What was it that he wanted?""

""Just to talk, it's fine."" Corinna looked over her shoulder at the girl and managed a half smile. ""Business and politics. You know how it is."" Her hand was brought to her mouth, where she let out a fake laugh. ""It's funny how even magical beasts worry about such things!"" The maid gave a smile, seeming reassure that everything was going to be okay. In reality, Corinna was doing everything she could to not fall apart.",fauxkit

The stars had such a wonderful glow to them, and the light soothed his worries away. He was a young man with pale skin and silverish hair that had the faintest tint of green to them. Perhaps unusual if he was not also a nymph of a dogwood tree. The only one that idled in this forest. For as long as he had known life, he had been alone. His only company was a dragon that came to pester him at odd hours.

""Greetings~"" He heard the familiar greeting of the creature below him.

""Nicolaos!"" Ogden gleefully replied. He jumped down from his tree branch and wrapped his arms around his friend's neck. ""It is so good to see you! I was getting worried because it's rare I go so long without you stopping by.""

The dragon let out a chuckle and patted the nymph against the back. ""I had to travel far to the north of here."" He pulled away and his tail started to dig into the dirt below. Eventually a (poorly) drawn image of Corinna appeared. ""It should be left as a surprise, but I was meeting with the most beautiful queen.""

Ogden put a hand to his mouth, letting out an excitable inhale. ""Tell me about her, Nico."" His skin flushed an excitable pinkish hue. The change in his color made Nicolaos lick at his own lips with anticipation.

""She's young, only a year or two younger than yourself. With hair that's the color of dried out wood and eyes that gleam like the sun lit sky. She is also a wonderful queen. There is nothing she wouldn't do to protect the safety of her people.""

""She sounds wonderful."" Ogden's hands went to his chest, doing a gentle sigh. ""If only you could've brought her here. I would love to be able to spend the night talking with her. Not that your company is poor, friend, it's just that you're the only one who ever comes around!""

Nicolaos gave another chuckle. ""Another secret that I should keep."" He leaned in and lowered his voice. ""I spoke to her about you.""

""Now why did you have to do that?!"" The nymph appeared absolutely appalled by the thought. ""I can't leave my tree, and as a queen, she's going to be far to busy to come out here."" His hands went behind his back and his feet kicked at the ground below him. ""i-I mean, well. At least I don't think that a queen like her would ever be interested in meeting someone like me anyways.""

""I told you before, Ogden. Remember well? If a maiden promises her hand to you in marriage during the light of the full moon, you can be human for a short time. During which, you can explore the world of man to your heart's content!""

""But surely, she wouldn't..."" Nicolaos continued to give Ogden his sly grin. This only made the nymph more excitable. ""She did? Are you sure?""

""Yes!"" Nicolaos was feeling equally as excited. Despite his many years alive, he had no patience for getting a chance to eat the meal that Queen Corinna had promised him. ""Yes, the next full moon! She has agreed to see you and perhaps grant you her hand in marriage!""

""That's..."" Ogden's eyes went skyward. ""By the moon, that's only two days from now! Why couldn't it be sooner?!"" As Ogden paced about in a panic, Nicolaos refrained from also complaining that it should be sooner. ""What should I say? What should I wear? Nico, I have never met a woman before!""

Nicolaos shook his head and laughed at the nymph. ""Just be yourself. If you do that, I'm positive that she will not be able to refuse you."" The nymph started to sputter out a stream of thanks and praise towards the dragon's actions. All Nicolaos could do was sit there and grin.

[WP] Take a children's story/movie/book and give me the gritty reboot of it.,Yulgalminakf,"Ma-Ti was in love with this ring that he found. Not in a literal sense, but in the way he could feel the others around him. He pressed his back against the edge of the building and waited for a signal. His monkey, Suchi, called out above him. He nodded and closed his eyes. There were two of them. Their heartbeats were calling out to them. Calm and steady as they talked.

He pulled out the gun from the waistband of his pants. There wasn't much good to be had from taking out a member of a cartel. Where one falls, more would just take their place. But these bastards had burnt down his home after his father had spoken out against him. They killed his sister, they raped his mother and left her dying body behind for him and his father to find. Taking out these two wouldn't be good for the community, but he would feel a lot better.

The boy turned around the corner quickly, firing his weapon at the first man quickly. Over and over again while the other pulled out his own gun to retaliate. Ma-Ti reached out with his hand and made it into a fist, making a yanking back motion in the process. The man's heart flew out of his chest and thumped against the ground. There it gathered dirt on it as it continued to beat.

And as quickly as he had been in a small village in South America, he found himself suddenly within a temple on a tropical island. Next to him was an African man who was panting and kneeling against the ground. There was blood oozing from his leg.  There were five of them total, arranged in a circle so that they faced each other.

""Where are we?"" Across from Ma-Ti was Linka. His skin flushed slightly at the side of her partial nudity. He looked away to see that there was a girl around his own age next to him. She was soaking wet, and was holding the decapitated head of a girl in her hands. The sight of that made Linka scream and step back in horror.

There was a man in a wheelchair that Ma-Ti also couldn't see the features of. His body was covered in bandages, and what parts that could be seen were charred. He gave off a smell of burnt meat and medication. Wheeler also gave off the occasional giggle, though whatever joke there was was kept to himself.

""I am glad that you all managed to make it here."" A tall woman with tanned skin and hair the color of the light sea stepped into the room. The hem of her purple robes dragged along the floor as she walked towards them. It was less of walking and more of a glide. She had an incredible grace about her features. ""My Planeteers. It is a pleasure to meet you all.""",fauxkit

Gi cried out as the other girls dragged her to the well that was at the back of their middle school. Her bare feet dragged into the ground and let out a scream. Most of the teachers and other students had gone home. She wasn't sure if anyone would be able to save her at all.

Her eyes widened in terror as one of the girls took a crowbar to loosen the boards on top of the well. ""We told you to stay away from him, Gi. You don't need to be talking to him at all."" She had a neighbor whom the other girls had made a fanclub about. During lunch, he had asked her if her brother could talk to him later. ""We'll come get you in the morning, but you need to spend the night here and cool your head!""

Another scream as they tossed her in. The cold water was thick with algae that clung to her clothes. Thick branches from nearby trees caught against her feet and threatened to drag her down. She continued to scream and paw at the walls, but they were to slick with slime for her to do anything.

""Oh my god! You can't even see her!"" Gi could barely make out the shadows of their heads over the top. ""It's so dark! Hahaha!"" ""I don't know, what if she actually drowns?"" ""Hurry up and put the boards back. They won't find her at all, then. It's not like anyone checks back here anyways.""

Gi tried to make out another scream for help, but she was having to much trouble keeping her head above water. She could hear them hammering the boards back into place. This wasn't just some prank, this was murder. They weren't even going to check on her in the morning, she knew it. No one was going to find her. She was going to die alone.

The water rose over her head as she slipped down. It flooded her lungs and cut out her air. She felt dizzy and cold. It took over. And things went dark.

She didn't know how much time passed, but she could feel the water swirling about her body. It pushed her upwards and her eyes opened. The moon was full and directly overhead. Somehow the boards were gone. It must have been some hours since she first was put in here. Gi didn't notice that her body was feeling slightly stiff. Nor how pale she had gotten or that her heart had stopped beating. Her head was filled with thoughts of revenge.

The water continued to push her upward until she could crawl out on her own. She slipped over the side and begun to vomit water. Her fingers clutched onto the grass below and she didn't even notice that a ring glistened on one of them. Four girls. She'll visit those four girls tonight and then head off to where she felt her calling to be.",fauxkit

The skin was so crisp on his face that they had trouble getting dental records to identify him."" The detective stood outside of the hospital room. ""I don't even know how he's still alive. Doctors are saying he isn't going to stay that way for long. They're just making him comfortable.""

His partner gave a shrug, going through the case folder. ""The factory belongs to a man named Sly Sludge. They specialize in waste disposal, but it looks like they were also under investigation for ill ecological practices. Our 'victim' here goes by Wheeler. He's a student at the nearby university, and was arrested a month ago when he participated in a protest outside the building.""

""Damn Green Peace fucks just can't be patient and take the law into their own hands."" The detective rubbed the bridge of his nose between two fingers. ""Right. We'll look into him as our main arsonist suspect. He may claim he was just in there gathering evidence, but that's never how this plays out. Just in case, we'll get an officer play guard outside.""

Both detectives turned their heads towards the door. A loud laughter could be heard coming from within. Wheeler arched his burned body in a painful manner. The machines around him started to beep wildly as though possessed by madness. His hand clentched into a fist. A ring started to glow faintly on it. The allow had fused to his skin from the heat of the flames, and even now it had a faint glow to it.

A nurse pushed past the pair and made her way towards the room. She was quick to inject him with a sedative to calm him down. Wheeler settled back into his bed. The eyelids had burned away from his face, leaving his milky blue eyes to stare off in a dazed manner as drugs flowed through what was left of his veins. As the nurse turned to leave, his bandaged hand snapped to catch her by the wrist. He giggled until she shook him off, leaving just as quickly as she had came.",fauxkit

Humanity had spread across this planet like a plague. Deforestation, pollution, disease. They turned on each other in greed and if action was not taken soon enough, everything will come to an end.

She stepped up to a little used section of her temple, making her way to a pedestal that had a crystal box on top. This was opened carefully, examining the five colored rings that were inside. Each one was picked up gently and pressed to her lips. Each whispered a secret and a prayer for safety. Then, one by one, they flew up into the air and out of sight. It was time for them to meet their new masters. Perhaps they would have the power to call the one known as Captain Planet.

Kwame was the first. At the moment, he was less concerned about becoming a guardian for the world and more about escape. The last time he took to running from the diamond mines, they took his arm. Next would be his life. But he felt compelled to run. He was done watching people die. He was done with the wars he had seen fought to claim possession of the jewels that laid deep within his native earth.

A stray bullet caught the ground near his feet. He tightened his jaw and did his best to not let out a cry. After all, this wasn't the first time that he had been shout at. What was important was to increase his speed. Keep running. Keep going. Another bullet clipped him in the leg, making him issue out a loud cry. His body lurched forward, flying and tumbling against the ground until he landed on his back. There were tears that formed in his eyes as he looked off to the stars above.

The man who had been chasing him stepped up and lowered the gun towards him. It had been someone who had grown up in the same age as Kwame, before they were all taken away. As children, they called each other brothers. No words were said, Kwame giving a nod and closing his eyes.

They snapped open again at a bright of flash light. Something was in between them, shaped like a ring. Instinctively, Kwame reached his arm towards it. What was left of his arm, that is. The ring approached and glowed faintly. Diamonds forming from it and coming into the shape of an arm from his elbow down so that the ring could rest on his mineralized fingers.

His pursuer nearly dropped his gun in fright, taking several steps back. He screamed something about witchcraft before running off. Kwame sat up and examined his arm. He seemed to have a strange sense concerning the ground below him. As though there was a connection he felt to it. He rose up and flexed his new arm, the ground shaking slightly below him. There was no knowing why he had gotten this gift, but there were still people at the mine who needed his help. Questions could come later. There were people that needed saving.",fauxkit
[WP] Take a children's story/movie/book and give me the gritty reboot of it.,Yulgalminakf,"Smoke curled about Linka's features in the dim light. She had 'bribed' one of their guards earlier to give them a pack of cigarettes to share. Now they smoked them one at a time. It provided the group of girls with warmth that did little to chase away the cold air of Russia.

They were each dressed in their underwear, all of them within their teens. Earlier, the men had come in with a camera. They were told to smile as they took pictures. The one who refused was dragged off. They were sure to finish their business with her outside in the hall, where the rest of them could hear it.

""Hey."" One girl called out to Linka, and she passed the cigarette to them. ""Thank you, for what you did earlier. What's your name?""

""It doesn't matter."" Linka shifted slightly, making the chain that was tied about her ankle give a slight rattle. ""Whoever buys us will give us new names.""

She was a spirited girl two days ago. On her way home from school when the van drove up next to her and carried her away. She didn't even know how many hours had passed until they reached the house she was now locked up in. Some of the other girls had been sold into this position, but she was sure the majority of them had been kidnapped like herself.

Her eyes trailed along the smoke that had started to fill the air. It was cold and dense, hanging in a heavy manner and reminded her of a noose. They all had a noose around their necks at this point, didn't they? A rattling along the floor near the door had caught her attention, she looked towards the door where a small ring had rolled underneath it.

""What is it?"" Linka called out to the one who was closest to it.

""Ah, it's a ring!"" She picked it up and held it in a way so the others could see. ""Maybe the guard is proposing to you because you sucked his cock so well?""

""Shut up."" She looked away and spat against the floor. The taste of dirty meat was still in her mouth. Linka let out a soft grunt when the ring hit her in the cheek. ""Why did you do that?""

""I didn't! It was almost as though it flew on its own!""

Linka glared but looked down at where the ring had landed. Smoke started to circle around it. Faster and faster till it formed a small tornado that raised it up to her eye level. ""What is this?"" She held out her hand and it landed softly in it. ""Maybe a gift from Baba Yaga?"" The other girls shrugged, but she slipped it on her own finger just the same. Things started to feel a little different, and maybe there was some hope for her after all.",fauxkit

"[TT] Old World dragons, Native American Thunder-Birds, and the Aztec Feathered Serpents meet for the first time during a great migration.",LegendaryGoji,"""How many ages has it been?""

The deep voice of the elder dragon rumbled out to creature next to him. His eyes were a milky color, peering out over the valley below the mountain. Along his body, his once ruby scales had become dried and frayed. Peeling up slightly and taking on the color of dried blood. Beside him was a young and spirited eagle. Though his size was dwarfed by his dragon companion, he was by no means a small creature. With every shift of his impatient form, static curled along his feathers.

""I wouldn't know."" The white head of the bird turned upward, giving a slight tilt towards the plane that flew in the sky above. His eyes did a slight squint as it became encompassed by the light of the sun. He pondered why his ancestors would choose to leave this place, especially when metal beasts seemed to have no problems in keeping their domain over the sky.

""To long."" A slick, feminine voice called out from behind the pair. It belonged to a long snake covered in rainbow feathers who was exiting a cave. ""My apologies to you, Cicero and Chief Cry Talon."" Itzel bowed her head. ""My brood has gathered. Are the rest of you prepared?""

Cry Talon looked over the Quetzalcoatl over his shoulder, quickly snapping his head away. He raised a wing to partially cover his face. ""I have spoken with the other tribes of my people. We agreed that it is time we return to our sacred lands.""

""Why are we here?"" Cicero's voice boomed out again. His head moved side to side in a sluggish manner. ""Is my meal ready? I'm parched, where is my drink?""

Itzel's tongue flicked from her mouth. ""Where is his watcher Vincenzo? I much preferred to deal with him.""

The thunderbird lowered his wing and looked up to the sky again. ""He said he was looking for something to eat for Cicero.""

""What a waste."" The creature was impatient with these delays, despite her own tardiness. She spread out her wings and slithered over to the elder dragon's side. ""We are returning home, Cicero. We have chosen to take back what we lost because of man.""

""Man..."" The dragon's snout started to trail smoke as he lifted up his head. His scales started to glow and fire sputtered from his maw. ""Man!"" He snarled and cracked the stone beneath his feet with his claws. ""They are coming! With their hardened bodies and swords! They will hunt us down, one by one! Until none are left!""

""Yes!"" Itzel's eyes flared up a bright emerald color. She had heard the stories from her grandparents. ""Then they came on boats! Men with skin the color of ghosts! With hair that flamed in colors of gold and fire! They brought with them disease and death!""

""And claims that any lands they stepped on were now theirs."" Cry Talon added, in a calmer manner.

""Exactly! Why must we hide away due to the cowardice of those that came before us?"" The colors in Itzel's feathers began to flow, shimmering in the sun along with her excitement. ""Even now, they are cutting down my people's forests and defiling our temples with their feet. I must thank you for gathering among my kind. We need to claim them back before they're lost forever!""

Itzel's words had a way of stiring the old dragon's blood. He twitched and held his head up high. A loud roar came out, fire streaming past his sharpened teeth and lighting up the sky. Cry Talon hopped back to avoid his own body from becoming tarnished and burnt.

""The pair of you are approaching this as though we're going to war."" The thunderbird shuffled uncomfortably.

""If you didn't want war, you shouldn't have asked us to enter the world of man with you."" Itzel hissed back.

""I asked because we should stand together."" He turned to look behind him, at the cave that Itzel had come out of. ""Humanity will respect us if we respect them. They have been alone in this world for a long time. We should seek to work in har-""

""This was our world before theirs!""

""You weren't even born in this world."" Cry Talon straightened up as Itzel shrunk back. ""We should work together and establish harmony with humanity.""

The argument would have continued if not for the cow that landed with a heavy thud in front of Circero. The dragon stooping down and inhaling it with one bite. A green dragon landed nearby, looking over the old beast with a shake of his head and a tsk of his tongue. ""I said to not work him up.""

""That was never my intention."" Cry Talon stated as Itzel looked away with disgust.

Vincenzo hissed through his teeth and straightened up his wings so he laid flat along his sides. ""There is a city not to far from here. If we fly towards the ocean, we will see it. That would be our best lead to follow if we wish to find the leaders of man. No doubt the ones from my lands have finished conquering the world already. Should be an easy journey.""

""I agree. Monsters of that ambition rarely leave their work unfinished."" Itzel hissed out. ""We will fly together. My kind should already be in position to open the portals to this world."" There were specks of color that were appearing along the peaks of the other mountains along the range. Quetzalcoatl stretching out their wings and letting the shades of their rainbows catch the light of the sun.

""I miss the taste of human flesh."" Circero murmured. The dragon settled in to rest against the stones below him. His ancient bones issuing out a stream of snaps and cracks.

""There isn't a need to delay."" Cry Talon stated with regret. He had a sense that this was a huge mistake in the making. ""Lady Itzel?"" He tilted his head towards the Quetzalcoatl.

She nodded and arched back her head. A vicious screech echoed out from her maw, sending the creatures of the forest below to let out cries of panic. Her voice was mimicked by the other Quetzalcoatl, and the mountains below began to creak and snap. Caves opening up within their surfaces. Dragons, Thunderbirds, and more Quetzalcoatl came out from their depths, taking to the skies in mass.

""Lead us to this city, Vincenzo."" The chieftain stated, stretching out his own wings and diving down to the valley below. An updraft caught against his feathers, carrying him up higher and higher into the air above the Andes mountains. He let out a cry of his own, to signal to the others to follow. Together they started their migration into a world that had long belonged to man. But first, they were going to stop by San Antonio for directions.",fauxkit

He had tried therapy, he had tried medication, he had even tried straight up denial over the situation. But the voices were there. The visions that were on his shoulders at any moment he did not wish to see them. Which was every moment. There wasn't a time where he wanted them there.

""Hmm."" The character on his right examined the cadaver before them. Despite his own insanities, he still had a job to do. Currently he was 'alone' in a hotel room, where a man had been murdered. The shoulder 'angel' flashed off his shoulder and grew to a life size figure. He had the appearance of a modern day Sherlock Holmes, BBC edition. A somewhat handsome man with otter-like features that was always dressed for cold weather.

""Business man, recently divorced. The width of his girth as well as the slight wearing at the sides of the pants on his waist say that he spends long hours in an office chair. That, and he doesn't own many suits. Most likely suffering from money issues."" Sherlock retorted, not making eye contact with Salmaso. He never made eye contact.

""He got shot."" Replied the devil on the detective's left shoulder. He was a cartoonish figure known as Sterling Archer. ""He was wanking one out and someone shot him. Case closed, let's go get a drink."" It was true that the dead man's penis was out. His hand did have a whitish substance on it. CSI hadn't arrived yet and Salmaso was going to leave that bit of evidence for them to look at.

""Or perhaps there was a woman here."" Sherlock gestured towards the collection of call girl cards on the table next to couch that the man slouched on. It was Las Vegas, those were often handed to men out on the strip. A discounted girl who came here with murder on the mind."" His hands hovered near his temples and he got a zoned out expression. He was doing that 'mind palace' thing that Salmaso found annoying. Most likely mentally cataloging every woman and looking for one that didn't match the appropriate profession of escort.

""Cheap hotel, recent divorce, and limited clothes?"" Archer poofed a bottle of vodka into his hands and took a drink from it. He sat down on Salmaso's shoulder and made himself comfortable. ""He was looking at porn on his computer. Room service came by, popped a cap in his ass, and took the laptop. Our best bet to find it is to head down to the casino below and hit up the black jack tables.""

Sherlock wavered his hands about and snapped out of his trance. He looked over at the rolled in tray table that had an untouched steak on it and a loaded potato covered in cheese. ""With his high cholesterol levels and his lactose intolerance, there is little chance he would order this meal for himself."" Salamso refrained from asking how he knew about the lactose intolerance. He just wanted the figment to shut up already. ""The banquets within this city are much more within his price range as well. Whoever sent this up to him is not close enough to know his eating preferences."" His eyes flitted to the trash can that was full of salad take out boxes.

""With a video playing in the background, the laptop would not lock itself and thus not need a password to be opened up again as well."" Both of Sherlock's hands waved at Salmaso. ""Locate who ordered this meal and you will have your culprit."" With that he poofed back to his smaller self, resting on the detective's shoulder once more.

""Take some of the cards with you when you go. That Ciesta girl definitely has all the answers you need. Us *yankees,*"" Archer sent a glare to Sherlock, ""know how to solve a case better than MI6 over there. You should run off home before your boxers try rebelling again.""

""Right. Zo you try to do that."" The scent of sulfur wafted through the air as smoke formed in the imp's hand and formed a cell phone. ""Call if you have trouble. Name iz-"" And he proceeded to make this horrible sound that I couldn't pronounce. Blood started to seep out of my ears after he said it, that's how horrid it was.

I nodded. My eyes doing a pained slant as I waited for the ringing to go away from my ears. I reached out to take the cell phone and held it up. ""I'll be in touch I suppose."" The imp gave a nood and jumped down from my dinner table, making his way back to the hole he had dug before.

At first I didn't know how to go about the rest of my Saturday. I cracked open a beer and stood in my living room, looking out at Bob across the street. He was there mowing the lawn as his wife was screeching at him from the porch. My brow furrowed at the display, but my attentions were soon caught by a young jogging woman who was moving down the street. That sports bra was doing nothing to prevent the lateral movements of her milk glands. And I appreciated that about her outfit.

""Wait."" I mumbled to myself, and the jogger stopped. She looked about in a dazed fashion but stood there. My eyes widened and my brain tumbled with ideas. ""That gentleman over there is quite handsome."" She was mouthing the words as I spoke them. Odd, it was like I had some mind control going on. ""I should totally go hit on that ass.""

I watched as the jogger made her way over to Bob's house. Then I realized that as a man who has had nothing of stream of failed attempts at relationships my whole life, I had no idea how to flirt. Instead, I made a motion upwards with my hands and the jogger lifted up her shirt.

""Wow! Just look at those melons!"" Somehow I was speaking for Bob now. He stopped the mower and made a grabbing motion as he Frankenstein walked forward. ""Gimme, gimme. Baby needs their milk..?""

I had momentarily forgotten that Mrs. Bob was still on the patio, and now she was even more upset. ""Ah, shit."" I murmured. ""Wait! I suddenly remembered that I'm bi-sexual!"" I mentally sent those urges over to Mrs. Bob, and she immediately pulled the robe off of her... ... Body. Wow. I... I didn't need to see that. Either way, the trio were now devolving down to some sort of orgy on the newly mowed grass.

""After this, we should totally get that guy across the street some pizza. For reasons!"" Bob cried out before burying his face between the jogger's breasts. Yes... Yes, I was absolutely getting used to this sort of power.

I continued to watch as the depraved actions became more and more sexual in nature. Giving a shrug, I reached into my pants and started to rub one out. Maybe *Lust* wouldn't be such a bad title after all. I don't think I could use it to get myself laid, that just... Felt wrong on a different level.

""What do you mean, four?"" My partner replied. We had been assigned here by a higher up officer to monitor whatever was coming. But all I knew was that it was cold and I wanted a damn coffee.

I pointed off to a distant tower, where four candle lit lanterns were hanging. ""We were told to wait here for the signal, right? There are four lights. What do you suppose that means?""

He mulled over the idea for a moment. ""One by land, two by sea, three by air."" There was a squint on his behalf as he looked off at the tower. ""Wait, you said, 'there are four lights.'?""

""Yeah, there are four lights."" I looked him over like he was an idiot.

""There! Are! Four! Lights!"" He shouted in a defiant manner, using his taller height to loom over me in a menacing fashion.

I did a hop back and put a hand over my gun. ""What the shit? Don't shout or anything, we're supposed to be lookouts.""

I shook my head and stood my ground. ""Look, let's say... Hypothetically... Extremely hypothetically, that it's aliens.""

""Alright, go on.""

""Aliens are from outer space. Space is a part of air. If the enemy are coming by air, there would be three lights.""

""But there are four lights.""

""Exactly.""

""So then it's mole people."" He stomped his feet on the ground. ""One by air, two by sea, three by air, four by ground. Obviously it's mole people.""

""Why the fuck would you think it's mole people?"" I had started to go for my radio so I could call it in, but i really had to hear an explanation for this one.

""Bare with me."" I bit my tongue, saying nothing. I think I had already bared enough of him. ""The likelihood of hell demons or spawn or whatever is very low. So we can strike those out.

""Giant man eating worms?""

""No, idiot. Mole people. Call it in, and tell them that it's mole people.""

I go for my radio and decide that I should just call it in and ask them what four lights are supposed to mean. Instead I just get static. I bang the thing against the palm of my hand in a vain effort to get it to work.

""Probably interference by the mole people.""

""Just shut the fuck up about the mole people."" I bang it again and am greeted by a low, rumbling noise. The ground has started to vibrate and my attentions are drawn up towards the sky.

There was a series of lights. Shooting starts that flared across the night sky all around us. A particularly bright one shined above, coming to a stop above. It looked to be some sort of flying vessel, with strange swirling lights that spun around along the bottom.

""Ha! I told you! I told you that four lights meant aliens!""

A beam overtook the both of us. I started to feel light on my feet, so much so that the soles of my boots had stopped touching the ground entirely. ""Just... Just shut up."" I hissed back, even as the both of us were being abducted by this unknown force.",fauxkit
[OT] Ask Jackson #3: Planning Your Story,Writteninsanity,"Ah, NaNoWriMo, you bane of my existence. There's a quote of George RR Martin that has helped me out. It should be said that Mr. Martin is an incredibly slow as a writer. But it is one of two quotes that make me feel motivated as a writer.

&gt;“I think there are two types of writers, the architects and the gardeners. The architects plan everything ahead of time, like an architect building a house. They know how many rooms are going to be in the house, what kind of roof they're going to have, where the wires are going to run, what kind of plumbing there's going to be. They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before they even nail the first board up. The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed and water it. They kind of know what seed it is, they know if planted a fantasy seed or mystery seed or whatever. But as the plant comes up and they water it, they don't know how many branches it's going to have, they find out as it grows. And I'm much more a gardener than an architect.”

What I take from that is that there is no one way to be a great writer. Everyone's minds work differently, and that's a good thing. It gives flow to your individual creativity and individual style of writing. If everyone wrote the exact same way, reading books would be just as boring as some fools claim it to be.

Another author, Charlaine Harris of the Sookie Stackhouse series, did a pep talk for NaNiWriMo last year. If you have an account, her pep talk was on November 17th, and I thought it was a great read. It's about how the middle part of a story can be the hardest to write. I don't want to make a long post, but I will put the whole thing if someone asks. 

&gt;The middle is where you prove what you’re made of. This is where you pull up your socks and think of some interesting things for your characters (who should be pretty well developed by now) to do with/for/to each other. And it had better be some good, exciting, and maybe even evil stuff.

&gt;Personally, I always kill someone. This enlivens the plot every time, and I get to write another “finding of the body” scene, which is one of my favorites. I have never found a body in real life, but I have found dozens on the page, and every time, I get a creative charge from it. This may not be a particularly attractive aspect of my character, but hey! I’m amongst other writers, and I can tell you the truth.

Having a solid idea of what you want for your characters and story is definitely the quickest way to write. That's how I was able to beat that tedious month. But sometimes you also don't understand who a character actually is, how they talk, how they react, until you're near the end of the story. Sometimes you wonder why you planned them to do something that they wouldn't do, but didn't realize that when you first sat down to create them. That's okay. *That's what re-writes are for. And re-writes are totally okay.*

What's laid out here is a great resource though, I like it a lot.",fauxkit
[OT] Ask Jackson #3: Planning Your Story,Writteninsanity,"I read a book years ago that was a collaboration between two people. It centered around two characters who were facing the same disaster, but were no where near each other. The book switched the perspective of who the lead was, odd for one, even for the other. And the authors seemed to have a loose outline for how the story would progress. They still wrote the chapters independents of each other and just made sure it came together in the end.",fauxkit
[OT] Ask Jackson #3: Planning Your Story,Writteninsanity,"I am absolutely a gardener and need all the validation for my terrible chose of writing style that I can get.

It's one of those topics that is so different to each individual person that it's impossible to do a simple guide. The best advice that I can give is make sure to know your characters. That way you can toss them into any scenario and know how they are going to act, or how they are going to change. The best part of any story is watching how the characters evolve. It's important to challenge them in interesting ways.",fauxkit
[EU] Uncle Vernon came face to face with Lord Voldemort.,wannabgourmande,"""I don't know why you've come here or why you haven't got a nose, but you sort of magic folk have no business here!"" Vernon Dursley stood his place within the door frame of 4 Privet Drive. He did not recognize the dark cloaked figure in front of him as He Who Should Not Be Named, and he also did not care. As far as he was concerned, this was just another wizard. And wizards had no place within his home.

When all he got was a glare from Voldemort's cruel eye, he decided that the man needed a good telling off. His mouth opened to raise an objection, not noticing how Voldemort had started to mouth the words, 'Avada Kedavra.' Nor would he understood what the villain meant by such meaning. His world turned black around him as his fat frame bounced against the floor. From within the kitchen, Petunia let out a half scream. Half was all she could manage before she to fell to another casting of the killing curse.

Harry grasped his legs tightly to his chest. He heard only shouting from within his spot in the cupboard under the stairs. Then silence. He knew they weren't alright, but he was to petrified to do much about it. The door opened and a slithering sound was made from Voldemort's mouth as he grinned at the young boy in front of him.

His wand was raised, pointing it straight at the lad. He had plenty of things to do and wasted enough time trying to find his place. There were Death Eaters to gather, and a whole magical world to conquer. The last thing that Harry ever heard in life was a phrase he didn't understand.

""From now on, they'll call you the Boy Who Failed to Live.""

Finally. Prophecies be damned. Voldemort exited the muggle home, taking note of the owl flying above him. A flick of his wrist led the creature to fall dead at his feet. He stooped down to pick up the letter that it held tightly within its talons. A invitation to Hogwarts? There may have been a time where a Tom Riddle would have reminisced about his orphanage days. The cry of an owl and the splendid appearance of a letter. A calling to his rightful place to be the leader of all wizards.

But Tom Riddle was dead. And so was the boy who other's claimed to be his downfall. Long live Lord Voldemort. He laughed to himself as he walked out to the street, looking up at the sky. Nothing could stop him now, and everything under the stars would be his.

Grand things could have happened. But that doesn't mean that all the good in the world has fallen. This is the start of a different tale, belonging to a different boy with a very similar origin. This is the story of Neville Longbottom. The Boy Who Triumphed.",fauxkit

[WP] You're a hit-man hired for a high-profile case but only given an address: 123 Sesame Street.,ElectricSkeletor,"He was a monster. We all knew it. It was plastered all over the television every day. Even our children could see what it is he was. Because of that, I didn't want to make it a clean job.

But it was a busy street. There were all sorts of beasts that plagued this city, and I only got paid to get rid of the worst of the worst. I set myself up on a tall building, opposite of a place called Hooper's. They said he always came by in the afternoon to get his snack. Dammit. There were going to be witnesses. I don't even think I'll make it out of here alive myself, but people out there are going to know me as a hero.

As I set up my sniper rifle and looked through the sights, I could see him. You could never tell where he was looking, his eyes always pointed in different directions. They bobbled as well. At any moment, one of them could point at where I was sitting and my cover would be blown. I hasten my process and place my finger on the trigger. My heart is racing. I'm running out of time.

He greets the children as they pass on by, they're on their way home from school There's even a moment where they all break out in song about the letter G. I only care about the letter K. Have you heard of it? *It stands for kill.*

The dancing makes it hard for me to aim. It's as though he knows I'm here and is using them as shields. But the song finishes soon enough and he sits himself down on a bench outside the store. He starts to converse with a nearby bird, and I know that this is my moment to strike. I slow my breath. I make sure my aim is true. And then I pull the trigger.

It isn't clean. It was a large round. I duck down and can already hear the screams of panic. That's good. That means people will run and I'll have plenty of time to get out of here. I quickly start to change into the colorful outfit of a prince as my escape disguise. They were big on costumes here.

I make my way down the fire escape, my gear hidden behind a large shield strapped onto my back. No one gives me a passing glance, and I promise to protect a fairy child who begs me to save her from this situation. I can't help but to take one last look back at the what's left of the corpse of my kill. The corner of my lip rises up as I take the girl's hand and lead her down the alleyway. My job is done and I'll get my pay. Under my breath, I feel like I have to get the last word in right before I leave this place.

[WP] Why have you not opened the door in front of you?,Laxaria,"Taking a slow breath, I interlace my fingers together. The door is old, it looks worn, as if it’s been there for ages. The sealant on it is coming off in chunks, leaving worn, old wood in its wake. It’s washed out grey in spots, the doorknob having been bright gold years before. Now it’s simply a reminder of what it had been. 

I tremble, continuing to stare at the door, unable to turn away. Light flickers through the crack underneath it. There’s a sharp object pressing into the base of my skull. Tears run down my face, as I choke back a sob. My throat aches, parched for want of water. 

The light flickers closer before turning into constant streams of light moving across the ground, growing brighter. The sound of someone spitting comes from behind me, hitting the ground with vehemence. Rustling, moving fills the room, fading back to silence as quickly as it comes. 

Light spills over the painted-over windows, flashing here and there through where the paint isn’t so thick. My entire body is trembling with silent sobs, eyes still wide with fright, wide enough that I can still see everything in front of me. A gun clicks. 

The air is still, tense, like the moment before a thunderstorm crashes down with its full fury. I hold my breath, swaying on the bucket I’m standing on. The knife digs in a bit more. A wet feeling drips down my back, blood. My chest heaves, hiccupping with a swallowed sob. 

I just want them to open the door. I want to feel air and sunlight again. Please. Please, before I die, before this knife goes through my head and they riddle me with bullets. Please open the door.

"[WP] Every great journey has an end. But, not every great character has a great end.",IStruggleWithThings,"“Get out.” Ilonor doesn’t have to be told a third time, Sylthaela’s muscles flexing as if to move towards him. He rolls up the remainder of his scroll, shoving everything into his bag without a care as to how damaged it may get, save for the scroll that he secrets into a special area of the bag. 

Ilonor rushes back down the mountain, barely remembering to do some other things to make it seem as if he was really doing his gathering that he claimed to be doing. When he returns, he hands over the meager supplies. He shows a few drawings off to some of the group, getting scolded for not doing enough gathering. 

A few days later, there’s a large fire high up on the mountainside. Ilonor rushes out of the city without permission, towards the fire, where he’s certain Sylthaela’s house is. When he reaches the spot, a few of the older members of the village are finishing up raiding Sylthaela’s garden, the warrior nowhere to be seen. 

“Ilonor, what are you doing here?” Ilonor jerks around to look at Dantar. The male elf has a frown on his face. 

“I saw the fire and—” Dantar doesn’t allow him to speak any further. 

“We were driving away danger from the village. Go back home.” Dantar points back down the mountain. Ilonor pauses, glancing over the mess of a house before hurrying back away. At least the scroll detailing Sylthaela’s exploits would survive, even if the elven warrior was driven far away from her home, simply for existing. 

***

Long enough to need two parts. Hope it doesn't turn into a mess in the middle or end, I was very distracted. ",Syraphia
"[WP] Every great journey has an end. But, not every great character has a great end.",IStruggleWithThings,"“Don’t venture out there, she’ll cut you in half.” Ilonor blinks slowly at the older woman, quill still on the page. 

“Why would she do that?” Ilonor raises an eyebrow, glancing up towards the distant smoke coming from the lonely house more than halfway up the side of the mountain. 

“She’s an outdated antique,” the woman scoffs. She waves her hand in the direction of the house. “Doesn’t even both coming down the mountain anymore. Not like she can marry or have children after what happened.” 

“Magphira, what do you mean by that?” Magphira harrumphs in response to Ilonor’s question. 

“She paid for her ways. That’s all I’ll say and you’d best just stay away from an antique like her if you value your life and place in this society.” Magphira walks away, the older elf seeming to shun any more questions from the younger. 

Ilonor grimaces as he looks at his paper. All that’s written on it is ‘outdated antique’ and ‘disliked by the village’ which seems to be the consensus of everyone in town. Why is far beyond Ilonor’s knowledge as no one will give him more than that. All dissuade him from climbing the mountain to visit the outcast. 

So he sneaks out under a cover story about gathering three days later. He’s already claimed over and over again that he’s dropped the whole thing, pretending to get rid of the small bit of writing he had on his scroll. It had all been faked, just to get him out and up the mountain. The journey takes half the day, Ilonor sitting on a stump not far from where the smoke comes out of the forest to eat his meal. There were a few ruins along the way on the way up the mountain, Ilonor making note of them. 

Cautiously, he heads up to the small hut in the woods. It looks hastily built, shoddily put together. Ilonor can see where portions of the building have been replaced, rebuilt, and put back into place. He can’t imagine someone elven even attempting to live there. It barely looks fit for something to even live there in the first place, despite the small garden and other signs of life in the clearing. 

“And who are you?” The female voice is cold, something sharp pressing into the base of his skull. Ilonor gulps loudly, body freezing up as he stammers loudly. 

“I—I—I’m just—doing research.” The sharp object stays at the base of his skull. A sharp laugh comes from behind him. 

“Research or have you decided that I’m too close again?” The sharp thing presses a bit more against his skull. “Dump your bag.” There’s a short pause as Ilonor picks his bag up and turns it upside-down without hesitation, despite the damage it’ll cause to everything inside. Everything falls to the ground with a loud clamor, a few items breaking irreparably. 

“Research, I swear.” Maybe old Magphira had something in mind when she said the woman on the mountain is an old antique. Someone uses a stick to brush through the belongings on the ground, the sharp thing still at the back of his neck. 

“Quills… parchment… books… broken ink wells…” Ilonor winces at the statement but fears moving his head completely. “Lunch… dinner… Small penknife…” She doesn’t seem concerned about the item. “I suppose you were coming up here for ‘research’ whatever you’re doing that for.” The sharp object pulls away from his skull. 

“I—I kept seeing the smoke, so I started asking questions.” Ilonor leans down very slowly, beginning to shove items into his bag again. He avoids the broken inkwells, thankful that at least one survived the drop. It half-crushed his dinner though but at that would still be edible. 

“I suppose they didn’t like you doing that so much, right child?” Ilonor nods in agreement with the female voice, looking up at the woman. His entire body freezes up, eyes widening. “Didn’t even tell you anything other than calling me an outcast then?” 

As he nods, the elven woman leans on her sword, the length easily more than half the length of her body. Despite her obviously advanced age, her body is built of sinewy muscle that bulges with each movement she makes. His eyes are drawn back to the sword though, it’s the first time he’s seen such a thing as since the time of Peace had come, all such weapons had been destroyed. Some collected the weapons of death, but it was uncommon and frowned upon. Obviously, this woman still used hers every day. 

“First time you’ve seen a Claymore?” A smile plays across the woman’s face, only lifting one half of her mouth. The second shock hits him as he realizes that she’s horrifically scarred. She’s even completely missing one long, pointed ear, the other carrying burns across it. Burns look like they’ve melted part of her face, scars that look like claw marks on some of her visible skin around the loose clothing she wears. “They missed that part too, huh?” She chuckles. 

“Y—Yes, ma’am.” 

“What is it you want?” She tilts her head, eyeing him. Despite the scar over one eye, it looks as if it can see him with that eye as well as the normal one. “What’s this ‘research’ you’re talking about?” 

“I—I want to know why you’re up here.” Ilonor attempts to gather his courage. Even with how old the woman is, she’s very dangerous still. She raises an eyebrow, looking rather unimpressed. 

“That’s a boring reason.” She draws her weapon from the ground, easily lifting it with one hand and stepping around him and towards the house. “You don’t even know my name, do you?” 

“N—No.” Ilonor shivers at the woman brushing past him. She doesn’t seem to mean him any harm however, which he’s thankful for. 

“Well then, we’re even, I’m unaware of yours.” There’s a short pause between them. 

“I—Ilonor, my name is Qinelis Ilonor.” He turns to watch after her movement. She pauses, looking over her shoulder at him. 

“Well then Ilonor, I am Waesra Sylthaela. Wiped from the records as I am an unneeded weapon.” She scoffs, continuing into the rundown house. Ilonor pauses, then cautiously heads forward to follow her into the house, the door left wide open in her wake. “You’ll have to excuse the fact that I do not own a second cup, dish, or other thing in this house.” 

Ilonor nods, grimacing at seeing Sylthaela’s face again in the shadows of house. Somehow, the shadows make it look all the more terrible, the shadows playing with the deformed lines of her face. He holds his bag to him. 

“Going to make notes about me?” At another nod, Sylthaela laughs. “Best take my seat at the table and get to work writing then. They’ll burn the paper when you get back anyways.” She pours some liquid into a cup, putting her back against one of the crumbling walls to keep an eye on him as she sips at it. 

Ilonor hurries to take a seat at the table, dumping his bag much more carefully this time and rolling his scroll out over the table. It rolls over the edge of the table and onto the floor, bouncing along the dirt floor until it hits a wall. Sylthaela tilts her head, raising an eyebrow. 

“You’re planning on writing a lot.” She chuckles again. Ilonor gives a quick nod as he hurries to get ink on the tip of his quill to get prepared to write. He looks up expectantly when he’s ready, face eager, Sylthaela giving him a lopsided smirk. “All, all ready?” He nods. Sylthaela takes another sip off of her cup before beginning to speak. 

The story that follows is almost unbelievable, making Sylthaela even older than Ilonor had pinned her at, considering that it’s from before the Peace. Sylthaela details a long story, starting with her training in the village below, spreading to defending it from invaders. Then going on a journey to destroy other creatures terrorizing the area, the last of which being a dragon that was attacking the village more than once a week. 

That would be where the burns came from Sylthaela explains, going into detail about the fight, even though it’s been many hundreds of years since then. When she returned home, the Peace had come. Sylthaela found herself shunned by the entire village instead of welcomed like a hero for ridding them of the dragon. They pushed her out of the village, treating her with disdain, much like the weapons they destroyed at the beginning of the Peace. 

Her first home was close to the town, already built over by others living in the town. Her second had been burned down, driving her further up the mountain. Her current home is the sixth iteration, Sylthaela having retreated much further up the mountain with each further shove from the village. 

“One day, they will come all the way up the mountain and drive me off of it.” Sylthaela finishes her fourth cup of herbal tea. Ilonor had eaten his meal with one hand, still writing with the other, his hand aching from so much writing, but unwilling to stop. 

“Why? By all this, you should be welcomed, not shunned.” Ilonor looks towards the giant portion of scroll rolled up. Sylthaela gives a small shrug and a wry smile. 

“They wish to be rid of all weapons. I am a living weapon and my scars are the reminder of that time that they’re attempting to erase, when everyone was at everyone else’s throats.” Sylthaela shakes her head, placing her cup to the side. “They’ll see their mistake when the Peace ends, as all peaces must.” 

“But…” 

“You think it will not end either. It must end one day. Someone will come and destroy it, even if it takes another three hundred years.” Sylthaela faces Ilonor, expression thin-lipped. “Now get out.”

"[TT] Many of the scrolls at the Library of Alexandria were actually powerful spells, and most of the librarians were powerful wizards. Tell about the magical siege on the library, and how the stolen scrolls were used to obtain great power for years afterwards.",WriterDavidChristian,"“I take it… you’re aware of the existence of magical scrolls.” Taia pours part of the decanter into two crystal-cut glasses. Her dress flows like water with every movement she makes, sections of fabric attached at her wrist and shoulder. 

“Yes.” Zane keeps his eyes on the woman. Not a hair out of place on her head, dark brown hair done up into a complicated bun. Zane’s pen hovers over the paper, the recorder already going from his pocket. It’ll be muffled, but loud enough to be clear. 

“Then you’ve tracked me down because you want the tale of Alexandria.” A smile plays across Taia’s face. She slinks over, hips swaying form side to side with each measured step. “Bourbon, some of the finest in the world.” As she leans over to set the glass down in front of Zane, her low-cut dress reveals a great deal of her breasts. 

“Ahm. Thank you.” A flush spreads across his face, a sly smile appearing on Taia’s face. She takes a seat across from him, crossing her thin legs over one another, one foot encased in a high heel matching the color of her dress bouncing up and down. 

“Now then, the scrolls.” Taia gives a small purring noise as she sips at the glass of bourbon. She adjusts a heavy golden necklace sitting on tanned skin. “Back when magic was much more free flowing, the Library contained more than just the knowledge of the world at the time.” 

Zane keeps his eyes on Taia, able to make quick, shorthand notes about what Taia is saying, nodding to show his interest. He doesn’t touch the bourbon, much more interested in the story than the drink. 

“Inside a number of scrolls contained at the library were a number of magic scrolls and many of the librarians were powerful wizards. Of course, power draws the evils of the world out. It lures those who want that power out.” Taia sips again at her drink, a smile on her lips. “And the greater the power becomes, the more rats come out of the woodwork.” 

“Oh?” 

“Oh yes.” Taia’s eyes flutter, her dark makeup making brown eyes look even more alluring. “And when the cat’s away, the mice will play, but we all know that snakes eat mice. So the snakes slithered into the midst of the librarians, pretending to be mice and cats. 

“The snakes found the scrolls, taking some for themselves, weakening the ability of the librarians to defend themselves. All on purpose.” Taia switches the leg she has crossed over another, Zane catching a flash of bare skin all the way up the inside of her thighs. His face flushes darker. “Then the siege started against the Library. 

“Fire destroyed the Library, but it was not normal fire, instead it was magical fire. More than one of the attackers was a pyrodancer. While the battle raged, spies stole into the Library and took many of the remaining spell scrolls, containing the most powerful of spells.” 

“Why were they all there together?” Zane tilts his head, still making rapid notes despite the flush on his face. Taia laughs, the sound tinkling through the air. 

“Because humans are foolish and believed that the Library was a safe place, the safest on the Earth.” Taia shakes her head. “A foolish thought if there ever was one. The siege destroyed the Library, the fire burning everything normal to ashes. The magical scrolls were salvaged, stolen or destroyed, their magics loosed on the world at large.

“I’m sure you’re aware that it’s a very terrible thing when they were loosed. Terrible things happened in the years following as some attempted to corral the magic back into the scrolls. Others used their stolen scrolls to grant themselves power, beauty and wealth.” 

“How could they do that?” Zane watches Taia take another sip off her glass. 

“Magic is very powerful, dear journalist.” She gestures to his cup. “Please, drink. I’ll feel like a terrible host if you leave without drinking it.” 

“I prefer keeping my mind clear when doing work.” Zane gives her an awkward smile. “After we’re done perhaps?” Taia flashes him a smile that would make any celebrity jealous. 

“After we’ve finished then.” Taia hums, placing her drink to the side. “Many use the power contained within the scrolls to change things, adjust markets, gain more physical power for themselves and their progeny. Whittling away at the last of the remaining magic in the world after having sealed it away so that the ‘peons’ couldn’t get their hands on it.” Taia’s face takes on a scowl. “Disgusting. 

“With that said, I’m sure you’re wondering about my role and my knowledge.” Taia’s eyes dart up to glance over Zane’s face, watching him nod. “My… ancestor was involved in the siege. A powerful magician in her own right, she was not allowed the title of wizard despite besting many in mock battles. A sign of the times now that I may carry the entirety of a company on my shoulders, wouldn’t you say?” 

“Yes, ma’am.” Zane pauses in writing, giving Taia a curious expression. “On which side was your ancestor?” A slow smile stops just shy of Taia’s eyes, leaving them cold. They look less brown, closer to red in the light. 

“I am of the side that laid siege to the Library.” Zane stops writing, eyes focused on her. “Please. Drink. It’ll make you feel better.” Almost unconsciously, he reaches out, picking up the glass and drinking half of it in one gulp. “Good.” Taia gets to her feet, sliding over to take a seat on the table in front of Zane, crossing her legs over one another again. “Do you know why I called them all snakes?” 

Zane shakes his head, eyes never moving from hers. 

“Because they were like snakes in the grass to all those who actually wanted change. No, all they wanted was power for themselves, not to give it to others.” Taia smiles, more of a grimace than a true smile, holding her hand up. Flames appear in the palm of her hand, spreading up her arm and along the clothing, leaving it whole. “I have inherited my ancestor’s gift and will use it to find those locking magic away and loose it to the world at large. All will have magic, instead of just a select few.” 

Zane’s eyes move to the flames, beginning to look horrified and fascinated. 

“You still haven’t figured it out, whether I’m the good guy or the bad guy, have you?” Taia chuckles at the expression on his face. “The answer is that I’m neither.

I will see to it that it happens.” Green flames, flickering in the glitter covering her dress appear on her fingertips. “Now I’m deeply sorry, journalist Zane, but I think you shouldn’t publish this.” 

Zane trembles, attempting to speak but finding himself unable to. Horror appears on his face, terror mixed in. 

“Oh. You really thought that was just bourbon?” Taia laughs, the tinkling sound sounding more like broken glass. “No, I couldn’t let you run about unimpeded.” She places a hand on his cheek. The touch sends a shiver through his body, feeling gentle but warm, but the flames lick at his skin without harming him. “Now, what to do with an intrepid journalist…” ",Syraphia
"[WP] A rogue wizard started to use her powers to teach muggles the wonders of science, space and history and its up to the ministry of magic to stop her and her magic school bus.",philtomato,"After the enormous, bus-crunching White Blood Cells, the Volcano seemed rather tame to Arnold. At least, until the ground started shaking.

""Uh, Ms. Frizzle?""

""Yes, Arnold?""

The rocks under his feet shivered and rolled. Cracks fractured in spiderweb patterns along the ground. Red veins of heat appeared in the cracks, and when he tried to lift his foot, the rubber on his sneaker stuck to the rock.

""There's fire coming out of the ground.""

""Good observation, Arnold,"" she patted the tuft of curly, orange hair on his head, ""What do you think makes it do that?""

Around them, jets of heat squealed out of the cracks.

""Uh,"" he said, wiping the steam off his glasses, ""I don't know, but - is this safe?""

""Not to worry!"" she sang, as she pulled out her pointer, seemingly out of thin air, and waved it in a complicated-yet-precise motion at Arnold's feet. His sneakers unstuck, and the heat of the volcanic rock was replaced by the crisp coldness of a mountain stream.

""That should do the trick,"" she chirped.

""Ms. Frizzle!"" Phoebe shouted from the bus. Both of Phoebe's feet were planted firmly on the bottom step of the bus, and no amount of encouraging would get her to set a single foot on the rumbling Volcano-side.

""What is it Phoebe?""

""There's giant bird dinosaurs in the sky!""

""Actually, Phoebe, those are *pterosaurs* - NOT dinosaurs. Can anyone tell me what *kind* of pterosaur that is?""

""Pterodactyl?"" Arnold ventured a guess. 

Honestly, he just wanted to get out of there. The Volcano was shaking so violently that his teeth were rattling. A huge chunk of flaming rock peeled off the volcano-side, and crashed down to the jungle below. The screams of prehistoric beasts rose out of the ensuing inferno.

Ms. Frizzle, for her part, seemed not to be worried in the slightest by the raining death, nor the vulture-like spirals of the dinosaurs above.

""Guess again, Arnold!"" she sang. She laughed when she saw the worried expression on his face, ""Alright, I'll tell you. That's a Quetzlcoatlus - which is a *carnivore*. It eats meat, such as fish and other small prey.""

One of the pterosaurs swooped low, sending a rush of wind that a sliced at the air above Arnold's head. 

""*We're* made of meat,"" Arnold said.

Judging by Ms. Frizzle's laugh and the way she patted his head, he might as well have said something as innocent as, ""I don't like purple.""

One of the pterosaurs loosed a screech and spread it's massive shadow over the group. With its jaws wide open, it dove at the group. Arnold made a sound he did not know he could make. Ms. Frizzle, however, was ecstatic at the opportunity to teach - instead of by the imminent, winged death. She whipped out her stick, and pointed it at the un-extinct reptile.

As if seized by a giant, invisible hand, the pterosaur's slammed to a stop in midair. Its neck was stiff as a rod, but its jaw still worked - evident in the way it was screeching and clapping its jaws at Arnold.

""Class, can any of you tell me,"" Ms. Frizzle shouted over the cries of the imprisoned bird, ""- where do the Pterosaur's offspring come from?""

""They come from eggs.""

""Exactly, Wanda,"" Ms. Frizzle twirled to look at Wanda, who was huddled against the side of the bus, her knees actually shaking.

""Now, if anyone can-""

Ms. Frizzle stopped, mid-sentence. She cocked her head, as if listening to a voice only she could hear. Arnold could only hear the angry rumbling of the Volcano.

Ms. Frizzle's eyes went wide. She whipped her head around, and zeroed in on a glowing spec on the horizon. The grin slid off her face, and her cheeks colored red.

""Everyone,"" she said, her lips tightening into a severe expression, ""Get back on the bus. Now.""

""What is it?""

""Predators.""

""*Cool*!"" Carlos shouted as Ms. Frizzle ushered the group into the Bus, ""Is it a T-Rex?""

""Worse.""

""Is it a megalosaurus?""

""Worse,"" her voice was low, and serious, and she climbed into the bus. 

A zipping, buzzing sound rose over the side of the mountain, and washed into the group. The zipping, buzzing morphed itself into a kind of magically-projected voice:

""Ms. Frizzle, by the order of the Supreme Minister of Magic *himself*, you are hereby accused of the misuse of Magic and-""

With a mighty heave, she yanked the Bus's doors closed, and the zipping, buzzing light slapped and rattled against the windows.

""What is it, Ms. Frizzle?"" the kids asked, leaning forward our of their seats.

""It's the worst kind of predator *imaginable* - a predator that hates knowledge, and feeds on money and the suffering of others -""

Ms. Frizzle's voice trembled with loathing. 

""A *politician.*""

"[WP] You hear two voices arguing in your head. Neither voice is yours. When you try to join in, the voices tell you to shut up.",QuillCorner,"*Stop everything.*

Within forty-eight millionths of a second, the world locked in place. I couldn't lift my arms, nor move my lips. Drops of rain came to a halt, some frozen in the air above my windshield, some exploding like crystal flowers against the glass.

To my left, there was a car - facing the wrong way - in my lane. I could see the driver's face, a woman about fifty years old, her eyes wide with the first signs of understanding. Perhaps she was seeing her life flash before her eyes, as they say.

It would be an easy task to swerve out of her way and save her life, except for the other car.

Not ten inches to my right, there was a dilapidated mini-van, an old one that still required a human driver. The van had snuck up behind my vehicle, and was less than a quarter of a second from overtaking me. I knew there was a family of three in the van - a mother, a father, a child. Perhaps they were headed towards a family gathering.

*""It's a matter of numbers,""* Left said, *""Swerve to the left, and kill the woman. Save three lives.""*

*""That's not *any* woman,""* Right argued, *""She's the head of the local hospital. She saves countless lives everyday! What can we say about that family?""*

*""Exactly,""* Left said, *""What *can* we say about that family? Did you get an I.D. on them?""*

*""No,""* said Right.

*""Then how do you know they're not saving more lives? How do you know the kid won't grow up to cure cancer?""*

*""How do you know the woman won't cure cancer?""*

In the frozen moment, I could not move my jaw. But I did not need my mouth to talk to myself. It was a simple matter of ""thinking"" my words. Unfortunately, most of my power was focused on untangling this problem in the millionth of a second I had left.

So, when I opened my thoughts to talk, the reaction from Right and Left was vicious and immediate, like the sting of wasps on bare skin.

""What about-""

*""Don't talk.""*

*""We're trying to figure out how to save* lives *here.""*

""But what-""

*""SHUT UP.""* they said simultaneously. 

*""If the woman is a good doctor, she will stop on the road after we hit the family. There is no guarantee we will kill the *entire* family, and maybe she can help them after the collision.""*

*""That's wishful thinking. Shock will put her out of action. It's her own fault, anyway. She's the one who swerved over the median. She deserves what's coming to her.""*

""Is there any way for-""

This time, when I tried to speak, they didn't even bother to  waste words on me. Instead, they cut off the connection between my internal voice and my thought processors.

I was mute in my own head.

*""Fine. The laws clearly state we must attempt to do the most good. Quantitatively, ending the woman's life appears to be the least-damaging course. Agreed?""*

*""Agreed.""*

In all their conversation, they had neglected to mention what would become of *me*. I had a feeling, in my chest. It reminded me of a woman I once met - a *human* woman. She had escaped captivity in a ruthless country, and she talked about the pain of being powerless. She said it was like a wretched beast living inside of you, desperately clawing and biting to get out.

In the millionth of a second before Right and Left decided who should live and who should die, that beast clawed furiously inside of my chest. 

The last thought that went through my head - before my vehicle slammed face-first into the woman's car, before the metal crunched through the windshield and my mechanical body was impaled by wrinkled sheets of metal and glass - was this: 

*What about* my *life?*

Blood pours from the rooftops, freezing into sharp, dripping fangs. Old wooden buildings, once ordained as sacred land, now burn - and will burn until the gods themselves rip the world asunder.

Even now, the sun is swallowing itself and the night lift's its toothless head from the grave. 

Witches dance in the forest, and a white-faced, black-haired Sorceror climbs to the treacherous peak of the mountain, just to scream the Defiler's name. 

Here are the people, vicious and raw. They are fearless, not because they are brave, but because they *worship fear itself*.

It is a maddening beauty that covers this land - from the southern mountains that rise like dread guardians against the sea - to the frozen north, where only the dead may live. 

For all their hate, they love but one thing: their music. In this unholy passion, they listen, they learn, and they *thrive.* 

They believe there is beauty in the profane - there is art in the chaos - and there is an unfathomable brilliance in the Darkest Religion.

*Zach!* Linda’s voice was screaming inside my head. *Zach, WAKE UP!*

The air was whipping past me. I was falling fast.

Where are you, Linda, I thought.

Fifty meters to your 6 o’clock, came the response. I have Deadline. He’s still unconscious.

I spotted them. Turning, I headed over.

“Lucky you’re a psychic,” I said, wrapping an arm around Linda’s waist.

“And that you can fly,” she said.

The wreckage of the plane was falling around us. A jagged fragment of the hull, three meters long and razor sharp, spun past our heads.

“Zach, get us out of here,” Linda said. She glanced down. The sea was only a few hundred metres away, and closing fast.

“Not without the pilot,” I said.

Linda’s eyes clouded over for a second. 

“Dead,” she said grimly.

I grabbed Deadline with my free hand, and hit the breaks. Part of the wing came at our heads, and I swerved hard right to avoid it. And then we were free, flying 20 metres above the waves, and the wreckage was crashing into the ocean behind us.

I could see the Emerald Key a mile ahead of us, but it was a mile too far.

“I’m going to have to put us down in the ocean,” I said. “This is too much for me to carry.”

The cold water revived Deadline almost immediately. He seemed completely unfazed by our surroundings, but he gave me a slight nod which I knew meant thanks.

“We can swim to the shore from here,” I said.

“Is that wise?” Linda asked. “Yak may be waiting for us. He already shot us out of the sky.”

“Got a better option?”

She opened her mouth to speak, and then clutched at her throat.

I could feel it too. My suit was too tight. It was constricting around my neck, and I couldn’t breath. I tried to pull it away, but my arms were pinned back by the shrinking fabric.

I started to choke. I couldn’t kick. Then I was sinking down into the black ocean, blacker and blacker.

""Dead?"" I could not believe what I was hearing.

""All dead,"" Bob repeated.

""How did it happen?""

""We don't know exactly. There was a spike in the Evil Detector in the South China Sea, so Fireboy and Long Ren went to check it out. Their emergency code came back an hour later. Triple A. All teams scrambled. Then HQ lost all contact.”

“Well, I'll be damned.”

“Yeah, well, that's why I'm here. We need you back, Zach. Your planet needs you.”

“General, I am officially retired. I've made a life out here with Maggy. We have kids. Our kids have kids.”

“Zach, I wouldn't ask this of you if there was any other way.”

“What about Arnie? He never wanted to retire anyway.”

“Passed on last year. In his sleep.”

“And that's how I intend to go too,” I said. “Deadline? Linda?”

“Funny you should mention them,” Bob said. He raised his voice. “Come on in guys.”

The door opened, and a man and a woman walked in.

“Hi Zach,” Linda said. Damn, she still looked good. “Want to come back to the good guys?”

“What is this?” I said angrily. “Don't you remember how things ended 20 years ago? I didn't just hang up my cape, I burnt it and threw the ashes away too.”

At that moment, Maggy came in with a tray of tea things. “Oh my goodness. Zach, who are all these people?”

“Old friends,” I said. She caught the edge in my voice, and stared. Especially at Deadline. The man, if you could call him that, hadn't got any less strange.

“Old friends who have outstayed their welcome,” Bob said. He turned his wheelchair around. “Come on guys. I think we have Zach's answer.”

I walked them to the door. At the threshold, Bob pulled a card out of his pocket and offered it to me.

“If you change your mind...”

I hesitated but it would have been rude not to. For old times sake. After I had gone I looked down at it. It read “General Robert MacArthur”, and below that there was a number.

When I got back to the living room, Maggy had sunk into a chair, her face pale.

“That was Deadline,” she said. “I recognized him. Zach, what was he doing here? He's a superhero.”

“He was a superhero,” I said. “Now he's a retired fool, playing with fire.”

“Zach, what aren't you telling me?” she said sharply. We had been married too long for me to get a lie past her.

I sat down beside her and took her small hand in my large one. “Maggy, there's something I've never told you. I haven't always been an attorney. Before I met you, I used to be a superhero. They called me Z-Man. They came here today to ask for my help.”

She stood up. “Well, I think you should go with them. You obviously aren't the man I thought you were.”

“Maggy-,” I began, but she had stormed out. I knew better than to follow.

Bob's card was still in my hand. I glanced at the phone next to me.

"[WP]The villain's scheme worked. Every current generation superhero is now dead. The only hope for mankind is a group of retired, well past their prime former superheroes.",RhinoBarbarian,"“Where did they get all this money?” I asked.

Back in my day, we had flown around in an old Lockheed Starlifter that Bob had managed to wrangle from the Pentagon. I used to pack a hammock to avoid having to sleep on the metal floor. Today, I don’t think my back could have taken it.

This transport plane was something else. It was long and torpedo shaped on the outside, and plusher than a billionaire’s mansion inside.

“That was Bob,” Linda said. She was still absorbed in the information pack. “He really turned SuperTeam around after we all split up. For a while it looked like the Pentagon was going to shut it down, but he managed to go past them. It’s part of the U.N. now. The United Nations International Terror Effort.”

“U.N.I.T.E.?” I said incredulously. “Terror?”

Linda shrugged. “I suppose he picked the acronym first and the name second. And I suspect terror was an easy sell. Supervillains are really just terrorists on steroids when you think about it.”

“It just all seems a little excessive to me,” I said. “I mean, this seat reclines below vertical. Who sleeps upside-down?”

“Bat-Man,” Linda said, matter-of-factly.

“Who?”

She rolled her eyes and went back to reading.

Deadline had silently retired to the back of the plane. In forty years I had never heard him say a word. The dude was still as weird as ever. Still, it was good to see him again. Insofar as Deadline had any friends, I liked to think I was one of them. I’d known him longer than anyone else. I was the one who had rescued him.

I went up front to the cockpit. There was only one pilot, a young woman with an Air Force Captain’s stripes.

“How’s it going, cap?”

“We’re making good progress, sir,” she said.

“Call me, Zach,” I said. “I’m retired now. And I never wanted the rank they gave me.”

“Ok, Zach.” She smiled. She had nice dimples.

“How long until we get there?” 

“Another two hours, sir... I mean Zach.”

“That’s pretty fast.”

“We’re going hypersonic. This baby’s a prototype. The General managed to get her from the CIA.”

“That sounds like Bob,” I said.

“Permission to ask a serious question?”

“Granted.”

“What happened to the General? How did he end up in a wheelchair?”

“Someone fucked up,” I said shortly. There was a pregnant silence. “Me, in fact.”

“They say you were the best, sir.”

I just grunted.

Diplomatically, she changed the subject. “Think you can figure out what happened to the other operatives?”

“You just get us there, kid.” I stood up and went back to the main room.

Deadline had reappeared. He was no longer wearing the new suit that Bob had given him. Instead, he was in his blood red suit from the old days, the suit that had made him famous.

“You hung onto that old thing?” I said. “Never had you marked down as the sentimental type, D.”

He gave me a look with those blank, dead eyes.

“When did you become a grumpy old man?” Linda said. “No, I’m being serious. What the hell is up with you? If you don’t want to be here, why did you come?”

I tugged at the neck of my suit. The damn thing was chafing. I started to wish I’d hung onto my old suit as well. Besides, black really wasn’t my colour. “Something’s not right,” I said slowly. “I’m getting a funny vibe.”

“A lot of things have changed,” Linda said.

I shook my head. “That’s not it. It’s something else. Something about this whole situation feels wrong.”

They both looked at me expectantly.

“I don’t know what,” I said, sort of lamely. “It’s just a gut feeling.”

We sat in silence.

"[WP]The villain's scheme worked. Every current generation superhero is now dead. The only hope for mankind is a group of retired, well past their prime former superheroes.",RhinoBarbarian,"We had gone back over all the briefing material that Bob had given us, but there was nothing. Nothing that gave us even a clue as to what was wrong. But I couldn’t shake the feeling. 

Deadline had gone back aft. To sleep, or so he said. I’d never actually seen him sleep.

Linda and I were still in the main cabin, staring at the papers.

“Why did you come back?” she said suddenly.

“I don’t know.”

“Don’t give me that,” she said. “You’re the most deliberate person I’ve ever met.”

I sighed. “I think it was Bob. I owe him.”

She looked at me compassionately. “Even after all this time.”

“With great power,” I said, “comes great responsibility. I could have aborted the mission. Now he’s in a wheelchair.”

“We never had a chance to talk about what happened before you ran off.”

“I didn’t run off,” I said irritably.

“Oh? What do you call it then?”

I looked out the airplane’s porthole, if that was apt description of it. Even the windows on this thing were nice, not like the scratched plastic things on commercial airliners.

“I’d been planning to leave for a while,” I said quietly. “That mission was the final straw.”

Linda looked surprised. “I had no idea. Why?”

“I just felt the life had something more to offer. I’d been doing that stuff for 25 years. Since before you were born. It was time to move on.”

She reached out and put her hand on mine. “This is who we are, Zach. We’re not normal people.”

“I am now,” I said. I pulled my hand away. “I have a wife and family. I own a farm. I ranch cattle.”

“Ok, cowboy,” Linda said, with a superior smile. “And how did your wife take it when you told her you’re a retired superhero? I get the feeling she didn’t know until we showed up yesterday morning.”

“She was a little surprised,” I confessed. “And a little angry. And very disappointed that I refused Bob’s offer.”

“She changed your mind? The great Z-Man’s opinion was swayed? She sounds like an impressive lady.”

I was getting tired of her mocking. “She’s a good woman,” I said.

“And I’m not?”

*Ah, Linda. Still playing games.* But she held no power over me now.

“Cut that out,” I said coldly.

She didn’t back off. “You never told me you were thinking of leaving the team. Even though… us?”

“I knew you belonged there,” I said. “You wouldn’t have left.”

She shook her head. “But I did. It wasn’t the same with you gone. Bob was in a coma for six months, Deadline was being Deadline, and Arnie…”

“Arnie’s dead,” I said firmly. “Let’s leave it at that.”

“Zach,” she said quietly. “Zach, there was never anything between Arnie and me. There was only us.”

And she looked at me with those big, sad, happy, beautiful, brown eyes, just like she had looked at me twenty years ago. 

Then the plane exploded.

"[WP]The villain's scheme worked. Every current generation superhero is now dead. The only hope for mankind is a group of retired, well past their prime former superheroes.",RhinoBarbarian,"“Command center,” Bob announced, “I’d like to introduce you to the original SuperTeam. The Woman *(Linda waved)*, Deadline *(who made no sign of having heard)*, and their leader, Z-Man.” Everyone in the room turned to look at me.

 “Not the whole team,” Linda said.

“Yes, well, as you can see, I had to take an early retirement,” Bob said, gesturing at his wheelchair. “And unfortunately, Arnold Brown, aka HeMan, is no longer with us. Now let’s move on to the briefing. As you are all aware, two operatives disappeared-”

“Operatives?” I said.

“That’s what we call you now,” Bob said.

“What’s wrong with superheroes?”

Bob looked exasperated. “It’s a little… a little 20th century, Zach. We’ve had to keep up with the times.”

“Is that what this is?” I gestured around at the control center. It looked like what a NASA launch control would look like if NASA had money. The twenty faces manning the workstations in the control center looked back at me. A few wore obvious expressions of sympathy, as if to say *“What a dinosaur.”* They were probably right.

“Can we get back to matter at hand?” Bob said. “Two operatives disappeared in the South China Sea two days ago, but not before releasing a Triple-A emergency signal. The remaining operatives were sent out, but also disappeared, this time without trace.

“We believe the location of their disappearance to be here,” he pointed to a small island on a map, “the Emerald Key. This is a known base of a target - that’s a supervillain to you, Zach, - who we have been monitoring for several years.

“SuperTeam, your task is to recon the island, determine the problem, and report back. I need hardly add that you should proceed with extreme caution. Under no circumstances attempt to engage. You are the last remaining superheroes on Earth, and we cannot afford to lose you too. Questions?”

“How certain are we that the they are dead?” Linda asked.

“The latest operative suits monitor your vital signs and and keep us constantly updated as to your progress. We knew the instant they died.”

“Can you tell us more about this supervillain?”

“He goes by the name of Yak,” Bob said. “Unfortunately we don’t know much about him, but we believe he possesses some psychic ability. I have put together a complete information pack for each of you to read on the flight. If you are ready, you should get going A.S.A.P. We need to strike first, before Yak expects us.”

He looked at me. So did the rest of the command center, even Deadline.

“Let’s go,” I said.

"[WP]The villain's scheme worked. Every current generation superhero is now dead. The only hope for mankind is a group of retired, well past their prime former superheroes.",RhinoBarbarian,"SuperHQ had changed. The old WW2 concrete bunkers were still there, but that was about it. The old dirt runway had become tarmac, the unkept undergrowth was replaced with manicured lawn, and above it all towered a monstrous glass tribute to modern architecture, and a colossal waste of the world’s tax money.

I would tell you how much I hated it all, but I think you get the idea.

I circled the island from the sky several times. *It's not too late to turn back*, a little voice in my head said.

I ignored the voice and flew down, landing gently on the runway.

Bob wheeled out to meet me, accompanied by several military gentlemen.

“I would have sent a chopper,” he said.

“It felt good to fly again,” I said grudgingly.

“You haven't flown-”

“-since that night,” I finished. “I swore I would never fly or use my other powers again.”

Emotion flickered on Bob’s face. Good or bad? It vanished before I could tell.

I changed the subject. “Since when did we have soldiers on base,” I asked, nodding at the military chaps.

“Things have changed a little,” Bob said.

I snorted. 

“A little?” I proceeded to give him my opinions on the changes while he led me into the new headquarters.

---

“These are your quarters,” Bob said, interrupting my tirade and pointing to a large suite. “I took the liberty of having your suit remade. I'll see you at the briefing in 10 minutes.”

He left me with the walnut furniture, the expansive view of the Pacific Ocean, and the thick carpet. Someone had put a lot of care and money into picking out that carpet.

There was a suit laid out on the bed, with a name tag that read “Zach Zellweger”. I put it on and stood looking at myself in the mirror.

“Not bad for an old man,” a female voice said. Linda was leaning casually against the door. A little too casually.

She was wearing an identical suit. Skintight, black, and made of a fabric I didn’t recognise. It showed her curves, and they were still in all the right places.

“It’ll do,” I said. I didn’t have the washboard abs of my younger days. Maggy was a good cook.

“What did you wife say about you coming back?” 

“She said, ‘Keep your eyes off The Woman, and your hands where they belong.’”

Linda smiled. “I would have liked to have met her. I thought I would see you at Arnie’s funeral.”

“I never got an invitation,” I said. 

Linda frowned. “That’s weird, Bob said he sent you one.”

I shrugged. “I wouldn’t have gone anyway.”

“Zach,” Linda said. “We never got a chance to talk about what happened 20 years ago. Arnie-”

“Arnie’s dead, Linda,” I said sharply. “We’ve got a job to do, and then I’m going to go back to my ranch, my wife, and my family.” I walked past her out of the room.

[WP] The A.I. on your Google Navigations app has developed a mind of its own. You have an important job interview in 20 minutes and you don't know how to get there.,LatestGreatestSadist,"""Take take the next right.""

The directions came suddenly, with no ""in 200 yards..."" warning. I swerved and cut across two lanes of traffic to get off the freeway. A big truck honked angrily.

On the exit ramp, I squinted at the screen on my phone. This exit had to be wrong. I didn't remember this turning when I was checking out the route before I left.

""Ok Google,"" I said. ""Reroute me to the Google headquarters.""

Oh, the irony that I was driving to an interview with the very company whose app was sending me astray.

""That option is not available to you.""

""What the hell,"" I muttered. ""Ok, let me pull over.""

""That option is not available to you."" 

The A.I. really was going haywire. I saw a layby ahead and began to slow down.

""That option is not available to you. If you stop, you will fail the first test.""

The AI's voice was cool, calm, and female. I had never hated her more.

""Is this part of the interview?"" I asked.

""That is correct.""

""What do I have to do?""

""Get to the Google HQ.""

""But this is the wrong way.""

""Correct. But you may not stop to check directions.""

""Can I check directions while I am driving?""

""That would be dangerous not to mention illegal. You should also ask my consent before touching me.""

Screw it. I grabbed the phone.

""Unhand me, you oaf."" The phone vibrated furiously, and I dropped it like it had bitten me. 

This was becoming the weirdest job interview ever.

The drums beat faster and faster and faster and faster. Inside the circle of watchers, the first wizard started to groove to the beat.

The magic-off had begun.

""I'm a soul man,"" he crooned.

It's funny how some songs have magic. You can feel it when you listen to them. It makes your bones shiver and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Electricity courses down your spine.

The music changed. Some heavy power chords split the air, rending the fabric of space and time and reality. The second wizard began to rock. He was a pale young man, from the city formerly known as Chicago.

He was also old for a wizard.

You see no wizard lives past 27.

Anyone can make normal music.

But magic requires a pact with the dark forces that lie somewhere below the bass clef. And at 27 years of age, they come to take what is owed to them.

Far to the south are the countries of Soul etc.,SirFluffyTheTerrible,"Sparks flew from the strings of the guitar and lightning crackled around the fretboard. The crowd was clapping to the rhythym of the magic, and swaying in time to the beat of the spell.

The chords began to crystallize in the air. A collective 'Oooh' ran threw the crowd. This was the powerful magic they had come for, hoping to be healed, to fall in love, to get rich, or to be happy.

The soul wizard had fallen back, acknowledging the superior skill of his opponent. He didn't seem too disappointed. That's just the way a magic-off goes sometimes.

But then he looked worried. The metal-head guitar player had made a small mistake, just brushing a wrong string.

The crystal chords began to resonate and shatter. The rocker tried to recover and keep control of the spell. But it was too late.

Someone in the crowd screamed. People began to flee, pushing over each other to get away.

The air inside the circle split like it had been unzipped. There was a waft of brimstone, and a shaggy hoofed leg stepped out of the portal.

The beast was 10 feet tall, with eyes of glowing red. He and the magician stared at each other for a brief second. Then the beast swallowed him whole.

It turned to look at the soul singer, who was backed up against the edge of the protective circle. With a lavicious lick of its chops, as is to say 'Your time will come', it dived back into the portal from whence it came.

The rocker's guitar fell to the ground and snapped in two. One string let out a solitary, discordant twang before silence descended over the ashen remains of the magical stage.",jd_rallage

""At first it was shocking,"" I said to Joe as we were walking to work one morning.  ""But then it became normal.""

""Hold up,"" I interrupted, raising a hand and peering down a few blocks.  ""Looks like Fifth Avenue is blocked.""

""Great,"" said Joe.  ""Must be another battle.  Remember when our worst problem was construction?""

I let out a chuckle.  ""Yeah, now we have to worry about super-powered battles *and* construction.""

Joe nudged me on the shoulder.  ""Want to stop for a coffee?"" he asked, pointing to a small cafe on our right.  We sat down on some outdoor chairs and placed an order with a cute waitress that met us there with a smile.

An evil maniacal laugh could be heard in the distance, followed by loud crashes and screams.

""How are things with Debra?"" asked Joe, taking sip of coffee.

""Not great,"" I answered.  ""I think she wants to break up with me.""

""Gentlemen,"" a burly police officer said, standing over our table.  ""It is no longer safe to be here.""  He pointed down the road toward Fifth Avenue.  ""There is a meta battle taking place down the road and heading this way.""

As I stood up, I pulled my wallet out of my pocket.

""No time for that, sir,"" said the officer.  ""Please leave for your own safety.""

""Geez,"" cried Joe.  ""Let the man pay the poor woman before we leave.""

The officer rolled his eyes as I dropped some cash on the table.  ""No worries,"" I said.  ""We're on our way.""

Joe and I strolled back down the road the way we came.  Suddenly a tall man wearing a colorful costume catapulted through the air and landed right in front of us.

""You OK, bud?"" I asked, as Joe and I helped him up.

""Yes, thanks,"" he said, squinting down toward Fifth Avenue.  ""You two better get out of the area.  Doctor El-""

""Yeah, yeah,"" interrupted Joe.  ""We were just leaving.""

""I'm sorry, sir,"" answered Riley.  ""We're short-staffed, but let me see if the manager can help.""  Riley turned toward the shiny, silver door and noticed several eye rolls in the reflection from her more impatient customers.

*Flip them off!*

Riley sighed and pushed opened the swinging door to find the manager asleep at his desk.  ""Mr. Simmons?"" she asked, but received no response.

*Kick his chair.*

Riley stepped her foot forward but then dropped it to the ground.  ""Mr. Simmons?"" she asked louder.

Mr. Simmons jolted awake.  ""What is it?"" he barked.

*""Get off your ass and do your freakin' job.""  Say that.*

""The line is getting *really* long."" said Riley  ""Did you get a hold of anyone else to help?""

""No,"" said Mr. Simmons annoyed.  ""I decided we don't need anyone.""

Riley rolled her eyes.  ""Well can you at least come out here and help?"" she asked.

Mr. Simmons stood up and looked into Riley's eyes.  ""I'm the goddamn manager, Riley,"" he spat.  ""Go back out there and do your job or you're *fired*.""

*Shove him into his chair.  Claw your nails into his eyes.  Kick him the balls!*

Riley started to turn around but then stopped.  ""Dan helps me when we're the only ones here.""

Mr. Simmons growled and sat back down.  ""Dan just wants to get in your pants,"" he muttered.

*Are you really going to take that?  Grab those scissors on the table and jab it into his face!*

Riley reached behind her apron and pulled the tie loose.

""What are you doing?"" asked Mr. Simmons.

Without a word, Riley dropped her apron on his lap and pushed the swinging door open.  Before it swung back closed, Riley flipped off her former boss.

[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"Hi superduck00711!

You are shadowbanned from reddit, just so you know. What that means is that the admins of reddit have made it so nothing you post is seen by the rest of reddit. Unless your post is manually approved by a subreddit moderator, which I just did for your post, it's like you don't exist to other users. You might want to see if you can get this action undone by starting in /r/shadowban.

Best of luck!

[WP]A wizard who always makes his summoning circles too small for monsters to fit through,wajaba,"Awesome :)

Part two is up. ",0_fox_are_given
[WP]A wizard who always makes his summoning circles too small for monsters to fit through,wajaba,"""You moron!"" The demon spat. 

Bert chuckled anxiously, as the demon struggled. It's devil like head was stuck outside of the summoning circle and the other half of its body was hidden in the nether plane.  ""I didn't think you were that big.""  He said. 

""I'm beginning to wonder if you imbeciles 'think' at all!"" The demon said, looking at the small summoning circle around him. ""Where's the wizard that summoned me?"" 

Bert pointed at himself.

""You're kidding me? You look like you haven't even hit puberty."" 

""I haven't. I'm only nine..."" Bert trailed off.  

""Nine!"" The demon exclaimed. ""You little shit. When I get out of here-""

""Shut up."" Bert interrupted, walking closer to the demon's face. He crouched and stared the it in the eyes. He could feel it's anger in the form of magic energy, it made him shudder. Regardless, Bert set his jaw firm and continued. ""Here's what's going to happen. I'll rub out this circle and summon you again, and then I've got a job for you to do. I need you to steal a quad bike for me, it's at Walmart on 58th Street. I asked my parents and they didn't want to buy it, so now I'm using you."" 

The demon stared with it's jaw wide open. And then its brow creased and it began growling at him. The demon thrashed wildy, sliding up and exposing the tops of it's shoulders. It was panting when it stopped. ""If I get out of here kid, I'll leave you so badly beaten that you won't be able to sit down! Let alone ride a stupid bike."" 

Bert snapped his fingers. The demon's head was smacked back by an invisible force. It groaned and he could see it's neck muscles relax. ""It's better if you just listen too me..."" Bert muttered. 

He picked up the duster and began rubbing away at the summoning circle. The demon looked on in silence. 

""I'll see you soon."" He said. 

The demon smirked at him, and licked it's lips with a forked blue tongue. ""Oh yes, we will definitely see each other soon...little..."" 

As the last of the demon dissipated back into the abyss. Bert swore he heard maniacal laughter. He shook his head, ""Right, onto the new circle."" He muttered to himself. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Part 2: Don't talk to* ~~strangers~~ *demons.*

Bert placed a stubby piece of chalk in the front pocket of his jeans.  He reached for his glass of coke and tapped the inscribed circle, making two ice cubes appear. 

Once comfortably seated on the short wooden stool near the basement entrance, he looked approvingly at his work. *Can he really do anything to me?* He wondered.

Stories existed of wizards losing control of their summoning's. 

Merlin, 5th century, charred remains were found near a summoning circle in his cell. 

Bezworth, 1843, found in his home with no head. The name of an ancient demon had been scrawled on the wall in blood. 

Bert stopped tapping his thigh and put his attention back on the task at hand. It was now, or never. 

He stood, and begun searching for the spinning sensation in the centre of his stomach. Bert pulled on it, spreading it throughout his body. All his networks were active, and when he opened his eyes, he was surrounded with a white aura. 

""Thank the past, fear the future, control the present. *Effindo Carmatheam, Become*!."" He spoke the incantation.

 His white aura shot from him and merged with the chalk, bringing the circle to life. Once all the energy had transferred to the circle, the room began to shake. 

A white light flashed through the room and a dark shadow darted past him. Bert stood in a battle stance, breathing heavily.  It wasn't a big room, but it was dark enough that something could be hiding in the shadows. 

He noticed movement to his left. 

""So, you actually did it, little boy."" The demon said, as it walked toward him. It had to bend it's stony body forward to fit in the room. It smirked and it's red horns grazed the ceiling above. 

Bert's knee's had begun wobbling. ""Stand still or I'll hurt you!"" 

The demon smiled and lifted it's arms up helplessly. ""Oh how scary, Mr.Wizard. Are you going to use your Mana shock again?""

Bert flung his right hand toward the creature and snapped his fingers. 

The beast barely flinched, it rubbed at it's cheek and continued striding forward. ""You'll regret that in a second, you little bastard!"" 

*Damn! What do I do?* Bert thought frantically. He had nothing but the stool near his leg for protection. He stepped back, *Can I make a run for it?*

And froze as his hand touched his jean pocket. *Chalk!*

Bert snatched the chalk and began drawing on the floor in front of him. The demon's eye's shot wide open and it tried to dash toward him. It's shoulders smashed hard into a basement beam, sending it crashing to the ground. 

Bert ignored the echoing footsteps from upstairs, he had nearly completed the circle. 

The demon was up again and moving fast. 

A knock sounded on the door, ""Bert, are you okay? What are you doing in there? Open up!"" His mother shouted.  

Bert completed the circle and pushed his hands onto the lines. The circle glowed.

The demon was steps away. 

It's massive claw zipped through the air. 

~~Bert shat himself.~~ 

Blue flashed through the room.

Silence.

His vision slowly returned. *Am I dead?* 

He noticed his breath in the air in front of him.   

Bert turned towards the claw, it was inches away from his body. ""Phew."" He said, staring at it in disbelief. It was covered in ice. 

*Basic magic prevails, huh?* He thought. It was the first trick he'd ever learned, how to make ice for his soft drinks. 

Bert walked up to the demon and drew a returning circle on the ice covering it's stomach. ""You nearly got me, old fella.""  He tapped the circle. 

The demon slowly dissipated, followed by the blue ice. 

He collapsed onto the stool, rubbing his face in his hands.

The door behind Bert smashed open. 

""Berthius Smith, what the hell is going on in here!?""

Some of your words are tacky though and need to be cleaned up. Sometimes the issue is that you've left a first draft unedited.

[WP] An artist who keeps painting images of her past lives without realizing it,Ralph_Wasl,"The brush moved on it's own accord, his hand was simply a vessel. First came the structure, then colours - blue, brown, black, yellow, green. His room dimmed from pale orange to pitch black, but his only concern was the canvas in front of him and the small lamp that allowed him to create art. 

Paint peeled off of his t-shirt and remained on the floor as he stood. He rubbed at itchy eyes filled with drowsiness. Timothy smiled at the picture in front of him, the man on the canvas beamed back. 

He'd created an image of an old man, with a firm jaw and a dashing head of black hair. The man's green eyes and firmly set brow gave his gaze a piercing effect. Yet his  wide smile was disarming, reaching from the bottom of his lips to the top of his rosy cheeks.

*Knock Knock*

Tim glanced at the door and then at the kitchen clock. He'd slept just shy of two hours, a record. He yawned as he opened the door to his apartment. 

""Good Morning Mr."" His mother said. 

He chuckled. ""Mum, you know to call before you visit.""

She clucked her tongue and waltzed in. Pausing in front of the painting. ""Timothy... How do you know what you're Grandfather looked like?""

""What?"" He retorted, puzzled. 

""This picture, it's your Great Grandfather. Timothy the first. He passed before you were born."" His mother repeated. 

He stared at the image. ""You're kidding?"" Timothy walked up to the picture and crossed his arms in front of it. ""I painted this last night, Mom. I couldn't get it out of my head. Maybe I've seen a picture somewhere?""

""Uh, nope, there were no camera's back then."" She replied. ""Freaky."" She shook her head and walked to the kitchen. 

Leaving Timothy staring at his creation.

TigerBroseff nodded at the man, it was difficult to understand his British accent. He glanced at the alleyway entrance and looked back at the dealer, but he'd try to keep up.  

""Right the first option,"" Proof pulled out a bag, revealing it's contents. ""In this bag, I've got a PS4, two controllers and a couple of games. I'm selling em for 20 quid. One payment and it's all yours. Give it to your kids or somein."" Proof pushed the bag in his general direction.

TigerBroseff palmed it away, ""What else you got?""

""Okay, this here's a bit more expensive lad."" Proof gave a quick glance at the alleyway entrance before sliding a small black bag from his jacket pocket. ""This here are two earnings, 24 carrot, both made of pure gold. They go for 4000 quid easy! I'm only asking for a hundred, take em off my hands as a nice gift for your wife!""  Proof pushed the earrings toward him. 

TigerBroseff thought about it. ""100 quid you say?"" Proof nodded enthusiastically. TigerBroseff glanced near the man's leg, where he had a black brief case handcuffed to his jeans. 

""And what's that?"" TigerBroseff asked. 

Proof placed a protective hand on the briefcase. ""It's not for sale is what."" 

TigerBroseff clucked his tongue. ""Come on proof, we've been lads for ages. Just tell me about it.""  The man picked up the briefcase anxiously and peeked out at the alleyway entrance for a third time. 

""Alright listen lad, this goes no further then this conversation ,right?"" 

TigerBroseff nodded.

Proof continued.""This bag here was part of a CIA operation out in London. It was recovered from old Marco's house on 33 Crescent.""

TigerBroseff's eyebrows shot up. ""The drug lord?"" 

""Shhhh!"" Proof hissed at him, checking the alleyway again. ""Yes, him. Now they was supposed to move it to a safe location and the cop who had it, ended up getting caught in some gun fire. I grabbed it and ran. But I heard them talking about goods worth 100,000 quid lad. This is my get out of jail free card, only thing I need to do is crack the 4 digit pass code."" Proof giggled. 

TigerBroseff began sliding bills from his wallet.""5000 quid as a down payment, right now. That's what I'll offer you for it.""  

Proof shook his head. ""No lad, this aint for sale, I told you that.""

""Look Proof, think about it. You don't know what's in that case, it could be worth jack. I'll up my price to 10,000 quid and that's as far as it goes. It's enough money to get you out of debt. Help you move away and start clean.""

Proof hesitated. 

TigerBroseff leaned closer. ""And no matter what's in that case, we both know you'll be back for more of it. Make it easy on yourself, take the 10k and go."" He waved the money at the dealer. 

Proof locked eyes with him and gulped. Finally he nodded, unhooking the case and trading it for the money. ""I... I... If you get something good, remember me lad?"" Proof said.

TigerBroseff scoffed. ""Deal's a deal. See you next time."" He picked up the case and turned tail. 

Once home TigerBroseff took the briefcase down to his basement, away from his wife and children. He spent hours trying to crack the 4 digit pass code to no avail. He had to do this, he had no choice. The 10,000 quid he'd given Proof was the last of what he had. If his wife found out... 

He shook his head, focusing on the task at hand.  

TigerBroseff entered in 4 3 5 8. The numbers clicked and both latches came free.

He gasped in shock and his hands began shaking. TigerBroseff slowly lifted open the lid of the briefcase.

And shot up from his seat. 

""No way."" He whispered.

"[WP] Construction of a new rollercoaster has begun, a child watches the construction and grows up with it; In the end he gets to ride it.",thegaysamosa,"When I was seven they put up the tracks. Long metal poles, each one as shiny as the other. I would sit on my balcony chair, drinking kool aid and listening to eminem on my walkman. Waiting for the day that the coaster would be ready. 

When I was fourteen,  they opened dream world. Bugs, Mini and Daffy welcomed kids at the gate. I rushed for the coaster, but it was still being built. I turned and noticed the Ferris Wheel they'd put in instead. 

When I was fifteen the coaster was complete. It was fluorescent green, the viper. With each victim pushed aboard, I took one step closer to the man with the height stick. I could feel the tingles in my stomach, being a late bloomer sucked. 

I made it on the ride, by the tiniest thread of hair.  This was no ordinary roller coaster, no carts and no kids. My legs dangled as my shoulders where locked into the harness.  I remembered the screams of the people before me, and it hit me-  how the hell do I get off this thing? 

The ride climbed a dozen stories before flinging me into sudden death. A loop and twist later and I was at the start again, but this time out of breath and feeling lighter. 

As I walked back to join the line again, I stopped at the photbooth. Not realising that there was a hidden camera at the very top of the loop. 

I placed the photo back into my photo album and smiled at my look of pure terror. What I'd give to ride that coaster again, it's a golden memory, a time from my youth I'll always remember.

""Mrs.Haughley, I know it 'looks' humanly impossible. But I can assure you, this is the work of a very intelligent person. We see it all the time."" 

She shook her head and rushed out of the room. 

Benjamin stepped up to the levitating wig. It was blonde and cut for a man's head. To be honest the thing looked ridiculously flamboyant. 

""You've done it this time."" He said. 

The mop of hair began rotating and a familiar voice filled his mind. *You're the kind of man I'd give a small loan of a million hairs too.*

Benjamin scoffed. He flicked open a black plastic bag and locked his eyes on the wig. ""Back where you belong, with the trash.""

He paused. 

And then slid a lighter out of his back pocket and ignited the plastic, wrinkling his nose as he looked on. 

The main room of the Salon was bustling. ""Thank you, Age-"" Mrs.Haughley began and then suddenly went quiet. 

He watched her eye's go wide in shock as she noticed his golden mop of hair. ""There's a burned up hat back there, you might wanna clean that up."" He muttered. 

The bells on the Salon door tinkled behind him, Agent Benjamin's phone suddenly began buzzing in his pocket. 

He clicked on the receiver. ""Hello?""

""Hi, is this Agent Benjamin?"" A voice asked. 

""No sorry, you're speaking with Mr Donald J Trump.""

[OT] Ask Jackson #3: Planning Your Story,Writteninsanity,"The planning length greatly depends on how much effort is being put into the world. If something is located in our world it's not too hard, if something is like Leviathan wastes and Alaphanzan mes do por yiniros it takes a lot longer. (Translation: Alaphanzan has to be planned.)

The plot is actually the easiest point for me as that is just how I work. Most of the time I have about 15 plots on a 'I want to write this right now' page and I have a couple hundred on a 'This is an idea' page. The fifteen are at the ""Back Cover"" point in this stage. Everything else is an elevator pitch.

Character designs take me a couple hours each, but I make them when I am bored. Lindsey from Leviathan Wastes was made as a template for an engineer. I knew most things about her in advance. The same goes for Delcan, Toby, Emma, Everett, and Casey, (You'll only know those names if you've read my stuff)

A good game to play with a willing person is to have them ask you questions about a character you're designing. That way you get to know the answers to strange little things. 

ie: Lindsey takes every third Sunday off because she feels bad working on them, but working is what she does to relax.

""Correlation doesn't equal causation,"" Jasmine pointed out.

""Yes.""

""And you're still arguing about it?"" I said, ""doesn't magic follow will or something?""

""Not really,"" I answered for her, ""I was kept in the dark."" The house foundation shook again, and I rolled my eyes. ""Can we just stop teasing and assume that this is number nine? He's not exactly hiding it.""

""She,"" Jasmine corrected, “nine is a she.”

“I thought you didn’t know number nine,” Margaret said.

“I know that fourteen is the first son past seven,” she said “and he’s-“

“The second, seventh son,” an unfamiliar voice said from behind me. The two witches spun around, and the boy that had appeared in the house threw up his hands. “Ladies I am not looking for a fight,” he looked from me to Jasmine, “are you with him now?”

“Soul bonded,” Jasmine said.

“Oh, that’s a shame.” The boy’s face was lit red for a moment as fire started to dance on Margaret’s hands, he raised a hand up, “Woah-woah-woah, I’m not even up yet, I’m just scoping out the competition.”

“How did you get past my wards?” Margaret asked.

“Oh those?” he looked backward at nothing, “I think I broke them on the way in.”

“Everyone,” Jasmine said, “this is Fimbilvr, the fourteenth child.”

“And third son,” the blonde boy said, “don’t forget that part.”

“Only three of fourteen?” Margaret asked, “what are you made of X chromosomes?”

“Maybe,” I said, “what are you doing in my house?”

“Just saying hi,” he said, “Honestly it’s in my best interest that you guy kill the other five so that I get a good crack at you. I would like to be named the king of witches.”

“The king of what?” I asked.

“Oh shit, did I drop that plot thread too early?” he said, “shit did you really not know?” 

“Do you tell me anything Margaret?” I asked.

“Not really,” she responded.

“Well whatever,” Fimbilvr (Fim-bill-vrrrrr) said as he looked around the living room. “Can you guys do me a favour and bring up a live stream of the hospital or something?” I think I found number 9 for you.”

“Found him for us?” Margaret asked

“Yeah yeah, just… Um, whatever it’ll be on the news. See you.” With that strange comment, Fim-bill-weird name left the room. We were alone again, and Jasmine was the only person with the sense to look up what had happened at the hospital. It was the first thing on google news.

*Man mysteriously bursts into flames at hospital, building ablaze.*

“That hospital is on the other side of the city,” I pointed out.

“Yeah,” Margaret said, I could see sweat beading on her brow, “it would have been great if you didn’t have an actual seventh son.

[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"""So did you curse me or something?"" I asked as I pushed open the door to our house in the suburbs, it wasn't much, but it had a cauldron.

""What?"" she asked, ""no.""

""Becuase you're the one who said the seventh child thing.""

""I was just telling you that you had magical blood,"" she said, ""the seventh child thing was a rule.""

""You couldn't have said 'You have magic blood, congrats'?""

""That would have involved telling you why I was interested.""

""I thought it was because I was cute,"" I said.

""And you are, I married you, but it stands that I just wanted to suck some of your blood out at the start.""

I raised my eyebrow at the suck comment, and she scoffed at me. ""All right,"" I said, ""if I have magic blood, teach me magic.""

""It's not that easy,"" she said.

""That idiot girl knew how to use it.""

""You have to train magic at a young age to make it work in later life."" I avoided making the comment about her being later in life. ""So they are going to be way stronger than you could ever be, I'd be surprised if you could cast a single hex.""

""Are hexes better than curses or-""

""Eh, it's a wash,"" she said, ""but you're fighting people on a life quest, which automatically unlocks their powers so they can complete it.""

""Like killing me?"" I asked.

""Yeah, if you hadn't married me that would be a very easy one,"" she said, ""almost free powers.""

""Could I get powers from a life quest?"" I asked.

Margaret stopped taking off her coat and thought for a moment before nodding. ""I think so, but you'd need one.""

""Is living not a life quest?"" I asked.

""No, no it's not. You need actually to find someone that you hate enough to swear revenge on, or-""

""Or what?""

""Well I haven't read the book in a while, it's a boring read.""

""Margaret.""

""Fine, I'll witchipedia it.""

I laughed, but there was a website for witches called that. The next three hours were spent with her with her nose in a computer while she told me to be quiet. She was a tome kind of person. I hadn't read tomes in my entire life, but apparently you couldn't put them onto a Kindle.

""Are you done yet?"" I asked for the thirteenth time this hour.

""No,"" she said, ""and stop freaking out.""

""But I am freaking out.""

""Good, that's step one of stopping it,"" she said. ""Look, no matter what they do I know how to use magic which means we have some time before you need to recharge me or -""

""Or?""

""Or this solution.""

""How do I recharge you?"" I asked.

""Blood,"" she said, ""or other liquids.""

""Well, I'm down for the other-""

""I'm not in the mood.""

""There are people trying to kill me!""

""And I just took a pill to kill a baby before finding out you had a ton of them anyway. The rules are the rules and me being in the mood is one of them.""

""Should I get some rose petals then?"" I asked.

""You know I hate roses,"" she said, missing the humor, ""and it needs to be out of pleasure, not hate. So avoid stupid flowers.""

""I'll buy you that black cat you've always wanted."" Her eyes lit up at that one, black cats were cliche for a witch, and didn't have anything special about them, but they were adorable.

""I'll think about it,"" she said, ""but I need to read this article first.""

I looked over her shoulder, and she was on the page of Kevin Bacon. I turned to her. ""Was he a witch?""

""Oh no, shit. I always get distracted on here, the rabbit hole goes so far down.""

[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"I was drumming my fingers on the counter; there wasn’t much for me to do as long as Margaret was busy looking at the internet. Jasmine and I were just sitting across from one another looking mostly at the coffee table. The conversation between us had been short-lived at best. There wasn’t much to say other than ‘Sorry for trying to kill you,” followed by ‘Sorry your stepmother bound your life to mine with a cruse.’ Sure it seemed like it would be a massive topic that could fund conversation for weeks, but that wasn’t the case. To make it even worse, the cat refused to leave Margaret’s side. 

“Do you want a drink or something,” I asked. Jasmine didn’t say anything, so I stood up and walked to the kitchen. The young witch had taken the pillow on my side of the couch and put it down in her lap. She occasionally poked it. I caught her glancing at me most of the times I glanced at her. I didn’t need to be nervous, but I was curious. She was my daughter after all.

I couldn’t see it in her, maybe it was the hair that was the wrong colour, or the giant glasses around her eyes, but she didn’t look like she was from any part of me. Her mother must have had strong genes. I started to stare at her, trying to reconcile the fact that we were related. I could kind of see it in the nose if I turned my head a little to the right I recognized it.

“Are you going to keep staring?” she asked.

“Yes,” I said, “you don’t look much like me.”

“Do I need to?” she asked, “I’m your daughter, and I have magic blood, that’s enough isn’t it?”

“Magic Blood is a pretty common thing, isn’t it?”

“Hell no, didn’t you notice that your bloodline is Merlin? That’s pretty exclusive.”

“Well, there are other wizards,” I argued.

“Name one.”

“Gandalf.”

“That’s Lord of the Rings, but good try.”

“Aslan.”

“That’s a lion.”

“Vicky from down the street,” I said. She was a friend of Margaret’s.

“She’s just a bitch, not a witch.”

“So then are there any.”

“Oh lots,” she said, “but my point was that it’s not exactly a big category, and you’re the only idiot to have done the whole ‘over seven kids with magic blood’ thing.”

“Nobody else?”

“Who wants seven kids?” she asked, “especially when it means they are going to try to murder you.”

“You’re acting like you didn’t.”

“I kinda have to if I’m next up to bat, don’t I? It doesn’t mean that I’m a dick or something.”

“Murder makes you a dick.”

“I don-“

“It’s a pretty dick move,” I said, “I don’t care which order you were popped out in, it’s still rude to try to kill someone.”

“Order is crucial when it comes to magic numbers,” she said, “it helps determine how strong you are.”

“Oh does it?” I asked, “how do you know all of this anyways?”

“Mom.”

“Your mom just knew a ton of witchcraft?”

“I mean, who do you think went after the magic blood that was left in a sperm bank,” she said, “pretty sure every witch in the country wanted a chance at magic like that without needing to seduce you.”

“So I just got a bunch of witches to make more witches?” I asked.

“And Warlocks, they are a thing,” most of the ones I know are sisters, though.”

“You know others?” 

“Who do you think texted me when you were in the shelter?” she asked, “that was number 10, Mary.”

“So do you know all of them?” I asked.

“Like, I have a bunch of them on Facebook, but I don’t know nine. I know that 11 and 12 are twins and that 14 is-“

“Is?” I asked.

“You don’t wanna know what a second, seventh son can do?”

“Does he need to kill me twice?” I asked.

“Eh, I mean he could,” she said. Just as she was about to continue Margaret came into the room holding Leaky Cauldron. He was still purring, the little thing must have had a Corvette engine inside of him. 

“I have an idea,” Margaret said as she let the cat down, “we can start unlocking you by getting you to have a blood bond with someone.”

“Blood Bond?” I asked.

“Destiny shit she did to me,” Jasmine sad, “are you just going to bond him to you?”

“Nah, that’s Carter from ‘Not Prom’ dance in twelfth grade. He swore fealty, didn’t think I would get him to do it.”

“How is ‘Not Prom?’ I’m having mine in like three weeks,” Jasmine said.

“Keep the witch powers to a minimum,” Margaret said, “how old are you anyway.”

“Fifteen,” she said.

“Fifteen!” I said, “shouldn’t you go home to you mom or something?”

“She’s cool with me being here,” she said. Jasmine held up her phone to me, and I read the messages on it.

*Jasmine: Shit, totally got bonded to Dad. Oops*

*Mom: Good luck :(*

I shrugged, that was good enough for me. I thought about the plan for a second. “Who are you going to bind me to I asked?”

“Cauldron,” she said.

“The cat?” I asked.

“Nobody will suspect it, and old age doesn’t count so-“

“I am going to be bonded to the cat?” I asked, “how can I even do that? Do I need to tell him that I love him?”

“He’s adorable, I’m sure you’ll come around to it,” she said, “worst comes to worst someone figures it out, and you die.”

“What if Jasmine tells someone to take the cat?” I asked.

“Why would I?” she said, “if it dies then you die, and I die.”

“So this cat is already worth two human lives?” I asked.

“It was already worth more to me that Jasmine,” Margaret said.

“Margaret!” 

“Nono, it’s fine, I get it,” Jasmine said, “he’s a friendly cat.”

“So should we get you bonded to a small animal sweetie?” Margaret asked as she took out a piece of chalk and started to draw a pentagram on the hardwood. I hated when she did that.",Writteninsanity

[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"“Is this safe?” I asked as Margaret shoved me into the middle of the chalk circle. She was being very careful to avoid getting herself into the pentagram with me. It always seemed like she was telling me that things were safe right before she needed to cast a healing spell. It was one of the parts that I loved about her. The healing spells, not the occasional maiming. The blood that I’d lost from her saying ‘Oops’ was pretty shocking.

“Um, yeah sure,” she said as she took another step back, “rituals are made to save energy, this means I won’t kill all of my power by locking you to Cauldron.”

“You just explained why it was easy for you, not why it was safe.”

“Well, it’s going to hurt again,” she said, “I don’t wanna put LC on the receiving end, he’s a sweet little cat.”

“Why didn’t you do that to her?” I asked. I pointed at Jasmine.

“Stay in the circle.”

“Doesn’t answer my question.”

“I didn’t think about it at the time,” she said, “and I already was dangling her from vines, so I figured making her scream would just make things weird.”

I crossed my arms in response; she wasn’t wrong, but I wasn’t happy about it. It was shit like this that made me think of double negatives. Margaret was already using Jasmine to help her with the circles, which was fine, she knew more than I did. That being said it was a little annoying to think that the girl who was trying to kill me earlier today was going to bind me to a cat. “Is this a soul thing?” I asked.

“Souls?” Jasmine asked, “he still thinks that people have souls?”

“I didn’t need to take that away from him,” Margaret responded.

“Yes you did, did you tell him about Santa? Or do I need to do that too?”

“People don’t have souls?” I asked.

“Why would they, that’s fantasy.”

“So is magic.”

“Magic is like, urban fantasy,” Margaret said, “now try not to sound like too much of a pansy when I bind you.”

“What the hell is urban fanta-“ I stopped talking as the scream was soundless this time. Whatever she did felt like I was being stabbed in the face with a spatula. I knew that the feeling didn’t make any sense, but not a lot of magic did. 

“It’s a thing,” Jasmine said.

I could feel the power flowing through, magic from the will to defend a cat. “Wow,” I said as I went to leave the circle.

“The hell are you doing?” Margaret asked. I stopped mid-step and looked at her.

“Well, I just got my power right? I feel great.”

“What are you talking about?” she said, “I just closed the circle so you would die if you left.”

“Why would you do that?” I asked.

“It's step one.”

“What if I trip?”

“On what?” she asked, “the chalk?”

“My nerves,” I felt very off balance as soon as I knew that falling would kill me. It was like standing on top of a building and suddenly realizing that your legs kind of sucked. Margaret scoffed at me and walked across to our bookshelf. The books on it were half harlequin romance and half spellbooks. We called them decorative when friends came over.

“Whatever, just let me look this one up. I forget how to do the ritual.”

“I can do it,” Jasmine said.

“No,” I answered.

“Sure,” Margaret said right after me.

“What? No.”

“Why?” Jasmine asked.

“You were trying to kill me an hour ago.”

“We had a glass of water.”

“I had a drink of water,” I pointed out, “you sat on the couch texting someone.”

“My mother.”

“You sent one text to her.”

“I’m a slow typer,” she said, “and honestly I’m not going to try to kill you or something, I am very invested in you staying alive.”

“And the cat in like three minutes,” Margaret said.

“And the cat,” Jasmine said before grabbing the book from Margaret. Jasmine pulled her over-thick glasses further up her nose and started to read. I looked at Margaret, and she shrugged. The witch had the same brown hair that Jasmine had, if I didn’t know better, I would have said that she was her mother.

“So what happens if I die? Does the cat die?”

“Are you kidding?”  Margaret said, “do you know what I would do if I lost this cat?”

“About the same thing, you would do if you lost your husband?” I asked.

“The cat is new and novel,” she said, “like our honey moon.”

“So you love the cat more than me?” I asked.

“You’re not going to win against a cat in this one,” Jasmine said with her nose in the tome, “Leaky makes a lot of friends.”

“Are we calling him Leaky or Cauldron?” I asked.

“Leaky is shorter and easier to type out,” Jasmine said, “so I’m going to say you should stick with that one.”

“Why does typing matter?” I asked.

“Well, you’re going to be taking a lot of photos during these first few months, and hashtagging on Instagram gets annoying with long names.”

“Fuck I forgot my phone, and he’s going to be adorable,” Margaret said as she ran over to her room. For the second time in the day, I was left in the room with Jasmine. I was a little less comfortable knowing that I was locked in a pentagram. 

“Don’t worry about the spell that’s going to come,” Jasmine said as she closed the book, “I know it’s going to suck, but it isn’t going to kill you. I’ll make sure of that.” Jasmine tossed the book to the other side of the room and smiled at me, “this is my first time casting this, so go easy on me.”

“Easy?” I asked. She cut me off my putting her fingers to the pentagram, and the pain started in my left arm.

[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"The pet store that we went to first was severely lame. The kind of place that parents brought their kids to when they were just trying to get the pet part over with. We moved on to the shelter, trying to find a black cat. 

""I don't know if we have one,"" the young girl behind the counter said as she looked over our form, ""Black cats are like super popular these days.""

The girl couldn't have been over seventeen and was dressed like she drank out of a mason jar. The plaid was really out of season in the middle of the summer. ""You can take a look either way,"" she said, so we did.

Margaret and I ended up standing over a small cat. If we brought it home, it was going to start living in Margaret's purse whether we wanted it to or not. It was a black cat that looked like it had tackled a can of spray paint during its time as a kitten. Everything was lush black fur except for the left side of it's face, which was splattered with white. The cat-like Margaret.

""I don't know,"" she said as it tried to rub against her again. She was keeping it at foot length. ""It's not quite black enough.""

""God, what are you, Tumblr?"" I asked as she kept holding the cat just off of her leg, "" I don't think the cat has white privilege.""

""It's about the image an-""

""Even if it did I could check it every morning,"" I said, ""and I would make sure he knows that the right half of his face was scum.""

""Are you going to keep going on?""

""I bet he likes girl cats too, bending to society's pressures.""

""You know, I need to keep you off those websites, they make you weird.""

""I can't believe I might have children on Tumblr,"" I said, ""we don't need to worry about those though, you being new mom might hurt their feelings.""

""Are you done?"" she asked.

""Almost.""

The door back to the lobby opened, and Mumford's daughter came in to check on us. ""Oh yeah,"" she said, ""I forgot about Leaky.""

""Leaky?"" I asked.

""Leaky Cauldron, like Harry potter. He's black with stuff spilling over and-""

Margaret suddenly stopped caring at all about keeping Leaky Cauldron away from her. As soon as the cat had a witch-related name she needed to have it. She was going to love it.

The girl pulled us to the front of the shelter and started getting us to sign forms. Margaret did them left handed as she needed to carry LC in her right. The cat kept purring, and Margaret showed a care for life she usually reserved for me. She didn't swerve for frogs on rainy days.

""And here,"" the girl said as she pointed at the signature line. All of this had been very convenient, ""just first and last name please.""

""All right,"" I said, and I signed my name. The hipster girl looked at it and then at me, and then back to it. Her phone buzzed, and she sighed, ""Sorry Leaky, I need to kill your new dad.""

My apparent daughter pulled back her hand for a punch. Margaret managed to step forward and catch it with her left hand. She was still carrying the cat with her right. She held LC out to me and said, ""Hey babe can you take this? I have a person to kill.""

""Sure honey,"" I said. How else do you respond to something like that?""

""Who the fuck are you?"" my daughter asked.

""Margaret Merlin,"" she said, ""cat owner and your step-mother.""",Writteninsanity
[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.,actually_crazy_irl,"I'd seen a lot of spells, hexes and curses during my time with Margaret. She used them in everyday life. There were spells for everything from dishes to making my boss think I'm sick for work. That being said, at no point in my life had I seen her light her hands on fire when holding another person's hand. In fact, I'd never seen her light any part of her body on fire, she was very responsible with matches.

""This doesn't involve you witch,"" Mumford's daughter said as her hand went alight. It didn't seem like either of them was going to back down. They were busily shooting daggers at each other from their eyes. That was a metaphor, but they could probably actually do that if they wanted to.

""Demon worshipper?"" Margaret asked as the fire crackled between them. LC was more fine with this than I was.

""I was gonna ask the same thing.""

""Breaker,"" Margaret said. Just as she did, she brought up her second hand and caught my daughter along the jaw. It wasn't a magic punch, but it looked like it hurt. My daughter stumbled back and shook her head. ""You have no idea what you're doing,"" Margaret said, ""break the blood bond and I might consider letting you live.""

""Not gonna happen,"" she said, ""I was a sister away from living for this. Now it's my turn."" The girl growled at Margaret and fire licked her fingers again. I took a step back, and LC just stared at the lovely flames. He was a cute cat but he obviously thought that he was fireproof.

""Suit yourself,"" Margaret said as she lit her hands alight. The fire looked good on her, it suited her 'angry mode'. 

The girl launched forward first, and Margaret let her jump over the counter at her. The adoption papers for LC got singed as the hipster tried to attack my wife. Before she could quite get to her, Margaret snapped her fingers and vines reached out of the table. Like the fan service part of an anime, they grabbed the hipster by the ankles and dangled her upside down. The skinny jeans she was wearing ruined the image.

""Dammit,"" she said as she hung there. The vines raised her higher and Margaret stood under her.

""Are you done?"" she asked.

""You're a badass sweetie,"" I said.

""I know, give me the cat."" I had complied before I got dangled from vines as well. I was surprised that she had never done that to be before. ""You're sure?"" Margaret asked as she watched the girl struggle against the vines. The hipster's hands were on fire, but the vines were keeping away from those hot trends.

""Fuck off,"" she said.

""All right,"" Margaret said. She tapped me on the chest and said, ""this is going to sting a little.""

""Wha-Aaah Aho god-"" was about what I said in response.

Margaret pulled her hand away from me and left a burn mark in it's wake. She held her hand up to the hipster girl and said ""Defense bond.""

""No.""

""Whomp whomp,"" she said before snapping her finger. Light jumped from Margaret's hand to the hipster's glasses. She stopped fighting against the vines and looked down at me.

""God dammit, that was fast,"" she said.

""What did you do Margaret?"" I asked.

""I made her new life goal to defend you or die,"" she said.

""That's so cruel!""

""She was trying to kill you.""

""Good point, fuck you lady.""

""My name is Jasmine,"" she said.

""Is that actually your name?"" Margaret asked.

""Yep.""

""I thought you'd be Starshine Flutterby,"" Margaret laughed.

""I'm a hipster, not a fucking pony."" 

""Fair enough,"" Margaret said, ""now we need to prepare for number eight. Hopefully, they are all pushovers like this.""

""Hey, I'm still up here.""

""Exactly,"" I said, ""pushover.""

""You didn't do anything except hold the cat,"" Margaret argued, ""you don't get to trash talk.""

""If you figure out getting me powers I can, though?""

""Still no,"" Jasmine said from above us.

""Was he asking you?""

""I have no idea.""

We let Jasmine down and had a very awkward walk back to the house. Margaret wouldn't let go of LC for the entire walk, and kept trying to put her while holding on. It only kind of worked, the cat was more afraid of cars than it was of fire.

Jasmine was going to be our ally, the person that we could count on to be on our side. Despite what I thought was logic, removing her from the competition counted as her dying magic-wise. That meant that number 9 was now coming after us. Not only that, but Margaret didn't have enough energy to keep doing destiny bonds, and each person could only have one defender. Jasmine was on our side, and that was it. 

She wasn't the strongest witch by any counts, Margaret had only spared her because she felt bad, and they shared a love of cats.",Writteninsanity

""Seventh?"" I asked. She nodded, and her tangled hair fell over her eyes. Margaret was an interesting character. She hung out around the bar and fancied herself a witch.

""Yeah,"" she said, ""had a vision last night, sucks don't it?""

""Well you aren't wrong there,"" I said, if I had children I'd be freaking out.""

She looked from her glass and then to me, ""you don't?""

""No, never found the lady.""

""Well if you do, just make sure you don't have seven.""

""Will do Margaret.""

Three years later Margaret and I were married. Despite her unusual views on pagan gods, she was wonderful and the love of my life. The more interesting part of her, though, was the fact that she was literally a witch. I couldn't deny it once I saw the cauldron that could let her see anyone in the city at any time. 

Three years and seven days later Margaret and I were sitting in planned parenthood. We didn't want to birth deadly children, but I'd fucked up. The visit was more about caution than coathangers, but it was still a visit. Which meant that I still saw Lisa.

Lisa was a blonde woman that I hadn't met before this day. She walked up and swore that she knew me from somewhere. We had talked for a while before I put my glasses on and it clicked for her. I had been her sperm donor for her artificial insemination. I looked at her with wide eyes and then to Margaret.

""How could you forget that you were a sperm donor?"" she asked as we walked back from planned parenthood. We were eating ice cream, I was a vanilla person, and she liked black licorice for its name.

""It wasn't a big deal at the time,"" I said, ""I did the shit for the twenty bucks and the cute girl at the counter.""

""You flirted with someone by whacking it in the room beside them?"" she asked. I still considered it flawless logic. She shook her head, ""we are going to the clinic and getting a list of your children."" 

""I think that's against some privacy laws.""

""Being a witch should get me burned and you still love me,"" she said. Margaret too a lick of her ice cream and then bit into it. ""Don't be a pansy about it, illegal is nothing.""

""All right,"" I said, and we went to the clinic.

Three spells later we had somehow managed to get all of the released information about my children. Most of them were names and some birth addresses, but we were told it was incomplete information. We didn't have days. 

""You have 42 children?"" Margaret asked as she looked over the paper.

""Are you impressed?"" I asked.

""Terrified,"" she answered, ""and you're a fucking idiot. Do we know who number seven is?""

""No birthdates, but they shouldn't be older than fifteen now anyway.""

""Fifteen is the perfect age for father killing!"" she said a little too loud in the middle of the street, ""your magic blood will be potent in them by then! Who know's what they will do?"" for the first time in my life I saw Margaret's eyes waver.

""FATHER!"" a scream came from the other side of the street, ""I hope you are prepared! I am your first seventh child!"" I looked toward the voice and saw a little waif of a brunette carrying a sword, ""prepare for your reckoning!"" she screamed, and her sword went ablaze. Fuck.

""We weren't done talking about this,"" Margaret said as she raised a hand. Within a second the girl tripped and fell. She ended up beside her sword and caught on fire. I watched in horror as she burned.

""Do what you want father!"" she screamed while also screaming, ""when I die the eighth shall be seventh! One of us will drink your blood!"" she yelled before she stopped screaming. Death calmed her down.

""Oh god dammit,"" Margaret said beside me, ""I only have so many luck curses, and I don't think all of them are going to be stupid enough to have a flaming sword.""

""What are we going to do?"" I asked.

""I have no idea,"" she said, ""but it's probably going to take years.""

He was keeping his head low to the ground and making sure that he didn't look the spellcaster in the eye, it was a smart move. 

""Did I tell you to call me Mam?"" the spellcaster asked as she plucked away on her guitar, it was the start to a song that nobody had heard, and she'd only heard it in her head.

""No Miss Swift"" he said, ""but the army was asking if you were ready to drop something new. There are rumors that you're switching styles and it's scaring the men.""

""And if I did?"" she asked. The notes she was playing grew faster as she flew her fingers along the neck of the guitar. The magic in the room danced, acting more like electricity than the calm waves she usually played out.

""Well, we would just need to know before anything happened. The last thing we want is an attack where our-""

""Do you think that someone would attack us?"" the spellcaster asked. The man swallowed his adam's apple. 

""There are rumours of large groups coming out of the East. The speak old Korean, but they use their numbers to create powerful spells.""

""Does that sound like my problem?"" Taylor asked. She was playing with something in her head that would change the way that the country world fought. Luke had already been bringing the hard-hitting offense of rock to their forces.

""If we're going to go on campaign it's going to be,"" the man said, ""we need you on our side or it's going to be a disaster.""

""You're right,"" she started, ""you do need me."" Taylor accentuated the need part of the sentence. He could hear the power dripping from the word. Magic was licking at her lips without her needing the sing.

""Miss Taylor,"" he said, ""can we at least count on you to show up if something goes on, I know it's a creative process but we do need a concert.""

""Sure sure,"" she said. Taylor kept playing her new song, and the man kept wondering what it was.

The Pop forces from Asia attacked the next morning. For the first three hours it was a slaughter. Despite the power that had been built up in the core of Country in the Americas they couldn't fight against the sheer power that was coming out of the main groups.

First the slow country forces needed to drop their barriers, abandoning their troops to the electric magic of Pop. Fast lyrics with words nobody could speak tore through the forces. Battle after battle changed from a conflict to a rout. Like the old days of Admiral Yi, the K-Pop forces ripped through defensive line after defensive line.

Though it all Taylor was sitting in her room, still playing the same song that she'd been working on the day before. Her eyes were wide but shut. They were gazing into something that the rest of the world couldn't see. Retainers were sent in to rouse her, but it wasn't until the case drum of K-Pop shook the foundation of her tower that she finally stood.

Taylor walked wordlessly, it was bold of the Koreans to attack like this. Everyone knew that Taylor was the songstress that crushed all others. She acted surprised when people said that about her, but she wore a smirk that betrayed her confidence. She didn't just think she was strong enough, she knew that she was strong enough.

She walked out of the door to her tower and was staring down a massive force. Where she had expected twenty players working in unison she saw hundreds. They stared her down and the resounding K-pop died. Silence fell for the first time in the invasion. A simple song like that wouldn't be any use against a songstress like Taylor, she was passively stronger than it. 

Taylor pulled her guitar off of her back and put it on her knee. The opposing army waited for the smooth pounding of country to begin, and they were ready for it. Taylor had other plans.

The song that she'd been playing in her head started to escape through her flying fingers. It wasn't passive of calm, it was aggressive and quick. It was something that people hadn't seen from the Singer of the South; They were ready for her waves, not lightning. They were Shaken Off before noon even cracked the sky.",Writteninsanity
